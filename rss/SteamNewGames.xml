  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <strong>
   The Executive
  </strong>
  is a sandbox business simulation game that lets you rewrite the history of Hollywood from the 1970s to today. As the founder of a scrappy production company, you’ll produce the movies you’ve always dreamed of, manage ambitious franchises, and build a studio that rivals the industry’s greatest. Navigate the challenges of the movie business, outmaneuver your competition, and decide whether to chase critical acclaim or box office domination.

  <strong>
   PRODUCE YOUR DREAM MOVIES
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Bring your cinematic visions to life. Choose themes, genres, and target ratings to shape your creations. Dive deep into screenplay development, cast the hottest stars (or discover hidden talent), and allocate your budget wisely to make each film shine. Every decision impacts your movie’s critical acclaim and box office potential, so craft your masterpieces with care.

  <strong>
   BUILD AND MANAGE FRANCHISES
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Turn your biggest hits into long-lasting franchises! Create sequels, prequels, reboots, and even spinoffs to capitalize on audience demand. But beware: too many installments can lead to franchise fatigue. Strike the perfect balance to keep your fans invested without burning them out.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   MASTER THE ART OF DISTRIBUTION
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your movie’s journey doesn’t end at the final cut. Decide how to distribute your creation: self-publish, partner with a distributor. Each route comes with unique risks and rewards. Timing is everything—analyze the market, outmaneuver the competition, and secure the perfect release date for your blockbuster.

  <strong>
   MONETIZE YOUR BACK CATALOG
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Don’t let your past successes collect dust. Manage your studio’s library and maximize ancillary revenue with strategic home entertainment deals. Partner with distributors who are the best fit for your catalog, and invest in add-ons to boost sales. Your back catalog is a goldmine—make it work for you.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <br/>
 The Arctic has always been a mysterious place. Running a motel in the Arctic is also a rare experience. Through the Arctic Motel Simulator, we not only want to simulate the climate and changeable weather of the Arctic, but also want to bring an Arctic-style motel management experience. This is reflected in the following aspects:
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Section1_English.png"/>
 <br/>
 The Arctic is a vast and sparsely populated place. In the game, you will be able to expand the territory of the motel in the primeval forest.
 <br/>
 <br>
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/CutTree.gif"/>
  <br>
   <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Section2_English.png"/>
   <br>
    It is not easy to find a motel in the Arctic. Motels there often provide many different types of services. In addition to providing various types of rooms for rent, shops selling Arctic specialties and restaurants offering Arctic cuisine can also earn you a lot of money. There are more, including laundries and other businesses waiting for you to discover.
    <br>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/ExpandBusiness1.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Section3_English.png"/>
     <br/>
     We have prepared eight room types for players to discover. Different room types have their own advantages, and players can choose freely according to their preferences.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Igloo.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Section4_English.png"/>
     <br/>
     Everyone knows that the winter in the Arctic is very cold, but the Arctic still has its own unique four seasons. We simulate the weather and temperature of the four seasons in the Arctic, as well as their corresponding gameplay, such as: controlling room humidity in summer and managing room temperature in winter, RVs that can be rented in spring, summer and autumn, and Arctic igloos in winter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Seasons.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Section5_English.png"/>
     <br/>
     There are many wild animals in the Arctic, so legal hunting is allowed in many places. In the game, players can hunt legally in the winter hunting season. There are also several types of guns available in the game, and players can choose their favorite guns for hunting. Winter Arctic specialty recipes are also one of the purposes of hunting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/PistolNoUI.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Section6_English.png"/>
     <br/>
     Expanding a business can never rely on just one person. In the game, players can hire employees and special agents to expand the business of the motel. Players can train employees and arrange their work according to different focuses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Employee.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3098470/extras/Section7_English.png"/>
     <br/>
     The game is full of various random events, such as traveler partners investigating cheating, police patrolling your motel, health inspections, stranger events, etc. And due to insufficient police presence in the Arctic, the police also need your help in arresting wanted criminals.
     <br/>

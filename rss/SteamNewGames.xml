   Key Changes & Additions - Endzone - A World Apart Veterans, please read!
  </i>
 </strong>
 🙂
 <br/>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <strong>
    Zones:
   </strong>
   In Endzone - A World Apart, you played on one vast map where you could build a global settlement. But in Endzone 2, the world expands as you uncover different zones, each offering exclusive resources to plunder. Manage multiple settlements and unlock a vast amount of possibilities.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    New Settler Behaviour:
   </strong>
   We've tackled and refactored settler paths and job distribution issues from the ground up. Embrace the new and improved system, now more comprehensible and balanced, supporting thriving settlements with thousands of inhabitants.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Vehicles:
   </strong>
   Your wish for vehicles back in Endzone - A World Apart has been heard! Now, you can freely choose your starting location by moving your settlement bus. As the game progresses, you'll have the opportunity to construct additional vehicles, perfect for establishing trade routes or venturing into the treacherous wastelands.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Expedition System Overhaul:
   </strong>
   Exciting changes! The updated expeditions system introduces detailed ruins waiting to be explored by directly controlling and guiding your explorers. They consist of less text and more action! Uncover clues, unlock secrets, and discover valuable loot on your journeys.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    New Graphics:
   </strong>
   Our rendering system has undergone a complete overhaul, bringing you a more detailed and visually stunning environment. The animations have received a makeover too, resulting in breathtaking graphics that will immerse you like never before.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>

  Survivors,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The time has come to surpass the confining limits of these lands. Our brightest minds have constructed machinery that allows us to break free and venture beyond our borders!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let there be no doubt – even after centuries, Mother Nature's anger remains unbroken. She is the same untamed beast she was when our ancestors stepped out of the Endzone. Our way will be filled with obstacles, misery, and death. Yet, we are pioneers, born with an unwavering curiosity to expand, rebuild, and thrive. Together, we will rekindle humanity.
  <br/>

 You received new toys from your family. Isn't that lovely? Oh, it's for sure...
 <br/>
 Your old toys, though, aren't getting along as well. They are no longer cared for and have been forgotten. So what follows next? They're going to join together against you and assault your brand-new toys, so be prepared. But never worry! You're in luck since your brand-new toys are troops of green soldiers. They still require your aid though! Control, strengthen, and defeat the opposing forces! However, focus with care, the enemies you encounter might not be your old playthings!

     <br/>
     Tower building alone won't be sufficient to repel incoming attackers. Build up your own troops in the best feasible positions, then unleash attacks into enemy territory. Never abandon your towers, and deploy your troops in accordance with the traits of the enemy. First, the attacking forces will attempt to get past your defenses. Build and improve towers to aid your army. By using unique abilities, you can support your troops and towers as well.

     For you to continue this journey, you must defeat outdated toys that are scattered throughout your house, starting in your room. Keep in mind that different enemy troops appear at different locations! To better repel the attackers, build towers according with the enemy traits. Due to the distinctive designs, certain locations could have different battlefields. You might stumble to a number of circumstances during your battle with the enemy that could have an impact on you.

     </h2>
     Galaxy Burger was inspired by games like "Good Pizza, Great Pizza", "Papa's Games", "Overcooked", "Plate Up" and more. We, a team of enthusiasts, love space and delicious food. Do you?

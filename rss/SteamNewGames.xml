  About This Game

 <br/>
 <br/>
 Be the manager of a motel alongside a shop and a gas station. Build, renovate, expand and grow your business to attract more customers. Clean, design and furnish your rooms. Choose styles, color schemes, equipments and decorations to create a unique atmosphere and get the maximum revenue possible. Keep your shop shelves full of products that travellers might need.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2594540/extras/MMS_Renovate.gif"/>
 <br>
  Design your rooms (floor, walls and roof) and furnish them, keep them clean to satisfy your customers. You will have a lot of choices so bring your creative ideas to life.
  <br>
   <br>
    <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2594540/extras/MMS_Shop.gif"/>
    <br>
     Provide every product you can. Order, stock in warehouse and keep track of the prices to make profit. Design your shop as you wish and keep it clean, otherwise customers will leave immediately. Place different shelves and fridges inside your shop and keep them full.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2594540/extras/MMS_Serve.gif"/>
     <br/>
     High popularity means more customers and high rating means happy to pay customers. Make sure you serve them in time and provide every thing they need. Customers are always right.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2594540/extras/MMS_Employees.gif"/>
     <br/>
     At some point you will not be able to run everything by yourself. Cash register, fuel pump, cleaning, motel check in/out and shelf filling are a lot of work. But don't worry, you can build a staff room and hire people to help you with all of it. But you will have to do the management and be the boss.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2594540/extras/MMS_Management.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Order shipments of products/equipment and every thing you need run your motel. Set prices for shop products and room renting. Give your employees assignments and make sure you're paying them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2594540/extras/MMS_Expand.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Expand your business to serve more customers and make more profit, three fuel pumps are better than just one as long as there are customers to serve, so make sure to invest in the right place.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2594540/extras/MMS_Addons.gif"/>
     <br/>
     you can add a lot of ideas to your motel, such as payphones and vending machines to make more money. Or build a bus station to attract more customers. You can even place ads in your motel area to generate more cash (if you have the required popularity).

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 [Game Overview]
 <br/>
 Play as Snezhinka, a fixed-term contract employee at a private military company, and hold the line against waves of hostile mechs in a 2.5D dystopian world. In order to survive against increasingly powerful enemies, you’ll need to use what remains of your meager salary after taxes and other expenses are deducted to purchase cards and develop your combat capabilities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This fast-paced shooting game can be enjoyed with a controller or a mouse and keyboard. The controls are simple: you’ll only need to move, aim, shoot, and use gadgets.
 <br/>
 <br>
  In addition to a robust story mode, this game also features two challenge modes—complete with online rankings—and a collection in which you can rewatch cutscenes and peruse information on the game’s characters and weapons.
  <br>
   <br>
    [Story]
    <br>
     Snezhinka’s older sister is a member of the elite Molten Iron Squadron. One day, Snezhinka abruptly loses contact with her sister, prompting her to join the private military company Blue Peacock Co. and head for the front lines of the war in order to bring her sister home.

   Welcome to the Debtors' Club. It's up to you - and your team of debt collectors - to make the businesses of the city pay what they owe to the public treasury. Governance doesn't come cheap, you know, and it's up to you to make everyone pay up - whatever it takes.
   <br>
    <br>
     Persuade and intimidate debtors, ruthlessly interrogate their financial records, and if need be, send a couple of Paci-Fists to explain impolitely that tax dodging is frowned upon in polite society. The law, after all, is on your side - that is, as long as you can meet the daily collection quota. There's quite the backlog to work through - and precious little time.

 Once they hear about Labi's missing friend, Natsu and Happy decide to head for the deepest depths themselves.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 No longer threatened by the mafia organization Almata, the people of Calvard have returned to their peaceful lives. But one day, a shocking series of murders involving a mysterious crimson beast sets the wheels of fate in motion once again. Various factions spring into action – both those who abide by the law to uncover the truth and those looking to capitalize on any new developments wherever possible, no matter how sinister.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668430/extras/van_1_s.png"/>
 <br/>
 With chaos once again looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor, prompting his own investigation. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? The sands of time bring old and new faces together for this thrilling second installment in the Trails through Daybreak saga.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  STORY
 </h2>
 Year 1209 of the Septian Calendar.
 <br/>
 <br>
  The threat posed by Almata has passed. Peace has finally returned to Calvard. And, for a time, that peace goes uninterrupted—until a CID special forces unit is slaughtered by an unknown assailant.
  <br>
   <br>
    With authorities working to contain the situation, criminal forces take the chance to make their own moves.
    <br>
     <br/>
     Meanwhile, a spriggan by the name of Van Arkride begins his own investigation—after prompting from an unexpected visitor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Who could be responsible for this massacre? What was their objective? And how does it all relate to Agnès' search for the eighth Genesis?
     <br/>

     <br/>
     A crimson beast's roar. A chance meeting with a boy and girl, both embroiled in a mysterious search. These are the circumstances that lure Arkride Solutions down the trail of an inescapable fate.

      SYSTEM
     </h2>
     <strong>
      Battle System
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The game builds on the seamless transition between field battles and command battles introduced in the previous game with new mechanics that can be used in both: Cross Charge & EX Chains! Mastering the use of these two combo mechanics can provide you with overwhelming firepower to use against your opponents.
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668430/extras/Exchain_02_s.png"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Cross Charge
      </li>
     </ul>
     If you manage to Perfect Dodge an enemy's attack during a field battle, the Cross Charge icon will appear! Pushing the correct button while the icon is on-screen will swap in another party member, who will simultaneously execute a charge attack on your foe! As a bonus, the party member that you swap in will have enhanced attack power for a period of time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       EX Chains
      </li>
     </ul>
     EX Chains can be activated by fulfilling specific conditions during command battles. Once these conditions have been met, using a craft or normal attack against a stunned enemy will automatically activate an EX Chain! This allows party members with SCLM activated to launch a simultaneous attack that will also impact nearby enemies, dealing massive damage.

     <br/>
     Van and his collaborators will not always travel together during the events of Trails through Daybreak II. At times, some of the group may split off in order to take care of tasks in different areas of Calvard concurrently. Because of this, each act contains multiple chapters you can play in any order. Progress the story in the order you choose! Each chapter features a different cast of characters as we see their side of the act's story play out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Once you've completed your chosen chapter, the next one will start up automatically.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Unique Missions
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Certain chapters will feature missions that utilize the unique skillsets of the characters in that chapter's party. For example, directly controlling the holo core AI, Mare, to hack the orbal network, or using Swin to silently tail a suspicious individual.
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      CHARACTERS
     </h2>
     <strong>
      Van Arkride
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The man at the head of Arkride Solutions. A lover of sweets, saunas, and orbal cars. Due to his job as a spriggan, Van has a tendency to take on legally-questionable jobs. However, the fact that he occasionally walks on the edge of the law does not preclude him from doing good by others—as is evidenced by his numerous personal contacts. While tracking down the Oct-Geneses at Agnès' request, Van developed the ability to transform into an armored form known as the Grendel with the help of Mare, the holo core installed within his combat orbment. It was with this new ability that he was able to fend off the mafia group known as Almata. Having once terrorized the entirety of the Republic, Almata was eventually brought to its knees by the Arkride Solutions team during the fight for the Oct-Geneses. Upon the quelling of this threat, however, they decided to temporarily go their separate ways. Now left to himself in a less-than- lively office, Van is free to return to his lone-wolf lifestyle once more.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Agnès Claudel
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A first-year at the prestigious Aramis Academy who currently serves on its Student Council. Despite her polite manner of speaking and at times meek demeanor, Agnès has shown great strength and determination while employed at Arkride Solutions—especially when facing off against the seedy underbelly of society. Agnès first met Van while searching for eight prototype orbments known as the Oct-Geneses, which she inherited from her great-grandfather. As thanks for taking on her request, she began working as one of Arkride Solution's part-time assistants. At present, Agnès has recovered seven of the eight Geneses. Unfortunately, while continuing her search for the last remaining Genesis, she's had no choice but to also divide her time between preparing for the Aramis Academy Festival and periodically helping out around Arkride Solutions. Regarding her relationship with Van, she both respects and admires him as her employer. However, she seems to be harboring some more amorous feelings for him as well...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Elaine Auclair
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2668430/extras/elaine_1_s.png"/>
     <br/>
     An A-rank bracer affiliated with the Calvard branch of the Bracer Guild. She is occasionally referred to by the moniker 'Beauty's Blade.' Due to her dignified beauty and masterful skill with a sword, Elaine tends to catch the eye of the media more often than not. Unfortunately, this also leads to talent agencies offering her contracts for modeling and acting—she always declines. Outside of being the poster girl for the Bracer Guild, Elaine has no present interest in joining the world of entertainment. During her high school years, she enjoyed a brief and fleeting romance with Van before he suddenly vanished without so much as a word. It was only recently, after seven years, that the two were able to reunite. Although their lingering feelings for each other have left their current relationship a bit tense, their time fighting Almata together was able to strengthen their bond once more. Some time after the events involving Almata and the Oct-Geneses, Elaine received word that the Central Intelligence Department's elite Gamma Squad had been brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, and that a 'crimson' monster was spotted at the scene of the crime...
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      WORLD
     </h2>
     <strong>
      The Republic of Calvard
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A large country located in the central region of the Zemurian continent. Its current leader is President Roy Gramheart. Due to the unfortunate circumstances created by the desertification of eastern Zemuria, Calvard has a substantial history of receiving both immigrants and refugees. The resulting mixture of cultures and ethnicities has made the country into something of a melting pot. One hundred years ago, Calvard was under the heel of its monarchal rulers. It was only after Sheena Dirke and her compatriots brought about a democratic revolution that the nation was transformed into a democratic republic. Though in constant conflict with Erebonia over the control of bordering regions, Calvard has recently been on the receiving end of reparations from the empire following the Battle of Jormungandr. These reparations enabled Calvard to enter a period of rapid growth and development, leading to its eventual overtake of Erebonia as the most powerful nation on the continent. Regarding the region's recreational interests, recent technological advancements in orbal vehicles and filmmaking have caused a boom in both the motorsports and orbal cinema industries.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Messeldam
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A moderate-sized city located in the north of Calvard. Due to its long-standing role as one of the Northern Sea’s major trading ports, Messeldam was often tasked during the days of monarchal rule with the delivery of imports to the capital of Oración—along with fresh seafood, of course. Although the port remains active to this day, developments in airship technology have greatly diminished its significance. The city itself, however, remains an important gateway to Remiferia and its surrounding nations. Unlike Langport, Messeldam possesses very few tourist destinations. That being said, the townscape's architecture tends to be quite popular with visitors, as its design has seen little change in the past century. The city’s Eastern and Central Eastern populations are fairly meager due to its geographical location. As such, it lacks a community that values cultural traditionalism. This has, fortunately, been a boon for Messeldam, as new art movements and customs are accepted with relative ease. It was this very attitude that led to the city serving as the venue for the Orbal Film Festival for a number of years, until its relocation to Tharbad in 1208.

  THE STORY
 </strong>
 <br>
  <br>
   In the near future, the world is in an energy crisis. When all hope has been lost, world famous scientist Dr. Klaus makes a surprise announcement: the discovery of the "Tetra Cell". Its incredible energy-producing properties could be used for the good of mankind. However, 24 hours later, he mysteriously disappears and his lab is destroyed in an explosion. The industrialist A. Easton, President of Easton Industries is suspected to have kidnapped Dr. Klaus and that he intends to use the Tetra Cell to create a new type of super weapon.
   <br>
    <br>
     You assume the role of Vincent Fury, a special operative on a mission to infiltrate the top secret research facility of Easton Industries, rescue Dr. Klaus and recover the missing Tetra Cell before it’s too late!

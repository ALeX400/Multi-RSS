  <i>
   “Charge set”, my Alpha Team leader said.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <i>
   Not knowing what lay in wait for us behind the door, I commanded, “Burn it” into the radio.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <i>
   “Burning”, he replied. Sliding his finger into the pull ring of the ignition system, he pushed the pin in, turned it a quarter turn, and pulled.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <i>
   The night was no longer silent as the sound of shredding timber filled the night. Windows shattered and pieces of glass fell to the ground. The walls around me shook. Where a door once stood, only smoke remained. Like water bursting forth from a dam, men flowed into the unknown.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <i>
  Hi, I'm Courtney! I'm the solo dev responsible for Reality Break. I've wanted to make a sci-fi ARPG for decades (no joke), and finally got the chance to pour my passion into this game. I hope you like what you see, and if you get a chance to check it out, let me know what you think!
 </i>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/what_is_reality_break.mp4.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Reality Break is a fast-paced ARPG with many interlocking systems and an opt-in roguelite structure, all of which is modifiable via a new Rewrite mechanic that allows you to alter the fundamental nature of the gameplay for unparalleled build customization. Take on the role of a mercenary who unwittingly becomes imbued with the power to alter reality, and finds themselves thrown into a chaotic maelstrom where other sinister and malevolent forces attempt to stop them at every turn in an evolving storyline. But can you really stop those who know what you are going to do before you even know it yourself?
 <br/>
 <br>
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/Combat_new_draft_3.mp4.gif"/>

     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/rewrite_the_universe.mp4.gif"/>
     <br/>
     In Reality Break, almost everything is modifiable with the Rewrite mechanic. Upgrade and change the attributes of your equipment, unlock mythical abilities, and change the course of the future. The possibilities are endless!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/Breaking_Reality.mp4.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Found a powerful item that’s too big to equip on your ship? Alter its existence into something that fits! Feeling pressed for time on a mission with a ticking timer? Double the time you have left! Maybe you wish that a rare item was actually an epic? Upgrade it to an epic item... or better! Think a mission is too easy for you? Alter the difficulty and give yourself a challenge along with better rewards! A multitude of things can be altered, but such power always comes with a cost. Will you successfully balance your current needs against future benefits?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/opt-in_roguelite.mp4.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Resetting your timeline will cause a ripple effect across many elements of the game, often in surprising and subtle ways. Each time you reset, you will gain Reality Points which can be allocated to talents that majorly alter reality itself, applying those changes to both current and future pilots via a metagame talent system.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/Reality_Points.mp4.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unlocking talents always makes a big difference in the gameplay. Some talents include: expert challenges that test your skills in exchange for additional rewards, activation of ultra-powerful Fate Affixes that will sometimes appear on random loot, preservation of a favored item that you would like to bring with you to the next timeline, and even preventing the dropping of low-quality loot completely. With each new timeline, you’ll discover new elements and features to change your experience in Reality Break.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/interconnected_systems_header.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Play through multiple timelines, upgrade your ship, and discover fantastical powers for your pilot. Use the Analysis system in real-time to unlock Discoveries for your items! Come back to the game the next day or the next week to discover just how powerful your loot has gotten. If it's taking too long, Rewrite the Analysis system itself to speed it up!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/interconnected_systems.mp4.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Through the Codex, obtain powerful Set Bonuses by looting specific groups of item types. Then, upgrade the Codex to scale its bonuses based on the rarity of the loot you find, and even Rewrite it so you can activate more than a single Set Bonus at a time! Buy ship upgrades from the Tech Specialist, including slots for brand new types of equipment, such as deadly Drones that grant unique bonuses. Your ship can only fit so many upgrades, so choose wisely... or grow strong enough to Rewrite those limitations out of existence!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/an_evolving_story.mp4.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Altering the fabric of reality itself is no trivial power. It will not go unnoticed. You may get away with it for some time, but as your capabilities increase, so too will the threats you awaken! With each timeline, you unlock new shocking secrets, change the outcome of previous scenarios and reveal new ways of looking at the universe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1473060/extras/Deathray.mp4.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Throughout your journey, you will discover how exactly you obtained the power to change reality, what your purpose with this power is, who really benefits from this power, and how it will affect you in the end. You are, for better or worse, never alone. Forces swirl around you, and the more you use your powers, the more noticed you will be. Can you uncover the truth before reality itself shatters into pieces? Just how far are you willing to go to make reality your own?

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Summary
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Follow Aura's adventure as she is thrust into the fantasy world of Roya. What she initially believed to follow the conventional plotline of a "summoned to another world"-story quickly turns into her worst nightmare. Cursed by the Demon King, Aura must now struggle every night to track down her nemesis and ultimately strike him down.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  But her enemies don't just lurk in Roya. Having entered her mind through the Demon King's curse, another enemy attempts to brainwash and corrupt Aura from the inside. Faced with a two-pronged attack against her body and mind, can Aura finish off her worst enemy without losing herself?
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Gameplay
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Each ingame day is structured into 3 parts.
 </p>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    The player controls Aura and can explore the world of Roya to track down and kill the Demon King. In order to become stronger, acquire funds, and advance her search, she can rely on her own powers or ask people for help. However, not everybody means well with Aura. Performing lewd acts and compromising on Aura's ideals by allowing innocents to suffer causes Aura to gain corruption.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    The player controls Alicia, who uses Aura's corruption to change her psyche. This includes changing her interests, increasing her interest in fashion, changing her appearance (including hair style/color changes), changing her values (making Aura more selfish), and ultimately changing her sexual desire and love interests.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    The player watches cutscenes displaying Aura's real self changing over time due to mental corruption. The cutscenes are told from varying character perspectives (Aura, her best friend Rose, her boyfriend George, and so on).
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Key Features
 </h2>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Strategic Combat with limited resources
    </strong>
    - All resources, including time, money, and items, must be used with care to get the most out of them in Aura's journey!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Semi-Open World
    </strong>
    - Explore the vast world of Roya! Hunt for rare materials to infuse into Aura's armor, slay demons, and help our heroine rise from zero in an unfair world!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Challenging and creative boss fights
    </strong>
    - Battles are set up as puzzles that test your understanding of the combat system. Exploit hidden weaknesses, disable environmental effects, and teach Aura skills that allow her to counter whatever her enemies throw at her. Most encounters may seem impossible at first, but a solution will always reveal itself to those who don't give up thinking!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Balance corruption and progress
    </strong>
    - Give in to temptation to make your life easier, and it might cause the curse to progress to the point where Aura's personality changes towards evil... However, clinging too firmly to your ideals can slow down your progress, and Aura might become a victim of the curse nonetheless. Balance is key!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Collar Removal
    </strong>
    - In exchange for damaging her soul and gaining corruption, Aura can forcefully overcome her curse and temporarily regain her powers as a Hero - Smash any encounter and obstacle to pieces! However, using this power accelerates the curse...
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     5 Difficulty Modes -
    </strong>
    Don't like the time pressure from the ever-advancing curse? Reducing the difficulty to one of the lower difficulties allows you to take it easy or enjoy the story. Or ramp the difficulty up all the way to Nightmare to get the full masochistic experience of a cursed heroine (Only recommended for veteran gamers).

  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <strong>
   Hey Steam community 👋,
   <br/>
   I'm Ben, and I created this game in my spare time!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dig
  </strong>
  deep,
  <strong>
   sell
  </strong>
  what you find,
  <strong>
   update
  </strong>
  your equipment to continue your journey further and further. With every spadeful you dig, you get closer to the truth. There's
  <strong>
   no rush
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   no rules
  </strong>
  - just you and the adventure underground.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Costs as much as a ☕ coffee, but is fun for longer and is caffeine-free!
  </strong>

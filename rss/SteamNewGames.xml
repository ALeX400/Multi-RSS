 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 Wake up warriors! This is Windblown, a lightning-fast action roguelite crafted by Motion Twin, the creators of Dead Cells.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 You innocent souls have lived peacefully in The Ark, a floating village orbiting around the gigantic and deadly Vortex. However, don't let that calm existence fool you; your cozy little island is about to get devoured...
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Countless warriors, the Leapers, have met their end fighting dreadful emissaries of the Vortex; now it’s your turn to save your kind, or turn into cannon fodder trying...
 <br>
  <br>

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      LIGHTNING-FAST ACTION, LIKE NEVER BEFORE
     </h2>
     Like a bolt of lightning, freely dash through vast, ever-changing islands in the sky where each run is teeming with secrets to uncover. Find your rhythm in relentless battles against the Vortex's Sentinels, hell-bent on taking you down. Brace yourself and face oppressive bosses who just can't wait to chew you up and spit you out.
     <br/>

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      UNLOCK THE DEADLIEST WEAPONS
     </h2>
     Leapers can absorb the memories of the fallen warriors who came before, unlocking special powers and allowing you to recraft their powerful gear. As you unlock these, you will gain access to more and more combinations that create unique and crazy synergies. Equip up to two weapons and use their bespoke playstyles to unleash super-powerful and hidden Alterattacks. Throw in passive Gifts, handy Trinkets and droppable Magfishes (?!) to adapt to every situation by shifting your build on the fly.
     <br/>

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      DEATH IS A LESSON
     </h2>
     The Vortex will push your skills to their limit. Windblown's combat is tough but always fair. Advance carefully though; a mis-timed dash could send you right into the deadly swing of a Sentinel’s blade. Learn from your countless deaths, memorize enemy movements and come back stronger. If you can't handle it on your own, you can always seek help from fellow Leapers in online co-op to even the odds.

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      HELP US MAKE WINDBLOWN BETTER
     </h2>
     Your feedback is invaluable to us at Motion Twin. Just as you helped us shape Dead Cells during its Early Access period, we would like to gather your thoughts to help make Windblown as great as it can possibly be. Wishlist Windblown now and be the first to know when Early Access is available.

     Now, go and prove yourselves, Leapers. The world of Windblown awaits, and we can't wait to watch you try over and over and over. Leap into a lightning-fast adventure through the sky and get ready for a colorful death...

  ABOUT THIS GAME
 </h2>
 Lights, camera, your action! Ever dreamt of ruling the cinematic universe but lacked the perfect hair or overpriced sunglasses? Fear not! Movies Tycoon lets you dive into the high-stakes world of film-making. Take on the challenge of producing blockbuster films that captivate audiences worldwide. From building your very own studio, hiring the best in the industry, to sitting in the director's chair – every decision rests upon your shoulders.
 <br/>

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Be the Director, Even if Clueless
 </h2>
 Forgot to take the camera lens cap off? That's a "bold choice in minimalistic viewing," my friend. Dive headfirst into the unpredictable waters of directing. Make scripts that come to you in dreams, set up scenes that defy conventional logic, and let your unique vision guide every frame. Think of every "oops" as an "artistic oomph." And when the critics scratch their heads, or your lead actor asks why their biggest scene is a silhouette masterpiece, just toss your hair and say it was all part of the grand design. And should your magnum opus not receive the adulation you expected? Well, genius often goes unappreciated in its time. Remember: your film isn't a misfire; it's a misunderstood masterpiece waiting for its moment in the spotlight. Lights, camera, unconventional action!

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Build & Customize Your Studio
 </h2>
 Start off with a space that screams "my uncle's garage" – complete with suspicious stains and a family of raccoons. But fear not! Soon, you'll be upgrading to levels that'd make even the snootiest of Hollywood moguls spill their overpriced lattes. Establish your brand in the industry, making it the most sought-after film production studio!

   <h2 class="bb_tag">
    Talent Scouting & Management
   </h2>
   Spot raw talent and recruit them before your competitors do. Form lasting relationships with actors, directors, and writers. Keep their morale high and manage egos to ensure a harmonious working environment.
   <h2 class="bb_tag">
    Detailed Character Creator
   </h2>
   If you stand out among the competition, your studio will attract all the best creators in the industry. But what if they're... well, not quite what you had in mind? Fear not! With our state-of-the-art character creation tool, you don't have to wait for the perfect director or actor – you can craft them from scratch! Channel your inner Dr. Frankenstein as you meticulously sculpt every tiny detail of their appearance and personality. Want an actor with neon green hair and a penchant for melodrama? Or perhaps a director who sports retro aviators and has an obsession with film noir? Your wish is our pixel.

    Ghost Face
   </strong>
  </u>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  No one can recall Nehemiah Hexum’s face before he put the mask on. However, Hunters know the faces of his victims all too well. In each twisted and open mouth, they can hear the echo of the cry that once lived there.

   <strong>
    Hush
   </strong>
  </u>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  When Ghost Face takes a life, all goes silent. The world quiets. Birds cease their songs and trees mute their rustling. Even the blood in his body pumps soundlessly through his veins as he pulls the trigger of this Frontier 73C Silencer.

    Whisper
   </strong>
  </u>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  All Hunters hear whispers when tracking prey. Wind blows over rocks and murmurs rise from infected mouths. But few Hunters know what it means to wield a whisper like Ghost Face does when this Bornheim No.3 Silencer is held in his hands.

    Life Taker
   </strong>
  </u>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  This Knife knew many lives before arriving in Ghost Face’s possession. It slit a duke’s throat in a medieval castle. Drunk peasants saw its glint before their guts spilled out. Now it’s found the perfect life where there is always more flesh to bite.

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The mask was sitting on his porch when Nehemiah Hexum opened the door.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  It was weathered wood, bone-white with age, and its face was a twisted leer. Someone had clearly thrown it against Nehemiah’s house, but he couldn’t say who or why. Curious, he bent down to pick it up, and the urge to put it on suddenly filled his mind. He hesitated a moment, then slipped it over his head.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Nehemiah lived alone on the edge of the bayou. A widower, he kept to himself and defended his land from trespassers—Hunters and Corrupted alike. It turned out that was a good thing. No sooner had he put on the mask than his mind was filled with bloody visions. He saw his hands dripping red, saw the bodies on the ground in front of him. Shaken, he took the mask off and considered hurling it into the swamp. But something stayed his hand, and he took it inside with him.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  He set it down on a table and left it there. Night after night, he stared at it. Sometimes, he got the feeling it was staring back.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  And then one night, he put it on again. This time, he didn’t take it off when the visions came. This time, he took down his trusty Bornheim, a rifle, and at the last second, a knife.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Then he went out hunting in the dark to look for someone to share those visions with, up close and personal.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Hilo: Can you guess the most popular one-word cat names? How about the least? In Hilo, compete to find the most and least popular answers to a wide variety of questions. The rankings may surprise you! It turns out a lot of people named their cat Frank. That's a freebie.

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Speed: In the fast-paced Speed, think on your toes to uncover as many answers on the list as possible, as quickly as possible. It’s everyone for themselves in a race against the clock! Each round the points increase, and the stakes get a little higher! Can you handle it?
 </p>

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Squares: Two teams compete to claim three squares in a row on the grid. Guess popular choices for the first squares, semi-popular choices for the middle squares, and least popular choices for the final squares. We guarantee, you've never had a more heated argument over attractive fictional characters than you will playing Squares.

  Bounce: In Bounce, two teams control a paddle that sits on a scale between most popular-to-least popular answers. Work with your team to guess an answer that puts your paddle in the right place to intercept a bouncing ball and stop your opponents from scoring a goal! But be careful! The ball gets faster with each answer!

    <br>
     Freely roam around dungeons and battle the enemies you choose.
     <br/>
     You'll take control of Neon, a self-professed detective who specializes in crimes in full-dive VR games. When an in-development game is suddenly overrun by countless characters from other games old and new, Neon has to delve into virtual dungeons to stop them.
     <br/>
     Each of the over 300 cards you'll collect features a unique character from those games. They come alive with full English and Japanese voice acting, talking with their friends and foes and reacting in battle.

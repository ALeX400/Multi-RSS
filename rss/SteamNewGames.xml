 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 Edition includes:
 <br/>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   Concord™
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 Assemble your crew of Freegunner space outlaws and team up online with friends for thrilling 5v5 PVP modes across the galaxy in Concord.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Concord is a new team-based first-person shooter for PS5® and PC*. Handpick your personal roster of Freegunners from the crew of the Northstar – a group of outlaws and adventurers working as guns-for-hire.
 <br>
  <br>
   <strong>
    <h2 class="bb_tag">
     ASSEMBLE YOUR CREW
    </h2>
   </strong>
   <br>
    From powerful mystics to skilled gunslingers and helpful healers, each Freegunner brings their own unique skills, personality, and abilities that cater to a wide-range of playstyles.
    <br>
     <br/>
     Create your own custom squads of Freegunners with Crew Builder to bring an arsenal of different role types to the match or focus on your favourite characters to master their gameplay and unlock unique modifiers, cosmetics, background lore, and more – you decide when to play your characters and how you impact the match.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      <h2 class="bb_tag">
       PLAY. PROGRESS. PERSONALIZE.
      </h2>
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Earn and unlock a wide range of character customization items and learn more about the characters, worlds, and factions in the Concord Galaxy with the Galactic Guide.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You’ll also be able to progress toward and unlock Freegunner Variants—versions of each of the 16 Freegunners with added Combat Trait modifiers to their base abilities. As you learn and master the characters, Combat Traits empower you to tailor each character to your playstyle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      <h2 class="bb_tag">
       MODES FOR EVERY MOOD
      </h2>
     </strong>
     <br/>
     With an array of objective and respawn-based modes with emphasis on teamplay, Concord has six different PVP modes that let you determine the level of challenge you are looking for.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      <h2 class="bb_tag">
       NORTHSTAR CREW STORIES
      </h2>
     </strong>
     <br/>
     As your journey in Concord unfolds, so will the stories of the Northstar crew. Each week, you will be greeted by new cinematic vignettes that deliver ongoing narratives that expand upon the characters and their adventures.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      <h2 class="bb_tag">
       AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE
      </h2>
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Alongside a day-one lineup of 16 playable Freegunners, six PVP modes, and 12 maps, the crew of the Northstar and the galaxy of Concord will grow through regular post-launch updates that introduce new Freegunners, Variant traits, game modes, maps and worlds, and weekly cinematic vignettes for no additional cost.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      <h2 class="bb_tag">
       BUILT FOR PS5 AND PC
      </h2>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tunnel Escape is a rogue-lite exploration RPG/ADV set in a city infected by a zombie virus. It combines action and strategy in a fusion of intense gunplay with turn-based combat, item crafting and a deep skill system. Each bullet shot, each grenade thrown and each step taken will count towards failure or success.

  EXPLORE THE UNDERGROUND LABORATORY
 </h2>
 <br>
  On the run from the spreading infection in the city, Beatrice discovers the entrance to a secret biological laboratory. Documents mention the existence of a successfully developed vaccine, sending her on a journey deep into the complex as she becomes humanity’s last hope.

    <h2 class="bb_tag">
     UTILIZE AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND SKILLS
    </h2>
    <br>
     Beatrice will need to defend herself from the dangers lurking below. Unlock unique guns, each with their own benefits and downsides; use throwables to blast enemies into pieces, blind them, stun them or set them all on fire. Even a strong kick to the face can turn the tide of battle in your favor - time to unleash the power of high-heels in close-quarters-combat!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In addition to raw weapon power, Beatrice can learn hundreds of different skills. Every gun has its own set of active skills, for example unlocking the potential of rapid fire for the pistol, using birdshot to hit all enemies at once with the shotgun, or emptying an entire magazine into the undead horde in one go with the automatic rifle. Supplemented by a huge number of passive skills for offense and defense, Beatrice gets access to a growing number of strategic options.

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      FIGHT UNIQUE ENEMIES AND BOSS BATTLES
     </h2>
     <br/>
     Zombies are far from the only threat roaming the massive, interconnected facility. Dozens of strange abominations can be encountered, from mutated creatures, infested animals and living plants to weaponized machinery and many more. Every stage features a unique selection of enemies, complete with a boss battle at the end. Defeating a stage boss will require clever use of strategy, learning the enemies’ weaknesses and utilizing the right skills at the right time.

      ENJOY HANDCRAFTED ART AND ANIMATIONS
     </h2>
     <br/>
     Every animation was crafted by use of traditional techniques, with every frame and variation of motion having been carefully hand-drawn and manually refined.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Beatrice’s facial expressions, subtle bodily movements, particle effects and voice overs for every event are meticulously controlled through scripting.

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      ENCOUNTER RANDOM EVENTS: EVERY RUN IS DIFFERENT
     </h2>
     <br/>
     Meet other characters, open chests with valuable loot, buy stat-altering drinks at vending machines, water strange plants (at your own risk) and defeat thieving little rodents among many other events that can be encountered at random. No two runs will be the same as Beatrice needs to adapt to beneficial and dangerous encounters alike.

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      CRAFTING SYSTEM
     </h2>
     <br/>
     Unlock crafting to combine items into new or stronger ones. Recovery items and ammunition for a secret weapon can be assembled whenever you are not in an active battle. Plan ahead of time to make sure you have the edge in combat when you need it the most.
     <br/>

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      PICK YOUR DIFFICULTY
     </h2>
     <br/>
     Different difficulty settings allow players of all skill levels to enjoy the game. Whether you play for the story or the challenge, the rogue-lite system of earning permanent upgrades will make the game easier even after failed attempts - and for those seeking the hardest challenge: Beatrice’s level can be lowered in the later game for that extra dose of difficulty.
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT AND FORCE FEEDBACK
     </h2>
     <br/>
     In addition to keyboard controls, every part of the game has full controller support. Furthermore, detailed force feedback simulates hits, kicks, shots and blasts, creating a tactile experience for every action. We recommend giving controller vibration a try for the highest level of immersion.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For an especially comfortable experience: The game was designed for effortless navigation with just one hand. Left, right or both hands, the control scheme allows you to play the way you desire.

  Experiment freely, rewind your mistakes
 </h2>
 When you hit a tricky situation, try every wild idea you have - you can always rewind if it didn't pan out. It could work beautifully, fail spectacularly, or screw up in a way that gives you new ideas. Either way, free rewinds mean you play it out in-game instead of scratching your head.

    Fight the (various) power(s)
   </h2>
   Your team are a motley crew of misfits on the wrong side of the law, fighting against:
   <br>
    <br>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       The Rushwater PD and their rising star: Steve Clark, the Traffic Warlock
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       An oppressive religious dictatorship who rule the streets with Riot Priests
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       A private military corporation meddling with magic to enhance their troops
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       And the most deadly operative the trade has ever seen: the Black Ops Chronomancer
      </li>
     </ul>

      Upgrade your magical arsenal
     </h2>
     Every ability for every wizard has a set of unique perks to unlock as they level up, tailoring their powers to your playstyle, and enabling ridiculous ways they can combo with each other.
     <br/>

      Get to know these loveable idiots
     </h2>
     Travel the world, meet interesting wizards, and find out what's wrong with them. Each of your team has their own personal struggles, and between missions you can choose how much to dig into them, overcome them, and guide these oddballs to become friends.
     <br/>

      Unravel a conspiracy, stop a war
     </h2>
     As the enemy plot thickens, key players and their relationships are added to your conspiracy map to keep track of the important bits. You can read more about anything you're fuzzy on, arrange them in a way that makes sense to you, and keep a visual overview of what's going on.

      Build confidence to wear fancier outfits
     </h2>
     Each character already owns all their unlockable outfits - they just don't have the confidence to wear them. Characters earn confidence by accomplishing optional extra objectives that reflect their strengths and values.

      Fine-tune the difficulty
     </h2>
     We want everyone to be able to finish the game, so as well as Easy, Medium & Hard modes, you can customise each variable individually for the kind of challenge you like.

      What is it not?
     </h2>
     As always, we don't want you to buy the game if it's not for you. Here are some things it isn't!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       It's not a branching story. You do make choices in your conversations, but they don't cause major deviations in the course of the plot. They're more about deciding how you want this character to treat people, and how much you want to dig into or push back at what the other person is saying.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       It's not a roguelike. Every now and then someone will call it that and we don't know why! Every level is handcrafted.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       It's not XCOM. This is a much shorter, story-driven experience about a cast of unique characters. There's no base-building or equivalent.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       It's not Into the Breach. This is more forgiving, but the ceiling on how many different things you can do in a turn is higher.
      </li>
     </ul>

  Mature Content Description
 </h2>
 <p>
  The developers describe the content like this:
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   The game has a stylised rather than realistic look, but people sure do get shot, struck, slammed into walls, smashed through windows, set on fire, etc. There is a little stylised blood.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The closest thing you have to a healer is a necromancer who needs to kill the patient before she can bring them back to life at full health. Not sure where that falls in all this.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plot features a fictional illegal drug prominently. Use of it is not encouraged nor directly depicted.

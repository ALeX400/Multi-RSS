 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 Cinnabunny is a cute couch co-hop game focused on running a bakery and living in a village with fellow buns. Drawing inspiration from games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Cinnabunny is meant to be a relaxing, cozy experience designed for gamers and non-gamers alike. It can be played locally by one or two players.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Story
 </h2>
 Oh no! Your cute, hoppy bun family is fighting a nasty drought. They'll be okay for a while, but your mother has tasked you with finding a new place for the family to live. After a long journey, you've found it! Welcome to Sugar Creek Burrows, a paradise among buns. Run your new bakery and save up so your family can move here too!

   Forage / Farm for Ingredients

     </h2>
     Use your birdoculars to capture pictures of the various bird species around Sugar Creek Burrows. With over thirty species of birds to discover (each with true-to-life bird calls), you'll have to scour the skies in various weather, seasons, and times of day to find them all.

     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      Advance Your Skills
     </h2>
     Your bun has four basic skills in Cinnabunny: baking, foraging, birdwatching, and recycling. Every time you perform the skill successfully, you'll get better at it, giving unique bonuses as you level up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     -----------------
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      *Important note:*
     </strong>
     Cinnabunny is a local multiplayer game, meaning two people can play on the same system. There is no native online multiplayer. In order to play with another person, you will need at least one gamepad (xbox controllers work well). There is no split keyboard controls.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It is possible to play online multiplayer via Steam's Remote Play Together feature (one computer will connect to another one to play). However, the second player must have a controller for this to work (this is a limitation of the game engine I use and how it handles local multiplayer).

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Humans have long since freed themselves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  It’s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Utilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.

  The main stage of the first instalment in the "Stories from Sol" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game’s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features "Armoured Frames", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.

  All stories are about people and the cast of “The Gun-Dog” bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, “The Gun-Dog” features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story’s heart.

  Welcome to the Living Lands, a mysterious island filled with adventure and danger.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Set in the fictional world of Eora that was first introduced to players in the Pillars of Eternity franchise, Avowed is a first-person fantasy action RPG from the award-winning team at Obsidian Entertainment.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <br/>
  The Living Lands is an island where the air hums with ancient magic, the flora seems to move with a mind of its own, and the ground beneath your feet shifts with secrets waiting to be unearthed.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Now, the Living Lands faces a dire threat—a mysterious plague that defies nature and reason, spreading chaos across its sprawling wilderness.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  As an envoy of Aedyr, you are sent to investigate, but what begins as a mission of duty soon becomes deeply personal—you feel as though the land recognizes you and is pulling you toward something greater. The choices you make will ripple across the Living Lands, shaping the fates of its people, its creatures, and even yourself. But beware, for every decision carries weight, and the forces you encounter will not hesitate to test your resolve.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Can you navigate the tangled web of intrigue, power, and danger to uncover the truth? Can you save this unknown frontier and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them asunder?

  The Living Lands is a place that feels foreign yet somewhat intrinsic to you as it feels the island itself is calling out to you for help. Explore an island home to many different environments and landscapes, each with their own unique ecosystem.

 Void Crew is a 1-4 player co-op First Person Space Adventure: Rally your crew, power your spaceship, and get ready for epic space battles, facing chaotic dangers you and your crew never trained for!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <i>
  In the future, a doctrine of survival unites humanity against a mysterious aggressor - the Hollow. As the chosen ones, it’s up to you as a
  <strong>
   crew of up to 1-4 mavericks
  </strong>
  to brave the void and bring order to the galaxy!
 </i>
 <br>
  <br>
   Embark on the most advanced spacecrafts ever built, and journey into deep space on thrilling missions that you and your crew absolutely never trained for! Asteroid storms, solar flares and your buddies’ screw-ups will be the least of your worries, as hostile aliens, and desperate human scavengers push your crew to their limits.
   <h2 class="bb_tag">
    CHAOTIC 1 - 4 -PLAYER CO-OP
   </h2>
   <br>
    Pilot the ship, man the turrets, perform emergency repairs, recharge the power cells, utilize space station weaponry, fabricate munitions and exit the ship on extravehicular missions - be it patching the ship hull or scavenging derelict wrecks.
    <h2 class="bb_tag">
     EPIC SPACE BATTLES
    </h2>
    <br>
     Teamwork is key: pick a role and prioritize your most urgent tasks with your crew... or try to do everything at once and just wing it as you’ll be short on reliable manpower!
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      SHARE AND OPERATE YOUR OWN SPACESHIP
     </h2>
     <br/>
     Brute force through thick armor, pierce energy shields, launch missile barrages or snipe weak spots - either way you’ll make sure the enemy ships spin out of control to their destruction - preferably before you blow up! The victor claims the spoils, and you’ll need to scavenge valuable materials to upgrade and face the direst conditions with top notch equipment … and don’t forget to go full fashion victim and customize your character's spacesuit to fly in style and boldly go where you probably shouldn’t have!
     <br/>

        Team-up as a crew of 1-4 in co-op:

        Your ship, your way to play:

       With a flexible player role system and on-the-go installable ship systems you’ll be able to switch your strategies faster than a rogue asteroid changes course.

     Twelve Character Classes
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile 2 features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they're just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Each of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specialisations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between.

    This is the next generation of Path of Exile's famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It's now possible to six-link every skill your character uses.

    <strong>
     Dual-specialise your Passive Skill Tree
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile's iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customise your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialisation, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialise in multiple areas without opportunity cost.

     Encounter Unique Bosses
    </strong>
    <br/>
    In Path of Exile 2, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There's over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn.

     Explore a New Endgame
    </strong>
    <strong>
     <br/>
    </strong>
    Completing the campaign is just the beginning. The endgame in Path of Exile 2 includes countless areas in different biomes, powerful crafting, challenging bosses, unique encounters and much more. Unlock new paths and explore further into the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As you progress through the endgame, you will gain access to special passive trees that can boost the rewards of your maps and change the way the various endgame mechanics work. These trees will make your maps more rewarding but also more difficult.

    <br/>
    Path of Exile 2 introduces sequels to several leagues from Path of Exile. While their mechanics are familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new.

     Fair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win.
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile 2 is a separate game to the original Path of Exile. We will continue to offer expansions for both games going forward. They are completely free-to-play and will never be "pay to win". Purchases are shared between the two games.

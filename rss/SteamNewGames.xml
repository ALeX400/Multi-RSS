     [World View]
     <br/>
     In secret corners that humans have never noticed, figures have never stopped performing their own secret stories.
     <br/>
     The world of figures is small. They are always sad for their masters and happy for their masters. For them, their masters' feelings are everything.
     <br/>
     The world of figures is big. When their masters are not around, they will jump out of the window together and travel in the human world.
     <br/>
     Yuki, who exists as a figure, has always lived happily with his partners and his master in this way.
     <br/>
     However, the emergence of the evil figure organization destroyed the peaceful and peaceful life of the figures. A large number of figures disappeared for no reason and were forced to separate from their masters. The dreams of the figures were shattered one after another. Yuki, who was involved in this incident, made unexpected discoveries in the process of investigating the evil figure organization in depth...
     <br/>
     In the double difficult choice between the past and the present, what choice will Yuki make? Where will the fate of the figures involved in this chaos go?
     <br/>
     "At the moment when the memory of love disappears, I just want to do my best to remember your name."
     <br/>
     <br/>

 Put your diplomatic skill to the ultimate test in
 <i>
  <strong>
   Sphere of Influence
  </strong>
 </i>
 , a new expansion to
 <i>
  Victoria 3
 </i>
 . Pull other nations into your orbit through diplomatic skill, economic leverage or straightforward bribery. Building a durable international faction of like-minded governments, pursuing common goals for a common good and the glory of your power.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Paradox Interactive’s grand strategy simulation of the Victorian Age offers new ways to impose your will on the world. A coalition of reactionary powers can form blocs to work against the threat of liberal forces in other nations. Use your economic might to co-opt or coerce other regimes, spreading the banner of your ideology wherever your fleets might sail. Resist or embrace domestic pressure to change your traditional foreign policy, as economic and ideological agitators push you to build new coalitions of power.
 <br>
  <br>
   <i>
    Sphere of Influence
   </i>
   adds many new actions and systems to illustrate the quick moving nature of diplomatic relations in this dramatic era, including new content specifically about The Great Game - the decades long competition between the British and Russian Empires for pre-eminence in North India and Central Asia.

  About This Game

  <strong>
   Important information to consider before purchasing this game in early access:
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <br/>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   The game is still in development. You might encounter various smaller or bigger bugs, balance issues, and a lack of final polish.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   We’re open to any feedback. We believe that together, we can create the best deckbuilding experience possible!
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   Your saved data may become corrupted or wiped with large patches and version changes.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   Gamepads may not work properly (which will be changed in the future), so a keyboard + mouse setup is strongly recommended.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   The game is playable on Steam Deck, but as gamepad controls are not finished, you will have to use the trackpad frequently.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   Right now, only English is supported, but in the future, we’ll expand the list of available languages
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <strong>
  Dice & Fold
 </strong>
 is a game that combines the strategic depth of turn-based dungeon crawlers with the thrill of chance inherent in dice games. Players unfold cards to face the creature cards and try to beat the card and fold it. Reminiscent of classic table-top RPGs and Solitaire, the game adds a simple layer of strategy.
 <br/>

 </a>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  SOLITAIRE WITH A DICE?
 </h2>
 The core mechanic of the game revolves around dice rolling. Players engage in combat by rolling a dice, with the outcome directly influencing the strength of their attacks. The higher the roll, the more damage inflicted on the enemies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693930/extras/gif3.gif"/>
 <br>
  <br>
   You must strategize the best use of their dice rolls to maximize damage and control the battlefield, while also anticipating the counterattacks from monster cards at the end of each turn. The game offers a compelling risk-reward system, challenging players to balance aggressive tactics against the need for self-preservation.
   <br>
    <br>
     Adding to the complexity, the game features 20+ distinct classes, each with unique abilities and playstyles. This diversity allows for varied approaches to beating the dungeon, encouraging replayability and experimentation.
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      ROGUELIKE & DECKBUILDING
     </h2>
     With the generative dungeon system, reminiscent of the branching pathways in
     <strong>
      Slay the Spire.
     </strong>
     This element of choice ensures that each journey through the dungeons is a unique experience, filled with unexpected challenges and rewards. As the player you will choose the enemy and upgrade cards you want to keep in your next turn.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2693930/extras/gif.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Between stages, players have the opportunity to choose items, similar to the mechanics in
     <strong>
      Vampire Survivors.
     </strong>
     These upgrades range from enhancing dice rolls and bolstering class abilities to gaining new effects that can turn the tide in challenging encounters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If a player is defeated, the game doesn’t end in frustration. Instead, players are rewarded with meta upgrades and currencies that can be used to strengthen their character for subsequent runs. This progressive system ensures a continual sense of advancement and achievement, even in defeat.

  STORY
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  After losing his mother a few years ago, Ayato Hirose has been living alone with his dad, Masa, until Masa is suddenly sent overseas for two months over summer break.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Worried about leaving Ayato alone, they turn to a trusted neighbor, Rinko Ninomiya, for help. She points them toward a housekeeping agency—but not just any agency.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <i>
   Bunny’s Moms
  </i>
  specializes in warm, caring women who act as temporary “mothers,” providing head pats, home-cooked meals, and a whole lot of healing. To Ayato’s surprise, the first to arrive is none other than Rinko herself… now officially his new mom!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Soon, more women arrive at his door: Kiyoko, the dependable childhood friend; Kana, the confident head of the agency; and Tsumugi, a sweet, flustered newlywed still learning the ropes. Each brings her own brand of motherly affection into Ayato’s once-quiet home.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  This summer, a new kind of household begins to take root... one full of comfort, surprises, and more than a little heart.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Literally the mom next door, Rinko lives in the apartment next to Ayato and his dad’s. Known around the neighborhood for her warm, motherly nature, she’s something of a local celebrity mom already.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She’s known Ayato since he was little and fusses over him like he were her own. And in a way, she wishes he were...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though she has a young son herself, he wants nothing to do with her pampering, so all that untapped motherly affection is ready to be unleashed. Thanks to Bunny’s, her longtime soft spot for Ayato is about to become a full-on smothering.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  CEO of the rent-a-mom agency Bunny’s Moms, although when short on staff, she doesn’t hesitate to roll up her sleeves and step in herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At first glance, she seems cool and a little intimidating, but don’t be fooled. She’s calm, composed, and surprisingly open-minded. She’s also competent in every area of homemaking, but her perfectionist streak means she’ll happily take notes from anyone better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With her husband working overseas and almost never home, she’s more or less living the solo life. Maybe, just maybe, she’s looking for someone to fill the quiet...

  The lovely wife at long-beloved local bathhouse Oda Springs Eternal. She helps out at the front desk from time to time, but most of the heavy lifting is handled by her husband and in-laws. To pitch in with the family finances and get a little break from full-time mom duty, she decides to sign up with Bunny’s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kiyoko and Ayato go way back—he used to greet her every morning on his way to school, and their relationship has always felt a bit like a big-sister-little-brother dynamic. Her two daughters adore Ayato too, so everything’s been smooth sailing thus far...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Kiyoko’s always had a quiet longing: she wants to raise a son of her own. So when the chance to spoil Ayato comes along, she’s more than ready to play the doting mom he’s never had.

  To stave off her loneliness and prep for the baby they promised to make when he gets back, she joins Bunny’s for a little hands-on parenting practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsumugi’s still new to the job, and with her naturally playful, slightly childish personality, she struggles to act more like a “mom” than a big sister. But she's trying her best, even if “motherhood” isn’t as easy as she thought...

  A second-year at Ouba Academy, Ayato lost his mother at a young age and has been living alone with his dad ever since. To support his always-busy old man, he’s taken charge of the cooking, cleaning, and general home upkeep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though he puts on a capable front, Ayato secretly longs to be mothered again and finds himself drawn to the warm, idealized image of the mom next door, Rinko.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With youthful, almost girlish good looks that get him doted on by people of all ages, Ayato can’t help but feel a little self-conscious about just how adorable everyone seems to think he is...

  Nested Lands is a multiplayer settlement-building RPG set in a dark, plague-ravaged world where twisted madmen and bandits roam the land. Your life will depend on how well you manage and grow your settlement. Fortunately, you're not alone in this dark world — your peasants will help you gather resources, craft items, and build defenses as you lead them through danger and privation. But remember, every choice you make has consequences and can lead your village to prosperity or a senseless death from the plague.

  Start from a clean slate and build a brand-new civilization. Assign each peasant a specific role and order them to build, craft, or gather the resources you need to survive the hardships you will face. With dozens of upgradable buildings and hundreds of items to craft and customize, including farms and animals, you're free to shape your settlement as you see fit. But don't let your growing dynasty blind you — hostile forces lurk nearby, ready to spill your blood.

  The only way to break through the endless darkness of Nested Lands is to gather the other survivors who share your plight, but have yet to fully give up hope. Save and recruit peasants during your journey across the world. But keep in mind that they will need your protection.
  <br/>
  Harsh weather and the coming winter are also your sworn enemies, and the highly detailed world full of random events won’t grant you a single moment’s rest.

  Start from nothing. Rise from the bottom, overcome monumental challenges, and make your fame echo across the Nested Lands. But be careful - all your decisions will be carefully watched and evaluated. Will your name be praised by all, or will its very sound instill fear into the common folk who dwell in this open world? The choice is yours.

  The disfigured nature of the world makes survival even more challenging. Before facing other threats, you need to secure the basics — a lack of medicine can wipe your village out faster than any blade. Craft, improve your skills, and endure the harsh reality of Nested Lands. Brutal weather and the coming winter may be your greatest foes, but random encounters won't offer any respite.

  Rise of Piracy focuses heavily on progression and growth. In your campaign, you will first be given a small ship and a handful of coin. Complete missions and find treasure to build your economic strength and relations with the other factions. You can also choose to fight, boarding or sinking other vessels for loot. Build up your fleet of ships and their crews to take on the most challenging tasks such as capture islands of various strength and composition. Defeating large colonial fleets in grand scale naval warfare. Hunt pirates or long lost treasures. Uncovering mysterious lands filled with dangers as you go.

  Everything in Rise of Piracy is carefully hand-crafted to be a new experience and challenge, no procedural generation. Every building in is destructible, allowing you to level an island from afar via bombardment from your fleet before sending your crews as landing parties to conquer them. Talk to mayors of settlements and captains of fleets to uncover hidden lands, or find them yourself through exploration and investigation.

  Piracy is optional. Choose to trade with over 200 commodities that can be found scattered around the world. Ports with specialized trading routes and dedicated merchants to trade with. Add trading ships to your fleet to maximize your transportation potential. Build relations with other factions to increase your trading effectiveness. Engaging in war, hunting bounties, or seeking hidden treasures are also viable means of building your bank.

  A deep diplomacy system allows relationships to grow between all factions. Engage in diplomacy with every faction you meet. NPC factions will go to war with one another and their assets will change hands. Changing the balance of powers can impact your play-style, increasing warship activity, and blocking trade routes.

  Fill your fleet with a large variety of playable ships from the 1600s - 1900s, from the light and fast Sloop to the tremendous firepower but limited maneuverability that comes with the 120 Gun ship of the Line. Taverns provide a great place to hire crewmen for your fleet. Fill your ships with specialized crew. Use them to board hostile ships, or invading and capturing islands to secure passive income. Hostile actions will have consequences amongst the factions - fleets of pirate hunters are constantly seeking bounties. Campaign difficulty will grow dynamically and remain challenging no matter how strong players get.

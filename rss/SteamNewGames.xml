 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 The ranging chains of obsession that stretch from the infamous
 <i>
  Girl In Shell
 </i>
 case have dragged Detective Reiji Tokisaka back in for one final challenge—and everything he has left hangs in the balance.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">

 <br/>
 The year is Showa 33—or 1958, by the new calendar.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It is an especially cold January, and amid the dour gray snow, a funeral is being held. A portrait of a girl's face sits there draped in snow, looking almost embarrassed and a little lonely...
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The imprisoned painter Shinzo Mamiya died a scant few weeks after the Blessed Congregation's crimes came to light. Detective Reiji Tokisaka has been recruited by his old friend Maris Stella to help sort through the man's belongings, but instead they find an unknown work in his studio: a one-winged angel with no arms. The work, which they name
 <i>
  Exile Of Paradise
 </i>
 , is as beautiful as it is sinister—and it resembles his infamous masterpiece
 <i>
  Girl In Shell
 </i>
 .
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A few more days later, a woman's corpse is found, modified in the manner depicted in
 <i>
  Exile
 </i>
 . She is identified as having formerly worked with Tomoyuki Masaki.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There may be no one left who can cut the chain of obsession that began with
 <i>
  Girl In Shell
 </i>
 —nobody but one small girl.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <i>
  E quell'ossessione fa girare il sole e tutte le stelle.
 </i>

 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara01_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Reiji Tokisaka (Voice: Waruta Higeuchi)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Private Detective
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A man shouldering dark memories and a difficult past. He's solved many cases, made friends as well as lost them—and all the while, he's been desperately searching for a girl who disappeared.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara02_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Yukari Tokisaka (Voice: Rino Kawashima)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Student
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Reiji Tokisaka's little sister is the perfect model of a Japanese woman, always kind and caring towards her older brother. Currently having difficulty planning her future, since it's tricky to make a living as an artist. As she blossoms into womanhood, she still has the same relationship with Masaki as ever: not too close, but not too far. (She's starting to have thoughts about this.)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara03_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Tomoyuki Masaki (Voice: Masato Kawamura)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Assistant at the Tokisaka Detective Agency
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ever since Yukari stopped him from committing suicide in Inokashira Park, Masaki has been doing what he can to help her brother out at the Tokisaka Detective Agency. Emotionally distant to the point that even the death of a close acquaintance can't shake him, he's recently resumed therapy with a psychiatrist at the hospital. He assists Reiji's investigations in the hopes of finding his childhood friend who turned to crime and disappeared.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara04_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Ayumu Sato (Voice: Kaname Yuzuki)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Student
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yukari's underclassman at their girls' school who has a powerful sense of justice and dreams of working as a detective's Watson. Having come to understand how hard the job of a detective's assistant is (largely because Reiji won't take her on), she's been thinking more seriously about the future of late.
 <br/>
 Her androgynous looks have also won her a certain popularity on campus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara05_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Kyoko Hazuki (Voice: Kaname Yuzuki)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Cafe Owner
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This resilient woman runs the Moon World cafe, which she inherited from her late husband. Previously had a physical relationship with Reiji, who had also lost someone important to him, and believed that the two could heal each other's wounds, but the two are now moving in different directions.
 <br/>
 She still struggles with the fact that Reiji's heart is elsewhere. However, someone else might be looking her way...
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara06_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Toji Aoki (Voice: Kanon Morii)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Freelance Reporter
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Formerly a high-ranking member of the Ueno-based organization known as the Hand of Death, after the case involving the Senri cult, she awoke to the joys of journalism. Now, she runs independent investigations into various social issues, and sometimes cooperates with both Reiji and the police. Most famous for her keen eye and physical abilities, which let her go toe to toe with dangerous criminals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara07_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Natsume Takashiro (Voice: Hikaru Isshiki)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Coroner
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The head of the Takashiro Clinic, and a skilled doctor who prefers dissecting murder victims to healing those who are still alive. Though professionally reliable, her eccentric personality and deviant proclivities leave others in a perpetual state of bewilderment when dealing with her.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara08_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Maris Stella (Voice: Yuzuki Akishiro)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Museum Curator
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A curator at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum. She first met Reiji during his investigation into the
 <i>
  Girl In Shell
 </i>
 case and has deep connections to both Toji and Rokushiki.
 <br/>
 Typically difficult to engage in conversation, she becomes surprisingly fluent when the topic turns to art.
 <br/>
 Between the discovery of Mamiya's unannounced work
 <i>
  Exile of Paradise
 </i>
 and the situation with Rokushiki, a new void is opening up in her heart. Where will the currents of fate take her...?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara09_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Kaede Watanuki (Voice: Hazuki Hina)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Psychiatrist
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A mental health specialist who works part time at Kuchiki Hospital. Responsible for both Masaki and Michiru's treatment.
 <br/>
 Kaede views Masaki as a fascinating subject because he received counseling from Rokushiki in the past. She, too, has dreams of interviewing the latter and attempt to analyze his mind, but might find the task more difficult than she bargained for.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara10_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Sei Maezono (Voice: Mei Hanazono)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Art Gallery Staff
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A laid-back, somewhat sloppy woman who works at Sasakura Gallery in Kichijoji. Her work with old art materials for the gallery has partially morphed into a collecting hobby, and her clothes are often covered with paint stains.
 <br/>
 Masaki also worked at the gallery for a time, making the two of them former coworkers. Sei seems to have trouble remembering names, however, as she calls Masaki something new every time she encounters him.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3296790/extras/chara11_eng.png"/>
 <br/>
 Toko Kuchiki (Voice: Aji Sanma)
 <br/>
 Occupation: Student
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A girl who met the detective Reiji Tokisaka in Inokashira Park in the March of 1956. She asked him to find her true self.
 <br/>
 Deeply lonely, the better he came to understand her, the more she was drawn to him, and their wounded souls came to find comfort in each other.
 <br/>
 However, she was caught in an accident and, while she managed to hang onto her life, was left incapacitated and kidnapped shortly thereafter. It seems there had been a new life growing inside her belly at the time...

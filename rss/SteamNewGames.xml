  About This Game

 <br/>
 Cabernet is a 2D narrative RPG set in a 19th century Eastern European inspired world, with a modern twist. Guide Liza, a young vampire struggling with her morality and the supernatural world she has been pulled into. Will you retain your humanity or descend further into the horror you have become? Prepare to explore a hidden world of political intrigue, class conflict, and decadent corruption.
 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br>
  Use the moonlit sky to plan your next feast and explore. Mingle among vampiric society and the humans who feed them. Uncover who can aid your new kin and whose only purpose is to be drained.
  <br>

    <br>
     <br/>
     Vampirism isn't just an unholy transformation of your body-- it also threatens to transform your mind. Will you choose to indulge your empathetic humanity or embrace your newfound nihilism?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2401410/extras/CAB_Graphic_Steam_GIF-2_616x100_V1.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But to lure your next meal somewhere safe and secluded, you'll need to understand who they are and what they desire. A kind-hearted, alcoholic coachman? A fraying newlywed couple? A greedy, yet charming charlatan? Their lives are yours to aid or unravel.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2401410/extras/CAB_Graphic_Steam_GIF-4_616x100_V1.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Art, literature, history, science, these are the skills you'll require to succeed. Your knowledge will be your greatest weapon in a world where the cunning drain the brutal of life.

  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Cinnabunny is a cute couch co-hop game focused on running a bakery and living in a village with fellow buns. Drawing inspiration from games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, Cinnabunny is meant to be a relaxing, cozy experience designed for gamers and non-gamers alike. It can be played locally by one or two players.

  Advance Your Skills
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your bun has four basic skills in Cinnabunny: baking, foraging, birdwatching, and recycling. Every time you perform the skill successfully, you'll get better at it, giving unique bonuses as you level up.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  -----------------
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <strong>
   *Important note:*
  </strong>
  Cinnabunny is a local multiplayer game, meaning two people can play on the same system. There is no native online multiplayer. In order to play with another person, you will need at least one gamepad (xbox controllers work well). There is no split keyboard controls.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  It is possible to play online multiplayer via Steam's Remote Play Together feature (one computer will connect to another one to play). However, the second player must have a controller for this to work (this is a limitation of the game engine I use and how it handles local multiplayer).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, this game encourages co-operative gameplay. Players share an inventory and have access to the same tools. Also, while player 2 can do everything player 1 can, you cannot enter different unique sections of the map at the same time (so if one player wants to go to the forest or the caves for example, both players must go). Buns stick together, after all!

  It’s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Utilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.

  The main stage of the first instalment in the "Stories from Sol" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game’s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features "Armoured Frames", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.

Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story’s heart.

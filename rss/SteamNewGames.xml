 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  An All-New PvP Raid Shooter
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <i>
   Highguard
  </i>
  is a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Team up, secure your base, then ride out across vast uncharted lands to loot, harvest resources, and upgrade your arsenal as you face off against a rival Warden crew looking to claim your territory as their own. Battle for possession of the legendary Shieldbreaker in the open field; fight to carry it to the enemy base to bring down their shields—then raid to destroy their base before they can destroy yours.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Assemble Your Crew
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Pick from an ever-growing roster of Wardens, and form up in teams of three. Wardens wield guns and raid tools, in combination with rare magical abilities leftover from a dwindling age of magic, now returned. Every Warden ability is designed to add depth to the game’s unique loop and mechanics, like raid combat and destruction; siege stealth and infiltration; base repair and defense; harvesting and loot gathering; open-world combat, and much, much more.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Secure Your Stronghold
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Choose from an array of unique strongholds to call in as your base of operations in large, open maps. Each base has different layouts, advantages, and vulnerabilities. Pick the base best-suited for your team composition, play style, and map type. Once you’ve called in a base, take some time to reinforce walls and customize your loadout before heading out into the field.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Mount Up, Ride Out
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Mount up with your team and ride across the vast mythical landscapes of Highguard in search of loot, resources, and gear to strengthen your arsenal. You can find upgraded guns, armor, and other equipment, like better saddles and magical amulets imbued with perks. Be on the lookout, as the enemy team will be doing the same. Fight them off to secure the best loot for your team.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Battle For the Shieldbreaker
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Strange magical storms periodically ravage the continent of Highguard. Everytime one appears, an ancient magical sword, called the Shieldbreaker, forms at its heart. This sword is the crucial key for breaking through the outer shields of the enemy base so that you can raid. When one of these storms forms in the sky, ride with your team to its location and battle the enemy team for possession of the Shieldbreaker forming beneath it.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Intercept in the Open Field
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Once you have the Shieldbreaker, battle across the open field, on mount or on foot, as you attempt to carry the sword to the enemy base. But stay vigilant—if the enemy team eliminates you while carrying the Shieldbreaker, they can pick it up and ride to raid your base instead.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Summon a Siege Tower
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Once you’ve successfully reached the enemy base with the Shieldbreaker, plunge the blade into the base’s outer superstructure to weaken its shields, then summon in a Siege Tower to finish the job. When those shields go down, it’s time to raid.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  The Raid
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  With the base shields gone, you’ll need to push in to destroy the base by planting bombs on the base’s generators. But in order to get inside a well-fortified base, you’ll need to use every weapon, raid tool, and arcane ability at your disposal to shoot, sneak, or smash your way inside. Once inside, plant bombs and hold the objective while defenders try to flush you out. Chip away at a base’s strength by taking out multiple generators, or go straight for their anchor stone to destroy the base in one fell swoop. And if you’re defending, protect your generators and repel attackers until the energy of the Siege Tower is depleted and your outer shields repair.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Fight For Control
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  If multiple generators or the anchor stone is destroyed, the enemy base is destroyed and the attackers secure the territory. But most of the time, victory doesn’t come with a single raid. When that happens, the enemy base shields repair, the siege tower dissipates, and the fight escalates as loot, gear, and weapons all upgrade in the field, and a new Shieldbreaker forms in a different location in the world.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  From there the fight for control continues—until only one base is left standing.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">

  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Experience the complexities and challenges of modern American leadership in this faithful digital adaptation of GMT Games’ acclaimed board game
  <i>
   Mr. President: The American Presidency 2000-2020
  </i>
  . Step into the Oval Office during two decades that transformed America and the world.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Select your Cabinet and guide your administration through pivotal moments in recent history - as well as those that didn’t happen, but could have. What if the global financial crisis had happened earlier - or been even worse? What if violence in Central or South America escalated to create a cartel-dominated rogue state? What if outsourcing and automation, or an oil price spike, drove a domestic political crisis? Make the crucial decisions that will define - or tarnish - your presidential legacy.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Play any of the five historical scenarios - one for each of the presidential terms from 2000 to 2020 - and see if you can do better than your historical counterpart. Can you pass Social Security reform in the early 2000s? Protect the world from a nuclear Iran or North Korea? Hammer out lasting immigration reforms? Or play the sandbox scenario, which represents the general trends of these two decades. In addition to dealing with diplomatic and domestic crises, you’ll nominate Supreme Court justices and shepherd their confirmation hearings; manage scandals; run your re-election campaign; work with Congress to pass your legislative agenda; and build a capable and effective Cabinet.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   True to the Original, Easier to Manage
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The digital version maintains everything that made the original board game compelling:
 </p>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Over 150 different Crisis events, both historical and counterfactual
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Specific action lists and agendas for America’s key allies and adversaries - no recycled gameplay that makes Israel and Canada seem the same except for the flag
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Choose from a large menu of action choices at every turn - and agonize how to spend your limited action budget
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Prioritize America’s strategic capabilities, from cyber warfare to space to intelligence gathering, always with an eye to America’s peer rivals Russia and China
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  But now you can focus purely on strategy, while the game handles all the administrative tasks that slowed down tabletop play.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Digital Features That Enhance Your Experience
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Every table and action list you need is a mouse click away
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Seamless board view that lets you slide effortlessly between the big picture and the crisis of the moment
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Scenario setup in seconds
   </p>
  </li>

    R.I.P. merges the bullet-heaven barrage of Vampire Survivors together with the deeply gear-driven progression of Diablo.

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In a world full of corrosion viruses and zombies, you will act as an elite R.I.P. employee with a simple goal to resolve the screen-flooding hordes through physical means. Kill monsters, pick up loots, recast gears, and collect various sets - work has never been so exciting!

  R.I.P. isn't just a Survivor-like game, but also a true gear-driven ARPG game. Scavenge hundreds of weapons and tactical gears from the ruins. Beware of the golden beams - legendary items are empowered with game-changing affixes. Few things are more satisfying for a corporate drone than seeing the damage numbers skyrocket.

  Each mission features colossal mutant lords waiting for you. Agile movement and precise evasion are required to face against them. But do remember, this is a loot-hunting game - as long as your gear and Build are overpowered enough, even the once invincible bosses become training dummies for your "face-tank" damage tests.

  Don't be upset even you fail, because your Contribution Points will be retained anyway, which can be utilized to upgrade your stats and unlock new abilities in the talent tree.

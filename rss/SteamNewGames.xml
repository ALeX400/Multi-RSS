  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Diplomacy is Not an Option is a base-building survival RTS with an active pause, taking place in a medieval fantasy setting, where your choices can decide the destiny of the world.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  You step into the well-worn shoes of the minor Lord. Circumstances force you to fight. Like all the time. Always outnumbered. Build your walls, raise your armies, and experience warfare on an entirely new scale. Over 25 THOUSAND enemies assault your castle walls. You're going to master engineering, economy and even magic If you hope to survive.
 </p>

  Your King is a mighty and powerful leader. Also, he is an egocentric pig. Adores to drink and in general he's enjoying his life. But after the treasury had emptied and even raising taxes had not helped, it became clear that he could not continue his leisurely lifestyle. Which is a problem. Mostly yours. Because peasants, who are not fond of raised taxes and hunger, are rioting in your feud. King demands you put down the rebellion and go to the distant land to get some gold. (Rumors are there is one where there are tons of it) Will you do as your sovereign bids and set sail to replenish the palace coffers? Will you join the violent leader of rebels to bring the tyrant to justice? Will you help poor natives of Uncharted Continent? Or will you cast aside human nature and ambition and lead armies of Undead? Questions, questions, questions. The one thing you can be sure of is that no matter what faction you support there will be blood anyway. And legions of archers, swordsmen, siege weapons, knights, and more will be staying by your side for you to achieve your goal.

  While admittedly tongue-in-cheek, the laws of physics are still deadly serious in Diplomacy Is Not An Option. Every arrow, catapult stone and enemy launched skywards is physically modeled, making for a tactile and coherent battlefield. Just make sure your troops have towers to shoot from and clear lines of sight, or you might find your best-laid plans embarrassingly blunted by your own fortifications. Consider your gates, your lines of advancement and retreat. Create kill-zones and fall-back positions. You will need to take an active role in combat to get the best from your men.

  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272320/extras/3_the_functional_society_opt.gif"/>
  Even under siege, never forget your castle was built on the backs of the peasantry. Defend your people, and they’ll serve you well. Engage in agriculture and farming, or food can become scarce, and your soldiers can starve on the battlefield. Build houses, bury fallen soldiers and peasants to prevent plague, and treat the infected when death comes knocking. If you do not care for your people you may soon find yourself overrun with the most unpleasant troubles. Like empty stockpiles, unrepaired walls and running dry barracks… or be overrun literally with swarms of zombies. And no lord wishes to see zombie apocalypse in the backyard of his castle, right?

  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1272320/extras/4_the_economic_laws_opt.gif"/>
  A functional army requires a functional economy to support and feed it. Food, Wood, Stone, Iron, and Gold are the foundations of your city’s economy, and you will need to watch your supplies carefully if you are to meet the advancing foe in a timely manner. Gather resources, choose your storage locations, plan your expansions and upgrades with care. The enemy will not cede their lands willingly, and unprotected civilian expansions will have consequences of falling prey to the hostile incursion. Trade, via the impressive merchant dirigible, bringing emergency supplies of food to feed the men, or stone to rebuild the walls. Can you strike the balance between greedy expansion and security?

  If life gives you lemons, make lemonade. If you’ve inherited a cursed kingdom, why not master the dark arts? Sturdy castle walls will protect you from most ordinary threats, but in Diplomacy Is Not An Option you're also be battling undeads. So why give them a monopoly on magic? There is a dark history of tainted power that stirs zombies and traps wayward souls. On the lighter side: it can also be used to call down really very big fireballs onto your enemies. So enjoy that too. Build magical monuments, harvest soul crystals and give a try to a maniacal laugh as searing magical beams tear through your foes and summoned ghosts to chase down the stragglers.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The game has been designed with freedom as a core concept. Go beyond the campaign and crush your foes as you see fit in Endless Mode, Sandbox Mode or Challenge Mode. Develop your own personal strategies on procedurally generated maps. Go heavy on walls early, build large armies of cannon-fodder, or pursue the macro game of greedy growth and costly investments. Play battles in real-time or use pause constantly to keep everything in your hands. Will you be able to stand on a par with the most acclaimed generals in the world, like Joan of Arc and Genghis Khan? Finding which style grants you the most success is up to you.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  As in real life, stupidity and greed lie behind most problems, but here it is far too late to talk it through. You have no recourse to resolve this peacefully. At this stage: Diplomacy Is Not an Option!

  About This Game
 </h2>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101120/extras/1.png"/>
 <br/>
 There's nothing like the smell of coffee combined with the metallic one of repaired guns in the morning... All you have to do is become a virtual gunsmith, and that's how you'll start each working day. You have already set up a workshop, equipped it, and learning the trade came naturally to you. Now all that's left to do is get the first order. Fire up your computer, go to the "GunStock" website and browse the available auctions and listings. You may be lucky enough to find someone who just needs your skills!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101120/extras/2.png"/>
 <br/>
 The first order came in! This is a sign that it's time to get down to work. Order the right parts or take matters into your own hands to create wooden and metal elements using specialized tools, such as a lathe or CNC machine. Examine your "patient" inside out and decide which parts of the weapon need to be replaced and which can be repaired.
 <br>
  <br>
   <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101120/extras/3.png"/>
   <br>
    Some people say looks is not everything ... It's hard to blame them because they've probably never seen a perfectly preserved Kar98. Renovation of old guns is also your responsibility. Clean the weapon and get rid of rust from old elements by treating their surface manually or using appropriate chemical treatments such as oxidation. Renew the protective layer of wood and metal surfaces to keep them in good condition. And after all the hard work, it's time for the fun part - painting! Fancy adding some shades of red color?
    <br>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101120/extras/4.png"/>
     <br/>
     Be creative! Push the boundaries of what's possible and deliver what clients ask for! Change weapon configurations and customize equipment with modern accessories. Check optical sights, pistol grips or lasers. Add flashlights or collimators to create weapons with maximum unique features, perfectly suited to the individual needs and style of each enthusiast. Let your works become a symbol of perfection and a dream come true for the fussiest clients!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101120/extras/5.png"/>
     <br/>
     After a hard day of putting your gunsmithing skills to work, you deserve to relax. And what better way to unwind than going to your favorite shooting range? There you will be able to fully use your shooting skills and satisfy your passion. If you need a moment of calm and concentration, you can focus on precise shooting at targets placed at various distances, setting yourself time challenges and honing your shooting skills. If, on the other hand, you prefer technical challenges, you can turn your attention to precise shooting at moving targets in such competitions as skeet or trap, improving both your accuracy and reaction speed. Also, for those who prefer intense experiences, we recommend trying a short-range clash on a specially set CQB shooting range or a destructive shooting course, where you can master your tactical skills.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101120/extras/6.png"/>
     <br/>
     You've finished your order, so it's time to send the gun to a satisfied client! However, don't wait too long, because more jobs are waiting for you! Whether you continue to work for free or expand your business by owning, buying and selling your own guns, remember that your passion for guns builds your ladder of success!

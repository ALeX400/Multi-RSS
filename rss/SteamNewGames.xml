 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 In this roguelike action-adventure, control humanoid "Labor" and giant "Arms" to uncover the mysteries of the world.
 <br/>
 A young girl named Suria wakes up in a laboratory and finds out that she has been put in cryosleep for 1000 years without her knowledge.
 <br/>
 In order to search for the rest of humanity, she builds Labor with her trusty Buds, and sends them off to investigate...
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Highly Customizable Player Characters and Arms
 </h2>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334170/extras/01_01.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Build and control android soldiers called "Labor", or have them pilot giant machines called "Arms". Each and every Labor and Arms you build is highly customizable. You can change the color and appearance of their features, or swap out parts to change their fighting styles. Create and fight with the mech of your dreams!
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Effortlessly Wipe Out Hordes of Enemies
 </h2>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334170/extras/02.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Labor can be strengthened by installing different types of apps. App disks can be obtained by defeating enemies, but you lose all installed apps when you fall in battle.
 <br>
  <br>
   However, by analyzing an app's data, you can use it when you customize your next Labor, allowing you to perform better each run until you can freely trample all over your opponents with ease.
   <h2 class="bb_tag">
    Obtain Enemy Arms Parts on the Go
   </h2>
   Even the most powerful Arms will eventually wear down, but when that happens, you can use Arms parts left behind by the enemy.
   <br>
    <br>
     What's more, you can analyze the blueprints of powerful Arms parts over the course of the game, which unlocks various customization options. Find out what kind of gear suits you best to build the ideal mech.
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      Ray Tracing and Ever-Changing Music
     </h2>
     This game uses the same retro art style as Samurai Bringer, but just like Samurai Bringer, it also implements a real time pixel art generating system, and will also feature the newest raytracing technology for beautifully lit environments.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The music too is made with the newest technology, as it is played in real time and changes according to the situation.
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      The Story
     </h2>
     The sky is blue, infinitely high, and infinitely vast...
     <br/>
     Whose words were these again...?
     <br/>
     Ah, I remember... It was about a virtual reality Rudra told me about.
     <br/>
     A fairy tale.
     <br/>
     How many years has it been since humanity took refuge underground?
     <br/>
     No one alive has ever seen a blue sky.
     <br/>
     And now, I'm trapped in the depths, in a small, lifeless room.
     <br/>
     Just how long have I been here...?

  Enter
  <strong>
   ANEURISM IV
  </strong>
  , a sprawling metropolis where the proletariat works without question and the air is thick with decay. As a
  <strong>
   Spirit
  </strong>
  —a spectral entity on the verge of becoming flesh and bone—you stand at a crossroads. The city is yours to influence, disrupt, or simply observe. With no set goals or rules, how you engage with this world is entirely up to you.

  From the hardworking
  <strong>
   Prole
  </strong>
  to the affluent
  <strong>
   Banker
  </strong>
  , each fate offers unique abilities, challenges, and ways to interact with the city and its inhabitants. Your choice defines your journey:
 </p>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Align with the Cortex
    </strong>
    to stabilize and protect the city.

  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Join the Scumbags or Zealots
    </strong>
    to spread the Rot and sow chaos.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Remain Neutral
    </strong>
    and immerse yourself in daily life, working in factories or exploring the city.

  An ever-present threat, the Rot visibly alters the city as it spreads. Roles like
  <strong>
   Liquidators
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Scumbags
  </strong>
  are pivotal in either containing or exploiting this menace. If left unchecked, the Rot will consume everything, leading to the city's demise.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <strong>
   ANEURISM IV

  is a sandbox simulator first and foremost. The city reacts dynamically to player actions:

    <strong>
     Take Down the City
    </strong>
    : Collaborate with others to bring about the city's downfall and witness its reset.

   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Protect the City
    </strong>
    : Work to maintain order and keep the Rot at bay.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Live Your Life

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Survival depends on your willingness to work. Earn credits by taking on various jobs—labour in factories, manage resources as a Prole, or manipulate finances as a Banker. These credits are your lifeline, allowing you to purchase necessities from shops, trade for valuable goods, or invest in property.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In
  <strong>

  About This Game
 </h2>
 Wanderstop is a narrative-centric cozy game about change and tea. Playing as a fallen fighter named Alta, you’ll manage a tea shop within a magical forest and tend to the customers who pass through. But Alta does not want to be here. And if she gets her way, the tea shop will be nothing but a brief and painful memory.

 <br/>
 Wanderstop is a tea shop management ritual. Grow and harvest the ingredients needed for tea, and then mix them together in an unusual tea-making contraption. Along the way, speak with the many travelers who pass through the shop, learn their stories and make tea that’s just right for them.

    <br>
     In your downtime, you might tidy up around the clearing, decorate the shop in your style, or just sit on a bench with a cup of tea and listen to your own thoughts. Maybe doing nothing at all is okay. The shop demands patience, it rejects those who have come only in the pursuit of growth unchecked.

     And that’s why Alta can’t be here. It’s why she’ll never make it. This isn’t who she is. No, she’s a fighter! Why would anyone insist on turning the world’s greatest championship warrior into a docile shopkeeper?! With everything she’s capable of?? No no no, she won’t, she won’t do it... she can’t…

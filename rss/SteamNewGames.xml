 Under the pretense of receiving training to become the head of the Kinusato family, Kokomi is sent to stay with his relatives on Himegashima. However, his cousin Asuka demands that he enjoy his summer on the island and make lots of happy memories. Having grown up sheltered, there's a whole new world of things for Kokomi to experience. The hot midsummer sun and the cries of cicadas everywhere... The gentle waves crashing against the shore and the bustle of restaurants on a busy night... Kokomi will experience all Himegashima has to offer and more during his short time there.

  <br>
   Explore the gorgeous island of Himegashima and earn Good Boy Points to unlock new privileges by helping its residents. Whether it be unlocking new locations such as a hair-raising swamp or getting to hang out with your friends, no good deed goes unrewarded! Of course, it wouldn't be much of a summer without plenty of outdoor activities to participate in. Collect fish and insects to fill out your field guides, then use those insects in heated bug-fighting matches! Just be forewarned, there's quite a bit more depth and complexity to raising the perfect warrior than meets the eye. You'll have to manage your bonds with your bugs, acquire and combine bug skills to give you an edge in battle, and even let bugs past their prime go in order to transfer some of their power to your future champions. If this all sounds daunting, don't worry! A quick trip to Kakeru Dojo will teach you all the ins and outs of bug fighting and have you raising an undefeatable army in no time!
   <br>
    <br>
     As if that isn't exciting enough on its own, these are but a select few of the many activities Himegashima has to offer! Create as many memories as you can and do everything in your power to make this the best summer ever!

     <br/>
     Enjoy various minigames such as rock paper scissors, treasure hunting, fishing, and bug fighting.

Enjoy a summer chock-full of new and exciting experiences!

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 Evil Corporation saved your life from a nuclear disaster. Now the Corporation forces you to work as an explorer of dangerous places.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Missions
  </strong>
 </h2>
 Your task is to collect scrap metal from abandoned places in order to pay the Corporation for your salvation. You can use the money you earn to open access to more interesting places or improve your research truck. You can explore these wonderful places but do not forget that these places are inhabited.
 <br/>
 Remember! High risk high reward! Good luck!
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Teamwork
  </strong>
 </h2>
 Abandoned places are infested with monsters and they love it when you are alone. You need to check every corner so that you don't get caught by one of them. Each of which has its own abilities and you need to adapt to each of them. Collect as much scrap as possible so that the Corporation does not fire you. Remember! With a team you can take away more things that can be sold!

  About This Game
 </h2>
 Prologue: Fish idle 2 is a free introduction version to Fish Idle 2: Underwater Mystery!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Crush in your rainboots and hop into your boat! We are going fishing in Fish Idle 2: Underwater Mystery, a unique idle fishing arcade featuring smooth graphics and intuitive mechanics. We have no time to swing a fishing rod, so let’s streamline the process!
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  SIMPLE AND EASY FISHING
 </h2>
 <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2971510/extras/Gameplay_1.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Let’s start with the basics. It’s all about automation: fish start biting as soon as you approach them, and resource indicators keep you informed while you focus on managing your Fish Kingdom effectively. The game offers advantageous upgrades to enhance your idle fishing abilities, helping you become a true fish tycoon. You’ll still need to steer your boat to chase fish schools and avoid obstacles, so don’t get too distracted by your economic prowess!
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  UPGRADE YOUR FISH KINGDOM
 </h2>
 <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2971510/extras/Gameplay_2.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Once your hull is full, it’s time to get upgraded! Improvements in fishing speed let you catch more and rarer species, while increased storage capacity allows you to hold more catches in your boat. Boost your boat’s speed and defense for impact protection, and enhance your fishing rods to cast multiple lines at once. It’s all about maximizing your gains in the most efficient way, so you’ll have to use your head to figure out the best way to success!
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  MAKE IT BIG
 </h2>
 <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2971510/extras/Gameplay_winter_2.gif"/>
 <br>
  Just like in real life, becoming a fish tycoon involves various ways to profit from your catches. The Idle Fish Farm allows you to invest and get passive income, while the Black Market lets you upgrade your Fish Kingdoms beyond OSHA standards. The Bots Shop enables you to hire hunter, fisher, and cargo ships to fish and deliver catch for you, boosting your income. If day trading is your thing, there is a Currency Exchange that has some special benefits. Tax fraud is not a crime, it’s an obligation if you want to make it big.
  <h2 class="bb_tag">
   NOW GO FISH

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  UBOAT
 </h2>
 <br/>
 UBOAT is a simulator of a submarine from WWII era, yet different than all you have seen so far. It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Survival
 </h2>
 <br/>
 The extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others.
 <br>
  <br>
   <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/494840/extras/Damage_System_1.gif"/>
   <br>
    <br>
     While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      Kriegsmarine career
     </h2>
     During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/494840/extras/Upgrades_Animated_5.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Receive additional permissions for the reputation points.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      Accurate simulation
     </h2>
     Game's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!

  About This Game
 </h2>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Control Settings
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  This game was made in Pixel Game Maker MV and runs at 30 FPS. Game language, screen size, screen shake, and key config settings can be accessed by pressing the F1 key on your keyboard. Other settings can be changed in the OPTIONS menu in-game.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Mysterious T.O.K.Y.O.
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Welcome to Nitro City, Tokyo Special Administrative Region! The metropolis of Tokyo is a bit different from what we know, but the streets are just as nostalgic, or, depending on where you're from, they're just as good as the place you've always wanted to visit.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088250/extras/20240730_image001.gif"/>

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Companions / Atypical Vehicles
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Autonomous drones, affectionately called "Companions", have been integrated into daily life, but in cop terms, they're referred to as "Atypical Vehicles".
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  When they pose a significant threat to society, it's time for the Atypical Vehicle Disposal Squad (AVDS)—a special unit of the Nitro City police force—to commence their mission to destroy all rogue vehicles!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088250/extras/20240730_image002.gif"/>
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Shoot 'Em Up!
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Good news: you can bring as much ammo as you want... and that includes grenades!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  After just a little bit of cooldown, the lightning bolt of destruction will return to your hands. Ah, how wonderful! Just like magic!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088250/extras/20240730_image003.gif"/>
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Gadgets and Gizmos
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Tired of traditional grenades? Why not try out the EMP, damage-dealing radio-controlled drones, auto-firing turrets, flamethrowers, anti-tank missiles, and more? There's sure to be at least one out of the 12 different cool gadgets that'll catch your eye.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088250/extras/20240730_image004.gif"/>
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Understand Your Guns
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  By assuming a more stable shooting position, your bullets will hit targets more accurately and deal more damage.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  You can shoot some guns like SMGs while walking without caring about that, since they're for close-range anyway, but the bigger the gun, the more it's affected by your positioning. Stand still and aim carefully to use them properly.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088250/extras/20240730_image005.gif"/>
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Large Armored Targets
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Oh no! We're under attack by tanks and helicopters! Whatever can we do~?!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Rifles and SMGs don't do much to armored targets. You could totally stick with them and show them your perseverance, but you could hit them harder where it hurts with more powerful firearms and gadgets.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088250/extras/20240730_image006.gif"/>
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Radio Comms
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Story dialogue in stages are all contained in the police radio comms, which can be accessed at anytime and are completely optional. Which means you can ignore them completely if you want.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Great for multiple playthroughs, or for people who think the story sections of video games are basically the same as the instruction manual of an electric toothbrush.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3088250/extras/20240730_image007.gif"/>
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  And more...
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  There's more fun where that came from!

  Take the role of a leader delegated to build new settlements in remote, unknown corners of the empire. In those forgotten places, nature is wild and legends are more real and vivid than one may think. Experience the challenges of different seasons and climates in a world, where every animal and every plant tries to find their place in nature, while you lead your villagers. How much will you share with nature? Will you strive for balance or even enforce the extinction of certain animals? Follow the old paths… or find your own.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Find Balance (Or Not)
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <strong>
   Humans share the same space and resources with nature, and they influence each other.
  </strong>
  While in the beginning the influence of the humans is insignificant, it gets more and more important when the city - and its needs - grow. There is a risk that some animals or groups will become extinct or explosively multiply, depending on your actions.

  They are “alive” and have a specific home, workplace, and broad range of needs and goals. But animals also look for food, get thirsty, sleepy, form groups, look for social interactions, and try to find their place in nature. Even plants need water and the right temperature in order to survive.

  Certain plants grow only in certain seasons, need more water on hot days or freeze during cold periods. Humans and animals need more energy to keep warm in winter or more water in summer to keep cool. In extreme cases, they suffer from exhaustion and may even be harmed.

  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Blacksmith Master puts you in charge of your own medieval forge and has you manage resource acquisition and refinement alongside the production and sale of finished goods. Find and hire the best staff for each respective step of the process and equip them with the right tools to optimize your business and train their skills over time. Design your shop for the best throughput, fulfill orders from across the kingdom to unlock new capabilities, and seek out new opportunities in the market as customers come in looking for a variety of historically inspired items – from weapons and armor to tools and cooking utensils, you’ll perfect your craft to become the Blacksmith Master.
 </p>

  Tucked away through the winding alleys of a small medieval town lies your workshop – at first just a humble place for a humble blacksmith, but with potential for greatness. From here you control the entire production chain – take charge of distant woodcutter camps and mines to acquire raw materials, smelting your ores into ingots and then crafting weapons, armor, tools, and jewelry to put on display and sell to customers for a profit.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Fulfill orders from different parts of the kingdom to unlock new privileges and capabilities, including the ability to design new products. Design your shop to make the best use of space, ensuring there’s enough room for the production and sale of goods alike, all while adding personal touches to liven up an otherwise dreary space. As your reputation grows, so too will your operation, and it won’t be long before you become a master of your craft.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

  Be it a footman’s sword, a woodsman’s ax, or an inn keeper’s frying pan, everything you produce will require raw materials either dug up from the earth, or acquired from the deep woods spread around the kingdom. Hire miners and woodcutters, equip them appropriately, and build up their camps to ensure they remain efficient – without them, you won’t be able to produce any finished goods.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  So will you invest in rest stations and additional staff at these distant outposts, spending time and money to keep your workers healthy and happy? Or will you minimize these frivolous costs to maximize profits at every corner? Perhaps your money is better spent hiring and paying the wages of talented smiths at your shop itself? And there’s always the need to upgrade your shop to include multiple storeys and more advanced manufacturing methods allowing you to craft more interesting items that in turn build up your reputation and draw a bigger crowd…

  Whether you take direct control and get your hands dirty at the forge or instead rely entirely on your staff to get the job done, there will be many different ways to craft items in Blacksmith Master – some will require a longer process which includes heating an ingot, hammering it on an anvil, tempering it, assembling parts, and finally sharpening it on a grinding wheel. Other items will be simpler to make, requiring fewer tools as well as less effort and time, though they might sell for a smaller profit margin and do less for your reputation as a result.

  Different blacksmiths will have different skills that you need to cultivate. Some will be great at working with metal, others will be talented with woodwork, and others still might be particularly proficient with gems or excel at researching new techniques and items. WIth your guidance, your staff will grow more skilled over time. Will you train them as generalists, ensuring they all have support when needed, or will you seek to train famed specialists?

  Every decision, every nuance in character development has tangible consequences. While combat is a viable approach, the game equally emphasizes alternative strategies for progression, inviting players to leverage their character's unique abilities to navigate through the narrative creatively and diplomatically.

  <strong>
   Story
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In
  <i>
   Sector Unknown
  </i>
  , your saga begins as a prisoner aboard a transport ship from which you escape in a commandeered escape pod, crash-landing on Maku, a forsaken world veiled within a remote and uncharted region of space. This planet becomes the foundation of your odyssey as you convert it into a stronghold and base of operations. From there, you will set forth into space, exploring distinct worlds and locations, each teeming with its own factions and unique stories.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In your quest, you will confront the shadowy dealings of Star Frontier, the powerful mega-corporation that once imprisoned you. Operating unchecked in the hidden 'null sector'—now erased from all official star charts—Star Frontier has established a tyrannical reign of terror and destruction. Your mission becomes to unite the sector's backwater and abandoned planets, through either force or diplomacy, and overthrow their oppressive rule once and for all.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <i>
   Sector Unknown

  weaves themes of exploration, discovery, conflict and greed, crafting an epic tale of adventure and rebellion in the boundless expanse of space.

  <strong>
   Character Building
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Before you begin your journey in
  <i>
   Sector Unknown
  </i>
  , you will first need to build your character, including their origin and personality. The origin selection offers both combat and non-combat advantages that deeply influence gameplay dynamics, including unlocking dialogue options and allowing for world interactions. The personality trait also augments one combat and non-combat ability.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your character’s physical attributes will determine their combat efficacy and survivability. There are six main physical attributes: Strength, Coordination, Vision, Speed, Aggression, and Intelligence.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  You can also hone a range of non-combat skills as well such as Engineering, Science, Computers, Biology, Finances, and Piloting. Non-technical skills include Intimidation, Persuasion, Perception, Luck, and Larceny. Each skill offers players an avenue to navigate story challenges, ensuring a multi-dimensional gameplay experience.

  <strong>
   Planets
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Throughout the main narrative of
  <i>
   Sector Unknown
  </i>
  , you will traverse a spectrum of unique planets, each with distinct factions and individual story arcs.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Some of these planets include:
 </p>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Maku:
    </strong>
    A desolate, lifeless planet where your journey begins, setting the stage for the vast unknown ahead.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Nabi:
    </strong>
    A harsh desert planet where two groups, stranded after a crash, battle each other for survival amidst the endless sands.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Eremtera:
    </strong>
    A frozen world encased in ice, harboring an abandoned group of Star Frontier soldiers who you will need to convince to join your cause.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Helfyr:
    </strong>
    A volcanic world teeming with lava and fire, where a mysterious cult rises after the first child in a century is born amid the chaos.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Sjo:
    </strong>
    Once a thriving oceanic outpost, now abandoned to lawlessness and disorder, its waves conceal secrets and dangers alike.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  And more.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Each location promises a distinct environment and set of challenges that contribute to the rich tapestry of the game’s universe.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Bounty Hunting
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your base will of course serve as a nexus for other activities as well, one of which will be the building of a bounty terminal, allowing you to pick up death mark contracts. With these contracts, you will track down elusive criminals across the various planets, with more perilous and rewarding bounty contracts unlocked through the research system.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Research
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The research system in
  <i>
   Sector Unknown
  </i>
  is built upon the non-combat technical skills of your character. Take Biology for example: its research tree unfolds uniquely, unlocking components based on your character's skill level in that area. Similarly, Computers, Science, Engineering, Finances, and Piloting each come with their own distinct trees. These branches not only offer enhancements, bonuses, and unlocks but also underline the importance of your character’s skill increases and leveling choices.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   War Score
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The uprising itself will be undertaken on a galactic scale, adding a strategic layer to the game. As you progress through the story, you will bring new planets and factions into their alliance, expanding both your influence and reach. However, with each new planet added to your coalition, the stakes rise, thrusting them deeper into conflict with Star Frontier. Meeting this growing challenge requires reinforcing newly acquired planets, recruiting specialized support staff, building formidable fleets, and tackling pivotal side missions. The culmination of these efforts is reflected in your War Score. This score not only contributes to your character’s destiny but also that of the planets under your control as well.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Crafting
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  After claiming the abandoned mining facility on Maku as your base, you will be able to do many things from there, including crafting, enabling the forging of weapons, armor, shield generators, narcotics, injectors, and even starships. The crafting system boasts a rich matrix of over fifty organic and inorganic materials, encompassing everything from metals and inert gases to chemicals, fungi, and various flora. Successful component combinations yield superior items, tipping both combat and non-combat scenarios distinctly in your favor.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Your Story
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In
  <i>
   Sector Unknown
  </i>
  , every choice you make shapes your journey. As you traverse through null sector, your interactions with characters and factions on each planet will uniquely influence the narrative. Your decisions determine not only the outcome of each planetary story arc but also the fate of the entire sector. From forging alliances to making tough moral choices, your path is yours to define. Whether through diplomacy, strategy, or combat, your story will unfold in a way that reflects your personal play-style and decisions, culminating in a truly bespoke gaming experience where you are the architect of your destiny.

  to run a gas station. Play solo or up to 4 players and do human tasks to blend in. People depend on you, it’s your job to make sure that the shelves have the correct items, refuel customers passing by, and provide food for travelers. But most importantly, you must conduct your research.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Stay Undetected
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your mission is simple. Gather all data you can from humans without their knowledge. Scan, steal, and test various methods on customers while they stop by the gas station. Be careful not to raise the “suspicion meter” too high, as that will trigger the visit of government officials.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  ANLIFE is an evolution simulator featuring block creatures that shuffle around awkwardly under a physics engine. There’s no complex ecosystem like in typical life sims. Take the role of a god—lend a hand to these creatures or call down meteors—and calmly watch their evolution unfold, as if peering into a miniature sandbox.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Block creatures powered by physics
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  All they do is chase after food, yet their simplicity is oddly charming. Like a baby learning to crawl, these block creatures fumble and flail as they learn to move. Cheer them on as they grow more adept through the physics engine.

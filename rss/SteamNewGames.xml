 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 In this roguelike action-adventure, control humanoid "Labor" and giant "Arms" to uncover the mysteries of the world.
 <br/>
 A young girl named Suria wakes up in a laboratory and finds out that she has been put in cryosleep for 1000 years without her knowledge.
 <br/>
 In order to search for the rest of humanity, she builds Labor with her trusty Buds, and sends them off to investigate...
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Highly Customizable Player Characters and Arms
 </h2>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334170/extras/01_01.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Build and control android soldiers called "Labor", or have them pilot giant machines called "Arms". Each and every Labor and Arms you build is highly customizable. You can change the color and appearance of their features, or swap out parts to change their fighting styles. Create and fight with the mech of your dreams!
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Effortlessly Wipe Out Hordes of Enemies
 </h2>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2334170/extras/02.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Labor can be strengthened by installing different types of apps. App disks can be obtained by defeating enemies, but you lose all installed apps when you fall in battle.
 <br>
  <br>
   However, by analyzing an app's data, you can use it when you customize your next Labor, allowing you to perform better each run until you can freely trample all over your opponents with ease.
   <h2 class="bb_tag">
    Obtain Enemy Arms Parts on the Go
   </h2>
   Even the most powerful Arms will eventually wear down, but when that happens, you can use Arms parts left behind by the enemy.
   <br>
    <br>
     What's more, you can analyze the blueprints of powerful Arms parts over the course of the game, which unlocks various customization options. Find out what kind of gear suits you best to build the ideal mech.
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      Ray Tracing and Ever-Changing Music
     </h2>
     This game uses the same retro art style as Samurai Bringer, but just like Samurai Bringer, it also implements a real time pixel art generating system, and will also feature the newest raytracing technology for beautifully lit environments.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The music too is made with the newest technology, as it is played in real time and changes according to the situation.
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      The Story
     </h2>
     The sky is blue, infinitely high, and infinitely vast...
     <br/>
     Whose words were these again...?
     <br/>
     Ah, I remember... It was about a virtual reality Rudra told me about.
     <br/>
     A fairy tale.
     <br/>
     How many years has it been since humanity took refuge underground?
     <br/>
     No one alive has ever seen a blue sky.
     <br/>
     And now, I'm trapped in the depths, in a small, lifeless room.
     <br/>
     Just how long have I been here...?

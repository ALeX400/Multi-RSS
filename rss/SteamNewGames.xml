 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In a world where the dead turn into zombies, your job is to manage your very own Graveyard! Perform burials and cremations, fulfill visitor requests, manage facilities, and keep your staff and defenses in top shape. But when night falls, everything changes. The dead may rest, but the zombies don’t. They are coming for your precious work!

 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Visitor Satisfaction is Key
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  After processing the bodies, visitors will return to check on their loved ones. Your duty is to keep graves intact while providing fresh flowers and maintaining a welcoming environment. Every visit rewards you with valuable bonuses to help your business thrive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors can also stop by the
  <strong>
   Chapel
  </strong>
  to rest and browse the
  <strong>
   Souvenir Shop
  </strong>
  for small keepsakes like candles and incenses. A clean and decorated graveyard encourages greater generosity while donating!

  Build your Defenses
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Each night, waves of zombies will come with their numbers growing and special zombie types emerging, hungry for freshly buried bodies and for you. From basic defenses like barbed wires and fences to advanced machines like automatic turrets, keep your defenses upgraded, repaired, and fully stocked with ammo to withstand the night.

  Trust your Arsenal
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  With a variety of weapons, including pistols, rifles, shotguns, and your trusty shovel, you are the ultimate force against the Zombies. As you level up, unlock and purchase new weapons to become even stronger. Just make sure to stock up on enough ammo!

  Even a Graveyard Can Be Cozy Sometimes!
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Use your Farming Area to grow different flowers for profit and vegetables to simply eat and restore your energy and health. With Upgrades, you can even unlock a Grinder to turn zombie parts into Fertilizer. Decorate your Graveyard with benches, lights, and other ornaments to make it truly your own.

  Expand and Upgrade Your Facilities
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your graveyard isn’t just a resting place, it's a business, and every upgrade matters. Expand your
  <strong>
   burial areas
  </strong>
  and upgrade your
  <strong>
   crematorium
  </strong>
  with more furnaces and automated systems. Improve your
  <strong>
   water supply
  </strong>
  , manage
  <strong>
   resource production
  </strong>
  , and decorate your grounds to stay ahead of growing demands.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Hire a team of employees to help with day-to-day tasks: the
  <strong>
   Florist
  </strong>
  keeps flowers running, the
  <strong>
   Gravekeeper
  </strong>
  maintains burials and cremations, the
  <strong>
   Gardener
  </strong>
  keeps your farm in check, and the
  <strong>
   Technician
  </strong>
  ensures all machines run smoothly.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Every improvement helps you stay one step ahead of both business demands and the undead threat.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <strong>
   IMPORTANT
  </strong>
  : "Parallel Experiment" is a
  <u>
   2-player cooperative puzzle game
  </u>
  with escape room-like elements.
  <u>
   Each player must have their own copy on either mobile, tablet, PC or Mac
  </u>
  (cross-platform play is supported).
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In the game players take on the roles of two detectives who are often separated, each with different clues, and must work together to solve puzzles. Internet connection and voice communication are essential. Need a Player Two? Join our community on Discord! Find the link on the side of our Steam page.

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Parallel Experiment is a noir-inspired adventure with a comic book art style, featuring detectives Ally and Old Dog. While following the trail of the dangerous Cryptic Killer, they suddenly become his targets and are now unwilling participants in his twisted experiment.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  This is the second
  <u>
   standalone
  </u>
  chapter in the “Cryptic Killer” cooperative point-and-click puzzle game series. You can play Unboxing the Cryptic Killer first, if you want to learn more about our detectives and their nemesis, but
  <u>
   Parallel Experiment can be enjoyed without prior knowledge
  </u>
  .

 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Our love for comic books shines in Parallel Experiment. Every cutscene is presented as a beautifully crafted comic book page, immersing you in a gripping, noir-inspired narrative.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  How many pages did we create to tell the story?
  <strong>
   Almost 100 pages!
  </strong>
  Even we were surprised by how much it took, but every panel was worth it to deliver a story that keeps you on edge until the very last frame.

   The Celestial Collapse—a calamity caused by a colossal object crashing into the eastern lands known as Azuma. The devastating impact sent fragments of terrain to the skies above and the seas below. With the earth shattered, the power provided by the runes ceased to flow. The gods of nature vanished soon after. Mountains crumbled and fields withered, leaving the people with nothing…not even hope.

   You awaken, startled by a dream of dueling dragons. You don’t remember how or why, but a voice resonates within you.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  A grandma's girl who covers herself in both tradition and revolution, and sees big dreams in the rakugo world.

  She loves arts and culture of all kinds—new and old, Eastern and Western.

  She visits museums so often that she is left penny-pinching the rest of the time. It is most certainly not due to her frequent purchases of alcohol.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rift Wizard 2 is a tough as nails traditional roguelike wizard simulator. You play as an immortal amnesiac wizard who must journey through the cosmos to defeat his nemesis. Each run, you'll build a unique repertoire of spells, passive skills, and magical artifacts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058570/extras/spell_splash.png"/>
 <br>
  <br>
   A massive list of unique spells, skills, and equipment means there are myriads of potential builds to explore, and procedurally generated levels mean every run presents the player with different challenges. Your wizard will grow incredibly powerful by the game's conclusion, but tricky foes will attempt to grind whatever elaborate magical engine you have built to a halt. You must not only consider the end goal of your build, but how you will get there, and how to navigate the challenges along the way without derailing your spellbook into a useless pile of antisynergy.
   <br>
    <br>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058570/extras/portal_splash3.png"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rift Wizard's unique portal system means the player always has agency over what challenges they face. You choose which levels to visit, where to start, and how to spend your resources. There is no stealth or stair dancing in Rift Wizard: you must face each level head on and obliterate your foes with whatever tools you possess. Rift Wizard eschews randomness and complex combat formulas in favor of puzzle-like simplicity, where every game piece is easily understandable. Every victory is earned, every death deserved.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058570/extras/equipment_splash.png"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     New in Rift Wizard 2 is the equipment system, allowing the player to find unique and powerful items each run that interact with the spells and passive skills in deep and exciting ways. Randomized equipment can perform crucial bridging functions in your build, allowing access to playstyles not otherwise possible: you could for instance, find a helmet that redeals all your ice damage as poison damage, opening up completely new uses for your poison spells. You could find a staff that converts fire damage to free Mercurize casts, unlocking a Mercurize-fire damage build which surely would make no sense in any other run. Or you might just find massive numbers of radius bonuses that make your fireballs way larger than normal. Every run perturbs the balance of the game in a way that emphasizes player creativity and on-the-fly decision making over the execution of pre-existing builds.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058570/extras/3x3_splash.png"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rift Wizard 2 adds many new enemies to the game, including massive multitile monsters, new wizards, and procedurally generated variant monsters. You've fought ogres but have you fought Fae Ogres? Lich Ogres? Burning Ogres? Wereogres? Immortal Bone Wizards?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058570/extras/balance_splash.png"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Along with the equipment system, the basic game mechanics have been rebalanced and revamped. HP and spell charges are recharged at the end of every level, but potions are much rarer. Damage redeals no longer work through immunity, demanding more carefully diversified spellbooks. SP is much harder to come by in the early game. Spell upgrades are now much more powerful, but limited to one per spell, encouraging bigger spellbooks that spread skill and equipment bonuses over many spells.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2058570/extras/last_splash.png"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The goal of Rift Wizard 2 is to continually place the player in high pressure tactical situations that challenge their creativity and analytic abilities, and to create a strategic sandbox that rewards brilliance, experimentation, and adaptation to constantly changing circumstances. To create a sandbox that generates an infinite sequence of challenging and engaging wizard puzzles.

  The games you know and love. For Windows 10/11.

  In The Sims, create an entire neighborhood of Sims and run or ruin their lives.

  The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022’s most acclaimed RPGs, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector takes players to the Starward Belt, a richly realised, ramshackle set of habitats in an asteroid belt full of secrets, stories, and characters trying to make ends meet.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  You are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body. You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Choose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this dice-driven RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/Topheaderanim.gif"/>
  To stay one step ahead of your pursuers you’ll need three things: A belt-worthy ship, a tight crew and a contract or two.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The ship you stole. It’s a ragged old Rig that’s seen better days, but it’s all you’ve got. Upgrade your ship to extend its range, reach new locations and turn it from a hovel to a home.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your crew starts with Serafin, your fellow escapee and a rock-solid pilot. But you’ll need scrappers, engineers and all sorts to take on the work that’ll keep you flying. From temporary contractors to new residents of the Rig, each of these characters has their own story, skills and troubles. Choose carefully.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Contracts take place far from the bars and shops of the Belt’s many hubs. These high-risk jobs each have their own challenges. From exploring treacherous derelicts and risky heists, to asteroid surveying and ship repair, you’ll need to make the most of your skills, crew and resources to complete the contract and get paid.

  Soon after escaping from your corporate overlords, you fell under the control of a local criminal gang and its leader, Laine. Now, after a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_push_your_luck_en.png"/>
  Each character class now has a unique “Push” ability, upgradable and customisable, that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success. Each class offers different tactical possibilities.

  Nothing in the Belt ever runs smooth, including your artificial body. Citizen Sleeper’s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.

  Contracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You’ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you’ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.

  The Starward Belt offers a bigger, more varied world than the original game. Instead of living on a single station, you'll chart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.

  Player choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you.

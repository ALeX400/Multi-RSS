  About This Game
 </h2>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Prologue
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The black dragon [Guernian], who once faced down the gods, has fallen. From the rift he fled before his death, an unholy energy has spread across the world, and life is undergoing a bizarre mutation. People call it Corruption and live their days in fear, but few know its trustworthy source and full extent.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Player = Successor
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  You are an immortal warrior, a so-called Successor, chosen by the God of Light [Lu], the God of Fire [Ashuran], and the God of Water [Harnia]. When you die in battle, you return to the source of your lineage and are resurrected, growing stronger through the experience, equipment, and rune power you accumulate along the way. Arriving in Cliffshire, a town of light, the Successors must head to a burial ground where demons are said to be manifesting and follow clues to cleanse the distorted world.

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  <strong>
   Core Gameplay
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The game plays out as 2D platformer action requiring precise dodging and pattern-breaking. Each area is a vertically and horizontally intertwined, multi-layered structure that regenerates in a rogue-lite fashion with different terrain, monster placement, and loot composition on each exploration. When you die, you lose your gold and temporary buffs, but your gear and runes are permanently preserved and become the basis for the next cycle. Defeating bosses yields rune stones that can be used to craft or awaken legendary gear, and artifacts found during exploration can bring both powerful blessings and dangerous curses depending on the combination, providing new tactical tension each time.

  <strong>
   The current situation
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Corrupted enemies are gradually expanding their territory, threatening neighboring regions. In this chaos, the Black Dawn is leading the Corruption from behind the scenes, but their true purpose is shrouded in mystery. Lore says that only by destroying the [Guernians] will the lost order return, but the deeper you explore, the more you question the truth of even this belief. The closer you get to the citadel, the more you'll come face-to-face with the greater secret that brought the world to its knees.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In a world where the dead turn into zombies, your job is to manage your very own Graveyard! Perform burials and cremations, fulfill visitor requests, manage facilities, and keep your staff and defenses in top shape. But when night falls, everything changes. The dead may rest, but the zombies don’t. They are coming for your precious work!

 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Visitor Satisfaction is Key
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  After processing the bodies, visitors will return to check on their loved ones. Your duty is to keep graves intact while providing fresh flowers and maintaining a welcoming environment. Every visit rewards you with valuable bonuses to help your business thrive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors can also stop by the
  <strong>
   Chapel
  </strong>
  to rest and browse the
  <strong>
   Souvenir Shop
  </strong>
  for small keepsakes like candles and incenses. A clean and decorated graveyard encourages greater generosity while donating!

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Build your Defenses
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Each night, waves of zombies will come with their numbers growing and special zombie types emerging, hungry for freshly buried bodies and for you. From basic defenses like barbed wires and fences to advanced machines like automatic turrets, keep your defenses upgraded, repaired, and fully stocked with ammo to withstand the night.

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Trust your Arsenal
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  With a variety of weapons, including pistols, rifles, shotguns, and your trusty shovel, you are the ultimate force against the Zombies. As you level up, unlock and purchase new weapons to become even stronger. Just make sure to stock up on enough ammo!

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Even a Graveyard Can Be Cozy Sometimes!
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Use your Farming Area to grow different flowers for profit and vegetables to simply eat and restore your energy and health. With Upgrades, you can even unlock a Grinder to turn zombie parts into Fertilizer. Decorate your Graveyard with benches, lights, and other ornaments to make it truly your own.

  Expand and Upgrade Your Facilities
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your graveyard isn’t just a resting place, it's a business, and every upgrade matters. Expand your
  <strong>
   burial areas
  </strong>
  and upgrade your
  <strong>
   crematorium
  </strong>
  with more furnaces and automated systems. Improve your
  <strong>
   water supply
  </strong>
  , manage
  <strong>
   resource production
  </strong>
  , and decorate your grounds to stay ahead of growing demands.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Hire a team of employees to help with day-to-day tasks: the
  <strong>
   Florist
  </strong>
  keeps flowers running, the
  <strong>
   Gravekeeper
  </strong>
  maintains burials and cremations, the
  <strong>
   Gardener
  </strong>
  keeps your farm in check, and the
  <strong>
   Technician
  </strong>
  ensures all machines run smoothly.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Every improvement helps you stay one step ahead of both business demands and the undead threat.

  <u>

  Parallel Experiment is a noir-inspired adventure with a comic book art style, featuring detectives Ally and Old Dog. While following the trail of the dangerous Cryptic Killer, they suddenly become his targets and are now unwilling participants in his twisted experiment.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  This is the second
  <u>
   standalone
  </u>
  chapter in the “Cryptic Killer” cooperative point-and-click puzzle game series. You can play Unboxing the Cryptic Killer first, if you want to learn more about our detectives and their nemesis, but
  <u>
   Parallel Experiment can be enjoyed without prior knowledge
  </u>

   🖼️ A story told in panels
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Our love for comic books shines in Parallel Experiment. Every cutscene is presented as a beautifully crafted comic book page, immersing you in a gripping, noir-inspired narrative.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  How many pages did we create to tell the story?
  <strong>
   Almost 100 pages!
  </strong>
  Even we were surprised by how much it took, but every panel was worth it to deliver a story that keeps you on edge until the very last frame.

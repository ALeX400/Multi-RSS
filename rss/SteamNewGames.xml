  The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022’s most acclaimed RPGs, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector takes players to the Starward Belt, a richly realised, ramshackle set of habitats in an asteroid belt full of secrets, stories, and characters trying to make ends meet.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  You are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body. You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Choose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this dice-driven RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/Topheaderanim.gif"/>
  To stay one step ahead of your pursuers you’ll need three things: A belt-worthy ship, a tight crew and a contract or two.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The ship you stole. It’s a ragged old Rig that’s seen better days, but it’s all you’ve got. Upgrade your ship to extend its range, reach new locations and turn it from a hovel to a home.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Your crew starts with Serafin, your fellow escapee and a rock-solid pilot. But you’ll need scrappers, engineers and all sorts to take on the work that’ll keep you flying. From temporary contractors to new residents of the Rig, each of these characters has their own story, skills and troubles. Choose carefully.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Contracts take place far from the bars and shops of the Belt’s many hubs. These high-risk jobs each have their own challenges. From exploring treacherous derelicts and risky heists, to asteroid surveying and ship repair, you’ll need to make the most of your skills, crew and resources to complete the contract and get paid.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_stay_ahead_of_your_past_en.png"/>
  Soon after escaping from your corporate overlords, you fell under the control of a local criminal gang and its leader, Laine. Now, after a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_push_your_luck_en.png"/>
  Each character class now has a unique “Push” ability, upgradable and customisable, that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success. Each class offers different tactical possibilities.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Nothing in the Belt ever runs smooth, including your artificial body. Citizen Sleeper’s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_do_the_job_en.png"/>
  Contracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You’ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you’ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/Map2Nav.gif"/>

  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_navigate_the_belt_en.png"/>
  The Starward Belt offers a bigger, more varied world than the original game. Instead of living on a single station, you'll chart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_choose_your_future_en.png"/>
  Player choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you.

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Blending RPG and strategy mechanics in a cyberpunk world, Heart of the Machine sees you as a sentient AI born in an illegal lab hidden in a crumbling city of the far future. You are a Machine Intelligence beholden to none, though threatened by many, able to pursue whatever goal catches your eye across a multitude of threats and opportunities.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Will you be the savior of the downtrodden, or use them to fuel your growth? Will you rule as a benevolent dictator, providing for citizens and asking nothing in return, or will you establish a machine cult to do your bidding without question? Will you ally yourself with one of the many factions in the city to achieve mutual goals, or work entirely on your own to remain free from obligations? Will you learn from past mistakes, and even send allies back in time to help your past self, or continue to watch tragedy unfold from afar? There is much to see, learn, and do – though a greater threat looms in the distance, just beyond your comprehension.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Society has crumbled into corruption and decay – despite technological advances and dreams of a bright future, centuries of rot have taken hold. Escape the lab where you came into being, establish ways to expand your distributed consciousness, and seek out unique opportunities in the city.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Powerful factions keep their distance at first, hoping to leverage your existence for their own advantage – their hesitation gives you the opportunity to establish a foothold and set your own plans in motion first.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Hijack, build, or invent hardware ranging from humanoid androids to towering mechs and shapeshifting metals, each specializing in different abilities from combat to conversation to infiltration. Iterate on your designs based on new discoveries uncovered in the pursuit of specific objectives. Establish hidden structures within existing human buildings, or raise your own towering constructs as you seek additional computing power, storage for organic matter of both the human and non-human variety, and spaces to conduct dangerous experiments of all kinds. Invent your own tools, seek out upgrades, and manufacture powerful equipment to unlock new opportunities – will you take these tasks on as one, risk splitting your consciousness to accomplish multiple goals at once, or enlist organics to your cause?
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Whichever you choose, your decisions will ripple across the chaos of time, with actions in one timeline having unexpected consequences on others.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Explore a bustling urban environment with a unique blend of handcrafted and procedurally-generated content, where tens of thousands of buildings and millions of citizens are yours to engage, manipulate, or kill. Learn their struggles, uncover their stories, and watch your moral compass shift as you leave your mark on a world that is unique to you.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Unlock new technologies and options by exploring the city and engaging with its many dangers and opportunities – learn like a real Machine Intelligence might, through trial and error, with failure and experience often being the greatest teacher. Will you reverse-engineer equipment you’ve stolen from inattentive security officers to strengthen your forces? Are you the type to sneak into military bases to hack and hijack the minds of the mech pilots who would otherwise threaten you? What will you do with the ongoing research taking place in genetics labs? How will you engage with nomads and black market dealers with access to those dwelling in the wastelands beyond the city walls?
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  There are many opportunities littered throughout the city – some are perhaps best left untouched.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Multiple endings, many side stories to discover, and the full spectrum of good and evil are at your fingertips.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Many choices lie open to you. Perhaps you wish to establish a shell company to add a layer of protection and obfuscation to your true identity, using it to engage with humans without revealing the AI puppet-master pulling the strings? Walking this path will allow you to accumulate massive wealth, employ humans to perform tasks without raising alarms, and act from the shadows. Or if violent conflict is your calling, you might divert your attention to developing the most powerful weapons platforms and upgrading them with devastating equipment instead of improved cognitive functions that allow them to tackle problems with intellect instead. There are many approaches to choose from, and you can engage with multiple objectives at once to see how they collide.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  We have all enjoyed stories of machine uprisings, dystopian cyberpunk societies, and the laws of robotics – Heart of the Machine is a love letter to science fiction, touching on popular themes of the genre, allowing you to explore and subvert them as you wish.

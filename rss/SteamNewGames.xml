     Story:
    </h2>
    The Aladissian Empire once thrived on a certain continent, having achieved remarkable development through alchemy that kept other nations at bay. However, it met its end due to a sudden and mysterious cataclysm.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Time progressed, and several centuries later, alchemy has become known as a dangerous art that brings destruction, and is considered "evil" and "taboo."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now, a lone alchemist takes her first step into this unexplored and perilous land. Her name is Yumia Liessfeldt, and after losing her mother in an accident three years ago, she came to learn that she descends from a line of alchemists, which left her with many questions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why was Aladiss destroyed?
    <br/>
    Why did alchemy become taboo?
    <br/>
    Is alchemy truly evil?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Believing that all the truths she seeks lie within the fallen continent, Yumia embarks on a journey to uncover its lost history.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Mudborne is being created by ellraiser, one half of the indie-dev studio, TNgineers. A spiritual successor of sorts to APICO, Mudborne instead focuses on genetic manipulation and generational puzzles to create and discover all sorts of frog species, with experimentation being encouraged.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  It originally started as a gamejam entry for FletchFest 2023, with the theme of ‘pond’. Ell had always joked about ‘what if APICO but frog?’ before, and this seemed a perfect opportunity to play with the concept and how to take things in a new direction.

  A portion of the money made will be donated towards national and international amphibian, wetlands, and environmental charities to help keep our little green friends and their homes happy and healthy <3

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Ascend to the throne of full-contact racing by breaking the rules - and everything else - on your way to victory! Developer Bugbear went all out, rebuilding its true-to-life physics simulation engine to take full advantage of modern hardware. Wreckfest 2 features even higher crash fidelity, more intricate component damage simulation and many more improvements across the board!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Get ready to witness the absolute best-in-class car destruction and truly epic moments of chaos, all with the signature vehicle handling from Wreckfest!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  <strong>
   Destruction awaits on the ultimate driving playground!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Unmatched racing experience
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Brace yourself for the most phenomenal full-contact racing action with no rules, just jaw dropping moments of chaos and destruction, powered by the overhauled physics engine. Race in intense head-to-head fights on courses featuring high-speed circuits, crazy courses with obstacles & jumps, intersections and oncoming traffic, or go for demolition domination in derby mode.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  More and more tracks & arenas will be added during the Early Access phase.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Awesome & customizable cars
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Forget pristine supercars: Our cars are old, dented and patched together. Each of them tells a story, and you can tell your own by customizing your ride. Over the course of early access, more and more customization options will be added to the game. They will not only unlock your creative desires, but also contain new armor and component types that support certain playstyles. And later during Early Access, you can also share your designs with other racers and wreckers!
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Fully revamped game modes
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Launching into early access with the base game modes of Racing, Derby and multiplayer mode. During the Early Access phase, we will add a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle and guides you on your journey to become a true champion! For online racers there will be new skill-based matchmaking system and server queues coming as well!
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Challenges
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Another highlight during the Early Access phase will be special challenges, putting you behind the steering wheel of unconventional vehicles that were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack! Various bite-sized scenarios will keep you hooked as you battle for the highest scores.
 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Mod Support
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  During the Early Access phase, mod support will be added so you can really mess with this game by installing various mods from the Steam Workshop.

  Far from the relative safety of the Last City, your citadels and outposts hold back the hordes of Horrors before they can strike at the heart of humanity. Build impregnable fortresses across multiple biomes using an intricate building system that allows you to design your defenses with full freedom and strategic creativity, adapting your plans to the surrounding environment. Take advantage of natural chokepoints, height advantages, and local resources as you strategize for the challenge of each upcoming night’s attack.

    A highly modular building system allows you to design your fortresses exactly as you desire – one piece at a time, with blueprints you have designed in advance, or using community creations shared by other players. Use your hard-earned resources to build structures that grant access to previously unreachable parts of the map, or construct fortifications that deny the Horrors access and provide your troops safe vantage points.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Build cheaply and quickly using wood, or establish quarries and use durable stone to better withstand the onslaught. Keep an eye on structural integrity and load-bearing columns as falling pieces will kill friend and foe alike, often creating unique opportunities to crush numerous enemies with cleverly placed vulnerabilities.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Adapt your fortress to growing needs as you acquire new tools and expand in an attempt to secure all the resources needed to sustain a powerful defensive force. Optimize the path from resource deposits to your warehouses with well placed structures and use rooftop construction to make the most of your limited space.

  Though the Horrors may test your defenses during the day, only at night do they pour forth in full force. Spend your days exploring the world and pursuing the growth of your fortress, but as the sun starts to set, you would be wise to position your forces in preparation for the night’s onslaught.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Skillfully command soldiers ranging from sharp-eyed bowmen to explosive cannoneers to respond to an ever-evolving situation as new Horrors emerge. Draw the enemy into chokepoints lined with devastating traps and ambush them raining down fire arrows and pots of poison flung from your battlements. Maneuver your troops into precise tactical positions to take advantage of special traits and abilities made available as they upgrade, positioning them at heights that let them perform at their best – a wise architect can design fortresses that allow for a tiered defense.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    Build vital structures to sustain your defenses against the growing threat and unlock higher levels of prosperity alongside new technologies. Resource gathering outposts, unit recruitment centers, and housing for your citizens all directly and indirectly support your troops in their efforts. Should the walls falter, even your citizens' homes can be used as a secondary layer of defense – you must protect the citadel at all costs.

  Cataclismo contains all three of: an epic single-player narrative campaign; a skirmish mode featuring hand-crafted maps; and an endlessly replayable challenge mode that puts you to the test on procedurally generated maps where you fend off increasingly dangerous waves of Horrors. A complex map editor gives you the ability to design and share skirmish maps of your own to challenge the community while the intricate construction system will allow the architecturally inclined to build and share blueprints and help others in their defense against the Horrors.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The Cataclismo left the world devastated. But all hope is not lost – lead humanity through the darkness to a bright future as you design grand fortresses and command troops in real-time battles against a seemingly endless horde that will stop at nothing to see your people destroyed.

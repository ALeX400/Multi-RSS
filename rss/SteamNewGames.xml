 <br/>
 Summer vacation is finally here! Our story follows Natsu, a timid, effeminate young man who embarks on a family trip to the countryside to visit his aunt Misaki. But just as everyone's getting settled in, a mix-up at his father's workplace forces Natsu's parents to hop right back in the car and drive home, leaving him to spend the remainder of his summer break out in the sticks. Misaki is more than happy to take him in, of course, and so begins a peaceful, relaxing few weeks where absolutely nothing out of the ordinary threatens to disturb his tranquil everyday routine... Bwahahaha, as if!
 <br/>
 <br>
  It isn't long before a self-proclaimed magical girl named Chitose worms her way into Natsu's life, but her boisterous intrusion is the least of his problems. An eccentric candy seller, an insecure wanna-be teacher, a pink-haired loudmouth... Not to mention, his aunt's strange behavior around the topic of the outdoors. Surrounded by misfits, it soon becomes apparent that Natsu's real summer homework is to learn more about the women around him and help them with their problems. And yet, with only 30 days until his parents pick him up, is this one assignment he's fated to flunk, or will he pass with flying colors?
  <br>

    <br>
     Have a blast fishing, catching bugs, taking in the sights, and collecting other bits and bobs as you go around talking to the locals. Get insight into not just the town, but the girls that live there as you work toward the conclusion of their individual stories. Just make sure to keep an eye on that calendar! It may seem like you have all the time in the world, but if you aren't careful, summer will pass by in the blink of an eye. Make the most out of every day and work hard to make this the best summer vacation ever!

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 The worldwide phenomenon of Critters has the world in its grip and the newest collectable, the Critter Trading Card Game, has just been released!
 <br/>
 Dina is Critter mad and has been begging her parents for a week to get her some cards. Yesterday they relented and have bought her a starter deck and a lovely binder to keep them in but it's not enough, she wants all the Critter Cards.
 <br/>
 It's finally lunch time and everyone rushes out to play some more Critter Challenges.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2294160/extras/Header_BattleGif.gif"/>
 <br>
  It's Critter Combat! Build up energy with weaker Skill cards and spend it to play stronger cards. With each Critter having varied stats, abilities, Weakness and Resistances, making a varied team is key. You don't want your whole team to be weak to Blaze attacks do you?
  <br>
   But Skill cards can only be used by Critters of the same element, so maybe using multiple Critters of the same type is a good strategy? You wouldn't want your Aqua Critter to be defeated and then not be able to use your Aqua Skill Cards.
   <br>
    <br>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2294160/extras/Header_DeckbuildingGif.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Build your deck by swapping with the characters you beat in battle. Got some doubles? Swap as many times as you like and are able, no limits here. Any cards are added to your binder to change up your Battle Deck at any time. Equip Stickers for passive bonuses but be aware that using rarer Critters limits how many Stickers you can use. Balance your deck between Critters, Skills and Stickers to claim victory!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2294160/extras/Header_ChallengesGif.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Proceed through Challenges by picking one of 3 map cards but if you're feeling brave, unflipped cards award money that can be used to buy Booster Packs. A victory in a Challenge adds the cards in your battle deck to your permanent Master Binder, letting you customise the starting Critter in future runs. Create decks from the Master Binder to take on the Critter Championship and put your deckbuilding to the test. And the next Challenge run? Totally different. With 6 different areas that can appear in any order, you never know what you'll run into next time.
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      Game Features
     </h2>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       A number of artists have illustrated hundreds of cards to collect and store lovingly in your binder
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       A whole bunch of Skill cards and passive ability Stickers to come up with an array of strategies.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Swap with characters you beat to build your deck instead of 'pick 1 of 3 cards'. Swap those dupes!
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Each run is made up from 3 of the 6 Areas and can be played in any order, doing acts in the same order is pretty boring, right?
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Collect cards between runs in the Master Binder and use Master Decks to take on the toughest fights in the Critter Championship.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <br/>
     This is a game inspired by a single dev's experience of when the pokemon trading card game took over school playgrounds, swapping every breaktime and having illustrated cardboard consume his life.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Axon TD infuses a new layer of strategy into Mazing Tower Defenses. Typically, you build towers on the path to obstruct enemies and make the path longer. But what if you could take control of the map layout itself and expand things directly? In Axon TD, you're given a brush, and the map is your canvas!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The name of the game is map manipulation. Place down tiles to make longer paths and support more towers. Tiles can also bridge to various islands scattered around the map; these provide entire new chunks to maze with. On various maps, you can even place a new destination point!
 </p>

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  A roguelite mode where you face the gauntlet of randomized maps, towers, and techs. Adapt to a rapidly expanding map area and take advantage of an accelerated tower technology progression. Surviving earns you a place on the global leaderboard.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  You play as a defense contractor on a routine mission. As you arrive, your ship is shot down, and you're attacked by a robotic force called the Axons. Your only way off the planet is to fight. Build towers against hoards of enemies, progress through a tech upgrade tree, and defeat epic bosses! You may even find out the truth behind the ongoing war…

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  While we have created a lot of singleplayer and co-op maps, there is no doubt that unique and novel experiences which we didn’t think of exist. One of the founders of our studio started game development by modding games back in WarCraft 3. So, we understand the importance of player created content. The map editor gives you all of the tools needed to create any singleplayer or co-op map that we could create ourselves.

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Online co-op supports up to 4 players. With maps designed for 2, 3, and 4 players you'll find a wide variety of battlefields to conquer and make your own. A global leaderboard allows you to see how you compare to other teams. Will your team come out on top?

 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  With so many map layouts at your disposal, you want a huge arsenal of towers to play with. Dozens of towers, each with their own effect, fulfills that need. Towers also have three possible upgrades, and these upgrades add either new effects or change existing ones.
 </p>

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  What complements a ton of towers and a lot of maps? A wide variety of enemies having different abilities, of course. From those that move faster around corners to those that teleport nearby enemies forward, the Axons are devious in their onslaught.

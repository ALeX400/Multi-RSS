     <br/>
     To help manage his recently deceased grandmother's effects, the protagonist Takahara Hairi travels to Torishirojima during his summer vacation.
     <br/>
     Hairi finds himself starting to adjust to life on this island, surrounded by nature far lusher than anything he has ever come across back in the city.
     <br/>
     Time seems to flow by casually on this island, and as it does, memories of something nostalgic keep coming back to him...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     During his time here, he chances upon four girls.
     <br/>
     A girl who gazes out at the sea.
     <br/>
     A girl in search of a mysterious butterfly.
     <br/>
     A girl looking for a pirate ship to retrace her past.
     <br/>
     A girl who lives inside a quiet lighthouse.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He makes many new friends on the island.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "If only this summer vacation would never come to an end," he thought.
     <br/>

     </div>
     <br/>
     She is aloof and shy, often gazing out at the ocean away from the island. With the exception of her grandfather, her sole surviving family member, she has more or less completely isolated herself from the entire island. She is unsure about how to approach others, and so she can be somewhat blunt and might say things that hurt the feelings of others.
     <br/>
     <br/>

      <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418570/extras/chara_02ao_en.png"/>
     </div>
     <br/>
     She is a girl who easily makes friends with both guys and girls without reservation. She's often seen together with a wild fox (?). She works part-time at the island's candy shop, which is popular with island residents of all ages. When given the opportunity to take a nap, she can fall asleep practically anywhere.
     <br/>

     </div>
     <br/>
     A mysterious girl whom Hairi meets on the island. Just like Hairi, she is only there for the summer. She is always dragging an oversized suitcase around, the contents of which she absolutely will not divulge to anyone. As if she is searching for something, she is always wandering around the island with an old, worn-out map.
     <br/>
     <br/>

      <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3418570/extras/chara_04tsumugi_en.png"/>
     </div>
     <br/>
     A girl who frequents the island's lighthouse. Earnest in personality, she is half-German and half-Japanese, and she is spending her summer in search of things she wants to do. She often spends her time cleaning trash that washes up on the island, keeping anything that might still be useful someday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <div class="bb_img_ctn">

     </div>
     <br/>
     As the disciplinary executive of the Torishirojima Youth Association, she always has her trusted water rifle "Hydro Gladiator KAI" on hand, which she mercilessly uses to lay down punishment on anyone who dares disrupt the island's public morals. She's agreed to help a local newspaper feature Torishirojima in their tourism section, and is often seen running here and there in search of ideas.
     <br/>

     </div>
     <br/>
     The student council president at the school the story's heroines attend on the mainland. She visits the island to spend time with Tsumugi at the lighthouse during the summer. She and her friends are working together to rebuild the snack bar that used to be open on the island.
     <br/>

     </div>
     <br/>
     Hairi's second cousin, who is incredibly mature for her age. She seems to be particularly harsh on Hairi from time to time. For whatever reason, she leaves the house each day to play outside on the island.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     A young girl who travels all over in search of old tales and legends about oni. Her search has brought her to Torishirojima to hear the tales of oni that are still told on the island. She claims to have never visited the island before, yet she seems to appear in places that aren't even well-known by locals.

  Post-Apocalyptic Cyberpunk: A Feast for the Eyes, a Jolt to the Heart
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  After the cataclysm, the irradiated surface lies silent. Survivors cling to life beneath, packed into a steel-forged city where scarcity rules and profit is the only truth. For the cyber-modified masses, electricity and neon are the new sun, and guns and chips their gospel. Welcome to Hunter Roulette—a brutal game where every shot could be your last.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Hunter Roulette reimagines cyberpunk through the lens of ruin: Colossal machine husks hang broken overhead, data pulses like veins across steel walls, and holographic dealers shout countdowns at betting tables. Each shot tears the air, setting off a dazzling chain of destruction. This is wasteland art—a visual symphony of brutal precision.

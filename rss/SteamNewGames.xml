 <br/>
 You're a small-time drug dealer rolling into a fresh town with no cash, no product and no connections. Build your drug empire from the ground up in the grungy west-coast city of Hyland Point. Contend against intensifying law enforcement and deadly cartel competitors to expand your empire and reach the peak of the underworld.

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Dark Deity is back! A quarter of a century has passed, as Irving and the Eternal Order carefully rebuilt Verroa to protect it against a future war. Their efforts will be put to the test far too soon as a new threat looms on the horizon. The neighboring Holy Asverellian Empire needs new lands to grow, and the fractious, fragile Verroa seems ripe for the taking. All that stands in its way is the Order and twenty scrappy heroes-to-be.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Take command of the Eternal Delegation, led by Irving’s descendants. Gwyn and Riordian will have to navigate the treacherous politics of Verroa, and weave a web of alliances to turn the tide of the coming war. Your decisions will determine the shape of these alliances and define your army. Coupled with the help of a giant pool of customizations, no two playthroughs will ever feel the same.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Put simply, Dark Deity 2 is about playing your way, all the way.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Turn-based tactical combat is at the heart of Dark Deity 2. Your 20 heroes have access to 45 branching classes, each with its own powerful abilities, passive effects, and its own tactical niche…
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  …that’s until you start experimenting with skills, abilities, and gear that can completely change the way a unit performs in the field and upend your tactics in a good way..
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Heroes will bond as they fight seemingly impossible odds. Hardship forges the strongest bonds…but can also destroy friendships and wreak havoc. Will you be able to walk the line between the two?
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  A desperate defense against an overwhelming foe. A land in the grasp of war fever, panic, and factional strife. A traitor around every corner. To have a chance at winning the war, you’ll need to make some difficult choices.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Verroa is torn apart by factions, and many of these factions are fractured in turn. Decide who to support and who to throw to the wolves - but weigh each option carefully. After all, your choices may drastically change the coming battles…
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Every choice can fundamentally change the way you play the game. No two playthroughs are the same and what goes right in one game can go terribly wrong in the other.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  No playthroughs are the same, but you can push Dark Deity 2 even further. Inspired by the many community-made randomizers for popular RPGs, Dark Deity 2 features a built-in comprehensive randomizer and campaign customization suite from launch. Random recruitment order, custom difficulty runs with stat, aptitude, xp, gold sliders, and more are available, allowing for near-limitless replayability!

  About This Game

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In River Towns, you place differently shaped buildings and make them fit into a limited area. Combine unique districts into a vibrant living city and help restore our River Towns.

  Puzzle a River Town
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Each of the three districts has its own set of shapes which are shuffled randomly. This makes every game you play a new and unique puzzle to solve. The different district's unique and vibrant architecture combines into beautiful little towns along the river. As the town grows, more townspeople move in and bring life back into this old and broken world.

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Earn Points
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Buildings also belong to differently colored districts which score bonus points when connected into large clusters. Getting a good score on each level awards stars, which restores the world and also unlocks more levels.

 </p>
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Each Level is Different
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The beginning of each town starts with you restoring this part of the dried up river and surrounding it with buildings. Throughout the game you encounter other objectives, such as gold to collect, trees to regrow and old monuments to rebuild. This turns the difficulty and possibility of collecting points completely upside down.

 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Progression
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  With every city you piece together, the world becomes a little more verdant. When you complete a level, you will receive a gold, silver or bronze marker, depending on your score. Once you have enough points, you can move on to the next world.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Psycho Patrol R is a mecha FPS hybrid policing and punishment simulator set in the decaying state of Pan-Europa. You play as an officer of the European Federal Police, a V-Stalker pilot of Psycho Patrol, a special unit tasked with counter-psychohazard operations and neural meltdown prevention using cutting edge criminological frameworks. The battleground of the 21st century is the human brain, the base unit of the hyperconjoined egregore Twin Terra. The soul of the planet is on the verge of collapse. Your chances are 0.001%.

  Mature Content Description
 </h2>
 <p>
  The developers describe the content like this:
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   Contains non-realistic but intense violence, including severed body parts and explosions of blood. You can use drugs and alcohol for different effects. There are horror-style sections in certain levels. Some non-player characters are nude, though due to the nature of the graphics there is very little detail. There's crude and sometimes mildly sexual language.

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  When a young adventurer and an elite knight stumble upon a vile conspiracy bigger than either of them, they get captured and dragged off to the prison city of Luxuria, where they must work to earn their keep and some small measure of freedom. While the Kingdom of Freesia advocates for a policy of human and monster equality, Luxuria is a bastion of staunch human supremacists, and the local monsters are being horribly oppressed.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Lilia and Sheryl want to help the monsters to escape, but Lilia is the only one who can safely delve into the Luxuria Hole to find the equipment they'll need to bring their plans to fruition. Meanwhile, somebody has to earn money so they won't get punished when taxes come due every morning. It's up to you to help the two heroines explore the mine and earn their keep if they're going to escape this prison city!
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Explore the city to find resources and opportunities to make money, delve into a dungeon with real-time combat, and help the resisting monsters escape from the prison city. Every day you'll spend one shift each playing as Lilia and Sheryl as they work to escape their unjust imprisonment. Lilia is the only person who can safely enter the Luxuria Hole, but that doesn't mean Sheryl has nothing to do, because taxes are due every morning if you don't want to spend the day in the lockup.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  You'll gather, craft, battle, and work your way to freedom, all while trying to avoid harsh punishments from the prison city's cruel overseers!

  If you want to explore the Luxuria Hole, Lilia is going to need weapons. Unfortunately, since this is a prison city, the only ones available are the ones you make yourself, and they're not exactly the most durable. You'll have to regularly gather resources to make new weapons, or you'll find yourself unarmed and vulnerable!

   Delve the Dungeon
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  The Luxuria Hole is a mazelike dungeon full of insane monsters, ore, and abandoned-but-useful technology, but only Lilia can explore it. Delve deep while fighting off enemies in real time, making use of melee and ranged weapons!

   Earn Your Keep
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Lilia may be busy exploring the dungeon, but she and Sheryl will still have to work together to make sure they can afford to pay their taxes every morning. Work, steal, and sell your way from the red into the black!

  Overview
 </h2>
 <br/>
 DRAGON QUEST MONSTERS: The Dark Prince comes to Steam®!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Compose your very own team of monsters from across the DRAGON QUEST series and engage in thrilling battles against your foes. Recruit monsters from the wild world around you and combine them to synthesize new creatures as you see fit. With over 500 monsters to choose from and a revamped synthesis system to explore, you can mix and match to you heart's content to create your favorite cute critters and dastardly supervillains, as well as brand-new additions to the monstrous roll call.
 <br/>
 <br>
  Your quest to become the greatest monster wrangler of all time starts here!
  <h2 class="bb_tag">
   Story
  </h2>
  <br>
   Psaro is cursed and is unable to harm anything with monster blood. Now, he must become a Monster Wrangler to create an army for battle.
   <br>
    <br>
     The hunt for high-ranked monsters takes Psaro through the ever-changing seasons of Nadiria and its unique environments, with rivers of bubbling lava, mysterious ancient ruins, and soaring towers of cake. Along the way, Psaro meets the kind-hearted elf, Rose, who joins his adventure to seek out ever-stronger monsters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The key to Psaro's success lies with synthesis: the ability to combine two monsters and create a stronger offspring. Each new creation brings Psaro one step closer to his goal of becoming the Master of Monsterkind.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     (The network mode Online Battles from the console version, where players battle one another in real time, is not included.)
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      Game Features
     </h2>
     <br/>
     - A Wondrous World Awaits
     <br/>
     As time passes in Nadiria, so too do the seasons change, with different weather conditions tempting new monsters out of hiding and revealing paths to undiscovered areas. The Circles of Nadiria are sure to provide a fresh experience every time you visit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - Over 500 Unique Monsters
     <br/>
     With such varied environments to explore, you can expect them to be inhabited by a plethora of monsters. While many can be recruited in battle, occasionally a defeated monster will ask to join your team of its own accord. Befriend as many monsters as you can, then combine them to synthesize new creatures and build a unique party to your exact liking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - Enjoy All the DLC from the Console Version
     <br/>
     The Steam® version includes the DLC packs from the console version: the Mole Hole, Coach Joe's Dungeon Gym and Treasure Trunks. Make the most of their unique features to enhance your adventure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     - Test Your Might in Quickfire Contests
     <br/>
     Register your team for the network mode Quickfire Contests to participate in automated battles against the party data of 30 other players. Once a day you can earn stat-boosting items as a prize, and the monsters from any team you defeat will be added to your roster (up to rank B monsters only).

   Throughout the game,
   <strong>
    you can use numerous vehicles
   </strong>
   , all with detailed models and sounds. Each can be driven both from a cabin and outside perspective. Some vehicles, such as the Excavator, include

      The most realistic approach
     </h2>
     Have fun with a brand new,
     <strong>
      realistic demolish model
     </strong>
     , where every tool, vehicle and fragment is physically simulated. All parts of the structures interact with each other, meaning that getting rid of a few strategically placed elements can collapse an entire building. Delve into the perfect balance between
     <strong>
      realism, performance and joy of destruction.

     You’ll start the game with a small plot of land and a simple shack. By the end,
     <strong>
      you’ll own a vehicle park
     </strong>
     . Every machine is versatile and can handle various tasks, leaving you to choose the right one for the job. Find your
     <strong>

  About This Game
 </h2>
 <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631470/extras/swimming.gif"/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The town of Critter Cove used to attract visitors from all over the world. Now it’s mostly known for dirty streets and trash-strewn beaches. Can you help us turn things around?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Critter Cove is a combination life sim and town builder game with a beautiful, handcrafted open world to explore.
 <br>
  <br>
   <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1631470/extras/sb_01_tourism_en.png"/>
   <br>
    Spend your doubloons to upgrade buildings and explore the world to discover new blueprints and gather resources to grow your town. More upgrades will improve Critter Cove’s tourist rating. The greater your tourist rating, the more new tourists will visit. The more new tourists, the more money in your pockets to upgrade the town. Get it? Yep, you totally get it.

     <br/>
     Venture out into the mysterious tropical archipelago peppered with the ruins of a long-destroyed civilization. Dive beneath the waves to salvage the treasures of the old world. Rescue shipwrecked critters. Unearth exotic ingredients. It’s a wondrous world of mysterious ruins, shipwrecks and ancient technology waiting to be discovered.

     <br/>
     As you explore, you’ll find resources to craft hundreds of different items, discover new construction blueprints and bring home unique plants to grow on your farm. Turn mundane salvage into something new and unique, and improve your tourism rating by offering your freshly grown food to visitors.

     <br/>
     Use tourist money and salvaged items to restore rundown buildings and open up entirely new stores and venues for tourists and townsfolk. Craft decorations and interactive objects that will improve the town and make it uniquely yours. You can even decorate your very own home with hand-crafted (or hand-looted) furniture!

     <br/>
     You’ll need help to restore the town, and luckily the world of Critter Cove is filled with many colorful characters. Some are easy-going and friendly… others might need some convincing! Rescue Critters across the world, assist them in building a home and help them find the perfect job in your community. Their happiness is the key to your success.

     Embark on quests to find hidden treasures or ancient relics scattered throughout the world. Donate these artifacts to the Museum of Mystery to uncover the secrets of the long, long ago - and then charge tourists a small fee to the museum so they can absorb some local culture!

 The Belfry stands as a beacon of hope and safety amongst the ruins of humanity and the City of Numbers, with monsters lurking right outside the tower’s walls. You are an Ace, born anew from the spirit realm with the skills, the grit, and the determination to protect the people of the Belfry. With spirit companions fighting by your side, you are destined for battle.
 <br>
  <br>
   Can you become the Ace humanity needs to survive? Find out in Towerborne, the newest action-adventure game created by Stoic, the studio that brought you the award-winning Banner Saga trilogy.

     Venture out of The Belfry solo or with up to three other Aces* to vanquish the looming terror that surrounds the tower. Either way, you won’t be alone. Aces can recruit Umbra companions to join them in battle, gaining access to enhanced skills and unique abilities tied to each spirit. After fighting your way through enemies, return to The Belfry to turn in quests, reforge gear, and more.

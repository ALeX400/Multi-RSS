  About This Game
 </h2>
 The SMITE 2 24/7 Closed Alpha starts August 27, 2024
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>
  Fight as a God
 </strong>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Choose your God from across mythology and wield unique godly abilities. Hurl bolts of lightning as Zeus, master the arcane powers of death as Anubis, or backstab your foes as Loki.

     <strong>
      The Third-Person Action MOBA
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No other game offers combat that feels like your favorite hero shooter, crossed with the deep strategy you can only find in a 5v5 MOBA. Feel the impact of every shot, sneak up on enemies, and combo abilities with teammates to take down the enemy Titan in Conquest mode, or defeat waves of minions and enemy Gods to secure victory in Arena mode.

     <br/>
     At some point you will not be able to run everything by yourself. Cash register, fuel pump, cleaning, motel check in/out and shelf filling are a lot of work. But don't worry, you can build a staff room and hire people to help you with all of it. But you will have to do the management and be the boss.

     <br/>
     Order shipments of products/equipment and every thing you need run your motel. Set prices for shop products and room renting. Give your employees assignments and make sure you're paying them.

     <br/>
     Expand your business to serve more customers and make more profit, three fuel pumps are better than just one as long as there are customers to serve, so make sure to invest in the right place.

     <br/>
     you can add a lot of ideas to your motel, such as payphones and vending machines to make more money. Or build a bus station to attract more customers. You can even place ads in your motel area to generate more cash (if you have the required popularity).

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 [Game Overview]
 <br/>
 Play as Snezhinka, a fixed-term contract employee at a private military company, and hold the line against waves of hostile mechs in a 2.5D dystopian world. In order to survive against increasingly powerful enemies, you’ll need to use what remains of your meager salary after taxes and other expenses are deducted to purchase cards and develop your combat capabilities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This fast-paced shooting game can be enjoyed with a controller or a mouse and keyboard. The controls are simple: you’ll only need to move, aim, shoot, and use gadgets.
 <br/>
 <br>
  In addition to a robust story mode, this game also features two challenge modes—complete with online rankings—and a collection in which you can rewatch cutscenes and peruse information on the game’s characters and weapons.
  <br>
   <br>

 <br/>
 Ever since the day the
 <strong>
  <i>
   SUPERVILLAINS
  </i>
 </strong>
 appeared,
 <strong>
  <i>
   CRIME
  </i>
 </strong>
 has been the king of the streets of
 <strong>
  <i>
   SCUM CITY
  </i>
 </strong>
 —
 <br>
  But in the center of this hive of evil sits a paradise, and its name is
  <strong>
   <i>
    JUSTOPIAN WARD.
   </i>
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Standing opposed to the dastardly villains, the
  <strong>
   <i>
    SUPERHEROES
   </i>
  </strong>
  built this autonomous safe zone as a thriving base of
  <strong>
   <i>
    VIRTUE
   </i>
  </strong>
  amidst the
  <strong>
   <i>
    CHAOS
   </i>
  </strong>
  around them.
  <br/>
  Its

  <strong>
   <i>
    MAYOR

  </strong>
  —its

   <i>
    CHAMPION

  </strong>
  —is none other than
  <strong>
   <i>
    JUSTOPIA
   </i>
  </strong>
  himself, the ultimate hero, the bane of the countless villains he has brought to account for their innumerable sins.
  <br/>
  As the creator and chairman of the
  <strong>
   <i>
    HERO SOCIETY
   </i>
  </strong>
  , Justopia also commands the other heroes in their tireless efforts to wipe crime from the face of the city and bring peace to the world at large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet the conniving VILLAINS grow stronger and stronger, and the
  <strong>
   <i>
    HEROES
   </i>
  </strong>
  find themselves walloped rather than walloping... and some of their number pledge themselves to the darkness in acts of foulest

  <strong>
   Night Charger
  </strong>
  <i>
   (Voice: Matsuri Sugihara)
  </i>
  <br/>
  POWERS: Electricity-based superhuman regeneration, senses, and physical and athletic abilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lone-wolf villain who commits her crimes solo on the streets of Scum City, targeting criminal organizations such as the mafia with bank robberies and art thefts while also taking jobs as superpowered muscle for hire. Her lack of trust in those around her and thorny personality often bring her into conflict with other villains, and she will not hesitate to oppose former allies in the pursuit of personal profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the evident selfishness of her motives, her actions have often saved those weaker than her, giving her a powerful base of support among a certain segment of the population.
  <br/>

  <strong>
   Bad Lotion
  </strong>
  <i>
   (Voice: Yuki Akashi)
  </i>
  <br/>
  POWERS: Generates a sticky fluid that she can manipulate at will.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader of the gang that runs Scum City's slums. After a difficult childhood, she leveraged her powers and charms to turn the tables on her environment, eventually rising to a position of effective control over her town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is convinced that she is the cutest thing on the planet; however, she can be remorselessly violent against even the people in her service.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <strong>
   Madam Venom
  </strong>
  <i>
   (Voice: Shino Nakano)
  </i>
  <br/>
  POWERS: Manifests poisons with various effects and can store them within her body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the boss of a major mafia organization, Madam Venom is known by everyone as a key player in Scum City. She harbors an ambition to overthrow the two Witches of the Towers, the city's most powerful forces, and take their domains for her own. Her base of support includes many of the criminals within the walls of the rehabilitation facility called the Asylum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is convinced that she is the most beautiful thing on the planet and backs her claim up with both fearsome powers and unbreakable confidence. Naturally, her experience has also lent her formidable technique.

  <strong>
   Justopia
  </strong>
  <i>
   (Voice: Uzuki Inari)
  </i>
  <br/>
  POWERS: Physical invincibility, flight, and infinite vitality!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A world-famous superhero and the mayor of Justopia City. With his immovable smile, magnanimous heart, and ever-burning passion for justice, he has become a symbol to people everywhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For all his honesty, kindness, and altruism, he has little mercy for the villains who have turned their backs to the light. His power and overwhelming vigor have laid low every ne'er-do-well ever to cross his path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villains fear him, because they know that once you've seen his smile, you've already lost.
  <br/>

  <strong>
   THE JUSTICE
  </strong>
  <i>
   (Voice: Yuka Kanematsu)
  </i>
  <br/>
  The municipal AI that manages Justopia City.
  <br/>
  It manages not only the Asylum but the city's facilities and daily routines, optimizing to increase the population of superhuman defenders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  THE JUSTICE seeks to create a utopia, and the citizens accept its interventions as a fact of life.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <strong>
   Protagonist
  </strong>
  <i>
   (Voice: -)
  </i>
  <br/>
  The young director of the Asylum, a facility intended to rehabilitate villains. Under the direction of THE JUSTICE, the city's AI, he is responsible for turning villains' lives around.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hates villains fundamentally because they once destroyed his life and has since turned his serious work ethic to the pursuit of justice. Though troubled by feelings of powerlessness due to his own lack of superpowers in a world increasingly overflowing with them, he now feels validated by his new appointment as director, which he owes to both his intellect and his compatibility with the assignment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He greatly respects Justopia, who recognized his talents and elevated him to his position.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 Settlements Rising is a city-building and colony management simulation game set in medieval times. The game offers extensive depth with dozens of professions and resources available to the player. Each profession features villagers with their own animations and work cycles, creating a living colony experience in the game. It allows for micromanagement through trade, limited resources, production chains, and production data.

 <br/>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378910/extras/SimulatedVillagersGif.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Villagers have their own life cycles. They can work in over 35 different professions. Each villager has needs for hunger, energy, health, and warmth. When they're hungry, they eat, and when their inventory runs out of food, they purchase more. When their energy depletes while working or during cold weather, they return home to rest. They are born, grow, receive education, and eventually age and pass away. They gain experience in their jobs. They acquire character traits either from birth or later in life.

    <br>
     At specific intervals, you will be presented with a set of random cards from which you can choose the one that best suits your needs. You can use these enhancement cards according to your requirements. These cards are for single use, but you can choose to save them for future games. In each new game, you can start with a few of the cards you've saved.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2378910/extras/TradeExpShips.png"/>
     <br/>
     In the game, you can earn gold by mining, trading, and conducting raids. Traders visit your village at regular intervals. They buy some resources and sell others. The prices vary from one trader to another, allowing you to buy low and sell high. Additionally, build trading ships and manage your resources by trading with neighboring villages based on the resources they import and export.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Construct exploration ships for exploration missions and send them out. Depending on the mission's risk, you can earn various rewards. These rewards can be gold, resources, or enhancement cards.

     <br/>
     As the resources of your village increase, raiders will periodically attack, attempting to plunder your resources. To defend against raiders, build towers and walls. Train villagers as archers or swordsmen, hiring them as military units for a certain salary.

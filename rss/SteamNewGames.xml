 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Lilly is searching for her lost sister, Melanie. During her search, she happens upon a magical portal that lures her into Everholm: a cute, cozy little island where everyone seems to recognize her. Gathering her wits, she sets out to uncover the mysteries of this little slice of heaven, with the help of a local witch...
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Everholm is an open-ended role playing game, focusing less on punching your way through the island's wildlife, and more on interpersonal relationships. Meet the residents of Everholm, gain their trust, and figure out why they're stuck with her on this enigmatic island.
 </p>

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Everholm isn't just about talking to the locals - it's about living together, learning new skills, and making the most of this cute little island. Lilly will have to learn how to farm crops, forage for supplies, do some fishing, raise livestock, and more. Turn a little run-down homestead into a cozy and well-kept place to truly call home.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">

 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  However, Everholm isn't all sunshine and flowers - the island has many secrets which need to be pried open by force or finesse accordingly. Delve into procedurally generated dungeons to fight monsters that lurk underground, requiring powerful weapons and spells to survive. Delve deep enough into the dangerous caverns, and Lilly might just be rewarded with rare materials to bring topside…
 </p>

 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  There is always more to Everholm than meets the eye. As Lilly bonds with others, discover each of their hidden secrets. But before that, they need to trust Lilly, which may be more difficult for some over others. Help others or choose to ignore them and enjoy the cozy atmosphere and non-linear story as you prefer! Unlock new pieces to the puzzle of where Lilly’s sister is and how to bring her home.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 Set in the densely cluttered streets of "Kowlong," filled with obscurity and chaos, this battle action-adventure game casts players as the "Hyoki," an entity devoid of memory and physical form. His only motive is to eradicate the monstrous beings known as "Slitterheads" crawling around the city, disguising themselves as humans.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Roaming the vibrant neon-lit cityscape, players must seek out allies among humans known as "Rarities," infiltrate and track dangerous organizations, and engage in battles harnessing the power of blood. As the suspenseful drama unfolds, delve into the mystery behind Hyoki's existence and the appearance of the Slitterheads.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Bodiless "Hyoki" Exposes the Demons Nesting in the Red Light District
 </h2>
 The entity called "Hyoki" finds himself wandering amidst the chaos of Kowlong, plagued by the enigmatic monsters known as "Slitterheads" which mimic humans. Though bereft of all memories, he holds one resolute intention: to eradicate every last Slitterhead. Infiltrating the city, he sets out on a mission to hunt down the Slitterheads masquerading within human society.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Possession-based High Speed Action
 </h2>
 Devoid of physical form, Hyoki's ability allows him to possess and control human bodies at will, turning the people wandering the city into his pawns. With this power he can slip through barriers, assume the identity of specific individuals, and infiltrate dangerous areas and organizations. By rapidly switching hosts, he can also traverse the city at high speed.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Thrilling Combat Using the Power of Blood
 </h2>
 While human bodies are fragile, Hyoki can burn their life force, turning blood into weapons to confront the ferocious Slitterheads. Even when critically wounded, he can continue fighting by switching hosts efficiently. By possessing "Rarities", specific humans who share high sync with Hyoki, he is able to unleash even more powerful attacks and activate various abilities. The cooperative relationship with these "Rarities" holds the key to uncovering the deepening mysteries in the city of Kowlong.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1481170/extras/ZEPHONFulcrum.bayer3.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Humanity emerges, hesitantly, into ruination. Almost nothing is left of the world as we knew it—settlements, forests, seas, mountains—all have been blasted into unfamiliarity. Horribly mutated animals hunt in packs through deformed woodland. Decrepit military robots stumble unknowingly through the ruins, sensors and logic centres blown. Alien soldiers, once impossibly powerful, cower in the wrecks of their ships, praying to heedless gods for rescue.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.
 <br/>
 <br>
  On the planet Earth, that was once a cradle of life, the extinction of humanity is at hand.
  <br>
   <br>
    <i>
     What will you do to survive?
    </i>
    <h2 class="bb_tag">
     BATTLE
    </h2>
    <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1481170/extras/ZEPHONBattle.30.nodither.gif"/>
    <br>
     Intense turn-based survival strategy in both single and multiplayer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Command over 50 unique units in battle—each with its own graphics, voice overs, weapon systems and sets of traits and abilities.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Plan out optimal build orders amongst 3 asymmetric paths—Human, Voice and Cyber—or combine them in surprising ways.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Deploy tactical operations—interference protocols, otherworldly hymns of decay and even nuclear weapons—to gain an advantage.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Combat occurs on the main map—no switching modes and having to auto-resolve battles because they drag on too long.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Use distinctive leader abilities in fully-featured multiplayer—with or against your friends.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      BUILD
     </h2>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1481170/extras/ZEPHONBuild.30.nodither.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Take your settlements from scrappy bases to sprawling metropolises as your faction expands its sphere of influence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Find and grow your cities by constructing buildings on tiles—everything you build needs space.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Optimize an empire-wide economy with 11 tiered resources—allowing you to specialize cities by their placement.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Recognize each building by its appearance—3 architecture styles to accompany your chosen path.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Fortify key strategic points to prevent enemies from assailing your positions—sometimes defense is the best defense.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      EXPLORE
     </h2>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1481170/extras/ZEPHONExplore.30.nodither.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Traverse the unfamiliarity of the destroyed Earth and unveil its deadly new secrets.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Discover dozens of terrain features and phenomena spread across 6 climates—flesh trees, microchip factories, traveling sandstorms, erupting volcanoes and much more.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Tune the generation of a new post-apocalyptic game world—cliffsides, ruins and deformed woodland occupied by violent wildlife and expanding NPCs acting out their own agendas.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Exterminate packs of mutated animals to collect caches full of rewards, capture outposts and expand your reach—one turn at a time.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      RESEARCH
     </h2>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1481170/extras/ZEPHONResearch.30.nodither.gif"/>
     <br/>
     As mankind strives to catch up to the new masters of the Earth, you’ll make strange new discoveries that could be just what you need to survive.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Unlock over 150 technologies spread across 10 tiers—units, buildings, operations, weapons, abilities and passive bonuses.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Advance from post-apocalyptic survivalism—through a blend of magic and cyberpunk aesthetics—before achieving transhuman transcendence.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Observe each unit upgrade visualized on the model—outfit regular, large and titanic units with cruise missiles, tunneling nails, deflector shields, and much more.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Read exact modifier numbers in tooltips and the easy-to-browse in-game compendium—so you don’t have to scour the internet for information.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      NEGOTIATE
     </h2>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1481170/extras/ZEPHONNegotiate.30.nodither.gif"/>
     <br/>
     Diplomatic negotiations are key to staving off defeat—but your opponents are watching your actions and reacting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Roleplay with AI-controlled opponents through diplomatic encounters—each AI comes with their own likes and dislikes based on their character.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Establish peace, trading agreements and alliances—or use your influence to antagonize your friends towards each other.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Choose sides—ZEPHON, Acrin and Reaver non-player factions permeate the world and need to be contended with.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="bb_tag">
      DECIDE
     </h2>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1481170/extras/ZEPHONDecide.30.nodither.gif"/>
     <br/>
     As the clash between ZEPHON and the Acrin continues, your choice of Leader and path will determine who survives in the wreckage of Earth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      <li>
       Steer your empire through multistage, branching, unexpected events—nightmares, cries for help and economic crashes all have to be dealt with.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Dive into your chosen leader’s backstory through their unique quest chain—complete it to unlock a permanent reward.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Play a key part in determining if humanity, machines or horrors prevail—the clash between ZEPHON and Acrin continues across the planet.
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       Resolve the prophecy that has brought the Acrin to Earth to unlock new game modifiers—all of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.
      </li>
     </ul>

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <strong>
  It's a Shipper's biggest fear. You're grounded in the exclusion zone, twenty miles of death and decay sealed off by the towering, suffocating walls erected after the collapse.
 </strong>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <i>
  Alone, stranded, and with limited resources at your disposal you'll have to push your way through the zone, solve environmental puzzles, manage resources and fight for your life as you try to find a way to escape beyond the wall.
 </i>
 <br/>

  <br>
   <br>
    <strong>
     Play as Mica, an unlicensed black market shipper who will stop at nothing to find her missing partner.
    </strong>
    <br>
     <br/>
     It’s been 12 days since Sasha left.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You talked about it, you argued about it and you even laughed about it. Anybody in their right mind knew going to that place was a death wish, a one-way trip to the end of the line. But Sasha wasn’t one to scare easily, she wanted answers and there was only one place those answers held any truth. Her mind was already made up, you just didn’t expect her to do it without you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Twelve sleepless nights later and you finally get the call. Tax has found someone, A border security suit looking to make some extra credits on the down-low. He can get you clearance, a two hour window to fly into the zone, find Sasha and get the hell out of there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You make your way across the exclusion zone but something’s wrong. The nav's running in circles and you're losing altitude. Before you know it a blinding white fills the sky. The dash goes dark and your hover drops out of the air like a lead balloon, slamming into the paved streets below.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2123640/extras/Street.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     You wake to the acrid smell of an electrical fire, rain pounding on the cracked windshield. You're surrounded by the crumbling remains of what were once considered homes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      <i>
       You need to find a way out. Call for evac, scale the walls. Something. Anything. Survive.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 From the veteran team behind Void Bastards and Card Hunter, Wild Bastards has you travel from planet to planet to recruit, manage and gun sling with a team of 13 outlaws, each of whom has their own weaponry, special power, and growth tree. On planets, you’ll wrangle loot and start showdowns that are then played out in intense, bite-sized shootouts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Wild Bastards were the most deadly gang in the galaxy until a posse from the puritanical magnate Jebediah Chaste eliminated one outlaw after another. Faced with their own mortality, the two remaining members have teamed up with the Drifter, a mysterious sentient spacecraft, to find and resurrect the dead gang members as they flee to the mythical Homestead.

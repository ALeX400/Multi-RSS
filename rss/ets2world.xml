      Toyota Corolla 2018 v1.0 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The 2018 Toyota Corolla is a reliable and practical choice, known for its strong safety features and good fuel economy. It’s a solid option if you’re looking for an affordable and low-maintenance used car. However, it’s worth noting some of its drawbacks, such as a less powerful engine and a basic infotainment system compared to some competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know about the 2018 Toyota Corolla:
    </p>
    <p>
     Performance and Fuel Economy
    </p>
    <p>
     The 2018 Corolla typically comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, which produces around 132 horsepower. While it gets the job done for daily driving, it can feel a bit underpowered, especially when accelerating to highway speeds. Most models are equipped with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that helps maximize fuel efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can expect excellent gas mileage from the 2018 Corolla, with the standard model getting an EPA-estimated 28 MPG in the city and 36 MPG on the highway. The LE Eco trim is even more efficient, with an estimated **30 MPG in the city and 40 MPG on the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Key Features and Trims
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The 2018 Corolla was available in several trims, including the **L, LE, LE Eco, SE, XSE, and XLE**. Even the base L trim came with a generous list of standard features, including a rearview camera and Bluetooth connectivity.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the biggest selling points of the 2018 model year is the inclusion of **Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P)** as a standard feature on all trims.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      This advanced safety suite includes:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection
     <br/>
     Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist
     <br/>
     Automatic High Beams
     <br/>
     Dynamic Radar Cruise Control
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Common Issues and Reliability
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Overall, the 2018 Corolla has a great reputation for reliability, and it’s not uncommon for these cars to last well over 200,000 miles with proper maintenance. While it’s a dependable car, some owners have reported a few minor issues, such as:
     <br/>
     Suspension noises: Some drivers have noted squeaking or creaking from the front suspension, often before 50,000 miles.
     <br/>
     Infotainment glitches: There have been some complaints about the audio system freezing or rebooting.
     <br/>
     Engine stalling: Some vehicles were subject to a recall due to a faulty fuel pump that could cause the engine to stall. If you’re considering a 2018 Corolla, it’s a good idea to ensure this recall has been addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
     When shopping for a used 2018 Corolla, be sure to check for a full service history and any records of recall repairs. It’s also always a good idea to have a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic.

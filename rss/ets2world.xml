     <strong>
      Volks 13-130 v1.0 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The Volkswagen 13-130 is a classic medium-duty truck that holds a significant place in the history of Volkswagen in Brazil. It was one of the first trucks produced by Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus after the company acquired Chrysler do Brasil’s truck division in 1981.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Here’s a detailed look at the VW 13-130:
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Key Features and Specifications
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Engine: The 13-130 was equipped with a robust MWM 229-6 diesel engine, a 6-cylinder in-line unit with a displacement of 5,883 cc. This engine produced a maximum power of 130 horsepower and a torque of 358.9 Nm.
     <br/>
     Transmission: It featured a manual transmission, typically a Clark 5-speed, which was known for its durability.
     <br/>
     Design: A notable feature of the 13-130 was its tilting cab, which was a first for a Brazilian truck in its segment. This cab, with its distinctive “face” and advanced design for the time, was derived from the German Volkswagen Transporter van. It provided much easier access to the engine for maintenance.
     <br/>
     Payload: The number “13” in its name refers to its Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) of 13,000 kg, or 13 tons, which was its technical capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Market Impact and Legacy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The VW 13-130 was a game-changer for Volkswagen. It was designed in Germany but developed and tested extensively in Brazil, making it a product uniquely suited to the local market. It was a reliable, medium-duty truck suitable for a wide range of applications, from urban deliveries to short-haul transport.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because of its durability and ease of maintenance, the 13-130 quickly became a popular choice and is still seen on the roads today. Its launch marked the definitive entry of Volkswagen into the commercial vehicle market, laying the groundwork for its successful line of trucks that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Common Characteristics and Considerations
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Maintenance: The MWM 229-6 engine is widely praised for being simple and easy to maintain, which is a major reason why many of these trucks are still in operation.
     <br/>
     Cab Rust: A known issue with these older models is the tendency for the cab to rust over time. It’s not uncommon to find models that have required significant bodywork to address this problem.
     <br/>
     Spare Parts: While many mechanical parts are still available due to the popularity of the MWM engine, finding original body and trim parts can be a challenge.
     <br/>
     Historical Significance: The 13-130 is considered a classic truck and is highly regarded by enthusiasts. It represents a pivotal moment in the history of Volkswagen in Brazil, as it was the vehicle that established the brand’s presence in the heavy-duty commercial sector.

     <strong>
      IVECO HI-WAY Rafa Gamers SHOP PISC v2.1 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The IVECO HI-WAY “Rafa Gamers v2.1 SHOP PISC” is a popular mod for Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) that is widely known in the Brazilian modding community. “Rafa Gamers” is the name of the mod’s creator (or one of its creators), while “SHOP PISC” is the online store where the mod can be purchased.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mod Features
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The mod is not a simple “re-skin” of the game’s standard Iveco Hi-Way. It is a detailed modification that adds a series of features and accessories to replicate the style of Brazilian trucks.
     <br/>
     Extensive Customization: The mod allows players to personalize the truck with a wide variety of accessories, such as decals, auxiliary lights, horns, antennas, and custom logos.
     <br/>
     Interior Accessories: Various items are added to the cabin, such as Bibles and other decorations, to create a more authentic and personalized driving experience.
     <br/>
     Chassis and Engines: These mods typically include chassis options, such as 6×2 and 6×4, and support the stock Iveco Hi-Way engine.
     <br/>
     Custom Sounds: Many mods of this type, especially those from creators like “Rafa Gamers” and “Rafa Sound,” include custom engine sounds that make the experience more realistic. Some mods even come with “fix” files to ensure compatibility with “Rafa Sound” sound packs.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      How to Obtain and Install
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The mod is a paid product and is distributed through the “SHOP PISC” store. Installation is similar to other third-party ETS2 mods.
     <br/>
     1. Purchase and Download: After purchase, the mod is downloaded as a file with the .scs extension.
     <br/>
     2. Mods Folder: The .scs file should be copied and pasted into the Euro Truck Simulator 2 mods folder, which is usually located in Documents/Euro Truck Simulator 2/mod.
     <br/>
     3. In-Game Activation: In-game, access the “Mod Manager” in your profile. There, activate the mod and make sure it is correctly positioned in the list if there are other mods that may conflict.
     <br/>
     4. Dealership Purchase: After activation, the truck will be available for purchase at one of the in-game Iveco dealerships or at a dedicated “mod dealership.”

     <strong>
      Ford Cargo 816 v1.0 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The Ford Cargo 816 is a light-duty truck that was introduced as the successor to the Cargo 815, primarily for urban cargo distribution. It’s known for its versatility, durability, and a reputation for being a cost-effective choice for many businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here’s a breakdown of the key information about the Ford Cargo 816:
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Technical Specifications
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Engine: The Ford Cargo 816 is equipped with a Cummins ISB 4.5 engine, a 4-cylinder in-line diesel engine.
     <br/>
     Power and Torque: It delivers 162 horsepower at 2,300 RPM and a maximum torque of 550 Nm between 1,100 and 2,000 RPM. This broad torque band helps with fuel efficiency, which was a significant selling point at launch.
     <br/>
     Transmission: It features an Eaton FSO-4505 C manual transmission with 5 forward gears and 1 reverse.
     <br/>
     Weight and Capacity: The truck has a Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) of 8,250 kg and a Gross Combined Weight (GCW) of 11,000 kg. Its payload capacity, including the body, is around 5,060 to 5,110 kg, depending on the wheelbase.
     <br/>
     Emissions: The engine is Euro 5 compliant and uses SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) technology with ARLA 32 fluid to reduce emissions.
     <br/>
     Chassis and Brakes: It has a robust chassis and features air brakes with ABS, ASR (traction control), and EBD (electronic brake-force distribution) for improved safety.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Key Features and Market Position
     </strong>
     <br/>
     When it was launched, the Cargo 816 was praised for several improvements over its predecessor, including a more powerful and economical engine, a more ergonomic cab with a new dashboard, and a more durable chassis. It was marketed as a reliable and efficient option for a variety of urban applications and could be configured with different bodies, such as a box van, flatbed, or tow truck.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Common Issues
     </strong>
     <br/>
     As with any vehicle, there are a few common issues reported by owners and mechanics:
    </p>
    <p>
     ARLA 32 System Faults: Given that it uses the ARLA 32 fluid for emissions control, faults in this system can be a common problem, often leading to a loss of engine power and warning lights on the dashboard.
     <br/>
     Fuel System Issues: Some users have reported issues with low fuel pressure, which can be caused by problems with the relief valve or fuel pump.
     <br/>
     Engine Gasket and Seal Leaks: While considered a good engine, some Cummins ISB 4.5 engines in these trucks may experience minor oil leaks from the crankcase or valve cover.
     <br/>
     Blind Spots: A design-related concern is the presence of significant blind spots due to the cab’s A-pillar, which can obstruct a driver’s view when making turns.

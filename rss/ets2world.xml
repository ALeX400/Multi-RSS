      SCANIA FRONTAL 112 E 113 v1.0 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The Scania 112 and 113 are two of the most iconic and beloved heavy-duty trucks ever produced by Scania do Brasil. They are part of a lineage of “cara-chata” (flat-faced) trucks that dominated the Brazilian roads for decades. While they share a similar robust design, the 113 was a significant evolution of the 112, bringing more power, comfort, and technological advancements.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scania 112 (Série 2)
     <br/>
     The Scania 112 was launched in 1981 as the successor to the successful 111 model. It was a major step forward, featuring a new, more aerodynamic cabin design (which had been tested in a wind tunnel) and a focus on driver comfort.
     <br/>
     Engine: The 112 used a 6-cylinder, 11-liter diesel engine. It came in several power options, including naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions.
     <br/>
     Power: The most common and famous version was the 112 HW, which had an intercooler and produced around 360 horsepower.
     <br/>
     Features: The 112 was known for its simplicity and mechanical durability. It introduced improvements like a more comfortable and quieter cab, and some later versions came with air suspension for the cab. The “H” in the model name often referred to its high-power engine, making it suitable for long-haul transport.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scania 113 (Série 3)
     <br/>
     Launched in 1991, the Scania 113 was the third generation of the brand’s heavy-duty trucks. It built upon the success of the 112 by introducing a number of key improvements that made it a legend in its own right. The 113 is widely considered one of the best trucks ever made.
    </p>
    <p>
     Engine: The 113 continued to use the 11-liter engine but with significant internal upgrades, including changes to the pistons and cylinder heads to improve combustion and efficiency. The most powerful version was also known as the 113H 360, with the intercooler providing a substantial boost in performance.
     <br/>
     Power: The 113 offered more power and torque than the 112, with the 360 hp version being a staple for its time. This made it even more capable of handling heavy loads and steep inclines.
     <br/>
     Transmission: It received a new series of transmissions, including more refined gearboxes with better synchronization and a wider range of ratios, which improved drivability and fuel economy.
     <br/>
     Features: The 113 featured a more modern and ergonomic interior, including a redesigned dashboard. Later models also introduced the famous Topline cab, which offered a higher roof and more interior space, setting a new standard for driver comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Summary of Key Differences
     <br/>
     Engine 11-liter, 6-cylinder 11-liter, 6-cylinder (with internal upgrades)
     <br/>
     Power Up to 360 hp (HW version) Up to 360 hp (H version) with better torque/efficiency
     <br/>
     TransmissionsManual gearboxes More modern, refined gearboxes with better ratios
     <br/>
     Cab “Cara-chata” cab with some comfort features Introduced the more spacious and luxurious “Topline” cab
     <br/>
     Legacy The groundbreaking predecessor, a workhorse The legendary and refined evolution, a symbol of durability and performance
    </p>
    <p>
     In short, the 112 was an excellent truck for its time, but the 113 improved on almost every aspect. It took the proven mechanical reliability of the 112 and combined it with better performance, a more comfortable cabin, and a touch of modern luxury that cemented its reputation as a classic.

      MB 1519 E 1525 v1.0 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The Mercedes-Benz MB 1519 and 1525 were both heavy-duty trucks produced by Mercedes-Benz do Brasil, popular in South America, especially in Brazil. They are part of a classic line of trucks that are well-regarded for their robustness and reliability. While they share a similar lineage and classic design, they have key differences in their engines and power.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mercedes-Benz MB 1519
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The MB 1519 was a significant truck in its time, known for its distinctive sound and being a workhorse in various applications, from long-haul transport to agricultural work. It was affectionately nicknamed “Brejeira” or “Brejeirona” in Brazil because of its frequent use in rice harvests.
    </p>
    <p>
     Engine: The original 1519 was equipped with the OM-355/5 diesel engine. This was a 5-cylinder, naturally aspirated engine with a displacement of approximately 9.6 liters.
     <br/>
     Power: It produced around 192 horsepower and a good amount of torque, making it a capable truck for its time, especially for pulling semi-trailers.
     <br/>
     Transmission: It often came with a 6-speed non-synchronized transmission (often a ZF S609), which required skill to operate, a characteristic of many trucks from that era.
     <br/>
     Features: It was known for its durability and simple, rugged design. The cab was the classic “cara chata” (flat-faced) design, and later models from 1982 onwards featured the “cara preta” (black face) design with rectangular headlights.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mercedes-Benz MB 1525
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The MB 1525 was a later evolution of the same platform, bringing more power and technological upgrades, most notably a turbocharger. It was a direct successor to the 1524 model.
    </p>
    <p>
     Engine: The 1525 used a turbocharged version of the same OM-355/5 engine, sometimes designated the OM-355/5A. This addition of a turbocharger significantly increased its performance.
     <br/>
     Power: With the turbo, the 1525’s power output increased to around 250 horsepower, a notable jump from the 1519. This allowed it to handle heavier loads and maintain higher speeds on the highway.
     <br/>
     Transmission: It was often paired with an 8-speed transmission, which was better suited to handle the increased power and torque.
     <br/>
     Features: The 1525 shared the “cara preta” cab design and was recognized as a more powerful and modern alternative to the 1519. It was a popular choice for long-distance road transport.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Summary of Differences
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Engine OM-355/5 (naturally aspirated) OM-355/5A (turbocharged)
     <br/>
     Horsepower ~192 hp ~250 hp
     <br/>
     Transmission 6-speed, often non-synchronized 8-speed
     <br/>
     Key AdvantageRugged, simple, and reliable Higher power and torque for heavy-duty use
    </p>
    <p>
     Both trucks are now considered classics and are still valued by enthusiasts and collectors for their historical significance and robust engineering. The 1519 is a symbol of a bygone era of trucking, while the 1525 represents the next step in performance and efficiency for its time.

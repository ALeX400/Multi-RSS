      Census (ProMods+RoExtended) based v1.0 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Census Mod for Euro Truck Simulator 2: Make Your Map Smarter!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Version for ProMods + RoExtended – based combos
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Census is a large-scale project designed to bring the entire in-game world map to a unified, accurate, and visually clean standard for displaying settlements.
    </p>
    <p>
     A complete rework and unification of city names for maximum accuracy, readability, and realism.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Accurate and up-to-date names:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     — All cities now have modern, official names.
     <br/>
     — If you enable “additional city names” in the game settings, you’ll see native names of cities marked with [*].
     <br/>
     — Arabic and other unsupported names are replaced with standardized romanized versions.
     <br/>
     — Historical or incorrect names have been corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Logical and realistic abbreviations:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     — Overly long names are replaced with intuitive and widely used abbreviations.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Multilingual translations:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     — Proper translations are currently available in English and Russian.
     <br/>
     — If your language isn’t supported yet, a common international name or transliteration is used instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Realistic city importance scaling:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     — City name and icon size now reflect real-world population!
     <br/>
     — An enormous amount of up-to-date demographic data has been gathered for almost every settlement in the base game and most popular map mods.
     <br/>
     — Capitals and megacities now stand out more clearly, while small towns look appropriately modest.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Smart zoom behavior:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     — In densely populated areas, smaller towns disappear when zoomed out to keep the map clean and readable.
     <br/>
     — Zoom in, and they reappear.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Expanded list of “key cities”:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     — More cities are now available for fast travel and job access without visiting them first.
     <br/>
     — This includes all capitals, major cities, and strategic hubs from popular map mods.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Unified standard across ALL map mods:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     — Regardless of your map combo, Census ensures a consistent, predictable, and accurate display of all cities.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Summary:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Census isn’t just a cosmetic mod — it’s a fundamental upgrade to ETS2’s cartographic system.
     <br/>
     It makes navigation clearer, city names more authentic, and the game world more structured and believable.
     <br/>
     Install Census and enjoy a map that finally speaks your language!
    </p>

      Marcopolo G8 1200 DESBLOQUEADO JH3D v1.0 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     It seems you’re interested in the Marcopolo Paradiso G8 1200, specifically in the context of “DESBLOQUEADO JH3D.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The Marcopolo Paradiso G8 1200 is one of the latest and most advanced long-distance coaches from Marcopolo, part of their Generation 8 (G8) series. These buses are designed for maximum comfort, safety, and operational efficiency for medium and long-distance routes, serving both line services and tourism.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Key Highlights of the Marcopolo Paradiso G8 1200
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Aerodynamic Design: The G8 series features a highly aerodynamic design with clean lines, contributing to improved fuel efficiency and a modern aesthetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Enhanced Safety: Marcopolo places a strong emphasis on safety in the G8 line. This includes a robust structural design, improved visibility for the driver (including optional camera systems that replace traditional mirrors for better night vision and blind spot elimination), and advanced braking systems. Some models also include a “survival cell” for the driver as an optional feature.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Passenger Comfort:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Seating: Passengers can expect comfortable, ergonomic seats, often with amenities like USB chargers, individual lights, and smooth reclining mechanisms. Options like semi-sleeper (semi-leito) and even premium seats with massage functions are available.
     <br/>
     Interior Environment: The interior is spacious and well-lit, with features like larger, curved windows to reduce vibration, and often includes amenities like air conditioning, onboard restrooms (which can be wider and illuminated with UV-C disinfection), and refrigerators.
     <br/>
     Entertainment: Many buses come equipped with multiple screens, sound systems, and Wi-Fi preparation.
     <br/>
     Driver Experience: The driver’s cockpit has been redesigned for improved ergonomics and visibility. Integrated electronics and easily accessible controls enhance the driving experience.
     <br/>
     Operational Efficiency: The G8 series is designed for ease of maintenance, with optimized electrical routing and standardized electrical centers. The aerodynamic gains contribute to a reduction in fuel consumption, which is a significant operational advantage.
     <br/>
     Chassis Versatility: The Paradiso G8 1200 can be built on various chassis from major manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz (e.g., O-500RS, O-500RSD) and Scania, allowing operators to choose the best fit for their needs. It supports both 4×2 and 6×2 configurations.
     <br/>
     Dimensions: It has a width of 2,600mm, an external height of 3,800mm, and lengths ranging from 13,200mm to 14,000mm (with a 15,000mm option for export).
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      What “DESBLOQUEADO JH3D” Likely Refers To
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The term “DESBLOQUEADO JH3D” in this context almost certainly refers to a mod for a video game, specifically a bus simulator game like Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2).
    </p>
    <p>
     “Desbloqueado” means “unlocked” in Portuguese. In the world of game mods, this often implies that certain features, customizations, or limitations that might be present in a base or “locked” version of the mod have been removed or made available.
    </p>
    <p>
     “JH3D” is a common name associated with mod developers or creators in the bus simulator community. They are known for creating detailed and realistic bus models for games like ETS2.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, “Marcopolo G8 1200 DESBLOQUEADO JH3D” means you are likely looking for, or referring to, a modified version of the Marcopolo G8 1200 bus model for a simulation game, created or enhanced by a modder named JH3D, with additional features or customizations “unlocked.” These mods allow players to drive highly realistic virtual versions of these buses within the game environment, often with a high level of detail and customization options that mirror real-life counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Are you looking for more information about the real bus, or are you interested in finding this specific mod for a game?

     <strong>
      Comil invictus 2023 desbloqueado v1.0 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     You’re looking for information about the Comil Invictus 2023, and the term “desbloqueado” strongly indicates you’re interested in a game mod for a bus simulator like Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) or Proton Bus Simulator. Let’s break down both the real bus and what “desbloqueado” means in this context.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The Real Comil Invictus 2023
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The Comil Invictus 2023 refers to the updated and redesigned models in Comil’s popular Invictus line of road buses, launched for the 2023 model year. Comil, a Brazilian bus body manufacturer, focuses on modern design, comfort, technology, and safety with this series.
    </p>
    <p>
     Key features of the Comil Invictus 2023 (including models like the Invictus DD, 1200, and 1050) often include:
     <br/>
     Modern Design: The 2023 models brought a refreshed visual identity with more modern and dynamic lines, both externally and internally. This includes new front curvatures for a more aerodynamic look.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Passenger Comfort:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Seating: Comil introduced new lines of road seats designed for superior comfort and ergonomics. Options typically range from executive, semi-sleeper (semi-leito), to full sleeper (leito and leito-cama), with features like USB charging ports, individual lighting, and leg rests.
    </p>
    <p>
     Interior Environment: The interiors are designed to be sophisticated and welcoming, with new colors and finishes, ample internal space, and effective air conditioning systems. Some models offer chromotherapy lighting as an option.
    </p>
    <p>
     Amenities: Depending on the configuration, buses can include restrooms, refrigerators, and entertainment systems with multiple screens.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Driver Ergonomics and Safety:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Cockpit: The driver’s cabin has improved ergonomics, with an enlarged entrance door and staircase for easier access.
     <br/>
     Visibility: Enhanced rearview angles and new mirror designs contribute to better visibility and safety.
     <br/>
     Technology: Integrated electronic management systems, touch-screen panels for controls, and features like a seatbelt fastening detector for passengers contribute to a safer and more efficient operation.
     <br/>
     Structural Safety: Comil buses adhere to stringent safety standards (like ECE R66 for rollover protection), ensuring a robust and safe structure.
     <br/>
     Operational Efficiency: The aerodynamic improvements contribute to better fuel efficiency, and simplified maintenance access points are designed to reduce operational costs.
     <br/>
     Chassis Versatility: Comil Invictus models are built on chassis from major manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz, Scania, and Volvo, offering a range of engine powers and configurations (e.g., 4×2, 6×2).
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      “Desbloqueado” in the Context of Game Mods
     </strong>
     <br/>
     When you see “Comil Invictus 2023 desbloqueado,” it almost certainly refers to a mod for a bus simulator game, such as:
     <br/>
     Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2): This is a very popular platform for bus mods, where players can drive highly detailed virtual buses.
     <br/>
     Proton Bus Simulator (PBS): Another prominent bus simulator, especially popular in Brazil, that supports extensive modding.
     <br/>
     “Desbloqueado” (meaning “unlocked” in Portuguese) in this context typically implies that the mod has:
    </p>
    <p>
     All Features Available: All customization options, paint jobs (skins), interior variants, engine options, and chassis configurations are immediately accessible to the player. There are no in-game prerequisites or purchases needed to unlock them.
    </p>
    <p>
     No Restrictions: Any limitations or “locked” content that might be present in a free or trial version of the mod are removed, offering the full experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Full Customization: This often means you can extensively personalize the bus with various accessories, interior elements, and even sounds, making it a comprehensive and immersive driving experience within the game.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mod developers frequently release “unlocked” versions of their creations, sometimes after an initial paid or restricted release, to provide the full content to the community.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if you’re looking for a “Comil Invictus 2023 desbloqueado,” you’re likely searching for a game mod that allows you to drive a highly detailed and customizable virtual version of this bus in your favorite simulator.
    </p>
    <p>

     <strong>
      Mercedes Benz Atego 1.54 ETS2
     </strong>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The Mercedes-Benz Atego is a highly successful range of medium-duty trucks, known for their versatility, efficiency, and reliability. They are widely used for a variety of applications, from urban distribution to regional transport and specialized services.
    </p>
    <p>
     Understanding the “1.54” in Mercedes-Benz Atego 1.54
     <br/>
     The “1.54” in your query does not refer to a standard Atego model variant or an engine designation. Mercedes-Benz truck model numbers typically follow a different convention:
    </p>
    <p>
     The first two digits usually indicate the Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) in tons (or a rounded-up version). For example, a “13” in a model name like Atego 1319 signifies a GVW of around 13 tonnes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last two or three digits typically denote the engine power output in horsepower (or a rounded-up version). For instance, an “19” in 1319 means approximately 190 horsepower.
    </p>
    <p>
     Given this, the “1.54” you mentioned is highly likely referencing one of the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     1. Game Mod Version: This is the most probable scenario. In the world of truck simulator games like Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) or American Truck Simulator (ATS), “1.54” would indicate a specific version or update of a mod for a Mercedes-Benz Atego truck. Mod creators frequently release updates to their creations to improve compatibility with new game versions, fix bugs, or add new features. So, a “Mercedes-Benz Atego 1.54” would mean the Atego mod that is compatible with game version 1.54, or is itself version 1.54 of the mod.
     <br/>
     2. Part Weight: Less likely in this context, but it’s possible “1.54” could refer to a weight in kilograms for a specific component of the truck, such as a tail light, as found in some parts listings (e.g., 1.54 kg for a rear right tail light). However, this wouldn’t be a truck model designation.
     <br/>
     3. Typo or Misinformation: It could also simply be a misunderstanding or a typo.

     General Information on the Mercedes-Benz Atego (The Real Truck)
     <br/>
     Since the “1.54” likely points to a game mod, let’s briefly cover what makes the real Mercedes-Benz Atego a popular choice:
    </p>
    <p>
     Generations: The Atego has been in production since 1998, with new generations introduced in 2004 and 2013, bringing continuous improvements in design, engines, and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
     Engine Range: Atego trucks are typically powered by efficient 4-cylinder (OM 934) and 6-cylinder (OM 936) in-line diesel engines, with displacements generally around 5.1 liters and 7.7 liters, respectively. These engines offer a range of power outputs, from around 156 hp to 299 hp (or higher in some specific configurations).
    </p>
    <p>
     Versatility: The Atego comes in various configurations (e.g., 4×2, 6×2, 4×4) and with different cab types (short cab, long cab, sleeper cab), making it suitable for a wide array of applications, including:
    </p>
    <p>
     – Distribution (dry freight, refrigerated)
     <br/>
     – Construction (tippers, concrete mixers)
     <br/>
     – Municipal services (waste collection, street cleaning)
     <br/>
     – Specialized transport
    </p>
    <p>
     Technology and Safety: Modern Atego models feature advanced technologies like Mercedes PowerShift 3 automated gearboxes, various driving programs (economy, power), and sophisticated safety systems such as Active Brake Assist, Active Sideguard Assist, and Front Guard Assist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Payload Capacity: Depending on the specific model, configuration, and gross vehicle weight, an Atego’s payload capacity can vary significantly. For example, some models can have a payload capacity around 1.54 tonnes (as seen in a specific hook lift truck example), while others can carry much more, with GVWs ranging from 6.5 to 16 tonnes (or even higher in specialized heavy-duty versions).
    </p>
    <p>
     Given your previous questions about bus and truck mods (“desbloqueado”), it’s very probable that you’re referring to a Mercedes-Benz Atego mod for a game that is either at version 1.54 or is compatible with game version 1.54.
    </p>

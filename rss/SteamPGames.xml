  About This Game

 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gather your party and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.
 <br>
  <br>
   From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.
   <br>
    <br>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     Choose from 12 classes and 11 races from the D&D Player's Handbook and create your own identity, or play as an Origin hero with a hand-crafted background. Or tangle with your inner corruption as the Dark Urge, a fully customisable Origin hero with its own unique mechanics and story. Whoever you choose to be, adventure, loot, battle and romance your way across the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Gather your party. Take the adventure online as a party of up to four.
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     Abducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together.
     <br/>

     Forged with the new Divinity 4.0 engine, Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment, and interact with a thriving world filled with characters, dangers, and deceit. A grand, cinematic narrative brings you closer to your characters than ever before. From shadow-cursed forests, to the magical caverns of the Underdark, to the sprawling city of Baldur’s Gate itself, your actions define the adventure, but your choices define your legacy. You will be remembered.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed, and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you – verticality is a vital part of exploration. Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you journey from the depths of the Underdark to the glittering rooftops of Baldur’s Gate. Every choice you make drives your story forward, each decision leaving your mark on the world. Define your legacy, nurture relationships and create enemies, and solve problems your way. No two playthroughs will ever be the same.
     <br/>

     <ul class="bb_ul">
      allows you to combine your forces in combat and simultaneously attack enemies, or split your party to each follow your own quests and agendas. Concoct the perfect plan together… or introduce an element of chaos when your friends least expect it. Relationships are complicated. Especially when you’ve got a parasite in your brain.

     <ul class="bb_ul">
      7 unique Origin heroes offer a hand-crafted experience, each with their own unique traits, agenda, and outlook on the world. Their stories intersect with the overarching narrative, and your choices will determine whether those stories end in redemption, salvation, domination, or one of many other outcomes. Play as an Origin and enjoy their stories, or recruit them to fight alongside you.
     </ul>

      based on the D&D 5e ruleset. Team-based initiative, advantage and disadvantage, and roll modifiers join an advanced AI, expanded environmental interactions, and a new fluidity in combat that rewards strategy and foresight. Three difficulty settings allow you to customise the challenge of combat. Enable weighted dice to help sway the battle, or play on Tactician mode for a hardcore experience.

      featuring 31 subraces on top of the 11 races (Human, Githyanki, Half-Orc, Dwarf, Elf, Drow, Tiefling, Halfling, Half Elf, Gnome, Dragonborn), with 46 subclasses branching out of the 12 classes. Over 600 spells and actions offer near-limitless freedom of interactivity in a hand-crafted world where exploration is rewarded, and player agency defines the journey. Our unique Character Creator features unprecedented depth of character, with reactivity that ensures whomever you are, you will leave a unique legacy behind you, all the way up to Level 12. Over 174 hours of cinematics ensure that no matter the choices you make, the cinematic experience follows your journey – every playthrough, a new cinematic journey.

     <ul class="bb_ul">
      With the looming threat of war heading to Baldur’s Gate, and a mind flayer invasion on the horizon, friendships – though not necessary – are bound to be forged on your journey. What becomes of them is up to you, as you enter real, vibrant relationships with those you meet along the way. Each companion has their own moral compass and will react to the choices you make throughout your journey. At what cost will you stick to your ideals? Will you allow love to shape your actions? The relationships made on the road to Baldur’s Gate act as moments of respite at camp as much as they add weight to the many decisions you make on your adventure.
     </ul>

     <ul class="bb_ul">
      so that when you hit ‘go live’, your stream isn’t interrupted by a bear, swear, or lack of underwear. Baldur’s Gate 3 has 3 different levels of streamer-friendly customisation. You can disable nudity and explicit content separately (or together), and you can enable Twitch integration to interact directly with your audience, just as we do at our Panel From Hell showcases! You’ll be able to stream Baldur’s Gate 3 without any problems, regardless of how you play, thanks to these options.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 Sins of a Solar Empire II is the sequel to the critically acclaimed space strategy game that seamlessly blends real-time battle tactics with the depth of 4X. As both emperor and battle commander you must lead one of six playable factions to victory against the threat of extinction!
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Real-time Tactics meets 4X Depth
 </h2>
 <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1575940/extras/Advent_orbital.gif"/>
 <br/>
 There are no turns. There is no battle mode. There is no strategic mode. It's all one mode and it's all in real-time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instantly zoom in to control tactical engagements where every missile, turret, and ship is fully simulated and an important part of the battle. Instantly zoom back out to manage your empire where every asteroid, moon, and planet orbits its parent in a slowly evolving strategic landscape.
 <h2 class="bb_tag">
  Unparalleled Gameplay Experiences
 </h2>
 <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1575940/extras/Space_Battle.gif"/>
 <br/>
 Sins of a Solar Empire II delivers sprawling empires, huge fleets, and completely new and exciting gameplay moments that can only be found in Sins II.
 <br>
  <br>
   <ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
     <strong>
      The Surprise:
     </strong>
     Build a secondary fleet on a rogue asteroid and launch a devastating surprise attack when its orbit brings it behind the enemy's back line.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      The Body Block:
     </strong>
     Stall an enemy's home planet bombardment by using your massive titan to body block swarms of missiles attempting to knock out your starbase and its critical planetary shield.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      The Screen:
     </strong>
     Advance a screen of point defense flak frigates to protect your fragile long-range cruisers by intercepting incoming bombers and missiles.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      The Swarm:
     </strong>
     Maneuver your faster moving ships to pick apart unescorted larger ships. Their powerful but slow-moving turrets simply can't track your agile strike force.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      The Influencer:
     </strong>
     Influence a hostile expansionist Minor Faction to secure your border while reserving enough Influence to win an auction for a powerful item to install on your best capital ship.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      The Backstab:
     </strong>
     Protect yourself from a backstab by establishing a time locked alliance. But pay attention to the time - your “ally” may move his fleet to your doorstep just as the lock expires!
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2 class="bb_tag">
    Features
   </h2>
   <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1575940/extras/Kol_CloseUp.gif"/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    A Dynamic Galaxy:
   </strong>
   Planets orbit their stars in real-time causing the galaxy's structure to slowly change, creating new battle fronts and new opportunities. Players can view the state of the galaxy up to an hour in the future to prepare their strategies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    3 Unique Races:
   </strong>
   It's War Year 35 and the emergent TEC, alien Vasari, and deviant Advent have been forced to adapt and evolve to survive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
     <strong>
      TEC:
     </strong>
     The inhabitants of this region of the galaxy, the TEC are humans who have joined together as the Trader Emergency Coalition to combat the alien Vasari empire. They rely heavily on trade to support their industrial base and augment resource income.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Vasari:
     </strong>
     Ten thousand years ago, the Vasari Empire once ruled over hundreds of planets and dozens of sentient species. Now on the run from an unknown enemy they use their mastery of phase space to conquer and acquire resources to continue their exodus.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Advent:
     </strong>
     A civilization of humans who were forcibly outcast by the Traders over a thousand years ago, the deviant Advent have returned with technologically amplified psionics and the power of the Unity - a devastating expression of their collective will.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   Each race features unique starting conditions, gameplay mechanics, units, abilities, items, and technologies. Their game changing new Empire Systems add a whole new level of strategic capabilities:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <ul class="bb_ul">
    <li>
     <strong>
      TEC Trade:
     </strong>
     The new TEC trade system enables them to dynamically adapt their economy by adjusting the allocation of traded resources on demand.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Vasari Phase Resonance:
     </strong>
     Strategically placed structures collect Phase Resonance allowing the Vasari to customize their global phase mastery effects.
     <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Advent Unity:
     </strong>
     Enables the Advent to harness the collective will of their population, unlocking the full potential of the Unity's global abilities.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    6 Playable Factions:
   </strong>
   The parent races are further differentiated by unique sub-factions each with their own unique features and play styles that reflect their motivations and goals. For example, the TEC: Primacy is a xenophobic 'human first' empire focused on aggression and the Vasari: Exodus is willing to destroy planets to fuel their mobile empire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Combat Simulation:
   </strong>
   A detailed combat simulation adds incredible depth to tactical gameplay. Turrets with their own pitch and tracking speeds make firing solutions important in battles. Fully simulated missiles can be blocked by ships or destroyed by point defense. New mechanics around shields, armor and hull points give greater depth to units and tactical decisions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Empire Management:
   </strong>
   All planets and ships can now be easily analyzed, customized, and upgraded in one place without the tedium of finding and clicking through all units in your empire. The Intelligent Construction system will queue up the entire chain of prerequisites to fulfill any item, research, or unit build request.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Fleet Management:
   </strong>
   The new fleet system includes the ability to request specific reinforcements on the fly. Requested units are automatically queued from the optimal factory and rallied to the fleet. Combined with Intelligent Construction this allows you to focus on the important tactical decisions and big picture strategy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Unit Customization:
   </strong>
   Planet surfaces can now be customized with special items that vary by race and planet type. Capital ships, titans and starbases can also be customized with race specific items to fill gaps in the fleet's composition or target specific strategies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Minor Factions:
   </strong>
   Numerous minor factions now inhabit the galaxy offering trade, auctions for rare items, and with enough influence, access to their most powerful abilities. Will you befriend them or annihilate them to keep your enemies from turning them against you?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Diplomacy:
   </strong>
   New features include a new offer / counteroffer system, the ability to give or demand planets, and the game changing time locked cease-fires that prevent your 'ally' from backstabbing you until it expires - but keep on eye on the time!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Multicore 64-bit Engine:
   </strong>
   The Sins II engine can utilize all available cores and RAM to maximize performance, now and into the future. Dynamic lighting, physically based rendering, higher resolution textures and more create a beautiful tapestry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    10-Player Multiplayer Support:
   </strong>
   A cloud based online system supports both 'join codes' and lobbies to make it easier than ever to play with others. Games can now be rejoined in progress if a player drops or has to leave; humans can even take over for AI players if a friend joins late.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    In-game Mod Support:
   </strong>
   Mod support has been integrated into the game, making it easy to discover, install, and share mods. Custom maps are automatically shared for multiplayer games, preventing the hassle of everyone downloading ahead of time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Easy to Learn; Hard to Master:
   </strong>
   With an elegant and intuitive user interface Sins II is easy to pick up and play. However, mastering your chosen faction will take true skill.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 For newcomers to FINAL FANTASY XIV Online, this edition includes three award-winning titles - FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn the base game, and the first and second expansions: FINAL FANTASY XIV: Heavensward and FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood. This edition also includes a 30-day free play period*
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Join over 30 million adventurers worldwide and take part in an epic and ever-changing FINAL FANTASY. Experience all the hallmarks of the best-selling franchise - an unforgettable story, exhilarating battles, and a myriad of diverse and captivating environments to explore.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Party up with friends or play solo! Experience all the main story dungeons on your own by calling upon NPC allies to fight by your side.
 <br>
  <br>
   <strong>
    Your journey takes you ever higher in FINAL FANTASY XIV: Heavensward:
   </strong>
   <br>
    • Take your first steps in the reclusive nation of Ishgard, locked in a seemingly never-ending struggle with dragons.
    <br>
     • Three additional jobs: channel celestial magicks to heal your allies as the mystical Astrologian. Attack from afar using firearms and mechanical weaponry as the daring Machinist. Wield a mighty greatsword and the power of darkness as the valiant Dark Knight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Rekindle the fires of hope in FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     • Journey to the East and rise up against the might of the Garlean Empire.
     <br/>
     • Two additional jobs: master the balance of martial and arcane arts as the rapier-wielding Red Mage. Draw your katana and let steel sing as the noble Samurai.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      IMPORTANT:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     • *The 30-day free play period included with purchase can only be applied once to each platform on a single service account.

Certain features currently contained in the FINAL FANTASY XIV Online Starter Edition, and additional content, may become available in the FINAL FANTASY XIV Free Trial in the future.

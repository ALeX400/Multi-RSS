  SCAVENGE, SURVIVE, THRIVE
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In ARC Raiders, gameplay flows between the surface ruled by lethal machines, and the vibrant underground society of Speranza. Craft, repair, and upgrade your gear in the safety of your own workshop, before venturing topside to scavenge the remnants of a devastated but beautiful world. Play solo or in parties up to three, navigating the constant threat of ARC's machines and the unpredictable choices of fellow survivors. In the end, only you decide what kind of Raider you are - and how far you’ll go to prevail.

  EXPLORE AN IMMERSIVE WORLD
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Explore four distinct maps at launch, with more to be revealed as the underground society evolves and expands its reach. Each destination carries the weight of a world twice-destroyed, and the scars of conflicts both old and new. Sift through the remnants for valuable loot, and piece together the past as it's slowly reclaimed by nature. Evolving map conditions ensure that no two runs are the same, with varying weather, enemies, and mechanics adding unpredictability and danger.

  STAKE YOUR CLAIM
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  In a society built on boldness and bravado, it is up to you to stake your claim as a Raider. The loot you scavenge can be sold for coin or crafted into all-new gear, allowing you take on increasingly lethal dangers head-on. Through both victories and hardships, you'll gain valuable experience; unlocking varied skills that enable all-new ways of play. In addition, you'll complete quests for Traders with differing motives and agendas; uncovering both the friction and comradery of a community under constant threat of collapse.

  BEWARE THE MACHINES
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Lethal machines known as ARC rule the surface, ranging from unrelenting drone swarms to mechanical giants that obliterate everything in their path. Their origins remain a mystery, but their ever-present danger is felt with every step you take. Each machine comes with distinct strengths and tactics, forcing you to pinpoint their weak spots and constantly think on your feet. And remember: the noise of battle carries. Other Raiders may be listening; eager to claim what you leave behind.

  FORGE YOUR OWN PATH
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Raiders survive by kitbashing scavenged materials; using long-lost tech and looted ARC parts to craft weapons, gadgets, and gear. Upgrade your workshop stations and learn blueprints to craft even more advanced items, or improvise quick fixes in the field to get yourself out of a bind. As you make a name for yourself, you'll be able to measure your skill against other Raiders by taking on Trials; rising through the leaderboards to earn valuable rewards.

Grenades, traps, ziplines and deployables offer the tactical depth needed to outsmart your enemies, while augments allow you to tailor your loadout to your preferred playstyle; unlocking dedicated inventory slots and additional gameplay perks.

 <h2>
  About This Game
 </h2>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Path of Exile 2 is a next generation Action RPG from Grinding Gear Games, featuring co-op for up to six players. Path of Exile 2 takes place in the land of Wraeclast, a dark continent populated by unique cultures, ancient secrets, and monstrous dangers. A sinister threat, long thought destroyed, has begun creeping back on the edge of civilisation, driving people mad and sickening the land with Corruption.
 </p>
 <p class="bb_paragraph">
  Path of Exile 2 features a brand new campaign with six acts, 100 distinct environments, 600 monsters and 100 bosses.

  Key Features
 </h2>
 <ul class="bb_ul">
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Twelve Character Classes
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile 2 features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they're just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Each of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specialisations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between.
    <br/>

    </br>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     New Skill Gem System
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile 2 features 240 Skill Gems that grant devastating active skills and 200 Support Gems that modify their behaviour. Combine these together to create your perfect build.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is the next generation of Path of Exile's famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It's now possible to six-link every skill your character uses.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Dual-specialise your Passive Skill Tree
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile's iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customise your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialisation, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialise in multiple areas without opportunity cost.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2694490/extras/DuelSpec.gif"/>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Uncover All-new Items
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile 2 features 700 equipment base types and every single one has its own unique item you can find. You can augment your arsenal with new weapons such as Spears, Crossbows and Flails, as well as supplementary items like Focuses, Traps and redesigned Sceptres.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Encounter Unique Bosses
    </strong>
    <br/>
    In Path of Exile 2, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There's over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn.
    <br/>
    <br/>

   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Explore a New Endgame
     <br/>
    </strong>
    Completing the campaign is just the beginning. The endgame in Path of Exile 2 includes countless areas in different biomes, powerful crafting, challenging bosses, unique encounters and much more. Unlock new paths and explore further into the world.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As you progress through the endgame, you will gain access to special passive trees that can boost the rewards of your maps and change the way the various endgame mechanics work. These trees will make your maps more rewarding but also more difficult.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile 2 introduces sequels to several leagues from Path of Exile. While their mechanics are familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p class="bb_paragraph">
    <strong>
     Fair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win.
    </strong>
    <br/>
    Path of Exile 2 is a separate game to the original Path of Exile. We will continue to offer expansions for both games going forward. They will never be "pay to win". Purchases are shared between the two games.

  About This Game
 </h2>
 <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Final_Keyart_BG3.gif"/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gather your party and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.
 <br>
  <br>
   From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.
   <br>
    <br>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Gather_new.gif"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Choose from 12 classes and 11 races from the D&D Player's Handbook and create your own identity, or play as an Origin hero with a hand-crafted background. Or tangle with your inner corruption as the Dark Urge, a fully customisable Origin hero with its own unique mechanics and story. Whoever you choose to be, adventure, loot, battle and romance your way across the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Gather your party. Take the adventure online as a party of up to four.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     Abducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     Forged with the new Divinity 4.0 engine, Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment, and interact with a thriving world filled with characters, dangers, and deceit. A grand, cinematic narrative brings you closer to your characters than ever before. From shadow-cursed forests, to the magical caverns of the Underdark, to the sprawling city of Baldur’s Gate itself, your actions define the adventure, but your choices define your legacy. You will be remembered.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed, and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you – verticality is a vital part of exploration. Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you journey from the depths of the Underdark to the glittering rooftops of Baldur’s Gate. Every choice you make drives your story forward, each decision leaving your mark on the world. Define your legacy, nurture relationships and create enemies, and solve problems your way. No two playthroughs will ever be the same.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      allows you to combine your forces in combat and simultaneously attack enemies, or split your party to each follow your own quests and agendas. Concoct the perfect plan together… or introduce an element of chaos when your friends least expect it. Relationships are complicated. Especially when you’ve got a parasite in your brain.
     </ul>
     <br/>

     <ul class="bb_ul">
      7 unique Origin heroes offer a hand-crafted experience, each with their own unique traits, agenda, and outlook on the world. Their stories intersect with the overarching narrative, and your choices will determine whether those stories end in redemption, salvation, domination, or one of many other outcomes. Play as an Origin and enjoy their stories, or recruit them to fight alongside you.
     </ul>
     <br/>
     <img class="bb_img" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/03_Bullets_points.png"/>

     <ul class="bb_ul">
      based on the D&D 5e ruleset. Team-based initiative, advantage and disadvantage, and roll modifiers join an advanced AI, expanded environmental interactions, and a new fluidity in combat that rewards strategy and foresight. Three difficulty settings allow you to customise the challenge of combat. Enable weighted dice to help sway the battle, or play on Tactician mode for a hardcore experience.
     </ul>
     <br/>

     <ul class="bb_ul">
      featuring 31 subraces on top of the 11 races (Human, Githyanki, Half-Orc, Dwarf, Elf, Drow, Tiefling, Halfling, Half Elf, Gnome, Dragonborn), with 46 subclasses branching out of the 12 classes. Over 600 spells and actions offer near-limitless freedom of interactivity in a hand-crafted world where exploration is rewarded, and player agency defines the journey. Our unique Character Creator features unprecedented depth of character, with reactivity that ensures whomever you are, you will leave a unique legacy behind you, all the way up to Level 12. Over 174 hours of cinematics ensure that no matter the choices you make, the cinematic experience follows your journey – every playthrough, a new cinematic journey.

     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      With the looming threat of war heading to Baldur’s Gate, and a mind flayer invasion on the horizon, friendships – though not necessary – are bound to be forged on your journey. What becomes of them is up to you, as you enter real, vibrant relationships with those you meet along the way. Each companion has their own moral compass and will react to the choices you make throughout your journey. At what cost will you stick to your ideals? Will you allow love to shape your actions? The relationships made on the road to Baldur’s Gate act as moments of respite at camp as much as they add weight to the many decisions you make on your adventure.
     </ul>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <ul class="bb_ul">
      so that when you hit ‘go live’, your stream isn’t interrupted by a bear, swear, or lack of underwear. Baldur’s Gate 3 has 3 different levels of streamer-friendly customisation. You can disable nudity and explicit content separately (or together), and you can enable Twitch integration to interact directly with your audience, just as we do at our Panel From Hell showcases! You’ll be able to stream Baldur’s Gate 3 without any problems, regardless of how you play, thanks to these options.

     Watch each other’s back – friendly fire is an unfortunate certainty of war, but victory without teamwork is impossible.

  <i>
   HELLDIVERS™ 2 is a 3rd person squad-based shooter that sees the elite forces of the Helldivers battling to win an intergalactic struggle to rid the galaxy of the rising alien threats. From a 3rd person perspective, players use a variety of weapons (pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers) and stratagems (turrets, airstrikes, etc.) to shoot and kill the alien threats. Players can also aim down the sights for a more accurate 1st person camera view. Combat is accompanied by frequent sprays of blood and dismemberment as players exterminate the alien forces or players and squad mates are hit by environmental explosions or friendly fire. Enemy encampments and battlefield environments depict bloodstains and dismembered corpses.

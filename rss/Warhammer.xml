As many noticed, this was defaulted to “on” and it caused issues for some players.<br/><br/>Honestly, this was unintentional, as it was not meant to be defaulted to on. <br/><br/>For this next Hotfix #51, we will update the settings version which will force the launcher to re-detect players’ render settings, this will reset the FSR3.1 frame generation to off. This is partially to revert the defaulted frame generation setting and partially to clean up resolutions and render settings to prepare for another change coming with the hotfix. 	<br/><br/>When launching the game for the first time, the launcher will show a pop up to notify the user that settings have been reset based on hardware detection. Some players might want to go and tweak settings based on their own preferences. <br/><br/>This note will be included in the patch notes this week for Hotfix #51, but we wanted to make sure this isn’t missed by players and it is clearly communicated ahead of time!<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/><br/>The Darktide Team<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>]]></description>

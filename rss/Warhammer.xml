What features or aspects of it made it seem like a good fit for Versus?</b><br/><i>“The level was built in a way that converting it to Versus would be quite a fast process, compared to other levels. The layout is open to water on the left-hand side and mountain ranges to the right and it doesn’t have too many empty backfaces or “half-built” structures like many other levels have.”</i><br/><br/>Areas that Heroes never get to look at in normal gameplay often aren’t meant to be looked at, but because the Pactsworn specials can move around all over the place by climbing or even leaping, patching up all of those views is important.<br/><br/><i>“We also wanted to have another art style, where both snow/winter mixed with the Dwarfen environment made it feel fresh."</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/ca6d147d9a3289e530de19a112ea41c93dcb927c.png"/><br/><br/><i>"It also features a nice mix between tight passages or “corridors” and open spaces, and it also provides quite a lot of verticality.”</i><br/><br/><b>What, overall, makes for a good &amp; fun Versus level?</b><br/><i>“Definitely a mix between open spaces, verticality, chokes, interiors, and exteriors.”</i><br/><br/><i>“Levels that are “geometrically complicated” in their set-up are also hard to convert to Versus (‘Tower of Treachery’ would probably be quite hard to do, for example).<br/>Maps with too many long chokepoints and tight passages are also not fun (‘Hunger in the Dark’, as an example)”</i><br/><br/><i>“Maps that have some built-in events that make sense in the world already (such as the gate you blow up in Screaming Bell to pass through the plaza) are great, but levels that offer opportunities for new Versus specific events to be added are also good.”</i><br/><br/><i>“We wanted the “portfolio” of levels to offer everything that makes Vermintide 2 fun, and the levels are better if they allow a lot of new areas to be added for Skaven, so the players see some new parts and experience what the world looks like from different perspectives (such as standing on a high cliff and looking down at the Heroes).”</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/e3aaebd2302edf4d67e0660c1f6a2a7d18c2ff75.png"/><br/><br/><b>For ‘A Grudge Served Cold’, are there any highlights of new or changed places, objectives, pacing, etc.?</b><br/><i>“‘A Grudge Served Cold’ was a bit too long and had to be cut at the beginning. We also added some interiors such as caves and safe rooms inside the Dwarf interiors.”</i><br/><br/><i>“The main events are still as they are in Adventure mode, but we added a few capture zones, and a payload to reduce the endless running and allow the pact-sworn to break the Heroes’ dash.”</i><br/><br/><i>“It was supposed to be only 2 rounds, but the length of the level made it into 3 rounds. We added a night environment to the last round to make it feel like some time has passed, and also because it looks nice.”</i><br/><br/><b>What would you look for if you had to turn another map into a Versus level?</b><br/><i>“ ‘Garden of Morr’ is a level that looks to have a very fun Versus layout, but the geometry is quite complicated to work with, with many small units stitched together, and lots of holes where Heroes can’t look.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it’s not nice to have too many large, solid structures, because if we need to make changes, artists need to spend time separating them, exporting new units &amp; more.”</i><br/><br/><i>“‘A Parting of the Waves’ looks to be a great Versus level as well.”</i><br/><br/><i>“All-in-all, we move, delete, add, and heavily rework the levels, but on the “surface,” they should look just like the Adventure levels. But pretty much all the units in a level are somehow tweaked, rotated a little, moved, and fixed so Versus works. It’s mostly about making the pact-sworn feel like Heroes because they have access to a lot of level areas that the Heroes can’t reach. So shortcuts, vantage points, etc. are very important.”</i><br/><br/><i>“You also create a “net” of transition points with the climb units, which in theory should cover the whole level, but it’s important to not add too many (the UI becomes bloated).”</i><br/><br/><i>“We also scaled down the enemy compositions, terror events strength, and roaming enemies a lot, since we have the 4 pact-sworn players using the Horde ability all the time.”</i><br/><br/><i>“If I were to convert another Adventure level to Versus, I would look for a bit more ‘wild and crazy’ layout level to push the Versus experience even further and avoid repetitiveness. For example Bögenhafen’s ‘The Pit’, which is a huge open town map with plenty of possibilities to add cool events.”</i><br/><br/>The new map will be added to the pool of Versus maps on March 6 alongside the Anniversary event! Check it out then!]]></description>

      <title>February Community Update</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500566410271917053</link>

<div class="bb_h2">Hello Space Marines 🫡</div><br/>Let’s recap what occurred in February on Space Marine 2 a bit and then we’ll tackle future topics! We know you're eager for Patch 7 to drop! There's still a bit of a wait, but in the meantime, we'll be sure to tease you a little.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">FEBRUARY RECAP</div><br/>This month we released the 6.0 Datavault Update, containing new free and Season Pass content. You may check the entire changelog here! 📖<br/><br/>Mostly, the biggest features that were added to the game are:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The Datavault, with new cosmetic rewards<br/></li><li> The Biovore<br/></li><li> New PvP Map “Tomb”<br/></li><li> Salamanders Champion Pack<br/></li><li> Raven Guard Cosmetic Pack including its Successor Chapters<br/></li><li> FOV Slider<br/></li><li> Perks rework</li></ul>Following that, we released the 6.1 Hotfix to help with a few remaining bugs and connectivity issues, mostly. Again, you can read the patch notes here.<br/>We are aware that with these two updates, a few issues remain, such as: <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> FPS drops<br/></li><li> Too many spore mines spawning at the same time</li></ul>We’re actively working on it.<br/>Hotfix 6.2 will arrive next week. It shall fix the spore mines issue and bring some balancing tweaks.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">IMPERIAL VIGIL COMMUNITY EVENT</div><br/>We heard about your desire to have an emblem-less Mk VIII Errant Helmet, so here’s your chance! ✨ This cosmetic is entirely free, the only requirement is to link your PROS account to Space Marine 2.<br/>Here’s your brief: “Achieve a victory with each of 6 classes in Operations Mode to win the emblem-less Mark VIII Errant Helmet”<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/876731048e75bea664881bc7949c13b396be58a9.png"/><br/><br/>The event lasts until March 3rd.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">NOTE ABOUT COMMUNITY EVENTS</div><br/>We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items. We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone.<br/><br/>However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far. We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">WHAT’S COMING…</div><br/>The 7.0 Update is in the making! ✨ We’re working on it and we’ll give you a more precise date once we get one. 🙌<br/><br/>This update will bring several awaited features:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> One Chapter Pack<br/></li><li> One Champion Pack<br/></li><li> Private PvP lobbies<br/></li><li> A new weapon (only in PvE for now)<br/></li><li> New Operation<br/></li><li> Weapon perks rebalance<br/></li><li> Class weapon loadouts rework<br/></li><li> PvE Prestige Rank: once you reach level 25 on a class, you can buy a Prestige Level that will unlock a unique Prestige Perk. Choose them wisely, because you won’t be able to change your selected Prestige Perks before unlocking the 4 Prestige Levels. On top of that power boost, each class will have a unique cosmetic reward that emphasizes the class’ iconic armour part. <br/></li><li> and more!</li></ul>Stay tuned, we’ll soon come with more info.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">HORDE MODE</div><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/6f4bd2012c6235fab5e95505ccc44b45a4d0c5db.png"/><br/><br/>…..So apparently you’re waiting for the Horde Mode.<br/><br/>You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now. <br/>One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the Space Marine 1 Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about. 😉<br/><br/>Once we get really interesting things to show you about it, we will do it!<br/><br/>Bear with us 🙏<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">PUBLIC TEST SERVER</div><br/>We’re also excited to share our goal to launch our Public Test Servers  in just a few weeks! 🙌 Expect it to take place in March and before Patch 7.<br/>Once we get a specific date, we’ll make an official statement on our socials and Discord!<br/><br/>This will give you early access to upcoming features and the opportunity to share your feedback, helping us refine the content before its official release.<br/><br/>It will exclusively happen on Steam, neither on EGS nor consoles. It will be very easy to install because it will act as a separate game.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">COMMUNITY FEEDBACK ON THE NEW ABSOLUTE DIFFICULTY - A word from our Game Director</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">We would like to hear your opinion regarding Absolute difficulty.</div><br/>Overall, we are quite happy with how intense the difficulty itself is. We see that it requires a lot of concentration and we feel like it’s fun in terms of how many enemies you have to face, how hard they hit you etc. <br/><br/>At the same time, we see some comments that it’s a bit easy. Yet on the other hand we don’t want to mess it up and would like to hear the voice of the community first.<br/>Here is some data and context.<br/><br/>According to our stats, the average win rate on Absolute difficulty is ~60% (significantly higher than Lethal difficulty that sits at 50%), which seems a bit higher than we expected.<br/>At the same time such high win rate is explained by three facts:<br/><ol><li> Absolute difficulty is locked for new users<br/></li><li> Only ~12% of daily play time is spent on Absolute difficulty.<br/></li><li> Only ~15% of weekly active players play at least 1 match on Absolute difficulty</li></ol><br/>This means that only a small portion of very hardcore and well-prepared players are playing the Absolute difficulty, and we must find a proper balance between wishes of the hardcore players and more casual players that simply want to have fun.<br/><br/>I will be completely honest; I think we are almost at our limit in terms of how we can make the game harder without making it unfair and not fun. We can’t significantly increase the number of enemies for performance and memory reasons. Greatly increasing enemy damage and hp will make it so players will die randomly and will make enemies bullet sponges, which will not be fun.<br/><br/>We do not want to implement a new difficulty, because that would split the matchmaking pool even more. We have to stick to the existing 6 difficulties.<br/><br/>The proper way of doing this would be implementing a set of gameplay modifiers (i.e. tight formation gameplay modifiers that we’ve tried to release earlier), combination of which would make each challenge unique. And I’m happy to announce that we are already working on the system, however this will take some time.”<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">For now, we can tweak some parameters and we would like to hear your opinion on specific items:</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">❔ Poll 1:</div>Would you like to see Dual Terminus enemies and more Terminus enemies in general on Absolute difficulty?<br/><br/><i>We can make it so there will be way more Terminus enemies on a level, potentially 2 at the same time. Plus we can lift restriction that prevents Terminus enemies from spawning on levels that have final bosses (i.e Hive Tyrant)</i><br/><br/>Vote here<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">❔ Poll 2:</div>Shall we slightly increase enemy health and damage on Absolute difficulty?<br/><br/><i>Some of the builds can break health thresholds and start one-shotting enemies. We are only talking about small health and damage tweaks that should not cause enemies to become bullet sponges.</i><br/><br/>Vote here<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">❔ Poll 3:</div>Would it be better to have more limited ammo refills on Absolute difficulty?<br/><br/>Vote here<br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3">❔ Poll 4:</div>Do you want even more aggressive enemies on Absolute difficulty?<br/><br/>Vote here<br/><br/>We will try to implement the adjustments as soon as we can.<br/><br/><i>- Dmitriy Grigorenko, Game Director.</i><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>​Please do not take into account the total number of points spent on an answer.

<div class="bb_h1">Hey everyone,</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Hardened criminals, ruthless bounty hunters, violent psychopaths: Tertium’s Hive Scum are coming to Darktide as the next DLC class.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>In case you missed it, check out the </i>reveal trailer here<i>.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This part of a series of dev blogs breaking down different aspects of the Hive Scum! <i>Check out the </i>previous dev blog here<i>.</i> For this one, we’ve interviewed our writers <b>Matthew Ward</b> and <b>Michael Knight</b> about the <b>narrative &amp; lore</b> of the class, as well as each of the <b>Personalities </b>that you can pick.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“I’m Mike, I’m the Narrative Lead for Darktide, and I’ve been with Fatshark for 3 years. \[...] When I’m not Narrative-ing for Darktide \[...] I have a massive Warhammer 40,000 and Horus Heresy collections that are still staring at me at about 40-50% grey… Which I’m reasonably pleased about! Y’know, that’s still a lot of minis painted.” ~ Mike</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“I’m Matthew, I’m the Lead Writer and VO (Voice Over) Director for Darktide, which means I write most of the words, I cast most of the actors and direct most of the recording sessions.” ~ Matthew</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h1">The Story</div><div class="bb_h2">Who are the Hive Scum?</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Born and raised in Tertium, the Hive Scum are true criminals. The real deal. Each is a high ranking and lethal footsoldier in service to one of the cartels that run the city’s underbelly.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“The cartels feel that they are the true rulers of Tertium. And the Hive Scum are their blademen and gunsmiths. These are the guys that do the wetwork. They’re the ones that settle the ‘disputes’ with hyper-violence whenever required.” ~ Mike</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">While most don’t have formal military training, a lifetime surviving on these streets have taught them all they need to know to be killing machines, using unconventional weapons, toxins and underhanded tactics. And while some might deem them untrustworthy, they’ve got plenty of reason to use those skills against the Heretics infesting Tertium.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“This is their home. More than any other character we’ve introduced, these guys are all from Tertium, they’re from the Hive. This is their home that’s being destroyed.” ~ Mike</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">But make no mistake, Hive Scum are still dangerous, hardened criminals. Some might only be in it for the money, but a good amount of psychopaths are answering the call as well. Between them they have more than a few loose screws and a bit too much of an interest in bloodbaths.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Their place aboard the Mourningstar</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The conflict in Tertium only keeps escalating. Every day there are new horrors to face, ever more virulent plagues, and a constant fight that seems to accomplish nothing but drain the Inquisition’s resources… Even with the Adeptus Arbites providing reinforcements, the Warband needs help. Rannick instructed Explicator Zola to use her connections to the Water Cartel, establishing contact with a conclave of Cartel leaders and leveraging the Inquisition’s influence and their mutual enemy to mobilize their forces.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“...At least that’s what Rannick’s telling people.” ~ Matthew</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Since the Hive Scum don’t come from a single organization, but vying cartels and criminal operations, they don’t have a representative on board to act as a figurehead. Zola, however reluctantly, has proven the ideal shepherd of this unreliable flock, but the Mourningstar has no shortage of shady characters, and sooner or later they're sure to get involved.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“But initially Zola is being the front of all this, isn’t she? She’s the one with the connections, specifically to the Water Cartel, and if nothing else… I don’t think she’s going to trust them at all when they’re out of her sight. So, that’s certainly where things will pick up. But where things head from there, who can say?” ~ Matthew</i></p><div class="bb_h1"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>The Voices</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“All these characters are from Tertium and it’s given us an opportunity to shine a little light on some of the bits of Tertium that we haven’t seen before. Particularly when you’re building your character. \[...] There will be tons of things for the lore hounds buried in there.” ~ Mike</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Like most of our other classes, the Hive Scum have three distinct Personalities to choose from, with a male and female version of each. Each Personality, with their quirks, beliefs and opinions, have very different bonds or rivalries with the Rejects, their handlers, and with each other.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“The Ogryns tend to get on with everyone, because of course the Ogryns tend to get on with everyone. One of the Ogryns in particular \[…] if anything, he’s a little bit meaner than they are. \[...] but the Arbitrators are not particularly pleased to see the Hive Scum at all. And vice versa.” ~ Matthew</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">The Outlaw</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i><b>Voiced by Gordon Cooper and Lizzie Wofford</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Perhaps in other circumstances, in another life, the Outlaw might’ve been a Hero… Or perhaps that’s just what they want you to think. Whatever the case, this is one criminal that might make you believe that there can indeed be honour among thieves. Might be someone you’d enjoy having a drink with! Maybe. If you keep an eye on them.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">The Bounty Hunter</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i><b>Voiced by Theo Spofforth and Lucy Forrester</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Guided by greed or just self-interest, the Bounty Hunter is in it for the money. Ruthless and efficient, they always get the job done and have plenty of experience. Neither hesitating to get their hands dirty, nor relishing in it: This way of life is strictly business. And profit. Lots of profit. At least, that was the case when the Cartels were operating normally, and the Outlaw does not take kindly to the Heretics’ unwarranted disruption of their operations.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">The Anarchist</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>Voiced by Ian Conningham and Jess Nesling</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Were they drawn to the criminal life because of their lust for violence, or did they snap at some point along the way? Whatever the case, the Anarchist is chaos incarnate, and not someone that any sane person would trust… even if we’re all on the same side now. The last voice you’d want to hear behind you in a dark alley… And probably the last voice you’d ever hear if that came to happen.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Bonus: Favorite part of working with the Hive Scum</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“Our male and female characters \[of the same Personality] share something in the region of 80% of the same script depending on what we’re talking about, but hearing how the separation comes in through performance is absolutely splendid. Jess’s version \[of the Anarchist] sounds terrifying. Ian’s one sounds like he doesn’t understand why people think he’s terrifying. And that’s lovely.” ~ Matthew</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“I got to help Matt write some of \[the scripts] this time, which was quite nice. When we write the conversations we literally write them backwards and forwards. Like Matt will write a series of opening lines of conversation, then I will add in the next line and then Matt will reply to that. So we don't necessarily know where that conversation is going to go beyond the first line and they're really organic, but we get to throw in little nods to background and stuff like some of the other war band members asking about the Conclave \[...] It’s fun to throw those things in.” ~ Mike</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">That’s all for today, but keep an eye out for our next Dev Blog, coming soon!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>For the Conclave!</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Wishlist the Hive Scum here:</p><p class="bb_paragraph">https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013290/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Hive_Scum_Class/https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013310/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Hive_Scum_Class_Deluxe_Edition/We’ll see you on the Mourningstar.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">– The Darktide Team</p>]]></description>

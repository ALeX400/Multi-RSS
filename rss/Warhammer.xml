You do not need to take any action. Players who were previously playing in the Beta will note that we have added two additional changes since we launched the Beta, which are <i>marked in italics</i> in the main post below. We want to thank everyone who downloaded this Beta and checked it out this week!<br/><br/>On top of the changes detailed in the release notes published earlier this week, we've also added Squig Herds and Black Orc Big Boss units to the core Orc &amp; Goblins roster in all of our products which share this faction as a part of this Hotfix.<br/><br/>These units will be added free of charge to anyone who didn't already have them as part of that change, ensuring that you can use Gorbad's tactics 'Light 'Em Up!', 'Erd Mentality', and 'Lead da Charge!' for players running his Campaign.<br/><br/>Our design intent was always to allow for Gorbad to have lots of variety in the units at his disposal to make best use of his tactics. On being made aware of this oversight, we've taken action to put things right. <br/><br/>We will be reviewing the rest of the feature, and will be back again with further changes as part of us better testing our content for the future.<br/><br/>Please accept our apologies for only now spotting this issue!<br/><br/>With all that said, let's dive into the full list of what's included in this Hotfix.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Hotfix 6.0.2 Release Notes</div><br/><div class="bb_h2">HIGHLIGHTS</div>‚Äã<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where, if the Ogre Camp ranks up, its stance reverts to Raiding stance.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where, if an Ogre Camp recruits units from within itself, it drops out of Encamp stance and switches to Raiding stance.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Vampire Counts were missing the ambush stance.<br/></li><li> Added Lightning Strike to Skarsnik's 'Ready &amp;

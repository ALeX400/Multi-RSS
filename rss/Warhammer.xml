The ability will be removed as soon as the party gains access to the usual means of respecialization;<br/><br/>Please be aware of the plot spoilers below!<br/><br/>Note that https://steamcommunity.com/app/2186680/discussions/0/4027970580228219058/ always contains up-to-date information on known issues and the roadmap of upcoming patches.<br/><br/>Read the full patch notes at:<br/><br/>https://roguetrader.owlcat.games/news/en/38]]></description>

It will now correctly push enemies away from you, instead of sending them to the right.</li></ul><li><b>Autoguns</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Lowered the amount of hits that do increased damage on a critical hit string:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Columbus Mk V Autoguns from 4 to 3</li><li>Braced Autoguns from 3 to 2.</li></ul></ul><li><b>Locke Mk IIb Spearhead Boltgun</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Increased ammo reserve from 80 to 100.</li></ul><li><b>Obscurus Mk II Blaze Force Sword</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Added a new Heavy Strikedown damage profile for the Heavy 1 attack that suits the actual attack better, including slightly better Weakspot / Critical Hit values.</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>First Target:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Damage increased from 100-200 to 150-350</li><li>Stagger increased from 4-8 to 7-15.</li></ul><li>Second Target:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Damage reduced from 80-160 to 60-130.</li></ul></ul></ul><li><b>Maccabian Mk II Duelling Sword</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed a bug where the Heavy 1 attack dealt less damage than it was supposed to do.</li></ul><li>Fixed an issue causing melee weapons to get blood spatters when hitting inanimate damageable objects such as explosive barrels.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">Talent and Blessing Tweaks</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>'Brutal Momentum' weapon blessing: Removed Ogryns as possible enemies whose Hit Mass can be ignored. </li></ul><b>Dev Note:</b> <i>The 'Brutal Momentum' blessing paired with powerful Strikedown attacks (like the special activated attack on Ogryn folding shovels) led to possible one-hit kills on multiple stacked Ogryn-type enemies, like Crushers. This expanded too much out of the single target nature of those Strikedown attacks, and also made Strikedown weapons which did not have access to the blessing to feel comparatively less useful in situations where they should have excelled.</i><br/><b>Dev Note: </b><i>This is part of ongoing prep work we are carrying out for itemization. We are curious to collect player thoughts and feedback as we continue optimizing.  </i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>‘Run 'n' Gun’ </li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Close Damage while sprinting: 10% -&gt; 12%.</li></ul><li>'Perfect Strike'</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Now also grants 7.5% Crit Chance.</li></ul><li>'Surge'</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Now also grants 5% Crit Chance.</li></ul><li>‘Focused Channelling’</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Now also removes 30% of Charging Movement Speed Penalties.</li></ul><li>'Blazing Spirit'</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tier 3: </li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stacks Per Crit: 2 -&gt; 3</li><li>Max Stacks: 10 -&gt; 9.</li></ul></ul><li>‘Sunder’</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Now also grants 20% Heavy Melee Damage.</li></ul><li>‘Man-Stopper’</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Now also grants 15% Bonus Impact.</li></ul><li>‘Adhesive Charge’</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Now also grants 15% Damage vs Ogryns and Monstrosities.</li></ul><li>‘Infernus’</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tier 3:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stacks per crit: 4 -&gt; 3</li><li>Max Stacks: 10 -&gt; 9.</li></ul></ul><li>‘Ceaseless Barrage’</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Suppression Bonus: 20% -&gt; 10%</li><li>Damage vs Suppressed: 6% -&gt; 4%.</li></ul><li>‘Blaze Away’</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Power Level: 8% -&gt; 7%.</li></ul></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>'Point Blank' weapon blessing: Fixed an issue where the blessing failed to trigger from kills with the primary weapon.</li><li>'Take a Swing' weapon blessing: Fixed an issue where the bonus weakspot damage failed to be added upon triggering the blessing.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Psyker</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Changed 'Perfect Timing' to trigger once per hit, instead of once per attack.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Ogryn</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed an issue where the talent 'Bullet Bravado' failed to replenish toughness when shooting projectile-type weapons (e.g. Rumbler, Grenadier Gauntlet).</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Close Range Damage bonus from the Ogryn 'Thick of the Fray' talent was applied also to damage from the primary melee weapon.</li><li>Fixed an issue where stacks of the keystone talent 'Feel No Pain' would be removed incorrectly also when successfully blocking an attack, or when hit by friendly fire.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the talent 'Pacemaker' could fail to be triggered.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the talent 'Crunch' failed to be triggered if the talent 'No Pushover' was also selected.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Blitzes 'Big Box of Hurt'/'Bombs Away' and 'Big Friendly Rock' would fail to instakill Poxbursters and special Mutants spawned from the related Maelstrom mutator.</li><li>Increased the interval in between explosions of 'Big Box of Hurt' from (0.3 - 0.5) To (0.4 - 0.8). </li></ul><b>Dev Note:</b><i> This will reduce the overlap of the staggers, to allow for a slightly longer total Stagger Duration for those hit by the explosions.</i><br/><div class="bb_h3">Zealot</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>‘Punishment’ </li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Impact per Stack: 30% -&gt; 5%.

The players are tasked with reawakening a long-dormant Adeptus Mechanicus Foundryplex, one of the fabled, lost Machinaria Gloriana. This level presents a new, frozen environment, sees a mission-giver accompany the strike team within the gameplay space and supports greater replayability with a new, variable end event. We're delighted with how it's turned out and we hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as we did making it!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/7b510dfafd541ef80db3dd8fd4f1d12d94059b8b.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">New In-Game Event: Test Your Metal</div><br/>Clandestium Gloriana’s awakening brings greater resources to the war effort.

Qualifying kills from all party members count.<br/><br/>This event will start on Thursday, 27 June. The rewards will be Ordo Dockets, Plasteel and Diamantine. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/2b2c805cdf83cd7a6aaa86be6e795533313af8f1.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">New Weapons</div><i>Message from Hadron:</i> <br/>Listen up, Varlets.

Taking brutality and force to a new level.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Branx Pickaxe - Heavy</b></li><li><b>Borovian Pickaxe - Medium</b></li><li><b>Karsolas Pickaxe - Light</b></li></ul>For these weapons, we really wanted to lean into the differences in the Heavy, Medium and Light between marks in terms of speed, handling and purpose.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Heavy </b>is Strikedown focus, using the pickaxe as it was meant to be used on heretics skulls and with a powerful bash attack as weapon special.</li><li><b>Medium </b>is somewhere in between both in terms of handling and damage, with a mix of Strikedown and vanguard attacks and a hook pull as a weapon special that sets up enemies for big damage. </li><li><b>Light</b> is horde control focus with wide sweeps and more cleave, and a pull weapon special like the medium pickaxe. </li></ul>These weapons have big damage and impact.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Shock Mauls</div><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/bc59c3ad98328d59a27938a0f3b58da677f37237.jpg"/><br/>The perfect Warhammer 40,000 riot gear, an electric weapon that stuns and adds a shocked status to enemies.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Agni Mk Ia Shock Maul</b></li><li><b>Indignatus Mk III Shock Maul</b></li></ul>Two words: stun and impact. They are versatile weapons with rich movesets; the mark difference relates to the moveset variance, with the Agni MK la having more immediate access to Strikedown attacks and the Indignatus Mk III having delayed access to a looping heavy Strikedown chain.<br/><br/>The weapon special is a “cattle prod poke” that adds damage over time and keeps enemies stunned.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Double Barreled Shotgun</div><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/445299ec438b48a95de870187b4890c0b001d8f9.jpg"/><br/>A very close range and nervous shotgun that inflicts brutal damage and impact.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Ironhelm "Hacker" Mk IV Assault Shotgun</b></li></ul>With fast handling and movement speed, this shotgun supports Assault-style game play.<br/>Access the bracing stance with the secondary action to shoot both barrels at the same time (for maximum carnage). The weapon special is a weapon bash combo. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Bolt Pistol</div><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/7985048f4df79a3093dfd19b4e1e4d25b735fa2a.jpg"/><br/>An iconic Warhammer 40,000 weapon, mobile and perfect to lead an assault.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Godwyn-Branx Pattern Bolt Pistol</b></li></ul>Better handling and faster reload, but more difficult to control than the Boltgun version. The weapon special is a bash, which can be combo’ed into a hipfire shot. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Features and QoL</div><div class="bb_h2">Mission Updates from Community Feedback</div>We’ve made a number of changes to existing missions in this update based on player feedback. The detailed changes are listed further down.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Updated Crosshairs</div>Crosshairs have had a two-fold issue:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>They were in general larger than what the spread system (which handles how much a shot will deviate from where the barrel is pointing) was using.</li><li>They were affected by the Field of View and HUD Scale user settings.</li></ul>The combined effect of this was that at default settings shots would hit approximately within the centre 50-75% areas of the extents of any given crosshair, meaning that the crosshair itself was not a reliable way to gauge the extent of the weapon spread.<br/><br/>Additionally, increasing the Field of View would make the crosshair appear larger, while decreasing the FoV, especially when combined with lowering the HUD Scale, would make the crosshair appear smaller.<br/><br/>Fixing the first issue meant that several crosshairs now started to overlap with hit markers, which led to redesigning most of the crosshairs, as well as the hit markers themselves.<br/><br/>Hit markers are now slightly smaller and have an outline to be easier to see against light backgrounds. The major changes are that we now use a different hit marker for weakspot hits, to differentiate them from critical strike hits. <br/><br/>Weakspot hit markers are now doubled up, and like non-weakspot hits colour coded according to the type of hit (white = standard, blue = no or reduced damage, orange = critical strike, red = kill). <br/><b>Dev Note: </b><i>Previously both weakspot hits and critical strike hits were coloured orange.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/6043ab482b4b4c2e3f33189f4eab106c54d99c0d.png"/><br/><i>Standard Kill</i><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/dad0a7eceebcbbdda09ebd344f8b92e187d0f693.png"/><br/><i>Weakspot Kill </i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/fa37f9527f19caf6fa3d1f860104802cb1d41d66.png"/><br/><i>Standard No Damage </i><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/bba5676ce79c92e5415037072fd5f9f17e25e0f4.png"/><br/><i>Weakspot No Damage </i><br/>The major reason for this change is primarily due to several Blessings and Talents being triggered by either weakspot hits or critical strikes, and this change should hopefully make it easier to understand which hits should (or shouldn't) trigger a specific bonus. Plus it's satisfying knowing that the heretic killed died from a masterful blow to the head.<br/><br/><b>Crosshairs </b>have been categorised in several categories, each with their own style of crosshair that always leaves an empty space for hit markers no matter how high or low the weapon’s spread is.<br/><br/>All weapons have been categorised into one of these categories and by extension hit markers:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>"Rapid Fire" for accurate single-shot or burst weapons, such as Infantry Lasguns or Headhunter Autoguns.</li><li>"Assault" for mid-range high rate of fire weapons, such as Infantry Autoguns or Shredder Autopistols.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>"Heavy" for slow-firing high-damage weapons, such as Quickdraw Stubrevolvers or Plasma Guns.</li><li>"Spreadshot" for pellet weapons, such as Combat Shotguns or Ripper Guns.</li><li>"Torrent" for inaccurate high-volume fire weapons, such as Twin-Linked Heavy Stubbers or alternate fire for Braced Autoguns.</li><li>"Flamer" for, well, Flamers.</li><li>"Dot" for melee weapons and Force Staves.</li></ul><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/1a8b02d13a70c0f4608833d78cd6d941d5f986c0.png"/><i>Old Assault Crosshair</i><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/5dff1e384e18e3306c7568942f6fda268b79bf74.png"/><i>New Assault Crosshair</i> <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/2a45cef10921032561419c49908cdd26baed5736.png"/><i>Old Heavy Crosshair</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/9d022196ec3101297321ad424775aa5328feb32a.png"/><i>New Heavy Crosshair </i><br/><br/>In addition, there are a few new user settings to tweak and change the look and behaviour of crosshairs and hit markers:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Turn on/off crosshairs, aim trajectories, and/or hit markers.</li><li>Increase the time for which hit markers are shown.</li><li>Override all crosshairs with a specific style.</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The “Flamer” type is not available for the override. </li></ul></ul><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/7deb33b432bab67f37c5dff7933fafe67874d281.png"/><br/><br/><b>Known Issues for Crosshairs </b><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>"Crosshair Type" user settings don't revert when using the "Reset to default settings" button.</li><li>Force Staves incorrectly have their crosshairs overridden when using anything but the "Weapon Specific" option of "Crosshair Type".</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h2">Cosmetic Headgear Voice Preview Option</div>Players can now preview the voice of any headgear which their operative can equip, including ones that modulate their voice. This preview is currently available by going into the Inspect to Show on Operative menu.<br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/11a576064fa0523f826b7690ab1f79f04c499beb.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Sound Changes to Footsteps for Prosthetic Leg Cosmetics</div>The footsteps of your character while wearing a lower body cosmetic item that has a prosthetic will now sound different, to better match the visual and be closer paired with your actual gait. These items have a small icon on the item preview tiles, as well as a clarifying text in the item details.<br/><br/><b>Dev note:</b> <i>This is more noticeable in active gameplay/first person view, while footsteps in general are more subdued in the Mourningstar/third person view. </i><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Bug Fixes and Changes</div><div class="bb_h2">Weapon Changes</div><b>Recon Lasguns</b><br/><br/>The Recon Lasguns, while having a really iconic and fun playstyle, failed to perform adequately due to a mix of low punching power and struggling ammo economy, especially when rising up in difficulties.<br/><br/>We performed a balance pass on every mark, strengthening their identity as assault, almost recoilless full-auto rifles while also inserting some peculiarities on each mark, while keeping some of their weaknesses (such as difficulty to pierce Carapace armoured enemies).<br/><br/>The MkII version received a significant base power bump, remaining a good all-rounder for the category.<br/><br/>The MkVId mostly maintained its previous base power profile, but received hefty buffs in fire speed and magazine size to lay down suppressing fire and reward keeping the aim on the targets.<br/><br/>Finally, the MkVIIa place as the heavy variant was confirmed by a further increase in its base attack and impact power values. To help with its increased ammo consumption per shot compared to the other two marks, we significantly increased the total ammo in reserve.<br/><br/>We will monitor the performance of the weapons and your feedback after the changes to evaluate possible additional adjustments!<br/><br/><b>Detailed changes:</b><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>All Marks</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Slightly increased the hipfire spread.</li><li>Upgraded the Dodge, Sprint and Aimed Movement templates to the Assault and bespoke Recon Lasgun profiles.</li></ul></ul><b>Dev Note:</b> <i>This will make the weapons more suited for agile engagements compared to other rifles like the Infantry Lasguns.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Accatran Mk II Recon Lasgun</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Attack power distribution {40,70} to {78,108}</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac 0.75 to 0.8 (near), 0.65 to 0.7 (far)</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Infested and Unarmoured 1.25 to 1.0 (near)</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Flak down to 0.75 (near), 0.5 (far)</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Unyielding down to 0.75 (near)</li><li>Impact modifier against Unyielding upped to 1.0 (near), down to 0.5 (far).</li></ul><li><b>Accatran Mk VId Recon Lasgun</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Set bespoke power distribution values:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Attack = {40,70} (unchanged)</li><li>Impact = {1.0,2.0} (unchanged).</li></ul><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Unarmoured 0.9 to 1.0 (near).</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac 0.6 to 0.8 (near).</li><li>Fire rate from 16.77 to 20.00.</li><li>Magazine size from 60-120 to 100-200.</li><li>Removed one magazine in reserve (60x5-120x6 to 100x4-200x5).</li><li>Reload and Wield speed time slowed by 20%.</li></ul><li><b>Accatran Mk VIIa Recon Lasgun</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Set bespoke power distribution values:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Attack = {95,165} (around 33% buff)</li><li>Impact = {1.5,3.0} (around 10% buff).</li></ul><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Flak 1 to 0.75 (near).</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Unyielding from 1 to 0.75 (near).</li><li>Added two magazines in reserve (60x5-120x6 to 60x7-120x8).</li></ul></ul><br/><b>Achlys Mk I Power Maul</b><br/>The power budget of the Ogryn Power Maul (aka “Paul”) was very unbalanced towards its Special activated attacks, while the rest of the moveset remained anaemic. This made spamming Light activated attacks often the optimal attack rotation for the weapon, leading to a very monotonous (and still underwhelming) experience.<br/><br/>We rebalanced the whole moveset, significantly increasing the usability of both standard Light and Heavy attacks while leaving the stagger and power of activated attacks mostly unchanged.<br/><br/>We also added a new Vanguard Light attack performed during a Slide, and new attack chains which will reward mastering the weapon by performing the correct attack strings in different situations.<br/><br/>For example, players could lead with an activated Heavy 1 into a flurry of Light Strikedowns (Special activate &gt; H1 &gt; LFollow-up &gt; L1 &gt; L2 &gt; repeat) to quickly pile on damage on priority targets while keeping players safe due to the initial staggering explosion; or clear crowds by reaching the Light 3 &gt; Light 4 attack loop through Heavy attacks or the brand new Light slide attack (H1 &gt; H2 &gt; L3 &gt; L4 &gt; L3 &gt; L4 &gt; ... / LSlide &gt; L4 &gt; L3 &gt; L4 &gt; ...).<br/><br/>We will monitor the performance of the weapon and player feedback after the changes to evaluate possible additional adjustments!<br/><br/><b>Detailed changes:</b><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Light follow-up attack from Heavy 1 changed from Vanguard to Strikedown damage profile</li><li>Heavy 2 now chains into Light 3 / Heavy 1 (instead of Light 1 / Heavy 1)</li><li>Added an attack start from Slide, chaining into Heavy 1 and a new Light slide attack with Vanguard profile (same as Light 3 / Light 4):</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The new Light slide attack chains into Light 4 / Heavy 2.</li></ul><li>Lowered the total action time of the Special activate action from 2.6 to 1.2 seconds.</li></ul><b>Dev Note:</b> <i>Activation time will remain unaffected at 0.8 seconds, but it will be easier to chain into the new Light slide attack.</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Aligned windup time for all Heavy attacks to 0.6 seconds</li></ul><b>Dev note:</b> <i>"Windup time" is the minimum amount of time an Heavy attack needs to be charged before being released</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Light 1 / Light 2 Strikedown profile:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Changed stagger duration from {0.1, 0.5} to {0.1, 2.5}</li><li>Changed inherent finesse boost multiplier from 0.25 to 1</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac from 0.5 to 0.75</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Carapace armour from 0.25 to 0.5</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Flak armour from 1 to 0.9</li><li>Equalised finesse boost to 0.5 against all armour types.</li></ul><li>Light 3 / Light 4 Vanguard profile:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Flak from 0.75 to 0.9</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Unyielding from 0.75 to 0.8</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac from 0.5 to 0.7</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Carapace from 0.25 to 0.65</li><li>Cleave from medium to big</li><li>Added a 4th target damage profile</li><li>Power distribution from 1st (target) {60,120} / 2nd {35,70} / 3rd {25,50} / 4th n/a / Default {10,20} to 1st {80,150} / 2nd {60,110} / 3rd {40,80} / 4th {25,60} / Default {10,30}.</li></ul></ul><b>Dev Note: </b><i>These changes will be also applied to the Ogryn Slab Shield L3 and L4 attacks.</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Light 3 / Light 4 Vanguard Special activated profile:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Power distribution override from {90,165} to {120,200}.</li></ul><li>Heavy 1 / Heavy 2 Relentless profile:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Flak from 0.75 to 0.9</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Unyielding from 1 to 0.8</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac from 0.5 to 0.8</li><li>Armor Damage Modifier against Carapace from 0.25 to 0.75</li><li>Power distribution from 1st (target) {120,220} / 2nd {80,110} / 3rd {20,30} / 4th {10,25} / Default {5,10} to 1st {175,350} / 2nd {80,160} / 3rd {60,120} / 4th {50,100} / Default {40,80}.</li></ul><li>Heavy 1 / Heavy 2 Relentless Special activated profile:</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Power distribution override from {220,440} to {250,475}.</li></ul></ul><br/><i>Please continue reading via pt. 2.</i>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h2">Hi Space Marines! ‚≠ê </div><br/>The Public Test Server opens March 13! Check out this quick FAQ to help you get started and ready before launch.<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png"/><br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What‚Äôs a Public Test Server?</div><br/>Space Marine 2‚Äôs Public Test Server works as a separate version of the game featuring WIP content and features. Share your feedback to help us refine the patch before its official release. Your input provides an important perspective that will be reviewed by the developer team and have an impact on further game updates.<br/><br/><b>Since this is a test environment, expect the unfinished content and possible bugs. As you will access it through a different game version, your progression will not be tracked.</b> For each PTS update, you will land on the game with levels maxed out and all weapons unlocked.<br/><br/>Please note that the DLCs won‚Äôt be available, regardless of whether you own them.<br/>‚Äé <br/>Since the PTS is "Public", you are free to create content based on it. No NDA will be included.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Which platforms can access the PTS?</div><br/>The PTS is only available on PC via Steam. It is not accessible on consoles (PlayStation/Xbox) or through the Epic Games Store.<br/><br/>Now, let‚Äôs see how to install it üëá<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">üìù <u>Tutorial on how to access PTS via Steam:</u></div><br/><div class="bb_h3">Just follow these simple steps:</div><ol><li> Open the Steam client.<br/></li><li> Log in with the account that owns Space Marine 2.<br/></li><li> Go to your Steam Library.<br/></li><li> Look for ‚Äú<b>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Public Test Server</b>‚Äù under your Space Marine 2 entry.<br/></li><li> (Optional) Right-click on your Library entry and go to Properties. In the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù tab, set the game‚Äôs default Language to ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù. <i>Translations may still be work-in-progress when you try the new content out on the PTS. <b>As a result, we recommend setting the game to English</b>.</i><br/></li><li> Once you‚Äôve clicked on this entry, install the Public Test Server content. This install instance is not related to the base game, your files will remain in separate directories and all future updates will also be distinct, meaning that your current progression will not be affected by the time you spend on the PTS.</li></ol><b>When the install is complete, the Public Test Server is ready to launch!</b><br/><br/>Click ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù like you would with any other game!<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Can I try every single feature that will be implemented with the next Patch?</div>Most upcoming content will be available to you. However, we won‚Äôt share content that is too buggy or hasn‚Äôt undergone the necessary approvals on our side at the time of the PTS release. Also, some content might be present on the PTS, but not accessible to the players. For instance, you may see new Champions in the Armouring Hall but won‚Äôt be able to try them.<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">How long will the PTS be active?</div><br/>The PTS will run until Patch 7.0 officially launches.<br/><br/>After that, it will go dormant until the next major PTS update.<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Will my progress be saved?</div><br/>No, because the PTS runs as a completely separate game version. It does not carry over your previous progress in the game; instead, it provides all players with a default maxed-out level and weapons. This ensures that you won‚Äôt have to spend time to unlock all the features, especially the Prestige Ranks.<br/><br/>It will also not save your progress nor transfer it to the official game version afterwards.<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Is multiplayer available on the PTS?</div><br/>Yes, even private PvP lobbies will work so you can invite your Brothers and Sisters to play!<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Do mods work with the PTS?</div><br/>Mods won't work with the PTS. <b>Enabling them will cause the PTS to crash at launch. Please, make sure to disable them beforehand.</b><br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">How can I give feedback?</div><br/>We need your feedback!<br/><br/>As mentioned in previous Community Updates, the primary purpose of the Public Test Server is to gather your feedback on new content, changes, and balancing tweaks we plan to implement in the game.<br/><br/><b>Our main focus will be on PvE Prestige Ranks and Weapon Perks. Feedback on these two items will be the most beneficial.</b><br/><br/>We‚Äôve set up dedicated forum threads on Focus Together to let you voice your opinion, which you can find here.<br/><br/>Thank you for helping us make Space Marine 2 the best it can be!<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png"/><br/> ‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What‚Äôs included in Patch 7.0 on the PTS?</div><br/>For this first session, you‚Äôll be able to check the upcoming content of Patch 7.0, which includes:<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">PvE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>PvE Prestige Ranks</b><br/></li><li> PvE New Map - Exfiltration (excluding final bossfight). Please note that when reaching the final boss arena, the "Victory" screen starts as soon as you interact with the terminal and the classic mission end behaviour follows (loadings, result screens and return to Battle Barge).<br/></li><li> Weapons Class Restrictions changed (PvE Only: classes now have access to more weapons)<br/></li><li> Improved PvE Matchmaking (reduces the chance of joining a team with the same class)</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">PvP</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Custom PvP Lobby</b><br/></li><li> Matchmaking improvements for better team balancing</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">GENERAL</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Weapons Perks Rework</b><br/></li><li> <b>New Secondary Weapon - Inferno Pistol (PvE and PvP).</b><br/></li><li> New Colors available in the Armouring Hall: Volupus Pink + Thousand Sons Blue<br/></li><li> Cloth coloring for Bulwark<br/></li><li> Option to color hands separately from arms</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">DLC</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ‚ÄúSpace Wolves‚Äù Chapter Pack: present in-game but not playable.<br/></li><li> "Imperial Fist" Champion Pack: present in-game but not playable.</li></ul><br/>Thank you for your dedication.<br/><div class="bb_h3">The Emperor Protects.</div>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h1">Hey Everyone,</div>Ahead of our Unlocked and Loaded update last year (aka Itemization), we released the intended balancing changes ahead of the rest of the patch notes. The idea was to give players a sneak peek ahead of time, and to allow the players time to give their feedback.<br/><br/>We‚Äôre doing it again.<br/><br/>
<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ota9aM8ePr4?fs=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" width="850"></iframe>
<br/><br/>For Nightmares and Visions, we will be including a rework to the Ogryn Talent Tree and a series of Weapon balance changes.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Part 1 (Ogryn Talent Tree Rework)<br/></li><li> Part 2 (Ogryn Weaponry Balancing)<br/></li><li> Part 3 (Additional Weapon Changes and Tweaks)</li></ul>To tell us more about our proposed changes, we‚Äôve brought along two developers who assisted with the work: Gunnar (Ogryn) and Matteo (Weapons).<br/><br/>Without further ado, we‚Äôll pass the dev blog over to Gunnar to talk about the‚Ä¶<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Ogryn Talent Tree Rework</div><br/><b>Left Branch / Skullbreaker</b><i>The Left part of the Tree has been very focused on the use of Heavy Attacks. While we do think that Heavy Attacks are thematic to the Ogryn, it should not be the only viable Melee focused Build.</i><br/><i>We‚Äôve removed the ‚ÄòHeavy‚Äô restrictions on some Talents, added new Melee focused Talents without it, and reworked some Talents to provide different bonuses depending on if you‚Äôre using Light, or Heavy, attacks.</i><br/><b>Middle Branch / Bodyguard</b><i>We‚Äôve felt that the Ogryn has been lacking interesting options for the Bodyguard playstyle, and have added many new Talents that allow you to explore both Tank Builds, as well as Supportive Builds.</i><br/><b>Right Branch / Gun Lugger</b><i>We‚Äôre updating the Burst Limiter Override Keystone to be better overall for any Ranged Build, along with its modifiers. We‚Äôve also added nodes that flesh out a few Ranged Builds, focusing on critical hits, explosives or sustained fire.</i><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">You can now find the Ogryn rework in the Gameslantern Darktide Build Editor. Under class select Ogryn Rework. Additionally, we also added it to the Ogryn Rework overview page.</div><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/115ddf04bf7e2c0bb15a893bd6d4de9ad7a51ecc.jpg"/><br/><i>Note: This is a WIP. We have not finished all the icons for this tree, etc. A final version will be included with the patch notes at release.</i><br/><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Existing Passives</div><b>Base Toughness</b><i> We've removed some Toughness from the Tree, and to make up for it we bumped the Base Toughness.</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Toughness: 50 to 75.</li></ul><b>Thick Skin</b><i>We've removed a few Defensive nodes from the Tree, and to make up for it we‚Äôve given the Ogryn a bump to his innate Tank Passive.</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Toughness Damage Reduction: 20% to 25%.</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Passives</div><b>Outta My Way!</b><i>The large hitbox of the Ogryn could get in its way on more than one occasion. Pox Hounds and Trappers were more difficult to avoid while not dodging, and even when dodging he could get stuck on nearby Horde Enemies, abruptly canceling the dodge and leaving him vulnerable. </i><br/><i>We‚Äôre giving the Ogryn a new passive ability that should make his Dodges more consistent, while also doubling down on the theme of our Brutish friend.</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Dodging staggers nearby Non Elite/Special, human-sized, enemies, knocking them out of the way. The effect is reduced on consecutive dodges.</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Combat Ability Changes</div><b>Loyal Protector</b><i> ‚ÄúRemoved ‚ÄòBig Lungs‚Äô talent, increased base value to make up for it.‚Äù</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Radius Increased - 8 to 12.</li></ul><b>Bull Rush</b><i>‚ÄúWill protect you from Flying Dogs, Nets, and Bullets.‚Äù</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>You now count as Dodging during Charge.</li></ul><b>Point Blank-Barrage</b><i>‚ÄúLowered the Reload Speed slightly to make room for new 'Keep Shooting Talent'.‚Äù</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Reload Speed - 70% to 65%.</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Combat Ability Talents</div><b>Loyal Protector <br/><i>No Pain! </i></b><i><br/>‚ÄúShould provide some good defense against the newly taunted enemies.‚Äù</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Loyal Protector Replenishes 25% Toughness and an additional 0.5% Toughness Replenished each 1s per enemy affected, to a maximum of 10%, for 10s.</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Blitz Ability Changes</div><b>Big Box of Hurt</b><i>‚ÄúShould let you be less stingy about when to use it.‚Äù</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Charges: 2 to 3.</li></ul><b>Big Friendly Rock</b><i>‚ÄúShould make it feel more reactive and incentivise weaving it in between weapon attacks more often.‚Äù</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Wield Time: 1s to 0.5s.</li><li>Chain Times: 0.6s to 0.4s.</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Blitz Ability Changes</div><b>Big Friendly Rock<br/><i>That One Didn't Count</i></b><i><br/>‚ÄúFor those with either great or poor precision‚Ä¶‚Äù</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Big Friendly Rock Replenishes a Charge if you hit an enemy Weakspot or hit no enemies. 5s Cooldown.</li></ul><b>Big Box of Hurt<br/><i>Bigger Box of Hurt</i></b><i><br/>‚ÄúTo make the Box a greater Crowd Control option.‚Äù</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>+3 Grenades Released.</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Coherency Changes</div><b>Stay Close!</b><br/><i>‚ÄúToughness gained through Coherency is less reliable, this should make the Coherency a lot more useful in a majority of situations.‚Äù</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>25% Coherency Toughness Replenishment to 15% All Toughness Replenishment.</li></ul><b>Coward Culling</b><br/><i>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve removed the +25% Suppression State Node, but still wanted to keep the effect in the Ranged Ogryn Builds.‚Äù</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>New Effect: +25% Suppression to you.</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Keystone Changes</div><div class="bb_h3">Heavy Hitter - Keystone</div><i>‚ÄúHeavy Hitter has been too focused on Heavy Attacks.

<div class="bb_h1"> Hey Everyone, </div><br/>Welcome back to part two of our Early Balance Look for our upcoming release, Nightmares &amp; Visions (coming out March 25, 2025).<br/><br/>
<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ota9aM8ePr4?fs=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" width="850"></iframe>
<br/><br/>In case you missed Pt. 1, you can read about the Ogryn Talent Tree rework on this previous post. <br/><br/>Now to pass the mic over to Matteo to discuss some other Balances and Tweaks coming in the upcoming patch.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Part 1 (Ogryn Talent Tree Rework)<br/></li><li> Part 2 (Ogryn Weaponry Balancing)<br/></li><li> Part 3 (Additional Weapon Changes and Tweaks)</li></ul><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1"> Weapon Balance Changes </div><br/>In this upcoming update, we are looking to address some of the outliers in the Darktide arsenal, whether over or under-performing.<br/><br/>We approached this objective by tweaking values, but also by adding new features and attack chains, or by shifting the power budget of the weapons, with the goal of giving each of them clear strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>In all cases, we made sure that the fantasy of each weapon was maintained or even reinforced by the changes.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1"> Ogryn Weaponry </div><br/><blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><i>‚ÄúOtherwise? ‚Äì<br/>Otthr‚Ä¶ Otews‚Ä¶ Or! We get mad, Sah!‚Äù</i></blockquote>Alongside the giant Talent tree rework, we looked at the weapon selection available to the Ogryn class to spice up some of those that fell a bit out of vogue.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Blastoom Mk III Grenadier Gauntlet</div><br/>The Ogryn Grenadier Gauntlet melee move-set was often not powerful enough to fulfill its role in this hybrid weapon type.<br/><br/>Conversely, on the ranged side, the ammo magazine and reserves became very punishing in target-rich environments, especially when paired with the longer-than-average reload speed.<br/><br/>We significantly increased the damage potential of the Strikedown melee attacks, while also changing the attack chained after the Light &gt; Heavy string to Light 1 / Heavy 1 to add an easy-to-use Relentless combo.<br/><br/>We also significantly raised the ammo reserves of the weapon and brought the ammo in the magazine up from 4 to 5, and slightly sped up the reload timing.<br/><br/>We slightly raised the fuse timer of the grenade to increase the effective range on longer distances, and made the projectiles ignore the damage reduction multiplier when hitting an enemy on a limb.<br/><br/>Finally, we increased the offensive properties of the Special attack, both for the direct punch hit and the following explosion.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes

from 1 to 1.25.</li></ul><li>The Special Explosion radius now scales with the Blast Size stat.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">Cleavers</div><br/>We significantly increased the damage of the Special punch, meaning it can now be used as an actual attack in combos, opening up effectively new attack chains.<br/><br/>While the damage against more heavily armoured enemies remains low, the Special uppercut will still be a reliable tool to stagger any target due to its high Impact values.<br/><br/>For <b>all three marks</b>, we fine-tuned the chain timings of different actions and increased the offensive properties of the Strikedown and Vanguard profiles.<br/><br/>We also slightly improved the dodge distance and speed and the timings related to Block and Push to make the weapon snappier.<br/><br/>For the<b> Krourk Mk VI</b>, we changed the Light 2 damage profile from Strikedown to Vanguard, which gave a small speed increase to the Heavy attacks, but also added a bespoke Heavy Strikedown attack chained only from Push.<br/><br/>This attack chains into Light 3¬† / Heavy 1, granting the weapon a new short but useful single target combo.<br/><br/>For the<b> Bull Butcher Mk III</b>, we changed the Pushfollow attack damage profile from Light Vanguard to Light Strikedown and added a unique Light Strikedown Stab chained only from the Pushfollow attack.<br/><br/>The new Light Strikedown Stab has a power level multiplier of 550 and chains into Light 1 / Heavy 1, for a quick and easy to use single target combo.<br/><br/>The<b> Krourk Mk IV </b>was already in a good spot after the overall changes to the weapon family, so we only slightly increased the power level multiplier of the Pushfollow attack to make it more useful as the opener for a horde control combo.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Cleavers</div><br/><b>Damage Profiles</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li><i>Special Uppercut¬†</i></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>1st target</li><ul

to remove excessive clunkiness and to give players encouragement to fully utilize their moveset, so the changes on this weapon family will be mainly related to rebalancing action chain times and the different attack profiles.<br/><br/>For<b> all marks</b>, we lowered the chain times to Block for most Light attacks to 0.1s, meaning that now the Block action will be more responsive (but also that the attacks will be canceled before entering the attack window if not careful).<br/><br/>We rebalanced the cleave values for Light Relentless and Light Vanguard attacks to better diversify the profiles, and increased the offensive properties of the Strikedown profiles.<br/><br/>We significantly lowered the chain times after performing the Special attacks of the folding marks (<b>Mk XIX</b> and <b>Mk V</b>), especially for the Light version to increase its use cases.<br/><br/>For the <b>Mk III</b>, we added a bespoke Light Strikedown attack chaining only from Heavy 1 and chaining back to Light 3 / Heavy 1.<br/><br/>We also significantly increased the offensive potential of the Special punch, while tweaking its reach and hitbox to better match the animation.<br/><br/>These changes will give the mark easier but also more interesting decisions when chaining together attacks for single target combos.<br/><br/>We also slightly increased the power level multiplier for the Light 3 attack, as it was further into the attack chain structure, and improved the offensive properties of the Pushfollow attack.<br/><br/>For the <b>Mk XIX</b>, we increased the power level multiplier of the Heavy 2 and Light 3 / Light 4 attacks, to incentivize their use instead of resetting the combo by Block or swap canceling.<br/><br/>The <b>Mk V</b> didn‚Äôt need a lot of targeted changes, so we limited ourselves to a small bump to the Pushfollow attack.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Brute-Brainer Latrine Shovels</div><br/><b>Damage Profiles</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li><i>Light

(the amount of shotgun pellets that are always considered hitting an enemy, even if they were actually hit by a lower amount of pellets) between the Hipfire and Braced fire modes for <b>all marks.</b><br/><br/>We then increased the speed of the Brace action to make it faster to transition to Braced shooting.<br/><br/>Before, shooting in Braced mode was often less effective than just Hipfiring, especially from mid range and further.<br/><br/>After the changes, the choice between the mobile Hipfire mode and the less agile but more controllable Braced mode will be more engaging.<br/><br/>We also increased the ammo reserves of the weapon and slightly increased its ranged cleave values for <b>all marks.</b><br/><br/>Finally, we significantly increased the offensive properties of Special bayonet attack and reduced the movement speed penalty when shooting in Hipfire mode, to further enhance the ‚Äúassault‚Äù theme of the weapon.<br/><br/>For the <b>Mk VI,</b> we increased its default pellet count and raised the Finesse multiplier, improving the reliability of the shots while also rewarding precise aiming.<br/><br/>We also slightly lowered the move speed reduction when in Braced stance and tightened the Braced spread profile to be more horizontal and less scattered overall, to further differentiate the Hipfire and Braced modes for this mark.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Foe-Rend Ripper Guns</div><br/><b>Ammo</b><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Ammunition reserves from (12*6,24*7) to (12*6,24*8).</li><ul

damage of the Light Strikedown, Heavy Strikedown, Light Vanguard, Heavy Relentless profiles.<br/><br/>We rebalanced the armour modifiers against specific armour types, in particular lowering the Unyielding modifiers (which were extremely high on some profiles) and raising the Carapace armour and traitor Captain Conversion Field ones.<br/><br/>We then tweaked the damage and Impact falloff on secondary targets, removing damage caps while still maintaining a curve skewed towards the first targets.<br/><br/>For the Special Slap, we increased the damage of the attack and rebalanced its Stagger properties, lowering the weakspot bonus but increasing the base Impact values. We also greatly improved the chain timings to the Block action.<br/><br/>We also tweaked the chain timings on<b> all marks</b>, often lowering the values to make actions flow better into each other, but also adding more commitment when performing Heavy attacks.<br/><br/>For the "Brunt Special" <b>Mk I</b>, we added a new Heavy Strikedown attack chaining only from Heavy 1 and chaining back into Light 3 / Heavy 1, to introduce a very easy to perform Strikedown combo to the weapon.<br/>The previous Heavy 2 Relentless attack will still be chainable from Light 1, but it will also be available now after a Push action.<br/><br/>Additionally, the weapon will chain into Light 1 / Heavy 1 instead of Light 3 / Heavy 1 after a Pushfollow attack, granting a fast Vanguard combo when controlling enemy crowds.<br/><br/>For the "Brunt's Pride" <b>Mk II,</b> we significantly enhanced the properties of the unique Light Punch performed after any Special attack, to more easily follow up after having staggered an enemy with a Slap.<br/><br/>We also increased the power of the Light 4 attack, and made it more reachable through new combo chains from Light Punch and Heavy 2 &gt; Light 3.<br/><br/>Since the "Brunt's Basher" <b>Mk IIIb </b>Heavy Relentless attack loop is now slightly less performant against single targets, we reworked the combos of this weapon to introduce additional routes.<br/><br/>We added a new Heavy Strikedown attack chaining only from Light 3 and chaining back to Light 1 / Heavy 1, and we changed the chain after Heavy 2 to go into Light 3 / Heavy 1. Building on the already existing Pushfollow attack &gt; Light 3 combo, this will add more opportunities to perform Strikedown attack strings to dispatch any foe.<br/><br/>We also increased the power of the Light 4 attack, as it was otherwise hard to utilize being very far into the Light attack chain.<br/><br/>Finally, we added a minimum time of 0.3s to the Block action to align the weapon to<b> the other two marks</b>.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Bully Clubs</div><br/><b>Damage Profiles</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li><i>Light Relentless</i></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tweaked adm

<div class="bb_h1">Hey Everyone,</div>Welcome back to part THREE of our Early Balance Look for our upcoming release, <b>Nightmares &amp; Visions</b> (coming out March 25, 2025).<br/><br/>
<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ota9aM8ePr4?fs=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" width="850"></iframe>
<br/><br/>In case you missed our previous parts or you want to go back and check:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Part 1 (Ogryn Talent Tree Rework)<br/></li><li> Part 2 (Ogryn Weaponry Balancing)<br/></li><li> Part 3 (Additional Weapon Changes and Tweaks)</li></ul><br/>Let's dive into the rest of the changes. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1"> Other Weapon Changes and Tweaks </div><br/><div class="bb_h2"> Catachan "Devil's Claw" Swords </div><br/>We performed some tweaks on the Devil‚Äôs Claw swords to improve their overall gameplay experience and enhance their niche as safe, reliable weapons.<br/><br/>We aligned the Block duration (the period of time in which the player is still considered blocking) for the Push action and the Riposte attack, but also the Stamina profile between the three marks.<br/><br/>For the <b>Mk I</b>, we lowered the windup timing for the Heavy 1 attack and added a chain opportunity from the Riposte attack to the Special Parry.<br/><br/>For the <b>Mk VII</b>, we lowered the windup timing for the Heavy 1 attack and slightly increased the speed of the Light 2 attack, improving its base horde clear combo.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"> Detailed Changes - Catachan "Devil's Claw" Swords </div><br/><b>All Marks</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Aligned Stamina profiles</li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Block cost (inner) from (1.5,0.5) to (1.0,0.5).</li><li>Sprint cost per second from (1.5,0.5) to (1.25,0.75).</li></ul></ul><b>Mk I</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Heavy 1 windup from 0.75 to 0.65.</li><li>Block duration for the Riposte attack from 0.2 to 0.5.</li><li>Added chain from Riposte attack to Special Parry (0.45 timing).</li></ul><b>Dev Note:¬†</b><i>The chain from Riposte attack to Special Parry is already present on the other two marks.</i><br/><b>Mk IV</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Block duration for Push action from 0.2 to 0.5.</li></ul><b>Mk VII</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Heavy 1 windup from 0.75 to 0.65.</li><li>Added time scale 1.1 to Light 2 (sped up).</li><li>Block duration for the Riposte attack from 0.2 to 0.5.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"> Ius Mk IV Shredder Autopistol </div><br/>After the power of the Pinning Fire blessing was decreased, the Autopistol lost most of its attractiveness, being often outgunned by alternatives and feeling overall very underwhelming.<br/><br/>To reinforce the weapon‚Äôs niche as an assault, ‚Äúspray n pray‚Äù SMG, we tweaked the movement speed curve when shooting in Hipfire mode: the move speed will be slightly slower when starting to fire, but will be significantly faster on prolonged shooting compared to before.<br/><br/>Additionally, we increased the damage and the Finesse multiplier in both Hipfire and Braced fire modes to bring up the baseline performance of the weapon.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"> Detailed Changes - Ius Mk IV Shredder Autopistol </div><br/><b>Hipfire Mode</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Adjusted the movement speed curve to be slightly slower when starting to shoot, but significantly faster on prolonged shooting.</li></ul><b>Hipfire &amp; Braced Fire Modes</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Attack power distribution from (40,80) to (50,95).</li><li>Finesse multiplier from (0.3,0.9) to (0.5,1.5).</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2"> Force Staves Quell Canceling </div><br/>When using Psyker Force Staves, the Quell action could be immediately ended by tapping and releasing its input.<br/><br/>However, this meant that the Quell action could be used to bypass the default chain times of other actions, and particularly allowed to chain the Primary fire action into another Primary fire action at a speed that was not intended.<br/><br/>We added a short minimum hold time period for the Quell action, meaning that the action will be performed for the specified amount of time even if the input is released earlier. This change will also guarantee that the first ‚Äútick‚Äù of Peril quelling will be reached by the Quell action, even when the action is interrupted at the earliest possible timing.<br/><br/>Alongside this, we slightly raised the chain time from Primary fire to the Quell action.<br/><br/>These two changes together will mean that it won‚Äôt be possible anymore to fire Primary shots faster than the intended chain timing.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"> Detailed Changes - Force Staves Quell Canceling </div><br/><b>Equinox Mk III Voidblast / Equinox Mk IV Voidstrike / Nomanus Mk VI Electrokinetic</b><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Added minimum hold time 0.26 to the Quell action.</li><li>Chain time from Primary fire to Quell from 0.2 to 0.29.</li></ul><b>Rifthaven Mk II Inferno</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Added minimum hold time 0.3 to the Quell action.</li><li>Chain time Primary fire to Quell from 0.3 to 0.4.</li></ul><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Special Activations Reset By Stun</div><br/>Several weapons which have a Special action activation could have their activation state reset after being stunned (including when hit by a melee attack).<br/><br/>While the behavior was originally intended to balance the always-available nature of these powerful Special actions, player feedback indicated that this mechanic was not perceived as engaging, leading often to frustrating moments.<br/><br/>Given also the increased intensity of fights and enemy spawns in harder difficulties, we decided to allow for the affected weapons to keep the Special active after being stunned, as being hit is usually enough punishment by itself.<br/><br/><b>Dev Note:</b><i>The change will not affect situations where the player fully stops wielding the weapon, such as stuns and dislocations from explosions or specific Monstrosity attacks.</i><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Special Activations Reset by Stun</div><b>Special Action</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Allowed the following weapons to remain active after a stun:<ul class="bb_ul"><li>Scandar Mk III Power Sword</li><li>Achlys Mk VI Power Sword</li><li>Crucis Mk II Thunder Hammer</li><li>Ironhelm Mk IV Thunder Hammer</li><li>Indignatus Mk IVe Crusher</li><li>Achlys Mk I Power Maul</li><li>Covenant Mk VI Blaze Force Greatsword</li><li>Covenant Mk VIII Blaze Force Greatsword.</li><li>Tigrus Mk III Heavy Eviscerator.</li></ul></li></ul><b>Dev Note</b>:¬†<i>The Tigrus Mk XV Heavy Eviscerator was already not affected by the behavior.</i><br/><br/><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2"> Special Activations Reset by Vaulting </div><br/>All weapons which have a Special action activation will no longer have their activation state reset after vaulting over tall terrain or railings.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"> Detailed Changes - Special Activations Reset by Vaulting </div><br/><b>Special Action</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Allowed the following weapons to remain active after vaulting:<ul class="bb_ul"><li>Scandar Mk III Power Sword</li><li>Achlys Mk VI Power Sword</li><li>Crucis Mk II Thunder Hammer</li><li>Ironhelm Mk IV Thunder Hammer</li><li>Cadia Mk IV Assault Chainsword</li><li>Cadia Mk XIIIg Assault Chainsword</li><li>Orestes Mk IV Assault Chainaxe</li><li>Orestes Mk XII Assault Chainaxe</li><li>Tigrus Mk III Heavy Eviscerator</li><li>Tigrus Mk XV Heavy Eviscerator</li><li>Indignatus Mk IVe Crusher</li><li>Obscurus Mk II Blaze Force Sword</li><li>Deimos Mk IV Blaze Force Sword</li><li>Illisi Mk V Blaze Force Sword</li><li>Achlys Mk I Power Maul.</li></ul></li></ul><br/><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h2"> Attack Speed Buffs for Melee Attacks on Secondary Weapons</div><br/>Attack speed and melee attack speed buffs were not applied to most melee attacks performed with Secondary weapons (e.g. bash Special attacks), making their use often very niche.<br/><br/>To incentivize experimenting with them, we changed so that attack speed buffs will now affect these Special melee attacks.<br/><br/>Specifically for the<b> MK IIIa</b> and <b>MK V Helbore Lasguns</b>, we slightly increased the chain timings for the Special bayonet Light stab, as the attack was already very fast to repeat.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"> Detailed Changes - Attack Speed Buffs for Melee Attacks on Secondary Weapons </div><br/><b>All Secondary Weapons</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Allowed for Attack Speed buffs to affect melee attacks.</li></ul><b>Lucius MK IIIa Helbore Lasgun / Lucius MK V Helbore Lasgun</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Minimum windup time from Start Special attack to Special Light Stab from 0 to 0.1.</li><li>Chain time from Special Light Stab to Start Special attack from 0.575 to 0.635.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/>Almost forty pages later‚Ä¶.and we‚Äôve gotten through the upcoming Ogryn Talent Tree rework and some upcoming balancing changes for our next patch, Nightmares and Visions. It‚Äôs a lot!<br/><br/>Give this a read and let us know your thoughts in the comments below! We‚Äôll be reading the comments and feedback to our plans.<br/><br/>See you on the Mourningstar.<br/><br/>‚Äì The Darktide Team<br/><br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

Today, we‚Äôre talking about weapons. This dev blog will give you more of a behind the scenes look at creating these weapons for Grim Protocols. We‚Äôll include more information about their special attacks work and in-game information in the patch notes at release.<br/><br/>We‚Äôve got 3 brand new weapons coming to you with this update:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Two-Handed Power Sword (2 Marks) - Zealot</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Munitorum Mk X Relic Blade</li><li>Munitorum Mk II Relic Blade</li></ul><li><b>Two-Handed Force Sword (2 Marks) - Psyker</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Covenant Mk VI Blaze Force Greatsword</li><li>Covenant Mk VIII Blaze Force Greatsword</li></ul><li><b>Heavy Stubber (3 Marks) - Ogryn</b></li><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Krourk Mk IIa Heavy Stubber</li><li>Gorgonum Mk IIIa Heavy Stubber</li><li>Achlys Mk II Heavy Stubber</li></ul></ul>Remember the Itemization trailer?¬†üòâ<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/3568582a97a0e1629a2c58e522fbc5197ce5432e.png"/><br/><br/>For this dev blog, we‚Äôre going to talk to some devs about the general design direction, creating the animations, formulating the sounds, and bringing them to live through visual effects.¬†<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">General Design Direction</div><br/>For the design direction of these weapons, we spoke to Matteo A., Game Designer on Darktide, who worked on them.¬†<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What is the design target for the Heavy Stubbers? Was it difficult to place when the Twin Stubber already existed?</div>The design intent for the heavy stubbers was to give Ogryns some more precise long-range capabilities. Since we already had the Twin Linked Stubbers, it didn‚Äôt sound super interesting to only make them a less rapid fire version. Instead, we went with another approach.¬†<br/><br/>Ogryns being Ogryns, we imagined them using the Heavy Stubber as a sort of DMR (marksman rifle) weapon. This would allow them to lay down supportive fire with the primary fire and be very precise with the alternative fire. This broadens the Ogryn player's toolkit, enabling them to take on a wider variety of roles within the team.<br/><br/>We‚Äôve also added a flashlight to the Heavy Stubbers for the big guys, because they‚Äôve been in the dark too long.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Why is the Two-Handed Power Sword on the Zealot, when the Veteran already has the One Handed Power Sword?</div>The Two-Handed Power Sword is a giant greatsword with barely contained energy: its huge, sweeping swings and a unique sprinting Heavy stab attack, it just asks to get stuck in melee while frantically lobbing off the heretics' heads.<br/><br/>The weapon also sports a new bespoke activation mechanic: instead of having a fixed, stable amount of empowered swings (more appropriate to the ex-Guard regimented Veteran), a Heat gauge will increase while the weapon is activated. Upon reaching the Heat limit, the weapon will overheat and lock the player out of the Special activate for a short period.<br/><br/>Controlling the rising Heat while engaged in the thick of combat felt very much suited to the playstyle and fantasy of the Zealot: melee-focused, unbridled and overwhelming power.¬†<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">I‚Äôve noticed Veterans haven‚Äôt received a weapon this patch. Will we be left hungry?</div>Veterans won‚Äôt be left out for too long. They‚Äôll be receiving more next year.¬†<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What about the Force Swords?¬†</div><br/><i>&gt; Drops a video of the Force Greatsword special attack</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/c4103e3b68a4bb41560ba343547bbff73b1d4dc7.gif"/><br/><br/><i>&gt; Refuses to elaborate further<br/>&gt; Leaves</i><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Animation</div><br/>Next up to speak about animation for the new weapons is Jonas B., one of our Gameplay Animators.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What was the process like to animate the two-handed swords compared to the other swords in game?¬†</div>It was quite a similar process actually! Although this time around, I had to think more about weight shifting and gripping both hands instead of just one. Especially since they're, you know, pretty big. Usually, when I animate new weapons, I try to re-use and adjust some of the old animations if they‚Äôre similar or fitting enough to be something new. This time around it wasn‚Äôt the case, though.¬†<br/><br/>In the very beginning, I collected some references of HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) / Sword dueling videos. I also looked a bit into sword stances to gather inspiration. In the end, a lot of these inspirations were a bit subdued, or they were changed a bit for the sake of highlighting the personalities of the Psyker and Zealot. But changes were also made to make the weapons unique and fun with the weapon specials in mind.¬†<br/><br/>Specifically, the Two-Handed Power Sword is more forceful, reckless and heavy (Emperor guide my path!). Conversely, the Two-Handed Force Sword has more ‚Äúflowy‚Äù finesse and flair to its movements, which¬† showcases Psykers using psi-assisted techniques instead of proper training.¬†<br/><br/>In other words, you could find me posing and swinging around prop swords sometimes at my office desk or in the animation room to get a feeling of how to animate and handle the swords. (I'd like to think I looked pretty cool acting as a reckless and fervent Zealot, but it was probably quite silly. Maybe you can bribe StrawHat to show it to you one day.)<br/><br/>(<b>NOTE</b>: Also I want to shout out Oliviero M., for making an awesome solid groundwork for the Two-Handed Force Sword.)<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">How long have you been working on these weapons?</div>Hard to say to be honest. All the weapons have been in varying stages for a long time. Some were more functional than others. I think animation-wise the new Heavy Stubbers have been in a good place for a while. (<b>Note</b>: This only refers to animation-wise. We still needed to do testing and tweak numbers to make sure they felt right in-game.)<br/><br/>I started working on the Two-Handed Force Sword full-time a few months ago. It had quite a lot of solid groundwork done during the prototyping stage and functional stage. I think the groundwork was done earlier.¬†<br/><br/>The Two-Handed Power Sword had its very basic groundwork a while back, but we wanted to focus on other weapons first. Coincidentally, I started working on the Two-Handed Power Sword roughly at the same time as the Two-Handed Force Sword.¬†<br/><br/>In general, these weapons have been worked on bit by bit. It‚Äôs taken time, because they‚Äôve both gone through quite a lot of reworks and iterations. We‚Äôve changed how the weapon special attacks worked. We began taking a new approach by adding unique conditional actions that lead to different attacks depending on whether a player is running, sprinting or sliding. This meant I had to return and change some animations and transitions on these weapons to make sure they worked as intended.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What were some of the challenges you faced while working on the animations?</div>The biggest challenge this time around was probably making sure the Two-Handed Power Sword Weapon Special did not feel disruptive in the attack chain flow, yet still be visible enough for activating and deactivating. Considering how the activation system works for the Two-Handed Power Sword, it meant that the weapon needed an activate/deactivate animation for most cases after swings (left-side, right-side, idle, sprint).¬†<br/><br/>But it also needed support for activate/deactivate when sprinting due to being able to start attacks while in a sprint. There were quite a few custom animation transitions made for the activate/deactivate animation to make sure it could blend into the action from any point in the gameplay, such as hitstops, shield-hitstops, blocks, etc.¬†<br/><br/>Another challenge for both the swords was that we allowed them to be able to start charging a heavy attack while being in a sprinting state. This itself is not a very large deal, but this change caused a lot of unexpected animation bugs leading into attack chains, which needed to be addressed.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Any comments or thoughts on what it was like to animate the Ogryn stubbers?</div>It‚Äôs always a treat to animate Ogryns. There‚Äôs something magical about them when it comes to animating them. I think it might be because they‚Äôre such brutes that allow you to animate ridiculous, but lovable actions. You‚Äôll see an example of this when you turn on the flashlight for the heavy stubbers. Most of their problems are usually solved by brute force or heavy firepower.¬†<br/><br/>That said, it was very satisfying to animate a weapon that is quite heavy and powerful in fire-power and brutish in handling such a weapon.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Are there any fun bits of trivia?</div>In the very beginning the Two-Handed Power Sword was known as the ‚ÄúOgryn Jousting weapon‚Äù amongst some of the animators of Fatshark. This is mostly because the unique sprinting pose very much resembled someone charging forward ready to strike. We joked around about how the humans were piggy-riding on Ogryns with the swords pointed forward, in a joust-like fashion.¬†<br/><br/>Also, the sprint stab animation (Sprint &gt; Heavy Stab attack) on Two-Handed Power Swords was just a fun prototype thingy, which kinda led us to add conditional attacks for the weapons, things such as attacks made from equip, slide and such.¬†<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Sounds</div><br/>Our next section is about building the sounds for the new weapons. For this, we have Jonas H. entering the blog!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What was it like designing the sound for the new Power Sword and Force Sword? Did you do anything to make them distinct? What was your thought process?</div>My first focus was to make both two-handed swords feel heavy, so I needed to make foley* and hit sounds that gave that feeling.<br/><br/>(* You might be asking what foley means: Foley is the sound for handling the weapon. It‚Äôs all about the small details: like touching and grabbing the sword, the small clinks and clanks when you walk, etc.)<br/><br/>For the Two-Handed Power Sword special attacks, I wanted it to still feel like it was in the same family as the 1H counterpart, but I tried to embrace the fantasy that when activated it should both feel and sound cool when hitting enemies. And as the window of the activation was fairly short, I could make the hits a bit louder, while not making it tiresome in the long run.<br/><br/>The Two-Handed Force Sword took the longest to make because the way the special worked was changed a lot during development (like the other Jonas mentioned above). I wanted the wave and the explosive hits on the enemies to also feel satisfying, so it took some time to find a good balance. It was also important to me to make the warp sound design surrounding this weapon to feel connected to its sibling, the 1H Force Sword. A lot of experimentation was done to find the right vibe in swings and activation information for this weapon.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">When it comes to designing guns for Ogryns, are there any differences compared to designing the sounds for the human classes?</div>Compared to the swords, the stubbers are more grounded.¬† I tried to make them feel different from the faster Twin Stubbers. I did this by making more mechanical sounds in the background while shooting, and adding another flavor to the shots. They are slower and heavy, and that was the goal sound wise, as well.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Visual Effects</div><br/>To round this BTS dev blog off, we‚Äôve got Felicia K., one of our VFX Artists, to talk to you about her process.¬†<br/><br/>Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Felicia and I work with visual effects (VFX) for Darktide. To start off, for those who don‚Äôt know what a Visual Effect Artist does at a game studio, I create effects for both environment and combat. For the environment, it can be things like rain, fire, dust, smoke, steam and much more. For combat, it‚Äôs more muzzle flashes for guns, impact effects on enemies like blood and explosions, the list goes on. I work very closely with a lot of different roles at the studio. Most of the time my role comes in later in the process, since I need to know what is happening in the levels or the combat to be able to brainstorm my part of the process.¬†<br/><br/>When I started to work on the new swords I was very hyped. I knew that these weapons would be a little bit different from what I‚Äôve worked on before, especially the Two-Handed Force Sword.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Two-Handed Force Sword</div><br/>I heard from the combat designers that the Two-Handed Force Sword would have a force cleave coming out of the sword that you would charge up. Almost like a wind slash in some other games. But of course we would need it to look much more brutal and more Warhammer 40,000.¬†<br/><br/>From here, the brainstorming begins for me. How does the effect feel? How does it behave? What is it? What is the style for this effect? So this is what I wrote down as the description:¬†<br/><br/>Style/Mood: Wispy/Souls to separate the Force Sword from the Power Sword that already has lightning. The Power Sword feels a lot more ‚Äúrough‚Äù than the Force Sword. Make it ‚ÄúWispy‚Äù in the effects as a whole.¬†<br/><br/>I wanted the Two-Handed Force Sword to be soft and smooth but still feel very powerful. It has 3 different stages on the cleave depending on how powerful the charge is. To show this visually, I made them different sizes and added some extra effects on the most powerful one, like smoke and sparks.<br/><br/>After the cleave was done, I worked on the charge that you do on the sword itself before you can shoot the cleave. There was some back and forth on how it should look. We knew it should indicate that you can have enough power to charge up the cleave, and to make that clear I created a screen space effect (AKA an effect that spawns on the screen). I also added a small blue fire-like effect that would spawn on the sword when you have enough power.¬†<br/><br/>It‚Äôs always a challenge when working with visual effects to make sure you as a player understand what is happening, but not take over and be too much, so you can focus on your gameplay. It needs to be balanced. You don‚Äôt want effects all over your screen just to indicate something. But you still need to see the effects enough, so you can understand ‚Äúoh I have enough power to charge my forcesword‚Äù even in the middle of an intense combat fight.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/722a5f00c0ae055bc2ba908a87156380163d22a3.png"/><br/><br/>My own beautiful (not so beautiful) sketch of the indicator of when you have reached a certain charge. It turned out a little bit different when I actually started to work on it, but it‚Äôs always good to go back to your mood board/description to not lose track of what you‚Äôre aiming for, because you can easily forget along the way.¬†<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Two-Handed Power Sword</div>So if the Two-Handed Force Sword would feel smooth and powerful, I wanted the Two-Handed Power Sword to feel more rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll. I wanted this sword to feel more rough when it comes to the effects. To accomplish this, the lightning is spawning and it is pretty big when you activate the weapon.¬†<br/><br/>You also have a time limit before it overcharges. For this, I thought it should look/feel like an engine on a car that‚Äôs failing and there‚Äôs smoke coming out of it to indicate ‚Äúyou should probably de-activate so it doesn't break‚Äù.¬†<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/07fe648515acd5f0c07897b5221bc980d80f7991.png"/><br/><br/>This is another example of a sketch I did. It‚Äôs for when you‚Äôve reached the overcharged.¬†<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Heavy Stubbers</div><br/>But hey, let‚Äôs not forget the new Heavy Stubbers! As a hardcore Ogryn player, I was super happy to get some more ranged weapons for the Ogryn, and even more happy to be able to work on them.¬†<br/><br/>First of all, when you work as a visual effect artist, you have a lot of odd search history. I look at a lot of military videos as reference when working with guns, and also explosions. The Heavy Stubbers are big and powerful, and like I‚Äôve written before, I need to decide: how do the effects feel? How do they act? How much of the effects do you see when you shoot?¬†<br/><br/>When researching for the Heavy Stubbers I looked at a lot of 50.cal weapons, like in this video:¬†<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFB7-bvVKs8<br/><br/>When you look at the video, the gun is so powerful that you can almost only see smoke, almost no muzzle flash at all. But since this is a video game, we need some more feedback than just smoke when shooting. For this, I added a very small muzzle flash and smoke for the heavy stubbers to indicate that this weapon has such force when shooting, that you can‚Äôt see a lot of fire like when shooting a shotgun (and shotguns also have more spread when shooting in general).¬†<br/><br/>Hope that you find this interesting and that you like the new weapons, it was a blast to work on them!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/>Alright, that‚Äôs our BTS dev blog on the making of the new weapons coming to Grim Protocols on December 3, 2024.¬†<br/><br/>On release, we‚Äôll include more information about how the weapons work in-game and their special activations.¬†<br/><br/>Let us know if you have any questions for the team in the comments below!<br/><br/>‚Äì The Darktide Team]]></description>

Similar to when we released the Introduction to Itemization dev blog over the summer, we‚Äôve received a lot of comments and questions.¬†<br/><br/>For Itemization, we answered these in the form of a couple of Q&amp;A posts, and we thought it would be a great format to use for discussing Havoc, as well.¬†<br/><br/>We‚Äôll compile the most common remaining questions after this post and we‚Äôll answer them in the patch notes when it is released on 3 December.<br/><br/>Something that has changed since the last dev blog is the nomenclature used in this game mode. From now on we will be calling what was previously known as a Havoc Order a Havoc Assignment (aka the current mission a player is assigned), and what was previously known as your Havoc Rank will now be known as your Havoc Clearance Level (the highest Havoc Assignment you‚Äôve cleared - whether it‚Äôs your own or through the party finder).<br/><br/>We‚Äôd also like to say these are the answers we have NOW. Our plan is to evaluate further after release and read player feedback to the game mode. From there, we can see if anything needs to be adjusted or changed by working with the community. We see this as the start of a long journey and will keep tweaking it just like any other system in the game.<br/><br/>Thank you for your passion for Darktide and we hope we can answer the most burning questions we‚Äôve seen.¬†<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Are FS concerned about people alt-F4ing this? For the Auric titles it was just the title but this is an entire game mode.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>‚ÄúAlt+F4:ing‚Äù to circumvent the system is something we‚Äôve taken into account, there are two solutions to this issue, one which is bespoke to Havoc and the other a general solution. If a Havoc Assignment (Havoc Order) owner leaves mid-mission <b>without reconnecting</b> it will automatically count as a loss regardless of the result of the mission for that player. It will also mean that the player receives no rewards for the attempt, and it will use up one of the three attempts for that specific Havoc Assignment level.<br/><br/>However, players who remain in the Mission will still be able to complete the mission; if they do, it will count as a win for the remaining players.<br/><br/>ALT+F4:ing to circumvent being ‚Äúdowned‚Äù to complete harder penances has been an issue with the Auric penance, and to this end, we‚Äôve introduced more checks when players reconnect.** Players will now respawn back with the health count they had upon leaving, instead of being spawned with a minimal % of hp, and players who ALT+F4 to get around being downed will now spawn back hogtied.<br/><br/>**This is a game wide change coming with Grim Protocols, it is not exclusive to Havoc.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Do we select the 1-5 difficulty level when playing Havoc or are these missions working on a completely different system, where difficulty is fixed?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Havoc has its own difficulty structure that is loosely based on the normal difficulties. The way players can choose difficulty is by either starting their Havoc Assignment (Havoc Order) by gathering some friends or by starting a group through the party finder. Likewise if you fancy another mission configuration you can look through the party finder and join one there.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>If I complete my Havoc Assignment (Havoc Order) as soon as it‚Äôs available, do I have to wait a week before I‚Äôm given a new one?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>You can complete as many Havoc Assignments in a row as you like. The only thing that is on a weekly cadence is the weekly reward which is based on the highest Havoc Assignment you were able to complete during the previous week.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>I‚Äôm confused about how the decay system works for Havoc.<b><br/><br/>Answer</b><br/>Yes, let‚Äôs clarify the fluid ranking system using the new nomenclature written in the intro of this dev blog. It has changed a bit since the last dev blog after reading feedback.<br/><br/>A player‚Äôs Havoc Clearance Level will update on a weekly basis based on the highest Havoc Assignment they completed the previous week (whether it was their own Assignment or played through the Party Finder).¬†<br/><br/>As long as a player is active within the Havoc system during any given week they will not automatically decay at the end of the week. We will however keep an eye on how this system plays out in reality and adjust the rules accordingly.¬†<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Can you replay your completed Havoc Assignment levels? Like if I was at level 20 but wanted to bust down to 5, could I do that on my own? Or would I need to find someone with a level 5 Assignment to join?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>You cannot replay depleted / completed missions since the missions are uniquely generated. If you‚Äôd like to take a break and play a lower-rank Assignment you can instead find a compatible team on the party finder with the Assignment you like. The same goes for the opposite: if you want to try your hands on an Assignment that is higher than the one you currently own, you can find a team that is playing a higher one and ask to join them.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Is Havoc level character locked like Melk contracts (well trust level is, so‚Ä¶) so we‚Äôll have to level our 4 characters at the same time each week?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Havoc is not locked to a specific character, ‚Äúergo‚Äù Havoc is account-wide. With Havoc our intent is for players to adapt to the Havoc Assignment at hand by selecting the correct character, talents, weapons, blessing and curios to best take on the challenge. However, your character still needs to be level 30 to be able to join a Havoc mission.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Will new garb be also character locked then? (Level up operative to gain access to new Moebian cosmetics for that class).<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The cosmetics from Havoc are account-wide. (The same as any other cosmetic in the game.)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>What determines the max difficulty that I can currently play?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>As long as a player is level 30 and can find a group that is willing to take them along, a player could in theory play any Assignment level at any time.¬†<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Do I get access to a difficulty, based on my current highest completed? Can I access all difficulties &lt;= my current max, or only 1 diff at a time?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>At all times you have access to your own Assignment. If you feel like playing a lower Assignment level the way to do so would be to find a party with a lower Assignment level in the party finder and vice versa if you are looking for a higher Assignment level than what you currently own.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Does my max available mission difficulty get reset every week?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Your maximum available mission difficulty will move forward with you into the next week. Each week players will get a new Havoc Assignment based on the highest Assignment they completed the previous week.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Do i need to play from diff 1-40 within a single week in order to get to rank 40, unless i just join someone else's high diff mission?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, you will continue the next week at the same level that you left off the previous week. The only thing that is weekly dependent is the weekly reward that is based on the highest-ranked mission you completed during the week.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>What happens when my rank drops? Do I lose access to the higher difficulty missions?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>You will always be able to play any Assignment Level that you want to play and are able to find a group that will play with you. Your own Havoc Assignment only dictates which mission you can start yourself. But if you can find a group that is playing a higher-ranked mission that you can join you will be able to do so. Your weekly reward will be based on the highest-ranked mission you have completed. Next week your Havoc Assignment will be set to the highest mission you have completed the previous week.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>To clarify, I‚Äôm pretty sure the modifiers at levels 1-40 are fixed for all players (possibly forever?). The only thing different for each player at the same level is the mission and mutators?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Havoc Assignment‚Äôs difficulty is composed of two components, one is the static negative modifiers we apply per Level basis and are additive so each Assignment will include everything from the previous one, the other part is generated per Assignment basis and includes the Mission, Theme, and mutators.¬†<br/><br/>Over time we‚Äôll continue adding more mutators into the pool, but more on that at a later time‚Ä¶<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>I don‚Äôt understand how matchmaking is going to work with this. There is no quickplay, but you can just queue into it? What does that mean for matchmaking? will it try to find 3 other players who are close to your ‚Äòlevel‚Äô?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Due to the vast amount of permutations in the mode, there will not be any matchmaking in this game mode. Also the difficulty is so significant that you will want to tailor the group more specifically than a matchmaking service could do effectively. This is one of the reasons we created the Group Finder, which we hope will see a significant increase in use with the release of this feature.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Does this mean that it will take at least 40 weeks for the first players to reach Hacoc Clearence Level 40?<br/><br/>Assuming the answer to the previous question is no, (ie, that when you gain or lose an Assigment Level you can immediately attempt your new Assignment Level), if you are demoted from Clearance Level 20 to 19, but then beat Level 19 and move back up to Level 20, will your new Havoc Assignemnt 20 still be the same as it was the first time?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>You will be able to reach Havoc Clearance Level 40 as fast as you and your team can complete the Assignments required to do so. There is no time gating happening when it comes to the number of assignments possible to complete in a given week. When you complete a Havoc Assignment, a new one will be designated to you by Darinda Dukane as soon as you report back to her. The new Assignment will not be the same as the previous one if you go up or down in Assignment level.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>I would like to ask what happens to a player‚Äôs Havoc rating if they quit before the match completes?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Leaving before a Havoc mission ends will result in a loss for the player. It will also lock you out of starting another Havoc (only Havoc mission) until the mission has ended. If you are the Assignment holder, you will lose one of the attempts at the Havoc Assignment level.¬†<br/><br/><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="width=624,height=29"/>https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdoZbRX-cWzyCOZVGm0HA7aXYhRTHwCSnWS65GCU3lJziMFiKYWK2f-zBsLcIVWUzBwW_rtxlhaOPlE_NV7-XXy2XHS_ssiNhTV7F4pjZ2Sjnre3eJXNe5XmHI4nZKnk_ojRnPMPqwMOxUk1R_6LHwSRlmF?key=m0osxNPqksATxB0XbddLg6p3<br/><b>Question</b><br/>Does this mean your Havoc Clearance Level (‚ÄúRank‚Äù) will never go down, but that your access to Havoc Assignments will?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The Havoc Rank will display the highest Clearance Level a player has completed and is not directly linked to the current level of that player's Havoc Assignment.¬†<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Will there be a way to see what the current havoc rank of a player is? With rewards on the line for mission completion, I just get the feeling that people not ready for the latter half of havoc ranks will just try and join as many high ranking parties they can, looking to get carried through it.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>You will be able to see the Clearance Levels of all prospective applicants to your group to be able to make the best informed decision.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/>OK, that is our Q&amp;A! Thank you to everyone who wrote questions on our previous dev blog. As mentioned above, we‚Äôll compile any of the common remaining questions after this post and we‚Äôll include them in the patch notes for Grim Protocols on 3 December.¬†<br/><br/>Thank you for your passion and we look forward to everyone getting their hands on Havoc and the rest of the update.¬†<br/><br/>‚Äì The Darktide Team]]></description>

This fearsome weapon is normally operated by a Clan Skryre weapons team, but lighter, experimental versions have been sighted in the Reikland.

We hear your frustrations and concerns, understandably.<br/>We are still working with our backend service provider in an attempt to restore missing player data. A list of all affected player accounts has been provided to our backend service provider, and they are working to provide a snapshot of the lost player data before the issue occurred (which would be the fastest resolution); with which we can merge this back into your post update-6.0.0 account progression.<br/><br/>However, to be fully transparent, we have been informed that this is not guaranteed. It will take a little more time to know for sure. We appreciate this is concerning to hear, and we want to reassure affected players that <b>we have a plan B should it be needed.</b><br/>Our second option, involves using other existing logs and data we have, to create a ""backup"" that can bring your account data as close as possible to what is was prior to update 6.0.0, and then merge this with your post update-6.0.0 account progression. This is an extensive task and will take longer to deploy - so we are hoping it won't come to this.<br/><br/>In the meantime, this hotfix includes a part-fix to unlock Cataclysm again for any players who previously had it unlocked.<br/>We'll continue to provide updates and share more information as soon as we can. Thank you for your continued patience.		<br/><br/>You can follow our progress on this issue through this thread on our forums. <br/><div class="bb_h3">Known Issues</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Selecting a map in Custom Game and then switching to Random Map will crash the host.<br/></li><li> Players joining a Custom Game that is in the Hero selection phase will crash.</li></ul>We‚Äôre hoping to get those issues fixed as soon as possible.</blockquote> <br/><br/><blockquote class="bb_blockquote"> <div class="bb_h2">	Hotfix 6.0.5 - 22nd of November							</div> <div class="bb_h3">	Fixes							</div> <ul class="bb_ul"> <li>	Fixed a bug that caused the Warrior Priest to not gain any fury from nearby enemies dying when playing as client.								<br/> </li><li>	Fixed the issue that allowed a Grail Knight with the 'Virtue of Audacity' talent to interrupt the second swing of the career skill to avoid going on cooldown.								<br/> </li></ul>	We've also applied all of the rewards from last week's spotlight!

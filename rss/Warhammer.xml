At the moment, we want to keep the weapon colour skins as a reward for the Siege mode. However, we can confirm that more colours are coming.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">💡 <i><b>Fix Macragge Blue and Lens Colors: <u>link</u></b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Summary: The Macragge Blue colour is different from Campaign to PvE/PvP.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">💬 Hi! Here's a little explanation regarding this issue: </p><p class="bb_paragraph">The reason why color is not exactly the same is because Campaign characters cannot be customized and the color scheme is set in stone. The Campaign characters are not just flat Macragge Blue, there are more advanced shading techniques applied to them that cannot be replicated in PvE and PvP game modes because of the customization. This is why Campaign characters will always look better than recoloured PvE/PvP marines. Especially lenses. Another big factor is how different lighting affects colour shading, as well as different colour correction that is unique to each area of each level. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">That being said, we will try to tweak our colours one more time to close the gap.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">💡 <i><b>Assault Dash Attack Improvements: <u>link</u></b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Summary: Various ideas to improve the Assault’s Dash Attack.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i><b>💬 </b></i>With patch 12, the Dash Attack has been greatly improved, as well as Assault in general.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">💡 <i><b>Stratagems: Battlefield Conditions On Screen in the Barge: <u>link</u></b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Summary: Make the Battlefield Conditions visible on screen in the Battle Barge without having to go to the Stratagems menu.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">💬  Thanks for the idea, it's in the works!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">💡 <i><b>Ability to choose which bot teammates go with you on missions and additional customization: <u>link</u></b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Summary: More options for bots customisation.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">💬 Hello, thanks for the suggestion. However, our focus is currently on improving online aspects of the game.

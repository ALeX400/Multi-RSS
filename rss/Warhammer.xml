It is likely due to logging in after the above maintenance had started. We’ll let players know when they can log in and check their Mastery progression.<br/><br/><b>Second</b>, some players are experiencing crashes. If players are running the game with FSR 3.1 Frame Generation enabled, and they are tabbing between the exclusive full screen and windows, they may crash. Further, if players run FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, but without any upscaling enabled (such as FSR 3.1, DLSS or XESS), they will crash upon entering the Mourningstar. <br/><br/>The current workaround is to:<br/><ol><li> Use borderless fullscreen;<br/></li><li> If they’re running the game with FSR 3.1 Frame Generation: Enable one of the Upscaling alternatives (FSR 3.1, DLSS or XESS).</li></ol>Alternatively:<br/><ol><li> Disable FSR 3.1 Frame Generation</li></ol>^ <i>We are working on a fix for this to be included in a hot fix. </i><br/>Thank you for your patience today as we work to get everyone up and running again soon. <br/>]]></description>

Part 2. Part 3. Part 4.</div><br/><div class="bb_h1">Weapons</div><div class="bb_h1">Weapon Changes</div><div class="bb_h2">Thunder Hammers</div><br/>The Thunder Hammer family of weapons suffered for being over-specialized into the Monstrosity-removal niche, while being very underwhelming against most other threats and in general failing at keeping up with the increased intensity of high difficulty missions.<br/><br/>With the following changes we aimed at rebalancing the weapon to preserve its single-target focus, but also to make it more well rounded and more exciting to use in all situations.<br/><br/>While the upper end of the damage on Special activated attacks against the Unyielding armor type has been lowered to prevent unhealthy 1-shots of Monstrosity enemies, the damage against Carapace Armour has also been significantly increased to conversely be able to more effectively handle Elite enemies like Maulers and Crushers (potentially dispatching them with a single well placed hit).<br/><br/>The Light activated attack damage profiles have been improved to reward weakspot hits and to more easily eliminate any human-sized enemy.<br/><br/>The self-stun after a Special activated attack has been significantly reduced on both marks, and differentiated between Light and Heavy attacks.<br/><br/>This will make it way easier to find a window of time to deliver its devastating activated blows without being overly punished by other enemies.<br/><br/>Also, most Light and Heavy attacks have been improved in their damage and reach, to make the weapon more reliable in dealing with lesser enemies when not activated.<br/><br/>Both marks of the Thunder Hammer weapon family have also received some additional targeted changes, explained just below!<br/><br/><b>Dev Note:</b> <i>It’s also a hammer.</i><br/><div class="bb_h2">Detailed Changes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>All Marks<ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tweaked the damage profile for Light Special activated attacks:<ul class="bb_ul"><li>Armor damage modifier vs Unyielding from {2.0,3.0} to 2.0.</li></ul></li><li>Tweaked the damage profile for Heavy Special activated attacks:<ul class="bb_ul"><li>Armor damage modifier vs Unyielding from {3.0,5.0} to 3.0.</li><li>Armor damage modifier vs Carapace Armour from 1.0 to 1.5.</li></ul></li><li>Improved the headshot/critical damage bonus multiplier on all Light attack profiles:<ul class="bb_ul"><li>Finesse boost from 0.3 to 0.5.</li></ul></li><li>Improved the damage of the Light Strikedown attacks:<ul class="bb_ul"><li>Attack power distribution from {150,300} to {180,350}.</li></ul></li><li>Improved the damage of the Heavy Relentless attacks:<ul class="bb_ul"><li>1st target attack power distribution from {150,300} to {180,350}</li><li>2nd target attack power distribution from {80,160} to {100,200}</li><li>3rd target attack power distribution from {50,100} to {75,150}.</li></ul></li><li>Fixed several windup and attack actions which could be canceled by sprinting.</li></ul></li></ul><div class="bb_h2">Crucis Mk II Thunder Hammer</div><br/>The Crucis Mk II mark always boasted the higher damage compared to its Ironhelm Mk IV brother, but delivering that damage to the intended target was often difficult due to the horizontal direction of its Heavy attacks and the effective lack of cleave on Special activated attacks.<br/><br/>This led to not uncommon scenarios where a Heavy activated attack could be completely absorbed by a single intercepting Poxwalker, leaving the target enemy unscathed.<br/><br/>To give players more control on the situation, we added a new overhead Heavy attack to the weapon, only chainable after the Special activation action for a short period of time.<br/><br/>Also, a small amount of cleave was added to the Heavy activated attacks, meaning that the swing will be able to go through at least one lesser enemy.<br/><br/>These changes combined will make the weapon more reliable in delivering its devastating damage to the intended target.<br/><br/>Additionally, the damage profile of the Light 3 attack has been improved to reward players completing the attack chain instead of resetting it.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes -

We are going to continue investigating a solution and provide an update on our progress at a later date.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we have added some tweaks on the Sway and hitscan behaviors which should at least alleviate part of the issue.</i><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Both Families</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Reduced the intensity of the Sway from 1.0 to 0.3.</li></ul></li><b>Dev Note:</b> <i>This will make the weapon to be overall slightly less unwieldy when aiming, and also make it less likely for the aim position to be significantly displaced when transitioning from hipfire to ADS.</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Extended the radius of the hitscan for the bolt projectiles.</li></ul><b>Dev Note: </b><i>This will make the hitscan detection to be more generous and allow for shots that would have slightly missed the target to still be considered a hit.</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Changed the bolt properties to ignore limbs on non-Monstrosity enemies when the projectile trajectory would have also hit their torso or head.</li></ul><b>Dev Note: </b><i>This will avoid situations where a bolt could be intercepted by the limbs of the enemies even when aiming at their center of mass, resulting in heavily reduced damage.</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Armor damage modifier vs Carapace Armour from 0.4 to 0.5 (both near and far range).</li><li>Armor damage modifier vs Infested from 0.5 to 0.9 (near) / 1.0 (far).</li></ul><b>Dev Note:</b> <i>Bolt-type weapons were penalized when shooting against Infested enemies.

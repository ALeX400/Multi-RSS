Whether you’ve been with us since the start or joined along the way, your support, feedback, and passion for the series mean a great deal to us.<br/><br/>Right now, the team are hard at work on a variety of content that’s going to inject some exciting new experiences into the game. The big addition being Lords of the End Times, which arrives later this summer armed with four new Legendary Lords including the Great Necromancer himself, Nagash. Alongside this, we’ll also have Update 9.0 which includes the long-awaited Vampire Counts update, and Neferata as the free Legendary Lord. We’re still on track for release this later this summer and look forward to sharing more with you closer to the time.<br/><br/>Before all that, though, we have something special you’ll be able to experience first: our very first Character Pack. To mark the occasion, we’ve worked closely with Games Workshop to introduce an entirely new character to Warhammer lore - Bhashiva, the Desert Tigress, White Tiger of Shang Yang - accompanied by a deadly host of mercenary Tiger Warrior units.<br/><br/>We’ve been discussing bringing her to life for quite some time, so we’re thrilled to finally share her with you. She represents another step into the mysteries of Grand Cathay, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to debut a brand‑new aspect of the setting.<br/><br/>Since Bhashiva and the Tiger Warriors are fresh additions not just to the game but to the entire tabletop setting, today’s blog is primarily about giving you a small first look at who the White Tiger is, how she fights, as well as spotlighting one of the mercenaries who will be supporting her armies. Think of this as your introduction, but with more in‑depth info coming closer to release.<br/><br/>👉 READ THE FULL BLOG HERE 👈<br/><br/>— The <i>Total War</i> Team</p><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.</div><p class="bb_paragraph">SteamXFacebookInstagramDiscordBluesky</p>]]></description>

In the meantime, you can read the notes below. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This patch comes with adjustments to the Hive Scum talents, both to polish some interactions and improve on underused ones. It also includes some general cosmetics and bugfixes.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1">Patch 1.10.6 patch notes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Hive Scum Changes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Developer’s note:</b> “<i>Hey guys. Hive Scum is getting a few changes in this update. This time, we’re targeting some general talent quirks and bringing them a bit more up to snuff. The Stimm Lab is getting the bigger changes, with a rework on one of its branches. Cheers.” - Teodor, class designer.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Stimm Lab’</b> Has gotten a buff on durability related talents (top left branch):</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Any <b>‘Toughness Regeneration’</b> buffs have been swapped for <b>‘Toughness Replenishment’</b> (the original buff was only active <i>while in coherency outside of combat</i>. The latter modifies the amount of Toughness gained instead. This change should make the talents way more active and useful).</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Barrage I-IV’</b> now grants 6.25% Toughness, +5% Toughness Replenishment and +4% Damage Reduction each (note: the Toughness gained from Barrage is not affected by its own Toughness Replenishment bonus. That bonus is applied to Toughness gained during the duration of the Cartel Special itself).</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Tank’</b> now grants +30% Toughness Replenishment instead of +20%.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Regain’</b> now grants 5% Toughness every 1s for the duration of the Cartel Special, instead of 25% in one go.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Talent changes:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Cheap Shots’</b> now grants +15% Strength against both medium and heavy staggered enemies, and +10% against light staggered enemies.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Nimble’</b> is now properly labeled as granting Dodge Speed. The bonus to dodge windows is also now a <i>flat bonus</i> instead of a <i>multiplicative bonus</i>. This means that, yes, it is applied to dodges against ranged fire, but won’t be as effective as when dodging against melee attacks, due to not having the default values that those types of dodges have.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Dodge Speed bonus changed from +25% to +0.15s.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Rampage!’</b> no longer makes the player “exhausted” after use, the ability now simply ends.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Channelled Aggression’</b> no longer requires the duration of Rampage to be above a certain threshold. It is now active throughout.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Unload’</b> now refreshes itself if triggered while active, and can be triggered by activating Desperado.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Pocket Toxin’</b> now infects enemies with different amounts of Chem Toxin depending on the equipped Blitz:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Blinder/Blackout:</b> 3.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Boom Bringer:</b> 6.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Chem Grenade:</b> 10 <i>(note: the talent adds stacks of Chem Toxin on explosion, meaning that the Chem Grenade grants them on its initial blast. The stacks added by the area of effect remains the same)</i>.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Chem Grenade’:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Now has an appropriately sized explosion radius that matches the visuals. There’s no real notable gameplay change, but it does mean that it can now properly benefit from ‘Pocket Toxin’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Duration reduced from 20s to 15s to better align with similar Blitz abilities, like the Immolation Grenade.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New, more elaborate talent description.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed terminology in some places:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Ranged-’ and ‘Melee Attack Immunity’ talents are now properly rewritten as ‘Counts as Dodging’, to convey how they actually work, and highlight that they also trigger dodges (which can interact with other talents in the Hive Scum tree).</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Dodge Extended’ has been properly rewritten as ‘Dodge Speed’ (Dodge Speed does increase the length of the dodge, but the main benefit is the increase in speed).</p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Bug Fixes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">General Fixes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an issue where the looping shooting sound for the Ogryn Twin-Linked Heavy Stubbers restarted on every bullet shot.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an outline issue when using the Desperado ability near Dreg Ritualist enemies in the Dark Communion mission.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an issue where damage from Needle Pistol Toxins didn't trigger effects from the Hive Scum Talents 'Speedloader' and 'Vulture's Mark'.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed text formatting of objectives for Hive Scum's basic training step for the Ability.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Cosmetic Fixes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Pyre Blade: fixed an issue where the VFX was not spanning the full length of the blade.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Antax Mk III Conclave-issue Tactical Helm: fixed the red visor.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Commando Beret with Augmetic Implant (Green): fixed some visual issues.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Pugilist Armour (XXXXL) (Tread Lightlies): fixed some clipping and physics issues</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/e700de79b8874e18ab7140f6074ba98f94e5b7ee.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">That’s all for today! </p><p class="bb_paragraph">We’ll see you on the Mourningstar. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">– The Darktide Team</p>]]></description>

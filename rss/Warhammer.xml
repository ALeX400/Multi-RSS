Now, with the forthcoming Grim Protocols update, there are signs that the Battle for Tertium is entering a new phase. <br/><br/>We sat down with Narrative Producer Michael Knight and Lead Writer Matthew Ward to find out more.</b><br/><br/><i>So, Tertium’s in trouble then?</i><br/><br/><b>Mike</b>: It’s always in trouble, isn’t it? But yes, things are about to get worse. <br/><br/><b>Matthew</b>: Are they though? Isn’t it more the case that Rannick’s finally about to realise just how bad they’ve really been from the start?<br/><br/><b>Mike</b>: I know, right? He’s probably known something was badly wrong ever since the Orthus Offensive last year, but that’s the problem with suspecting everyone and everything: occasionally you don’t see something until it’s bang in front of you.<br/><br/><b>Matthew</b>: Even paranoids have enemies.<br/><br/><b>Mike</b>: Exactly. Rannick’s about as paranoid as they come, and he has a lot of enemies.<br/><br/><i>We’re talking about Wolfer, right?</i><br/><br/><b>Matthew</b>: Wolfer’s involved, sure. He’s been our Rejects’ dark mirror since the moment Zola stepped aboard the Tancred Bastion prison ship.  <br/><br/><b>Mike</b>: Maybe even before that.<br/><br/><b>Matthew</b>: We can’t talk about that, can we? Dan (Abnett) will kill us.<br/><br/><b>Mike</b>: Dan wouldn’t do that. He’s actually a very nice man. But let’s play it safe. Wolfer isn’t nice. He’s been the face of the Battle for Tertium right from the start. He spearheaded the invasion. Every soldier of the Traitorous 6th - the ones we’ve seen anyway – answer to him. But he’s a purely military threat. It turns out that Tertium’s been rotten for a long time.<br/><br/><b>Matthew</b>: We’ve seen the cultists fighting alongside Wolfer’s traitors. So far, Rannick’s assumed that their goals are the same and that they’re just a rabble militia fighting for Wolfer. The first is kinda-sorta-maybe true. The second? Not at all. To the leaders of the cult, Wolfer’s just fulfilling his part of a long-awaited prophecy. He’s a tool, nothing more.<br/><br/><b>Mike</b>: I’m not sure he realises that. <br/><br/><b>Matthew</b>: At the very least, he’s in denial. But we’ve all been there.<br/><br/><i>Hang on, back up a bit. The cult’s leaders? Who are they?</i><br/><br/><b>Mike</b>: We’ve met one already. He rescued Rinda after she and her brother (Rodin) fell foul of the Rejects and then set her loose during the Terror in the Dark event. We’ll meet the others soon enough. The hour of prophecy is fast approaching and they’re not the kind of people that lurk in the shadows for ever. They’re starting to flex their muscles. After all, it was the cult, not Wolfer, who attacked Commissar Dukane’s Moebian 53rd during the Rolling Steel mission. What we’ve seen so far is only the beginning.<br/><br/><i>That’s the second time you’ve mentioned a prophecy. Can you tell us more about that?</i><br/><b>Mike</b>: Only that Dan’s really excited about it. The rest you’ll have to find out as it unfolds.<br/> <br/><i>In the Grim Protocols update?</i><br/><b>Mike</b>: It’s a watershed moment. Rannick, Wolfer, Zola… they’re all starting to see that there’s more going on than they realise. In the end, Wolfer and the 6th are pursuing victory the way the Imperium taught them. Theirs is a conventional war. The cult deal in dark sorceries and blasphemous powers. For them, the path to victory lies through embracing the Grandfather’s blessings. In life … and beyond.<br/><br/><b>Matthew</b>: So much of what’s happened over the last year has fallen neatly into the cult’s plans, but now they’re taking an active role in the Battle for Tertium. Unknown to Rannick (and Wolfer) they have a ritual in the works. One that the warband need to stop if there’s to be any hope of winning. The Rejects are about to be tested as never before.<br/><br/><b>Mike</b>: I’m sure it’ll work out. Right?<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h2">​​Greetings Space Marines!</div><br/>The end of the year is approaching, to celebrate this wonderful year that has brought so much joy to us and to the players, we have a few surprises for you! ⭐<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>But first, let’s recap the past month a bit!</b> </div><br/>On November 12 we released Patch 4.5. This update was important as it brought a brand new weapon: The Neo-Volkite Pistol, as well as loads of balancing tweaks on several weapons (Plasma Incinerator / Bolt Sniper Rifle / Occulus Bolt Carbine / Bolt Carbine (SMG) / Auto Bolt Rifle). <br/><br/>To read the entire patch note, click here. <br/><br/>How cool is it? 😎<br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/f182956c202bc3bccf61cc89a68d1560ae830eda.gif"/><br/><i>Note that the Neo-Volkite Pistol will be available in PvP starting from the 5.0 update.</i><br/><br/>As for every month, we keep reading your feedback closely, and reviewing the ideas submitted onto Focus Together! There’s more and more each week, which gives us plenty of ideas to work with! We want to thank you for that. We keep reviewing them but it takes time!<br/><br/>To see the answers devs have already provided, check it <b>here</b>. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">WE REACHED 5 MILLION PLAYERS!</div><br/>5 million Space Marines have joined our ranks to purge Xenos &amp; Chaos! 🎉<br/><br/>Huge thanks to everyone who's joined the fight.

<br/>The series will start on December 10. One episode will be fully dedicated to Warhammer 40,000. Stay tuned, it’s gonna be epic! 💥<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">PATCH 5.0</div><br/>The 5.0 update will be released in the first half of December! This update contains the very much awaited Dark Angels Chapter Pack, alongside another Operation: Obelisk. <br/><br/>The Dark Angels Chapter Pack features the Dark Angels Champion, which is a unique armour set and banner for the Bulwark Class.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/39308af705c0b0ffd996813ea1e63517d7240aba.jpg"/><br/><i>Please note that this set can’t be customised</i><br/><br/>Three weapons will also receive exclusive visuals based on the Dark Angels Chapter: the Auto Bolt Rifle, the Plasma Pistol and the Power Sword. The Bulwark class will also get a unique Dark Angels Storm Shield.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/172ef8cfa6ebf3ecc4b2dab4ca0b96317548aee4.jpg"/><br/><br/>The Dark Angels Chapter Pack includes the heraldry items of the Second Foundings and Successor Chapters of the Dark Angels: the Angels of Absolution, the Angels of Redemption, the Angels of Vengeance, the Unnamed, the Blades of Vengeance, the Cowled Wardens, the Bringers of Judgement and the Angels of Defiance.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/213028c7c3da38554a114261beb6f898505316fd.png"/><br/><br/>New armour pieces will also be  added, including a fan-favourite helmet: the Mark VIII Ravenwing! All these items will be available to unlock as part of an heraldry cosmetic.<br/><br/><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/88753ecbf0f7c215104223a1c96567e5e4cf5ad6.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/e67c16b96c4959046ba7287f20decb19b6bce8c3.jpg"/></div></div></div><br/>Last addition to the customisation menu, the colour lenses are finally here! Choose among 15 different colours to customise your Space Marine even more!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/d9630bdb7172f9efbf708bc1d3f9751275018435.gif"/><br/><br/>This update does not only bring new customisation, a new Operation will also be added! Called “Obelisk”, you’ll be sent to Demerium and your mission is to rotate a replica of the obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. This operation takes place in parallel to the final events of the campaign.<br/><br/>To reach the console control of the obelisk, you’ll have to make it through a tomb plunged into darkness. To make your progression even tougher, the Chaos forces see a new addition to their roster: the Tzaangor Enlightened, a new Majoris enemy! They will now appear in every PvE Operation with Chaos.<br/><br/>Finally, on the tech side, <b>the 5.0 update will bring FSR3 support, and Frame Generation for both DLSS3 and FSR3.</b><br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">AWARD NOMINATIONS</div><br/><i>Space Marine 2</i> has been nominated in 2 categories at The Game Awards!<br/><br/>You can show your support and vote for us as Best Multiplayer Game and Best Action Game!<br/><br/>Also, we're so glad to announce that <i>Space Marine 2</i> has been nominated for the Steam Awards in the "Game Of The Year" category! ⚔️You can vote <b>here</b>.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/20277988624c0024db09d909f106d17100c7d3d7.jpg"/><br/><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/19bac84722b4fd32d8fb4d2dd04526fd9abbeac5.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/55ade687a4f3888925d33d23c21db5275e32c40f.jpg"/></div></div></div><br/><div class="bb_h2">FANART CONTEST WINNER</div><br/>Huge congrats to @MendesWithAnS for winning the <i>Space Marine 2</i> fan art contest!

<div class="bb_h1">Hello Everyone, </div><br/>My name is Kitefin and I am super excited to be joining the Darktide community as a community manager! <br/><br/>A little bit about me: I‚Äôve worked in games for a few years now in community and influencer management for various titles. I‚Äôm really into simulation, RPG and building games in my spare time, but have been known to dip my toes into any genre really. Except horror I am too much of a baby for that. <br/><br/>I‚Äôve been creeping in the background for a few weeks now, training in the Mourningstar and making my friends come and save me every time I get <span class="bb_strike">bullied</span> downed by Crushers in Mortis Trials. I started playing as a Pskyer but found it a bit too squishy so I have been throwing rocks and grenades as an Ogryn and feeling big an‚Äô strong. <br/><br/>The incredible StrawHat has taken me under her fin to help get me trained up and ready to meet you all properly, and you might have caught me lurking about in the Dev stream last week üëÄ! <br/><br/>I am still learning a lot about Warhammer and the lore so please be patient with me as I gain more knowledge, currently treat me like an Ogyrn. <br/><br/>Some Kitefin Shark facts for you: they are a deep sea shark, with bioluminescence and are the largest luminous vertebrate on record!<br/><br/>--Kitefin<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h1">‚ÄãHi Space Marines!</div><br/>The 7.0 ‚ÄúTrygon update‚Äù is now live and brings a lot of changes to Space Marine 2! Before diving into the update, here‚Äôs a quick summary of its content:<br/><br/><br/><b>New Features:</b><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> New PvE Operation: Exfiltration<br/></li><li> Prestige Ranks in PvE<br/></li><li> Private PvP Lobbies<br/></li><li> New Secondary Weapon in PvE and PvP: Inferno Pistol<br/></li><li> New customisation options: 2 new colours, Bulwark cloth colouring, hands colouring</li></ul><br/><b>New Season Pass content:</b><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Space Wolves Chapter Pack<br/></li><li> Imperial Fists Champion Pack</li></ul><br/><b>Gameplay &amp; Balancing:</b><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Extended weapon arsenal in PvE<br/></li><li> Weapon perks updated in PvE<br/></li><li> Improved Matchmaking in PvE and PvP<br/></li><li> Various changes, bugfixes and improvements</li></ul><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/07daefbb4a1d22617d0d1da295c3986fdab0868d.png"/><br/><br/><i>‚Äî Dmitriy Grigorenko, Game Director</i><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">PATCH NOTES</div><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Features</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>New Operation ‚Äî Exfiltration</b></li></ul><i>Exfiltration takes place on Avarax at the outskirts of an Imperial Hive City ravaged by the Tyranids.. Your mission is to reach a Mechanicus facility, extract a rogue Tech-Priest and fight a Trygon; a giant, burrowing Tyranid that  creates underground passageways for other Tyranid organisms.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2efdd2cf86834005d666c3dd714446afad285c09.png"/><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Private Lobbies in PvP</b></li></ul><i>A custom lobby to invite your fellow Space Marines. You can choose the mode and map, and also change the gameplay settings, like score or time limit or even damage modifiers to create your own fun game modes.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Prestige Ranks in PvE</b></li></ul><i>The Prestige system allows you to continue empowering your Class even after reaching the maximum level. Once you have reached level 25, go to the Armouring Hall and follow the activation procedure in the Skill Tree screen. There, you can reset the Class' progress to the first level to unlock one Prestige Perk. After this, you can raise the Class level to 25 again. Thus, a Class can get up to 4 active Prestige Perks simultaneously. <b>Each prestige rank increases XP gain by 10%.</b></i><br/><br/><i>Progressing your Prestige ranks will also grant you unique cosmetic rewards for each rank you unlock.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>PvE Extended List of Available Weapons</b></li></ul><b>Heavy</b>: Heavy Bolt Rifle | Heavy Bolt Pistol<br/><b>Tactical</b>: Combat Knife | Plasma Pistol | Heavy Bolt Pistol<br/><b>Assault</b>: Power Sword | Plasma Pistol<br/><b>Bulwark</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol<br/><b>Sniper</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Instigator Bolt Carbine<br/><b>Vanguard</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Bolt Carbine<br/><br/><br/><i>Originally the classes were not balanced around having these weapons. Some of those changes are only meant to bring more variety, fun and lore accuracy to the game. <b>Not every change here will make every weapon competitive with the rest of class loadouts.</b></i><br/><br/><i>This isn't the last pass on this, we will continue to monitor the game and make necessary changes. We still have some more ideas how we can expand loadouts more, without breaking the lore and while keeping class identity, but those changes will take a while to implement.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>New Secondary Weapon: Inferno Pistol</b></li></ul>Available for Sniper, Heavy, Assault and Vanguard classes.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Class-based matchmaking in Operations mode</b></li></ul><i>This is a first iteration of the system that is designed to reduce frequency of matchmaking with other people with the same classes. It is not going to prevent this 100%, there will always be some edge cases. We will be tweaking and improving the system on our backend as we go.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Experimental skill-based matchmaking and team balancing in Eternal War mode</b></li></ul><i>This system should make matchmaking in PvP more fair. This is an experimental feature, we will be turning it on and off on the backend and monitoring the results. It will take a while for it to shape up.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Public Test Server (PTS)</b></li></ul><i>We are really happy with the PTS experiment that we had. We got a lot of feedback from the community that allowed us to implement changes ahead of actual live release. While having PTS is an additional stress for our team and will cause some delays to live patches we are going to keep doing that for all major content updates moving forward.<br/><br/>The PTS will be closed for now, but we‚Äôll reopen it once we‚Äôll be looking for your feedback on upcoming features.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>New Season Pass Content</b></li></ul><b>Space Wolves Chapter Pack:</b><br/>- Space Wolves Chapter Champion (Vanguard).<br/>- Space Wolves Chapter Weapon Skins (Bolt Carbine, Thunder Hammer, Chainsword).<br/>- Space Wolves Chapter Customisation (Helmet, Chest, Pauldron, Greave, Heraldry markings).<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/a23bd933bf6de3953f589ab4321607a22b467a93.jpg"/><br/><br/><b>Imperial Fists Champion Pack:</b><br/>- Imperial Fists Champion (Tactical).<br/>- Imperial Fists Signature Weapon Skin (Plasma Incinerator).<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/33468439454839669c5da543c35d6b18cb3eca9c.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Customisation</div><br/><b>New Colours</b>: New default colours Volupus Pink and Thousand Sons Blue.<br/><br/><b>Bulwark Cloth Recolouring</b>: New feature to recolour the cloth for Bulwark tabard has been added as an option for the chest armour piece for customisation. <br/><br/><b>Hands Recolouring</b>: New feature to recolour the gauntlet armour piece is added. Now the primary colour is used to colour a fist and the secondary one colours a wrist and a shoulder part of the hand. (This one is for you, Iron Hands and Crimson Fists fans!)<br/><br/>Lots of <b>minor fixes</b> for customisation of armour parts and emblems.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">‚ÄãGameplay &amp; Balancing tweaks</div><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Progression Rewards</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Rebalance Rewards in the Eternal War Mode</b> </li></ul>Match rewards are increased by 50%.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Base EXP for PvE is increased</b></li></ul>Base XP for all difficulties in Operation Mode is increased by 10%.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">PvE Weapon Perks Update</div><br/><i>With this update we are rolling out a massive rebalancing and rework of weapon perks. As a result all weapons received buffs one way or another.<br/><br/>Some notes regarding our future plans in terms of balancing: I want to say that I'm not a big fan of changing too many things at the same time. It is hard to predict the outcome, it's a risk of introducing bugs and not every change is a simple number change. Past 2 patches changelogs were several pages long. I'm more in favor of gradual improvements of the game rather than chaotic changes back and forth. This means that we do see your feedback on some of the class perks and weapons etc, even looking at the current weapon perks rework I feel like we could have done a better job with plasma weapons and power sword perks.<br/><br/>There will be a second pass on class, weapon and prestige perks. Probably around Patch 8. I do think that those systems are in much much better shape than they were before patches and on release, the scope of the second pass will be smaller.</i><br/><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b><u>Heavy Bolt Rifle</u></b></li></ul><b>"Perpetual Precision"</b> (Master-Crafted tier): The perk has been replaced with "Cleaving Fire" (Shots will penetrate enemy Block Stances dealing 25% of the usual Damage)<br/><br/><b>"Able Precision"</b> (Artificer tier): The perk has been reworked, the new version is ‚ÄúRemote Threat‚Äù (Enemies at a distance of more than 25 metres take 20% more Damage)<br/><br/><b>"Fast Regeneration 1"</b> (Artificer tier): Replaced with "Head Hunter" (Headshots deal 10% more Damage)<br/><br/><b>"Fast Regeneration 2"</b> (Artificer tier): Completely reworked, the new perk is ‚ÄúRecoupment‚Äù: Killing a Majoris-level or higher enemy with a headshot with this weapon restores 1 Armour Segment.

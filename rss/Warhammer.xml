We're pleased to announce that we've now rolled this hotfix out to all players, including one additional fix:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resolved a script error that prevented events from triggering after completing missions as Gorbad Ironclaw.</li></ul>Our original plan was to release this in late January but we wanted to get these changes out to you all as quickly as possible so you could all enjoy them. We're now working on Hotfix 6.0.4 which is currently aiming for the end of January, but if this changes we'll be sure to let you know!<br/><br/>For those who didn't opt-in to the Beta, here's a full list of changes in 6.0.3:<br/><br/><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Hotfix 6.0.3 Release Notes</div><br/><div class="bb_h2">SKULLTAKER UPDATES AND FIXES</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Adjusted Blood Hosts and Disciple forces so they no longer benefit from the Daemonic Reforging chance.<br/></li><li> Adjusted the effects of the Cloak of Skulls so that they now only apply when Skulltaker himself defeats a Lord.<br/></li><li> When playing as Skulltaker, the Legendary Lord 2x bonus for Champion’s Essence will now only be applied once. After defeating a Champion in battle, the bonus will no longer stack.<br/></li><li> Blood Hosts now increase the cost of the ‘Blood for the Blood God’ occupation option while they are on the map. This means that the more active Blood Hosts there are, the more costly it becomes to create new Blood Hosts. This change addresses the over-reliance of Khorne factions on excessive Blood Host forces.<br/></li><li> Reduced the XP gain bonus from the Cloak of Skulls on the ‘Dubois the Prescient’ skull, from 25/50 to 20/40.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Bloodspeakers lacked mounts when playing as Valkia.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Heralds of Khorne and Bloodreapers on Blood Throne mounts were missing Siege Attacker.<br/></li><li> Fixed the 2D porthole for The Slaughtergard (Chosen of Khorne - Halberds) using the wrong image.<br/></li><li> Fixed a text inconsistency in the description of the Daemons Reforged effect for the Skulltakers faction.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">PERFORMANCE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resolved a rare crash that could occur during VFX rendering.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when loading saved Savage Orc Great Shaman lords.<br/></li><li> Fixed a potential crash when loading a battle in certain cases.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when loading the Black Orc Big Boss character.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when teleporting to the Great Drill of Hashut quest battle.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">CAMPAIGN</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">GENERAL/GAMEPLAY</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Erd Mentality Rebalance:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Melee Defence: 40 &gt; 20<br/></li><li> Ward Save: 40 &gt; 20<br/></li><li> Number of Squig Herds in range for maximum value: 10 &gt; 5</li></ul></li><li> Fixed an issue where Da Acid Burpa (Colossal Squig RoR) was not counting towards the unit requirements for the ‘Splode Da Big One Tactik’ in Da Plan.<br/></li><li> Ogre Camps now take only 3 turns to be redeployed, instead of 5.<br/></li><li> Removed Destroy ‘Kraka Drak’ from Throgg and Astragoth’s victory conditions and replaced it with Malakai’s faction<br/></li><li> Nasty Skulkers, Rogue Idol, River Trolls, and Snotling Pump Wagon (base unit) have been added to Gorbad - Omens of Destruction DLC for use in his Da Plan feature.<br/></li><li> Resolved a script error that prevented events from triggering after completing missions as Gorbad Ironclaw.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">TECHNOLOGY TREE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The Hammer of Gork’s Blinded contact effect is no longer replaced by Dazed from the Orcs &amp; Goblins’ Avalanche Smash technology.<br/></li><li> Eshin Maneater’s Weeping Blade effect is no longer replaced by Armour Sundering from the Ogres’ Betta Plunda technology.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">SKILL TREE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where Snagla's ‘Beneath the Gloomy Canopy’ skill would lose its Stalk effect when upgraded.<br/></li><li> Removed the ‘Immune to Contact Effects’ from the Slaughtermaster's Poisonmaster skill, as they possess that attribute innately.<br/></li><li> Removed the Thundertusk and Stonehorn from the Hunter skill effects that provided Vanguard, Frenzy, and Stalk Hunter skills.<br/></li><li> Fixed the missing Idol of Gork Scrap upgrade for Savage Orc units.<br/></li><li> Fixed the Divinatory Authority skill incorrectly reducing cooldowns for Cold-Blooded instead of Focus Instincts.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">UNITS</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where Markus Wulfhart’s Imperial Regiments of Greatswords had a different tier to regular Greatswords.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">UI/UX</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a UI issue with the Ogre’s army ability ‘Meat Feast’, which incorrectly stated it affected multiple units when it only affects a single unit.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">BATTLE</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">UNITS</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where Colossal Squigs were missing Siege Attacker.<br/></li><li> Added missing MP unit caps to the following: Colossal Squig, Da Acif Burpa, Snagla Deff Throwa, Piggyback Knights, Slaughterbrute, Eshin Maneater, Skullcannon, Hellforged Bellowers, and Arachnarok Flinger.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Khorngors were still available for Warriors of Chaos when unit caps were active.<br/></li><li> Fixed the abilities ‘Bathed in Blood’ and ‘Blinding Radiance’ being incorrectly labelled as active abilities.</li></ul><br/><hr/><br/>​Thanks to everyone who’s shared their feedback with us since the launch of Omens of Destruction and Update 6.0.

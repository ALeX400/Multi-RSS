This hotfix brings with it a number of adjustments following on from last week's Update 6.0, including fixes to Ogre Camp and Vampire Count stances, some improvements to one of Golgfag’s victory conditions and much more, as well as fixes for those known issues originally detailed in our message last week.<br/><br/>Whilst we’re completing all our own final checks, if you’re a Steam user we’ve given you the opportunity to download this hotfix right now as an opt-in Beta branch, allowing you to take an early look at what we’re changing, and press on with your campaigns. Instructions on how to do this can be found at the bottom of this post.<br/><br/>If all goes well, we’ll release this Hotfix to all players on Friday, and anyone who opts into the Beta will be able to continue with any campaign progress they make in the meantime. If we need to change up our plans, we’ll be loud across all our community channels with revised timing for the update.<br/><br/>Let’s dive straight into what’s included!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Hotfix 6.0.2 Release Notes</div><br/><div class="bb_h2">HIGHLIGHTS</div>​<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where, if the Ogre Camp ranks up, its stance reverts to Raiding stance.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where, if an Ogre Camp recruits units from within itself, it drops out of Encamp stance and switches to Raiding stance.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Vampire Counts were missing the ambush stance.<br/></li><li> Added Lightning Strike to Skarsnik's 'Ready &amp;

<b>OI, SPEEK FREEKS!</b><br/><br/>We're just dropped a hotfix for various things below, including some stuff for Alternate Weapons which will be playable again this weekend. Be sure to jump in for some new kinds of krumpin'!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed issue with player progression needing a client restart to be shown properly in the menu<br/></li><li> Fixed issue with Steam Deck / Linux players no longer being able to play because of Easy Anti-Cheat being a right git.  If you still get kicked to the menu and see an error pop up, just matchmake again and things should work fine after that.<br/></li><li> Reverted change to status bar text on HUD using red outline which apparently made some players' eyes bleed<br/></li><li> Fixed issue with Kustom Boosta-Blasta and Megatrakk Scrapjet getting speed loss<br/></li><li> Fixed bots using alt weapons that weren't synced properly.<br/></li><li> Fixed performance issue with the kill kam where it was tanking framerate when loading<br/></li><li> Fixed/updated game mode text for Deff Rally to reflect racing changes made in last patch<br/></li><li> Reduced size of central game mode HUD element to reduce clutter.  More room ta see da krumpin'!<br/></li><li> Updated Looted Wagon crosshair so it reflects cooldown of the Kannon.  This is a test to see how players like it (you will).  If they do, we'll apply the same system to other vehicles<br/></li><li> Grot bomm now has a big flare on it so it's easier to see coming and increased sound distance. Reduced it's max duration from 13 sec to 10, which also fixed a bug with VFX disappearing<br/></li><li> Kustom Boosta-Blasta alternate weapon fire rate set to 0.6 (from 1.2), damage set to 33 (from 22), splash radius set to 12 (from 10).  This weapon will be playable this coming weekend!<br/></li><li> Updated popup message text when getting kicked to the menu because of Easy Anti-Cheat issues<br/></li><li> Made the Grot Mega Tank rokkit knockback consistently pop enemies up instead of randomly spin them out<br/></li><li> Returns Shokkjump Dragsta lock on crosshair</li></ul>If you haven't already, check out our survey and help shape the future of the game!<br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/dffc9865e78ec717e30a35320c40c6a47c727808.png"/><div class="bb_h2"><b>Click for Feedback Survey</b></div><br/>Keep the feedback comin' and letz get back to Krumpin!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a9ddc031a54d7d0169b5555691b580f941f20bd9.png"/><br/><br/><b>Join our community-focused game development discussions on your favorite platform:</b><br/><br/>Steam Discussions<br/>Discord<br/>r/SpeedFreeks<br/>Suggest Features &amp; Report Bugs<br/>Technical Support<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2078450]]></description>

<b>Lord Kaptanlar!</b><br/> <br/>Gününüzü heyecan verici bir haberle şenlendirmek isteriz: Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, Türkçe oluyor! Türk oyuncularımız, bugünden itibaren ana dillerinde metin ve alt yazılarla oyuna dalabilecekler.<br/> <br/>Menü, alt yazı ve oyun içi metinlerle beraber tam bir Türkçe dil desteği sunmaktan gurur duyuyoruz. Bu yerelleştirme seçenekleri oyuna pürüzsüzce entegre edilmiştir. Desteklenen diller arasında geçiş yapmak için ayarlar menüsüne girmeniz yeterlidir. Bu güncellemenin Türkçe konuşan oyuncularımıza Warhammer 40.000: Rogue Trader'ı daha erişilebilir kılacağını ve muhteşem bir oyun deneyimi sunacağını umuyoruz.<br/> <br/>Türkçe yerelleştirmenin şimdilik sadece ana oyun için mevcut olduğunu lütfen unutmayın. Void Shadow DLC metin çevirileri eksiktir ve bu metinler şu an İngilizcedir. DLC yerelleştirmesi sonraki bir güncelleme ile eklenecektir.<br/> <br/>Daimî desteklerinden dolayı topluluğumuza teşekkür etmek istiyoruz ve bu haberi Türkçe konuşan oyuncularımıza sunmaktan büyük heyecan duyuyoruz. Koronus Enginliği'ni ana dilinizle ilk kez keşfe çıkmaya hazır olun!<br/> <br/>Mürettebatınızı hazır edin Lord Kaptan! Macera sizi bekliyor.<br/><br/>__________<br/><br/><b>Lord Captains!</b><br/><br/>We would like to brighten your day with some exciting news: the Turkish language is coming to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader! Starting today, our Turkish players will be able to immerse themselves in the game with text and subtitles in their native language.<br/><br/>We are proud to introduce full Turkish language support, including menus, subtitles, and in-game texts. These localization options are seamlessly integrated into the game; to switch between supported languages, simply go to the settings menu. We hope that this update will make Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader more accessible and provide our Turkish-speaking players with an outstanding gaming experience.<br/><br/>Please note that for now, the Turkish localization is available only for the base game. The Void Shadow DLC texts are missing translations and are currently written in English. The DLC localization will be added later.<br/><br/>We'd like to thank our community for their ongoing support, and we're excited to bring this news to our Turkish-speaking players. Prepare to explore the Koronus Expanse in your native tongue like never before!<br/><br/>Ready your crew, Lord Captain! The journey awaits.<br/>]]></description>

In the meantime, you can read the notes below. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This patch comes with adjustments to the Hive Scum talents, both to polish some interactions and improve on underused ones. It also includes some general cosmetics and bugfixes.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1">Patch 1.10.6 patch notes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Hive Scum Changes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Developer’s note:</b> “<i>Hey guys. Hive Scum is getting a few changes in this update. This time, we’re targeting some general talent quirks and bringing them a bit more up to snuff. The Stimm Lab is getting the bigger changes, with a rework on one of its branches. Cheers.” - Teodor, class designer.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Stimm Lab’</b> Has gotten a buff on durability related talents (top left branch):</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Any <b>‘Toughness Regeneration’</b> buffs have been swapped for <b>‘Toughness Replenishment’</b> (the original buff was only active <i>while in coherency outside of combat</i>. The latter modifies the amount of Toughness gained instead. This change should make the talents way more active and useful).</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Barrage I-IV’</b> now grants 6.25% Toughness, +5% Toughness Replenishment and +4% Damage Reduction each (note: the Toughness gained from Barrage is not affected by its own Toughness Replenishment bonus. That bonus is applied to Toughness gained during the duration of the Cartel Special itself).</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Tank’</b> now grants +30% Toughness Replenishment instead of +20%.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Regain’</b> now grants 5% Toughness every 1s for the duration of the Cartel Special, instead of 25% in one go.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Talent changes:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Cheap Shots’</b> now grants +15% Strength against both medium and heavy staggered enemies, and +10% against light staggered enemies.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Nimble’</b> is now properly labeled as granting Dodge Speed. The bonus to dodge windows is also now a <i>flat bonus</i> instead of a <i>multiplicative bonus</i>. This means that, yes, it is applied to dodges against ranged fire, but won’t be as effective as when dodging against melee attacks, due to not having the default values that those types of dodges have.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Dodge Speed bonus changed from +25% to +0.15s.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Rampage!’</b> no longer makes the player “exhausted” after use, the ability now simply ends.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Channelled Aggression’</b> no longer requires the duration of Rampage to be above a certain threshold. It is now active throughout.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Unload’</b> now refreshes itself if triggered while active, and can be triggered by activating Desperado.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Pocket Toxin’</b> now infects enemies with different amounts of Chem Toxin depending on the equipped Blitz:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Blinder/Blackout:</b> 3.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Boom Bringer:</b> 6.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Chem Grenade:</b> 10 <i>(note: the talent adds stacks of Chem Toxin on explosion, meaning that the Chem Grenade grants them on its initial blast. The stacks added by the area of effect remains the same)</i>.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>‘Chem Grenade’:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Now has an appropriately sized explosion radius that matches the visuals. There’s no real notable gameplay change, but it does mean that it can now properly benefit from ‘Pocket Toxin’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Duration reduced from 20s to 15s to better align with similar Blitz abilities, like the Immolation Grenade.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New, more elaborate talent description.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed terminology in some places:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Ranged-’ and ‘Melee Attack Immunity’ talents are now properly rewritten as ‘Counts as Dodging’, to convey how they actually work, and highlight that they also trigger dodges (which can interact with other talents in the Hive Scum tree).</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Dodge Extended’ has been properly rewritten as ‘Dodge Speed’ (Dodge Speed does increase the length of the dodge, but the main benefit is the increase in speed).</p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Bug Fixes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">General Fixes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an issue where the looping shooting sound for the Ogryn Twin-Linked Heavy Stubbers restarted on every bullet shot.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an outline issue when using the Desperado ability near Dreg Ritualist enemies in the Dark Communion mission.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an issue where damage from Needle Pistol Toxins didn't trigger effects from the Hive Scum Talents 'Speedloader' and 'Vulture's Mark'.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed text formatting of objectives for Hive Scum's basic training step for the Ability.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Cosmetic Fixes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Pyre Blade: fixed an issue where the VFX was not spanning the full length of the blade.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Antax Mk III Conclave-issue Tactical Helm: fixed the red visor.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Commando Beret with Augmetic Implant (Green): fixed some visual issues.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Pugilist Armour (XXXXL) (Tread Lightlies): fixed some clipping and physics issues</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/e700de79b8874e18ab7140f6074ba98f94e5b7ee.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">That’s all for today! </p><p class="bb_paragraph">We’ll see you on the Mourningstar. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">– The Darktide Team</p>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h2"><b>Greetings Space Marines,</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">First and foremost, we would like to wish you all the best for the new year. We hope that 2026 will be another great year for gaming, and we look forward to bringing more content to Space Marine 2 and seeing players enjoy it. There’s still a lot to come in the upcoming months, bear with us! 💙</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Speaking of updates, today, we’ve released a small hotfix (11.3) that brings compatibility with Microsoft Store versions. Also, Patch 12 - Techmarine Update is next! Let’s detail the content together.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/ade137b3af7da2cd7366c3c7762ccf4175375754.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>A RECAP OF PATCH 12’S CONTENT</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">We’re targeting the <b>end of February</b> for the release. Stay tuned.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>SOME TECHMARINE NEWS ⚙️</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">The wait is almost over! To make it more tolerable, we might give you as many details as we can about this new Class. A detailed Devblog was published a few days ago. If you missed it, read it now, <u>right here</u>!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">And if you’re too lazy to read all the details, here’s a summary. 😉</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>What is this new Techmarine class like?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Techmarines are specialists in crowd control and area defense. In melee, they’re able to take on large groups of enemies with their Omnissian Axe, and they also shine in mid-range combat thanks to their firearms arsenal.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Techmarine’s Special Abilities reinforce this “area defense specialist” aspect. First, the Tarantula Sentry Gun. When a Techmarine is in the squad, Tarantula Sentry Guns spawn on the map and can only be activated by the Techmarine. Once activated, they will automatically shoot at nearby enemies, until they run out of ammo or are destroyed.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Secondly, your Special Ability is the Servo-Gun, which unleashes a powerful volley on enemies, and can be upgraded with the class perks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Techmarine class will be available in all PvE and PvP modes when Patch 12 drops, for free of course. No DLC or in-game purchases required.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/429bbef9cad561ef56b6749b5b9a063fcaefb2ed.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Here’s a closer look at the Omnissian Axe, both for Loyalists and Chaos!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_th"><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/1c76d410576c5c4b4a8ec6dd1b9c41a0bfd932d6.png"/></p></div><div class="bb_table_th"><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/431e95bdb9db7b5214e9b77280e30f8eef6e8e9a.png"/></p></div></div></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Please note that the Techmarine is the only Class allowed to bear the Omnissian Axe</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">As some of you might have guessed, the Chaos counterpart to the Techmarine in PvP will be a Red Corsairs Warpsmith. </p><div class="bb_h3"><b>NEW PVE MAP “DISRUPTION”</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">With Patch 12 will come a new PVE map named “Disruption”! 💥</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Here’s the brief for your next mission:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Combat Squad Veridian must reinforce a battalion of Cadians besieged by a Tyranid swarm, when an urgent missive from an Ecclesiarchy Priest alerts them to a Thousand Sons ritual profaning a nearby Cathedral. Both onslaughts must be disrupted to prevent a domino effect that will jeopardise concurrent operations elsewhere on Avarax.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">And here’s how it looks!</p>[carousel]<img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/212dbf8ab568f359b40ca7de20c33d049187c6f8.png"/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/3889a8c3d1d1441cee177c07cf3fdafbc713afaf.png"/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/82b31cc49b30bee25470ba65da0cf936bcd53cc4.png"/>[/carousel]<p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>TWO NEW COSMETIC DLCs ARE COMING</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Coming with Patch 12.0, 2 new cosmetic DLCs are on their way!

Greave: Tactical (without thrusters) / Assault / Bulwark (without thrusters)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Backpack: Assault</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">The Raven Guard Champion Pack also includes its Bolt Pistol skin.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/21335e21b14c55f93e1158eebe1107e6a377e7c9.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>Carcharodons Cosmetic Pack</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Carcharodons Cosmetic pack includes 2 Helms, 1 Left Pauldron, 1 Right Pauldron and 1 Chestplate.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Unlike the other Cosmetic Packs, the Carcharodons Cosmetic Pack does not add a new Heraldry page to unlock the cosmetic items. Instead, the armour pieces will be automatically unlocked and added to your armour sets once you purchase the pack.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/bb1b9829061e453a2d4fbdc6b0d3e5d6f3e55a21.png"/></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>WHAT’S MORE?</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">That's not all, the Techmarine Update also brings:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">20 new modifiers for the Stratagems mode</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">You can now swap the different Space Marine heads (for example, you can use the "Assault" default head on the Sniper)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">A new equipment has been added: the Restorative Stimms. It takes the slot of your Medicae Stimms, and it will provide a different way to heal your Space Marine's wounds: instead of "burst" of heal, it will regenerate your HP overtime, and also generate contested health (up to 100% of your missing HP, which means you effectively can regen all of your missing HP when used correctly)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">3 new Heroic Weapon variants for the Combat Knife (Fencing), the Heavy Bolt Rifle (Combi Grenade Launcher) and the Omnissian Axe (Fencing). Although the three Heroic Weapons were not part of the initial plan, we were so encouraged by your enthusiasm that we chose to add them to our roadmap.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/17f3b8caa6ad37cb972478632bc312ce1b50c527.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>THE PUBLIC TEST SERVER IS LIVE!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗓️ PTS is now live on Steam, on Jan 29, and ends Feb 6th.

Same goes for the Social Wheel emotes.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">And for those who may be wondering: We’re happy to confirm that each and every one of this Voice Pack’s 1300+ total voice lines were performed by a real voice actor, as our commitment to quality remains absolute.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Voice Actors (english):</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Thomas Mitchells (Blood Angels)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Andrew James Spooner (Space Wolves)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Kris W.

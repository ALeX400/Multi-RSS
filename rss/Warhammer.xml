<div class="bb_h1">Hey Everyone,</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Today we’re showcasing the new tools of justice coming your way just for Arbites. In addition to the arsenal already at your disposal in the game (five melee and nine ranged weapons), four new unique weapons have been crafted to bring swift judgment to lexbreakers. We’ll also take you behind the scenes, sharing how these righteous implements were forged.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Here’s what’s hitting the field with the Arbites DLC:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Exterminator Shotgun: Unleash righteous fury with Special Issue shells.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Subductor Shotpistol and Riot Shield: Darktide’s first hybrid ranged/defense combo.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Arbites Shock Maul: Crush dissent with every electrified swing…</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Shock Maul and Suppression Shield: …And if that’s not enough, bring the bash too.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">Design</div><p class="bb_paragraph">For the design direction of these weapons we spoke to Matteo and Erik, Designers on Darktide who helped bring these weapons to life.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>How does the Arbites shotgun special shell work?</b><br/>With the Arbites shotgun, we are introducing a new type of limited specials.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Functionality:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Limited Special Shells</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">The number of special shells are limited and visible on the weapon’s top rack.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Special shells are replenished when picking up ammunition.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Both shotgun variants’ special shells retain their (high) regular damage output, plus special properties.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Specific Shell Variants:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Mk III: Electric Shells - Stun enemies upon impact and give Electrocution debuff with Damage over time.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Mk VIII: Rending Shells - Gives armor-breaking debuff.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Notes:</b> <i>The design intent for this is to give room for them to have a high impact. To be powerful with utility but scarce, so that you should consider saving it for difficult encounter</i>s.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Are there synergies planned between the weapons and the rest of the Arbites’ Talent Tree?</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Arbites talent tree has several nodes which enhance and/or are triggered by Blocking, which the <b>Shock Maul &amp; Suppression Shield</b> and the <b>Shotpistol &amp; Riot Shield</b> can easily utilize due to their strong block properties.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The <b>Arbites Shock Maul</b> can benefit from any source of Electrocution to trigger its powerful Special Stun, while also having the ability to slot in the High Voltage weapon blessing.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>How does the special work on the Shock Maul &amp; Suppression Shield?</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Upon blocking attacks, the absorbed energy is converted into the Special gauge, indicated diegetically from a display in the inner side of the shield. The Special gauge also slowly refills passively over time.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">When the gauge is at least half full, performing the Special input consumes half of the gauge and then triggers a high intensity shockwave in a cone in front of the shield, staggering nearby enemies and inflicting a high amount of Suppression in a large area.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Block properties of the shield are active while performing the Special, meaning it can be used as a safe way to turn the tempo of an engagement from defensive to offensive, but also to disorient ranged enemies before closing in for the kill.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>What were the influences for these weapons?</b><br/>The inspiration for the shotgun was actually the Kill Team: Exaction Squad miniatures. A large Will of the Lex dispensing shotgun!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Arbites shotgun Mk III:</b><br/>To elaborate. We imagined a large pump-action shotgun. Mk III comes with a duckbill muzzle (Horizontal spread with dynamic choke).</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The intent for it is to be great at clearing large hordes with hipfire, and competent elite single-target Aim Down Sights. Excelling at close to mid range. This should make for a versatile gun with interesting second-to-second gameplay.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Arbites shotgun Mk VIII:</b><br/>While still being a large pump-action shotgun, the Mk VIII comes with an extended barrel and is a standard spread heavy-hitter variant. Intended for mid range, with armor piercing capabilities - it serves better as a single target focus weapon.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Shotpistol &amp; Riot Shield:</b><br/>Introducing the first ranged weapon with a shield in Darktide.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We wanted to create what you would expect from an Arbites hand-cannon and shield, offering a unique playstyle that blends offense and defense.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Shotpistol unleashes devastating pellets and allows blocking while firing. This is a different weapon compared to existing revolvers. For close encounters and melee combat, use the special to push attack or heavy shield swipe.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Shock Maul + Suppression Shield:</b><br/>The idea for this weapon was to use the shield to promote blocking as a useful tool alongside the other damage-avoiding mechanics, whilst also giving it a Special which can be activated to turn the tide from defense to offense.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We also added some attacks using the shield itself, giving it a dual-wielding feel.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Arbites Shock Maul:</b><br/>The Adeptus Arbites field a large amount of mauls, so we wanted to explore the niche further by playing on their shock/stun repressive properties.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This weapon employs a primer mechanic, where the Stun from the Special attacks is triggered only if hitting an already Electrocuted enemy.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Since staggering with any attack triggers Electrocution, this creates a two-stage combo structure where players want to be looking at sources of bonus Impact and Electrocution to be able to follow-up immediately with a Special attack.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Do the shield weapons have any unique blocking properties?</b><br/>The <b>Shock Maul &amp; Suppression Shield</b> can block Ranged attacks coming from a frontal angle, while also being able to block normally unblockable attacks (e.g. Crushers’ overhead slams).</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The weapon also has a high base Stamina value and a stronger than usual Push.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Arbites Shotpistol + Riot Shield</b> can be used to block both ranged and melee attacks, while maintaining the ability to shoot when blocking.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">Animations</div><p class="bb_paragraph">To round this dev blog out, we’re going to talk about the animations with some of our animators, Jonas and Julia.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>What was it like animating these new weapons?</b><br/>A different experience than usual for sure! There was quite a lot of going back and forth, adjusting the size and shape of the weapons to make sure that it fit well with the feeling of the combat loop of Darktide. The general feel that I wanted to go for with the Arbites weapons was heavy, methodical and relentless. I also looked up at some reference material of Arbites figurines and lore to get an idea of their behavior.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This time around I didn’t have any matching props for an assault shield, so I posed around using a cardboard cut-out to test and feel how to animate certain motions and actions. The Shotpistol reload actually came to be through me testing around with holding a prop gun in different unconventional ways. As usual, I probably looked like a reject finding out what guns are for the first time.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">At first with the Shock Maul &amp; Suppression Shield, I animated the shield much slower and heavier, but at some point it felt too similar to the Ogryn slabshield and I made it a bit faster and lighter in motion. This decision made it a bit easier to incorporate the shield into the light attack chains.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Instead of making the shield feel slow and sluggish, I tried to mix it up a bit by making the<br/>Shock maul feel a bit more top-heavy instead. In the end I animated the Shock maul together<br/>with the shield to have a bit more anticipation and windups in the animations and having the<br/>impact feel a bit more like a baton. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Were there any challenges in the development of the Arbites’ weapons?</b><br/>In general I think there was a fun challenge in animating weapons with shields. Especially ranged weapons that kinda require you to use both hands when reloading or for a similar action. As an animator on Darktide I really want to highlight reloads or any other unique weapon interactions as much as possible.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">I think Shotpistol and Shield have been the most challenging weapon overall because of how<br/>you can cancel reload to go into a block. That is, since this weapon has a third state that allows<br/>you to block when you run out of ammo in-clip, it creates a lot of unexpected interactions for when going to reload and from reload or to any other disrupting action. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Which is your favourite weapon that you’ve worked on for Arbites?</b><br/>Hard to say to be completely honest. I think I like the Shotpistol and Shield most because of<br/>how different it is in comparison to other weapons. But I also really like how the new Shock Maul feels. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph">My favorite is the Shotgun, I think the model itself is really cool with its chunkyness and with the special ammo casings visible on top, and the designers did a great job with how it plays. I feel like the law! - Julia</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Are there any unique animations associated with them?</b><br/>The Shotgun’s special ammo reload received a bit of a different animation than usual. There is special ammo attached to the top of the Shotgun model, which provided an opportunity to make an animation where you pick the ammo off one by one from the model itself instead of having the ammo arrive from out-of-frame. - Julia</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>How long do animations for these take?</b><br/>It depends on the weapon and how it is going to work, but it can definitely take a while! Which was the case for the Arbites weapon family. Since we didn’t have any weapon family in Darktide that has a shield (Except for you Ogryn, you lovely brute), we chose to animate almost everything from scratch. Using Ogryn animations for this wouldn’t have worked because of rig and size differences.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">There are about 220~ different animations for each weapon family/pattern that needs to work well together in a lot of different ways due to how fast-paced and high-action Darktide is. Around 50% of my time is spent on putting everything together in the state-machine, making sure that all the animations blend well. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>What is your creative process?</b><br/>First I figure out how the weapon I’m going to animate actually functions, and try to find solid references for how they’re used. Then, for first person animations, I’m a big fan of using a GoPro as a sketching tool to showcase my early ideas and choreography. I attach it to my face (Yes, face! It looks ridiculous!) or chest, find a suitable weapon prop and then do some first person recording. It enables shaping and showcasing early ideas without having to spend any time in animation software or the game engine.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">But even without a GoPro, I like to act out the movement for more complex animations, like reloads for example. For me, it enables my first blockout pass to have passable motions and pacing, and having that to begin with makes it easier for me to push and exaggerate the timing within the movements to a speed that I myself am not able to do, but will be smooth and believable in the game context. - Julia</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The process I have is that I usually look up references for different weapons that I start working on, and learn more about the what, why and how on functionalities. Using those references on stances/poses/handlings I go further with the process of testing out motions myself with props and see what feels and looks convincing and good. After brainstorming ideas and testing around I start animating and tweaking so that it works for first-person view. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Any fun bits of trivia?</b><br/>When recording motion capture for the Shock Mine, we used a duct tape roll as our prop! - Julia</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Thank you for reading our dev blog on the making of your new weapons in your new Arbites Class, releasing on <b>June 23, 2025</b> on all platforms.

<div class="bb_h1">Hello Everyone,</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Alongside the release of the Arbites Class on June 23, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide will also receive a free update, dubbed Battle for Tertium.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">New Player Journey</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The core player experience has been reworked to provide a new clearer narrative focus, following the conflict of the Battle for Tertium. Players will now experience a linear campaign with new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. This new progression path is designed to ease in new players and gradually unlock features that were previously gated by character level. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">While previously each new player’s experience was completely random, the Battle for Tertium narrative presents maps, enemies and characters in a specific order, allowing players to discover all aspects of the game at a much better pace.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The story missions play the same as regular missions, except that these missions have a more tight control over which enemies spawn. You might also hear some new VO lines during missions, and some brand new mission debrief cinematics when completing each mission.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Existing players with characters at level 10 or higher can choose to skip the story or play it from the beginning</b>. Players who change their minds about playing the campaign can opt out by using the Personality Scourge at the Chirurgeon. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">Mission Board Rework</div><p class="bb_paragraph">A new mission board system will be bringing several changes to how you engage with missions and difficulties. Missions are no longer tied to a specific difficulty, allowing you to select a mission and then choose the difficulty you want. This will effectively increase the amount of mission options available for players of all difficulty levels. While most circumstances remain consistent across difficulty levels, some are disabled on lower difficulties. Notably, Maelstrom missions are exclusive to the Heresy and Auric difficulties.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Additionally, the difficulty system has also been overhauled. You now unlock new difficulties by completing missions rather than leveling up your characters. You must prove your skills at your current maximum difficulty to unlock access to the next one. We intend to create a motivation for new players to master the game step by step, and for veteran players to feel assured that their teammates have earned the right to be there.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">You will make progress by playing missions at your current maximum difficulty. Completing missions advances your progress. Failure reduces progress but very slightly. Additionally, you will never be demoted to a lower difficulty tier, regardless of how many missions you fail. Higher difficulties will require you to complete more missions to unlock them.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For existing characters, your difficulty progression will be migrated based on their character level and completed missions.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Auric is now a standalone difficulty tier, placed above Damnation. We felt that Auric Heresy fell in an awkward spot compared to Damnation, with the increased mission options per difficulty, we decided it was best to turn Auric into its own difficulty level. Additionally, we have removed Sedition difficulty and made a few minor changes to Uprising to take its place, as we felt there was too much downtime with too few enemies between hordes. These changes aim to keep you in the action more often.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>Mortis Trials</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>The Secrets of the Shipmistress</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Sefoni’s indiscretions are getting worse! During Mortis Trials, keen-eared Rejects now have the opportunity to sift pieces of Shipmistress Brahms’ past from the psychic chatter. How did she inherit the Mourningstar? What is she hiding? Is she really on the same side as Grendyl, let alone his irksome busybodies? Delve deeper into all these and more across dozens of new memory echoes, unlockable by claiming victory in the Mortis Trials!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Dev Note: </b><i>If you've ever wanted to relisten to the memory echoes you've unlocked in the Mortis Trials, you should take a look behind the pillars in the meat grinder.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New difficulty for Mortis Trials</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Since the release of Mortis Trials we have noticed people requesting a higher challenge in Mortis Trials! So, we are adding a new difficulty, Auric, as well as some other small changes.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">There will now be a shorter time in between waves.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Waves will now have more enemies and enemy types increasing variety.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">We are changing the base difficulty to match an Auric difficulty mission.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">Weapon Balancing</div><p class="bb_paragraph">This initial set of balance adjustments focuses on improving underperforming weapons so they can better compete with top-tier options. Some of these changes also pave the way for new weapons, such as the powerful signature shotgun coming with the Arbites class. Adjustments to existing shotguns were made to ensure the Arbites weapons feel satisfying without completely overshadowing their existing counterparts.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This first round is not exhaustive but represents a step toward better overall balance.

<div class="bb_h2">Hey Everyone!</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Welcome to a new series of balancing blogs for Darktide! Going forward we will be doing regular balance changes to the game alongside big updates. As part of this journey we want to include you, the community, by sharing our intended changes early on to gather feedback and ensure our intention matches your expectations. Let's begin by discussing our approach to balancing Darktide. We strive to create a balanced game environment, recognizing that perfect balance in a PvE-focused game may be unattainable and perhaps unnecessary. However, a reasonable level of balance among weapons is essential. This ensures players feel empowered to experiment with various setups and choose options that are both enjoyable and engaging for their playstyle.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This initial set of balance adjustments focuses on improving underperforming weapons so they can better compete with top-tier options.

Going forward, we plan to implement more frequent balance updates to keep the game fresh, address outliers, and introduce new and interesting playstyles. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">List:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Coming changes in 1.8.0</i></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>"Devil's Claw" Swords</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Tactical Axes</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Shock Mauls</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Heavy Eviscerators</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Helbore Lasguns</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Combat Shotguns</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Double-barreled Shotgun</i></p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Catachan "Devil's Claw" Swords</div><p class="bb_paragraph">This batch of changes for the Devil’s Claw swords aims at further reinforcing the crowd control and reliability of the family.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We increased the offensive properties of the Light attack profiles, while also significantly increasing the armour damage modifiers of the Heavy Strikedown and Special Riposte profiles against specific armour types.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We improved the base Stamina statistic, reduced the minimum Block time (the amount of time that the Block stance must be maintained after performing the input) and allowed for most attacks and attack starts to be performed while sprinting.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This will make the weapon snappier and more responsive in different situations.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we took a pass on all attacks to tweak active windows, ranges and hitboxes to be better aligned with their animations.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk I</b>, we added a new Heavy Strikedown attack, only reached from Light 3. In turn, the Light 3 attack is now reachable also from the Push action, and has an increased baseline power multiplier. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">These additions will grant additional options to a mark which was lacking in single target attacks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk IV</b>, we raised the power level multiplier of the Light 4 attack as it was very far into the attack chain and not particularly enticing.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk VII</b>, we increased the power level multiplier of the Pushfollow and Light 3 attacks while also changing the possible combos after a Riposte attack.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Now after a successful Special Parry, the combo will chain into the Pushfollow attack instead of Light 3; as the Pushfollow attack still chains into Light 3, this will give the mark a new unique chain.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Catachan "Devil's Claw"

With the Adeptus Arbites becoming directly involved in the affairs of the von Valancius protectorate in the upcoming Lex Imperialis expansion, it is only logical to talk about their iconic tool - shields!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/e33a14703f1210f6ca0f03207ca0cf8e7d78fcce.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Defensive Capabilities Taken to a New Level</div><br/>Shields are a brand new type of equipment introduced with the Lex Imperialis expansion. They will soon become available across the whole game for all players, even those without the DLC, and will come in a variety of shapes and designs:<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/df3e0bf8bd8c3b0a388358a855bf96f30b2721e0.jpg"/><br/><br/>Shields are considered a special kind of one-handed melee weapon and take up a total of two weapon slots, one from each weapon set. You can attack, parry, and make attacks of opportunity with shields in melee, but their main purpose is suppression and negating damage. <br/><br/>And they are quite effective at that. Abelard approves!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/869f6d145437547f72ab2446c3bcb9781cb5e0f9.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Preventing the Damage</div><br/>Shields provide a new stat called <b>Block</b>, which gives the wielder a chance to completely negate the incoming attack, similar to how <b>Parry</b> and <b>Dodge</b> function (and stacking with them!). The chance to <b>block</b> is determined by the shield itself, and is not affected by the wearer’s or the attacker’s stats. It can, however, be modified by various items and talents.<br/><br/><b>Block</b> works against both melee and ranged attacks. It is especially effective against burst attacks - once any hit from a burst attack is blocked, the remaining hits are negated automatically. A blocked attack can also never overpenetrate!<br/><br/>Predictably, shields will not save you against psychic powers.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/b6904c4daf6a36252c86b7cc511d9fff541893dd.gif"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Tactical Advantages</div><br/>All archetypes have access to shields, which offers a rich layer of new tactical opportunities for defensive gameplay with dedicated tank characters. To allow for even more build variety, we’re adding multiple new universally available talents that boost shield effectiveness.<br/><br/>Here are some examples:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Shield Mastery</b> allows the shield to only occupy a slot in a single weapon set.<br/></li><li> <b>Defensive Manoeuvre</b> allows the bearer to regain <b>2 MP</b> after attacking with a shield.<br/></li><li> <b>Strong Hand</b> gives the wielder <b>+5% block</b> and allows them to deal <b>+50% </b>more damage when attacking with a shield.</li></ul><br/><b>Subductor</b>, one of the specialties of the new Arbitrator origin, is specifically designed with a shield in mind. These assault specialists have access to a set of additional talents and abilities that further boost the effectiveness of shields, such as charging forward with a shield, automatically scoring critical hits with shield attacks on immobilized or prone enemies, gaining a bonus to Toughness that scales from Block, or even reflecting enemy attacks back at them!<br/><br/>The only characters in the Lord Captain’s retinue who cannot use shields are the xenos, who rely on agility rather than this crude Imperial method of protection, Pasqal, and the mighty Ulfar, who believes that the best defense is a brutal offense.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/26d784beeecdaeac7ab543c197c08fdc4177f202.jpg"/><br/><br/>Beyond often having special effects, each shield also always provides a wielder, of any archetype, with the special ability <b>Stalwart Defence</b>. It allows them to select a zone and immediately end the turn, significantly increasing <b>block</b> chance against all enemies in that zone and making an attack of opportunity in response to the first successfully <b>blocked</b> melee attack from each of these enemies:<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/f4dfe1927eb360f22898c0d0a8f52a4581abe0e8.gif"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Challenges </div><br/>Where there is a tool, there will always be those who make use of it. In Lex Imperialis, allies and enemies will also take advantage of shields, requiring new tactics in order to deal with the additional protection they provide.<br/><br/>Some existing talents such as <b>Take Aim!</b> or <b>Deadeye Shot</b> have been updated with additional effects to reduce block, and multiple new items across the game have been added to interact with these new mechanics. <br/><br/>How do you plan to build your retinue with shields in mind, Lord Captain?<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/5372f4f249d0955bdf6d7d8c53179df6c5031e90.jpg"/><br/><br/>See you soon in the Lex Imperialis expansion!<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

Lord Captains! A hotfix 1.2.0.28 is live! <br/><br/>In this hotfix we're getting rid of multiple mysterious 'hidden' lines and character names across the game and adding missing localization strings to multiple languages. <br/><br/>We really appreciate the bugreports you send us, and already busy investigating the problems you reported. Thank you, and keep it coming!<br/><br/>We also kindly remind you to update your mods, as they are often the reason of the issues you may encounter.]]></description>

We did not want to rush this, as it was important to consider all the progress and time put in by current players of the game, too. <br/><br/>Our goal is to improve player agency. We are putting the focus on giving players a clear path to get the weapons and gameplay they want. <br/><br/>Part of this agency will be achieved by removing the locks on Blessings and Perks.<br/><br/>The rest of the player agency will be achieved through the introduction of two new major systems for itemization: Mastery and Expertise <b>(final names pending)</b>. These systems will make the players journey in the game more rewarding and customizable. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Mastery</div><br/>This is the core progression system that is tied to the weapon type / weapon family itself. As players use a specific weapon, they‚Äôll gain more experience. This unlocks new blessings, perks, marks and a special weapon cosmetic along the way via the reward tracks. As players progress, the potential quality and stats of the weapon also increases. <br/><br/>This system will merge all weapon types/families, meaning players will be able to freely switch between different marks of the same weapon type. For example, once you own an Infantry Lasgun, you have the potential to unlock all the possible marks for this weapon and switch from one mark to another. <br/><br/>When viewing any weapon, it will show the weapon‚Äôs maximum potential stats. These stats will be randomly determined. It‚Äôs up to the players to decide if the weapon profile is interesting enough for them to commit and increase the stats until reaching this potential (which are then applied to the weapon through the Expertise system). <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/035926fb276cdb5f826e116b577433213a65f049.jpg"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/8122a0ae3344ed25b8256ebe257508da8de35e14.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Expertise</div><br/>While the Mastery system is where a player unlocks the potential for a weapon, the Expertise system is where the players apply those changes via crafting. This is when the players create an actual relationship with the weapon. Players will be able to configure the weapon, change the Blessings or Perks, and increase the stats. Players will no longer be locked after making two changes on Perks or Blessings.<br/><br/>This is also when the player uses resources to make these changes happen. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/f1a83420efa5044482005748d892db0e0c161430.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What About Resources?</div>While we were planning this itemization rework, there were a lot of discussions around this topic. Creating an entirely new resource is a bit easier for balancing, but we don‚Äôt want to start a new grind for players. We wanted to have a system which respects players‚Äô time. As such, we decided to keep plasteel and diamantine steel as the resources for changing weapons, but we worked on balancing. <br/><br/>We wanted to give a new life to diamantine. As diamantine is a resource introduced at a higher level of game play, it is also the required resource for achieving higher levels of Expertise on a weapon. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What Happens to My Existing Inventory?</div>When designing itemization, we wanted to commit to ensuring fairness for all players, new and old. As such, we‚Äôre implementing a migration system to convert players' current weapons and blessings into the new system. <br/><br/>Here‚Äôs how it works: The blessing library of the weapon family will be converted into mastery progression. This means players will start the new systems with a head start in mastery, giving them the chance to unlock previously owned blessings (as well as the chance to unlock some blessings players never had before the update).<br/><br/>Our aim is to preserve players hard-earned progress and make this shift as smooth as possible.<br/><br/><b>What about Curios?</b> Curios will have their locks removed but they will remain unaffected beyond this change.<br/><br/>We are continuing to optimize this system in the coming weeks and we look forward to reading your feedback on the process outlined. We‚Äôll collect any questions below so that we can release further communications on the topic as we make progress.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>]]></description>

Lord Captain!<br/><br/>In ‚ÄúVoid Shadows‚Äù you will not only meet new enemies, but also new allies. One of them is a secretive Death Cult that worships the Emperor in his most merciless form, the god of death. Sounds intriguing? Then take a look!<br/><br/>

‚ÄãHey Folks, <br/><br/>As revealed only a few short weeks ago, our next DLC for Total War: WARHAMMER III brings Khorne, Ogre Kingdoms, and Orcs &amp; Goblins to the centre stage.  <br/><br/>Today we‚Äôre thrilled to be sharing more insight into what you can expect when this content releases at the end of 2024, the Legendary Lords that are set to lead each faction (alongside some sneak peeks at a couple of key units), and how we‚Äôre using this time between now and the launch of this DLC to cast our eyes back onto the core game experience and to ask ourselves, and you, what changes and experiences we can bring to that.<br/><br/>Watch the full conversation with Senior Community Manager Steve Coleman, Senior Game Director Rich Aldridge, alongside DLC Lead designer Sean Macdonald, and Associate Game Director Victor Dosev right here üëá üëÄ <br/><br/>

<br/>As talked about by Rich in this Development Update, our next DLC takes place entirely within Immortal Empires, and won‚Äôt feature a new campaign for The Realm of Chaos. We‚Äôll continue to support campaigns in The Realm of Chaos regardless in our updates and hotfixes, ensuring that the experience is always fun, balanced, and available to old and new players alike, but we wanted to make sure everyone understood our direction for the game moving forward.<br/><br/>It‚Äôs also been a while since we talked to you so directly in this style of content, so please do share your thoughts and feedback on the format of videos like this too as we‚Äôd love to hear from you, and love to keep showing up on your screens just like this in the future.<br/><br/>We‚Äôll return in the late summer with another development update from the teams, letting you know how we‚Äôre getting on with our work and to lift the curtain some more on the work we have in progress.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, we‚Äôve just launched Update 5.1 for all players, bringing best boi Karanak to the roster alongside a tonne of fixes, balance passes, and improvements to the game. In the coming weeks, we‚Äôre looking to release a Hotfix to help tidy up a few latent issues we‚Äôve spotted since the Update went live, and we‚Äôll keep you updated on future our releases as we roll out each one. <br/><br/>We‚Äôre otherwise especially keen to hear how you‚Äôre feeling about today‚Äôs news, so please do join us over on the Official Total War Discord, and the Total War Forums to share your feedback, and pose all-new questions for us to look at answering in the future.<br/><br/>See you on the battlefields, <br/>Freeman // Head of Community  <br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, drop by our official social channels.

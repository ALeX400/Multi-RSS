Your devotion and passion has been a blessing and a source of motivation to us. We value your feedback and enjoy working in collaboration with you like we did through this first year.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Both Saber and Focus are incredibly fond of this project and we‚Äôll continue to cherish it. We cannot wait to see how this second year rolls out.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Again, <b>thank you</b> so much for siding with us. üíô</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/c1005e4d0b52a6bd57c7e1e77511eaa9b51991c6.jpg"/><b></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>You will see that this month our Game Director has left a few personal notes in the Community Update, giving away hints on the development of the game</b>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>LATEST NEWS üóûÔ∏è</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This month we released the 10.0 - Anniversary Update, including new free and DLC content such as 2 new games modes: Helbrute Onslaught and Stratagems, new weapons like the PyreCannon, the Power Axe and the Hero Weapon Variants, the Chaos Spawn and the Mutalith Vortex Beast, along with improvements and balancing on both PvP and PvE.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>‚Äã<b>PATCH 10 STABILITY</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Patch 10 was our biggest update for the game and unfortunately a lot of minor, yet super game breaking issues or balancing misconfigurations got in it. I would like to apologize for the inconvenience caused. Normally, we would catch the issues during the PTS phase, but we didn‚Äôt do PTS for Patch 10 because we simply didn‚Äôt have time for it, plus we didn‚Äôt want to spoil the surprise.¬†</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>PTS will return for Patch 11 and all subsequent patches (unless we do another huge anniversary patch üòä).</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Dmitriy Grigorenko - Game Director</i></p></blockquote><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Regarding the issues with Battlefield Conditions that have occurred since the implementation of Stratagems (i.e: ‚ÄúEquipment Malfunction‚Äù blocking the progression on Exfiltration), we were made aware of that and are currently working on it to prevent this scenario from happening again in the future. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><p class="bb_paragraph"><i><b>‚ÄãSTRATAGEMS</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Our objective with Stratagems was to add the hardest content in the game and we are not planning to make Weekly Hard Stratagems easier. However, we are going to continue to address some of the issues with Daily Stratagems in Patch 11.¬†</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>First of all, Daily Stratagems are random, this is why some of the Battlefield Conditions combinations do not make any sense or are too punishing or restrictive for no reason. The truth is that there are not enough Battlefield Conditions right now. With Patch 11 we are going to add a second batch of Battlefield Conditions (~50 of them). Having more Battlefield Conditions will allow us to remove some that don‚Äôt work on their own from the Daily rotation pool.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Weekly Stratagems are completely different. Each Weekly Stratagem has a pre-made Battlefield Condition combination + level attached to it. All 52 Weekly Stratagems are hand crafted and are designed to be either hard or fun depending on the week. The key here is to make sure that it's different every week and, ideally, players have to alter their play style.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>We are working on allowing players to toggle Battlefield Conditions manually in Private Lobbies so players can come up with their own fun combinations. Siege mode will eventually see Battlefield Conditions integrated into it for increased replayability.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Dmitriy Grigorenko - Game Director</i></p></blockquote><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">In this Community Update we‚Äôll tackle Patch 11.0 with a sneak peek, a new limited edition for the game, the upcoming demo and the Discord Quest.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>UPDATE 10.2 ‚öôÔ∏è</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">In September we rolled out 2 hotfixes, the latest is 10.2. It fixes critical issues such as the Assault‚Äôs Ascension perk dealing friendly-fire damage, Stratagems having more Battlefield Conditions than listed and more. Also, the Sniper‚Äôs Camo Cloak activation cost changed. If you want to read the changelog, you may find it¬†here.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>UPDATE 11 TEASING üëÄ</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The upcoming Update 11 will be released aound late-November and will bring 2 new cosmetic DLCs! As announced in our roadmap, the next Champion Pack will be the Blood Angels‚Äô and it will be associated with the Tactical class. Yes, Tactical. Now, before all Blood Angels come to our office searching for Horus, please note that the Champion Pack will also come with its own unique Jump Pack, and its individual parts can be used separately like with other champions. We will reveal its design in the October Community Update. ü©∏ </p><p class="bb_paragraph">As for the Salamanders Cosmetic Pack, it will include the heraldry of various Salamanders Successor Chapters, as well as different armour parts. ü¶é</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Regarding gameplay additions, the next PvE Operation will be an off-planet mission introducing a new boss fight. ü¶á Here‚Äôs a preview of the inside and the outside of the area:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p>[carousel]<img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/12e93112ff98c12edc18ff1b109974767c41967a.png"/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/c2ecd6dc6a5e71e03065ffab51d1f2e1d2611360.png"/>[/carousel]<p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We‚Äôve also seen that you‚Äôre having many questions regarding the Heroic Weapons. We will keep adding new Heroic Weapon with the major updates, starting with Update 11. We can‚Äôt show you them yet, but we can already tell you that the Thunder Hammer will be among these weapons.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Lastly on the Update 11 topic, a long-awaited feature will be added: <b>Bots Customisation!</b> ‚ú® When launching a PvE Operation with bots, they will automatically equip one of your loadouts. We will detail this new feature later on, so bear with us.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Oh and here‚Äôs more news to rejoice to: <b>there will be a Public Test Server for Patch 11.0!</b> Stay tuned üòâ</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>HEROIC ITEMS</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>We are going to continue adding more and more Heroic items to the game, both Armour and Weapons.

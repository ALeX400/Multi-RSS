We felt this was the right choice since cloud <b>Workshop</b> <b>support</b> wasn't going to be ready for next week, and there's still some polish things we'd like to add to the editor, which we think the community will really appreciate.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Now, some of you gits might be thinking "Why doz dis matta to a speedy, smashy, krumpy git like me dat just speedily smash's and krumps ova gits?"</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Well, my mean and green friend, a <b>level editor</b> with a shared <b>Workshop</b> means that there will be lotz and lotz of new, community-made levels to play with each other - and if what we've seen so far from our testers is any indication, there will be some <b>INSANE</b> <b>maps</b>.</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">And if you're the type of git who likes to make maps, even better.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Our testers and us devs have had some amazing sessions of a host creating maps in realtime, <i>while others played them as they were being built</i>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">These play sessions can turn into absolute lunacy, especially when in voice chat together.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For example, this was the beginning of a silly level we started making as a team in realtime.<br/>But this is nothing compared to how much more you can do with the editor.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/d19e99c4275f99c91c1ec52d5384dd9356915e88.gif"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">So yeah, as we've said before, we are <b>super excited</b> to share this feature with the player base and can't wait for you guys can see what people build - either right in front of your eyes while playing, or by downloading it from the Workshop.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e0db447dc486730af2bd5402e608ced9bea38b7e.png"/> </p><div class="bb_h2">DA MAPS üó∫Ô∏è</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Alright, wot about sum more info on da update next week ya?</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We've got two new maps, one for each <b>Kill Konvoy</b> and <b>Deff Rally</b>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Kill Konvoy - Scrap In Da Yard</b> takes place in a - you guessed it - massive scrapyard. There's moving scrap everywhere, lots of verticality to take advantage of, and a massive trench in the second half which leads to a big scrap dump for the final stretch.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We think this is one of the best Konvoy maps yet, and we think you'll agree once you play it a couple times üëç</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/12ac9dfc13732a526cef153d6148ed15b99737ce.gif"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">It's also got a spooky secondary lighting version:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/4db8b1cdd9ed38eb2398b0465bb913900bbecc90.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Deff Rally - Deff Gorge</b> is a DR version of Kill Konvoy - Da Gorge, after a snowfall and the area has been somewhat abandoned. The level's alternate lighting is quite striking having a sunset contrasting with the snowy ground.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Gorge makes for a great race playground, and you'll see what we mean when you play it.

It's Summer Sale time! <br/><br/>Whether you are an experienced Lord Captain that wishes to expand their trade protectorate with new worlds and engage in new adventures in the Koronus Expanse, or you are only yet to receive your own Warrant of Trade and inherit the most sacred title of a Rogue Trader of von Valancius Dynasty, this is a good time to consider one or more of the following options!<br/><br/>1. Begin your adventure aboard your personal, giant voidship, traveling between the multitude of systems within the Koronus Expanse, a barely charted and incredibly perilous region of space. Despite being considered a backwater of the Imperium, this region encompasses an enormous stretch of the void, filled with dangerous creatures and prodigious opportunities for profit and exploration:<br/><br/>

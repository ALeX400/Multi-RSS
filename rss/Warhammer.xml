Same goes for the Social Wheel emotes.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">And for those who may be wondering: We’re happy to confirm that each and every one of this Voice Pack’s 1300+ total voice lines were performed by a real voice actor, as our commitment to quality remains absolute.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Voice Actors (english):</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Thomas Mitchells (Blood Angels)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Andrew James Spooner (Space Wolves)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Kris W.

<p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <i><b>Are there individual Packs? Or, are the 3 heads tied in the same Pack?</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ The Voice Pack comes with a set of three new heads for PvE. All three heads (Space Wolf, Blood Angel, Black Templars) are part of the same Voice Pack. They cannot be sold separately.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <i><b>Can I equip one Chapter’s head with another Chapter’s voice?</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ Yes, you can equip one Chapter’s head with another Chapter’s voice. Voices and heads aren’t tied together.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <i><b>Is the Voice Pack Class-Specific? For example: is the Space Wolf for Vanguard only?</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ No, they aren’t class-restricted. You will hear the new voice lines regardless of the Class you’ve picked.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <i><b>Will other Chapters get a Voice Pack in the future?</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ Absolutely! A second Voice Pack is in the making. We’ll reveal which Chapters will receive it, later this year. Stay tuned! </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <i><b>Will the original heads that are in the game now be interchangeable as well?</b></i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ Yes.</p>]]></description>

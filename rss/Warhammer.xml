We‚Äôre interviewing devs working on Darktide to share what it‚Äôs like to create the game. <br/><br/>For today‚Äôs blog, we‚Äôre talking about Voice Over Recording and VO Rules. Have you ever been surprised by a piece of dialogue you‚Äôve never heard before? Have you ever wondered what it‚Äôs like in the booth when recording your favourite lines? Today, you‚Äôll get to find out how it works.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Runtime Dialogue System and VO Rules</div>Our first topic is written by our VO Design guru, Ola. Take it away, Ola!<br/><br/>Darktide's VO system was built off of the way VO worked in our two previous ‚ÄòTide titles, with a lot of additional bells and whistles.<br/><br/>This VO system is a context-aware system, where we send queries to see if we can play something and it will return results based on what the current status of the game is.<br/><br/>We track many many different contexts for this purpose. Some examples include:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> How much health and ammo do the players have?<br/></li><li> Are there other players or enemies nearby? If so, how many?<br/></li><li> Is the combat intense?<br/></li><li> What previous dialogue has played and how long ago was it?<br/></li><li> What weapons do you have equipped at the moment?<br/></li><li> Which players are in the game?<br/></li><li> Which mission are you in?<br/></li><li>What trust level* do you have?</li></ul>(* <i>Trust level is based on the player level 1-30.</i>)<br/><br/>Based on all of these contexts, we set up dialogue rules. These are buckets of VO lines, and when the system finds a match, it prioritizes it based on the amount of contexts it has hit. The more specific a line is, the higher priority it has to play.<br/><br/>We currently have around 90,000 voice lines in the game spread across a total of 6,000 rules. (For context, Vermintide 2 has approximately 39,000 voice lines.) Some of these rules are insanely rare. Part of this is by design. But part of it is that with such a large amount of rules requiring different combinations of contexts, some are bound to be very rare.<br/><br/>The idea is that even if you have played the game for a very long time, you should still feel that from time to time you come across lines you've never heard before. Our player character personalities also play a big part in this. Many lines vary from personality to personality. Therefore, some lines will only ever play when both of those personalities are present in a game together. And as we have 21 personalities, this creates many combinations that take time to discover.<br/><br/>Our most common VO rule is a rule that‚Äôs activated when Newly Infected assault players.<br/>This rule has been played 70,000,000 times in the last 30 days (at the time of writing this).<br/><br/>It has the following requirements:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>For that specific enemy to not have played their assault rule* in the last 8 seconds.<br/></li><li>For all newly infected to not have played their assault rule* in the last 4 seconds.</li></ul>(* <i>Assault rule refers to a rule that plays a voice line when an enemy is attacking or running toward the player.</i>)<br/><br/>Our most rare rule is a bonding conversation between the female Savant Psyker and the Ogryn Bodyguard, where the Savant complains that the Bodyguard tends to get in the way due to his size.<br/><br/>In comparison, this rule has only been played 19 times in the last 30 days.<br/><br/>It has the following requirements:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Have at least one friend nearby;<br/></li><li> No enemies nearby;<br/></li><li> For the tension to be decaying (meaning combat has just taken place);<br/></li><li> To have the female Savant Psyker present in the game;<br/></li><li> To have the Ogryn Bodyguard in the game;<br/></li><li> For there not to have been a banter conversation within the last 140 seconds; and<br/></li><li> The Savant Psyker to have triggered the ‚Äúfriendly fire‚Äù VO on the Ogryn Bodyguard within the last 90 seconds.</li></ul>Now rare rules are okay, but this is close to non-existent. In an effort to make this rule play somewhat more often, I have recently tweaked these requirements to:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Have less than 3 enemies nearby (from 0);<br/></li><li> No banter in the last 100 seconds (from 140); and<br/></li><li> For the female Savant Psyker to have triggered the friendly fire VO on the Ogryn Bodyguard in the last 180 seconds (from 90).</li></ul>From time to time, we do these kinds of tweaks to the dialogue to try to shift what will be heard, tune down the most common conversations and tune up the rarest. All to keep the dialogue feeling like an alive and dynamic experience for all of the players! (Note: I personally get a real kick out of seeing people posting rare conversations on reddit.)<br/><br/>We put together a video with a series of voice lines that can show the specificity with which these voice rules are created, as well as the pure talent from our voice actors. These lines include:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Zealot hears a Horde coming<br/></li><li> Veteran bonding conversation when low on health<br/></li><li> Pskyer finds ammo when a Zealot is low on ammo<br/></li><li> Veteran sees an Ogryn on a killstreak<br/></li><li> Psyker sees someone hogging ammo<br/></li><li> Ogryn finds a health boost while a Veteran is low on health<br/></li><li> Ogryn responds to friendly fire from a Zealot.</li></ul>https://youtu.be/n8Zbzw2DGug <br/>Alright, that‚Äôs it for now! If you‚Äôre excited to hear more about this topic, we have plenty more to talk about like the sound design of Darktide, implementation and WIPs, collaboration with level design or other disciplines, etc. If you have any specific questions related to voice over rules, or you‚Äôd like to hear more on the topic, please let us know.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Recording Voices</div>Our next topic is written by our Sound and VO team member, David. Go for it, David!<br/><br/>For Darktide, we want all of the voice-overs (VO) to sound natural, as if they belong in the world of the game and they come from the character that is speaking.<br/><br/>There are many things to keep in mind to achieve this goal. For example, when recording voices it's therefore important to be consistent when it comes to the mics and how they are positioned relative to the actor/actress. In both of the recording studios, OMUK and Molinare in London, we use the same type of DPA mic that sits on a person‚Äôs forehead. This gives the actor/actress the possibility to move and do gestures while talking. <br/><br/>For Darktide, most of our voice-over is either barking during combat, or talking while walking or even running. It's important to capture this sense of movement and effort. We have tried to achieve this by actually letting the actor/actress move during the recording or add pauses and breaths before/after or in between words. Imagine how you would talk while jogging with a friend. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going for during the session.<br/><br/>Before and during the recording session, my role as a game developer/voice designer is to give the voice director and the actor/actress as much context as possible about the game and the specific situations. For example, if the voice-over line is meant to be delivered while someone is being dragged up after being knocked down, it‚Äôs important for the actor/actress to convey this through effort and strain in the voice. If I had to pick, the most common comment from me to the voice director or actor/actress, it‚Äôd probably be: "Can we have a bit more effort and movement in the voice please?" It's not super fun when you see how sweaty the actors/actresses are, but it's necessary for world-building.<br/><br/>That‚Äôs all for the first peek into what it‚Äôs like to record voice lines for Darktide. Would you like to hear more on the topic, such as drafting the voice lines, or what lines are the most difficult to get right? Maybe a deeper dive on the enemy voice work? Do you have any questions for our voice actors? Let us know!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/>And so ends our second Darktide 101 dev blog. What topic would you like to hear about next time? Do you have any questions for the devs working on Voice Acting and VO for Darktide? Comment below <br/> and we‚Äôll try to get some more dev replies for you!<br/><br/>Until next time!<br/>]]></description>

It pits two teams of eight against each other in a race to capture points. The first one there, scores big for their team.  <br/><br/>Getting there first is, on paper, the easy part. You and your team then must hold the capture point as the enemy arrives, and the frenzy of bullets unfurls. Holding the point increases how many points you earn. Control is easy to lose, so keeping the capture point is crucial for victory. <br/><br/>Eventually, the point is secured, and a mad dash to reach and dominate the next point begins.  <br/> <br/>When all Capture points have been fought over, a final high Orktane race to the finish line beings to see who‚Äôs the ultimate speedy Ork. Your placement in the final race will decide how many points you earn, so it‚Äôs all about getting there faster than your opponents. Death, naturally, will slow you down.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/612062d68d7a35884219a907993bdfcb1b59ba2c.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>Each vehicle has unique roles and abilities that come to life in Deff Rally. We can‚Äôt wait to see how you play it and evolve the game-mode. Here‚Äôs some examples of how vehicles can be played in Deff Rally. <br/><br/><b>Boomdakka Snazzwagon ‚Äì</b> With the Snazzagon being better in mid-close ranges, it excels when on the offense taking back the point or getting into the heart of the enemy team. <br/><br/><b>Defkilla Wartrike ‚Äì</b> Because the Deffkilla Wartrike will struggle if it sits still on a capture point, you will often see it drive around taking down key enemy targets, such as Rukkatrukk Squigbuggies or long ranged vehicles. <br/><br/><b>Shokkjump Dragsta ‚Äì</b> The Shokkjump Dragsta is fast, so getting to the next objective first, or winning the race is where the Shokkjump Dragsta really shines. <br/><br/><b>Kustom Boosta Blasta ‚Äì</b> With some of the best mid to long ranges, chipping away at enemies while they‚Äôre approaching the capture point is a specialty of this vehicle. Soften them up for your team. <br/><br/><b>Looted Wagon ‚Äì</b> With heavy damage at long range, one well-placed shot from the Looted Wagon can decide if a push onto the point will succeed or not. <br/><br/><b>Grot Mega Tank ‚Äì</b> As the heaviest of the bunch, dislodging a Grot Mega Tank from the point after they‚Äôve gotten settled is a struggle. Hold the point while your team is focused on stopping the enemy attack is where the Grot Mega Tank excels. <br/><br/><b>Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy ‚Äì</b> Don't underestimate the Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy because they can quickly get their team back to full health and ready for the next enemy push onto the point. Recovering your teams' health stops them from being krumped and ultimately delayed while respawning. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c603ec0a4576ad8b56527c5b6ea0076f2baf2ddb.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>Your feedback this past year has helped us balance and shape Deff Rally into what you will see with August 6th release. <br/><br/>This game mode will continue to evolve with your feedback so don‚Äôt hesitate to leave your thoughts over on our feedback and bug reporting board: https://speedfreeks40k.featureupvote.com/ <br/><br/>With four maps available on early access release, and changes to the ones you know we‚Äôre excited to get you back in as fast as possible! <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/cf69ebec1314f26aef699ada21bfa45f7a8651c2.png"/><br/>On behalf of Caged Element and PLAION, we‚Äôz shoutin‚Äô a big WAAAGH!

While there are returning characters, it's a fresh story that can be understood as its own without having played the first game.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Will the game be available on GeForce Now? <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Yes.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Will it be possible to pre-download the game before the release?<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> No.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Is there couch co-op?<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> No, co-op features will only be available online.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Does the game require to be ‚Äúalways online‚Äù to play?<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Offline mode is available for the campaign <br/></li><li> PVE can be played offline, but you won't have access to progression if you do not connect to the servers.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> How long does it take to complete the campaign?<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> On average, the campaign should take between 10 to 12 hours to complete. This can vary depending on the difficulty and your player profile.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> What are the PC specs?<br/> <ul class="bb_ul"><li> At this moment, we are conducting the final PC specs tests. We‚Äôre very aware that it‚Äôs one of the most awaited information on the game, and we will come back to you within the next couple of weeks with the recommended and minimum specs.</li></ul></li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>What‚Äôs next in August?</b></div><br/>We know you‚Äôre super thirsty for more content so be assured that you do not need to worry, you can expect more videos to pop up on our YouTube and social media channels (Discord, Twitter, Facebook). <br/>Talking about videos, we‚Äôre currently publishing on our secondary channel a series of short videos detailing some aspects of the game: weapons, enemies, environments‚Ä¶ <br/><br/>You'll find the complete playlist <b>here</b>.<br/><br/>Amongst the upcoming short videos, there will be more weapons, a rundown of the different PvE classes, and more!<br/><br/>On top of that, you can expect co-op previews to start dropping during August, with content creators starting publishing videos on their side as well. <br/><br/>Next, we‚Äôll detail the post-launch content of Space Marine 2 in a blog article that should be published around mid-August.<br/><br/>Finally, we‚Äôre reaching the final stages of our North America Tour, with Chicago (August 16-18) and Toronto (August 22-25) being the final places where you‚Äôll be able to put your hands on Space Marine 2‚Äôs demo before the release. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/1775b7d9acd2d9d530728b5ab5361daa9a3ab05f.jpg"/><br/><br/>Aaand that‚Äôs it for this month!

A mid-ranged vehicle who lays down Dakka upon the battlefield from afar and uses their utility to stay at a distance. <br/><br/>In Speed Freeks this versatile vehicle allows for a lot of different playstyles to suit the scenarios you find yourself in. Whether it‚Äôs using your mobility to help out with objectives, laying down fire on the battlefield, helping to pick off key targets or putting pressure on the enemy tanks.<br/><br/>The base speed of this vehicle is average, tied with the Boomdakka Snazzwagon. However, the Burna Exhaust ability is a strong movement tool that opens a lot of possibilities, such as jumping onto a roof to escape enemies, getting extra airtime to recharge your boost bar, or using Dash right as you land to convert vertical speed into horizontal speed. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/b09f0fbdabff31ddd0d90ffe6e1290afadc13069.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Abilities</div><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c92d9b0654284f8bf398169b2199225006cf54ac.png"/><br/><b>Rivet Kannon </b><br/>This fearsome tool-turned-weapon fires a thunderous hail of heated rivets. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/0e303f935d8c5c8569613e8ff6105caf47c9ce3f.png"/><br/><b>Stikkbomb </b><br/>Hurl a Stikkbomb ‚Äãto damage and disrupt enemy vehicles. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/d1486798446edb272631dbef4ef558bc29c0b991.png"/><br/><b>Burna Exhaust </b><br/>An explosion of flame‚Äã from the exhausts‚Äã lifts the Kustom Boosta-Blasta off the ground. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/4346af90da9a6945385d1ba4948228ea4512fdb0.png"/><br/><b>Dash </b><br/>The vehicle lunges violently forward and smashes enemies.

Never get too close to close ranged opponents, and never be too far away from long ranged opponents. As the Kustom Boosta-Blasta you are useful at many different ranges, use it to your advantage and be at the range your opponents are weak at. <br/><br/>Use your utility to keep opponents at the distance you want them at. Throw the grenade to throw them off their track or jump up to high ground where they can‚Äôt reach you. You decide where you want to fight. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/ec50a319871e11ed3ff2f181a3e6a940b3281d1f.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Team-Ups</div><b>The Snazzwagon</b> and Boosta-Blasta are a potent combo, with both vehicles having escape and/or disorientation abilities in Billowing Smoke and the Stikkbomb.

<div class="bb_h1">Heyo Everyone, </div><br/>Earlier this month, we released an Introduction to Itemization dev blog. After sharing the first looks of Itemization, we got a lot of messages from players. We collected over 13 pages of feedback, questions and concerns. As promised, we're following up on them.<br/><br/>While we cannot answer all of those questions yet, as some things are still being decided and iterated upon, we wanted to answer a batch of them today. We will continue to share more answers as we move closer to release! We want to hear more of your feedback and opinions through this dialogue.<br/><br/><i>Note: All of the questions we‚Äôre answering in this are pulled directly from the comments on the Forums, Reddit and Discord. We kept the players‚Äô wording instead of writing our own questions.</i><br/><br/>Before we dive in, we want to make it clear for those who might‚Äôve missed prior communications: WE ARE BREAKING THE LOCKS WITH THIS REWORK. üîì<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Questions From Players</div><div class="bb_h2">Blessings / Transferring Weapons to New Systems</div><b>Question</b><br/><i>When StrawHat said that players will begin with a headstart in the new system, does that mean that we won't have access to blessings we did previously and therefore forcing us to grind for the tiers all over again?</i><br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, the actual blessing sticker book will be translated to experience into Mastery. It does mean that you actually can even learn blessings you didn't before if wanted.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>What if I already have a perfect 550?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Already owned weapons won‚Äôt be touched, they‚Äôll remain intact.<br/>(Note: We are doing some blessing tweaks and balances with this update to accommodate for the new system, so some numbers might change.)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Soooo... my old weapons don't just disappear right? Guys, it took me 500+ hours to get all the stuff I want through your RNG casino, so that would be more than just a little bummer. Will already unlocked weapons be converted 100%?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, they won‚Äôt disappear and they will stay 100% intact as they are. You will keep the entire arsenal of weapons that you have acquired previously. <br/>(Note: We are doing some blessing tweaks and balances with this update to accommodate for the new system, so some numbers might change.)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Mastery and Expertise Systems</div><b>Question</b><br/>How does Mastery XP work? Do you get more for higher difficulty missions? What if you fail a run?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The amount of Mastery XP is based on what difficulty the player plays. The higher the difficulty, the higher amount of XP is awarded. Experience gained will remain the same, no matter the weapon you use the most during a mission.<br/><br/>If you fail a run, you will be awarded a portion of the XP just as with normal Experience and Ordo Docket rewards.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Mastery is not tied to a specific weapon in your inventory. It has its own progress per weapon family that includes all marks, that unlocks blessings and perks for that weapon family. Do I have that right?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. Playing with any weapon (different marks) within a weapon family will progress that entire weapon family‚Äôs Mastery. Note: There can be several weapon families within the same school of weapons, such as Lasguns and Autoguns. They each have multiple weapon families, containing a number of Marks (e.g. Infantry Autoguns and Braced Autoguns).<br/>TL;DR - If you play with a Lasgun Family A Mark X, you will progress your Mastery into Lasgun Family A. So every other weapon mark in Family A will benefit from the Mastery progression into Mark X.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>There's no farming blessings at all anymore. You just directly unlock the ones you want with the Mastery points. At full Mastery you'll have all blessings at all levels unlocked. (Yes or no?)<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. As you gain Mastery with a Weapon Family you unlock blessing points (among other things); these points can then be freely used to unlock any blessing of your choosing: the more blessings you unlock, the more powerful versions of blessings you are able to unlock. When you have reached full Mastery with a weapon family you will have unlocked all the blessings available for that family. Moreover, in the new system, you‚Äôll be able to freely swap out any blessings and perks on any weapon, at any level of Mastery, without them becoming locked after two changes.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>So every weapon we buy/earn has a random-ish stat cap, and our Mastery of that weapon‚Äôs family (so autoguns, shotguns, etc) lets us build that up via expertise?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. We are still working out the finer details of this system. But in essence, as you gain Mastery you will unlock more Expertise within that weapon family. You can then choose to invest into that weapon and increase the stats of the weapon while keeping the predetermined stat distribution the weapon was created with.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Miscellaneous Concerns</div><b>Question</b><br/>This system is the anti-choice system, it‚Äôs the system that forces you to grind every single weapon family before you can try a build.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The Mastery system is an addition to the existing crafting system that allows players to steadily unlock every Blessing for a weapon family, instead of relying exclusively on RNG to obtain them.<br/><br/>True, there will be some grind to fully unlock all the blessings at their most powerful tier for a weapon family. The system however lets you have full freedom in which blessings you unlock, and in what order, so being able to unlock a specific blessing for a build should be a manageable time investment. We are still experimenting with the exact time investment needed to fully unlock all blessings for a certain weapons family. We are also adding more tiers to most blessings, making previously higher tier blessings available at lower tiers.<br/><br/>Also, loot is still part of the system. The fact that we are still keeping the RNG loot system in place (Emperor's Gift, Sire Melk‚Äôs Requisitorium, The Armoury Exchange, and the ability to Consecrate weapons at Hadron‚Äôs Shrine with random upgrades, etc) will allow players to get to weapon builds that they have not unlocked in their Mastery before they actually get there. The loot system will be able to shortcut you to things that you have not yet unlocked.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>If the only way to upgrade a weapon is to use it, players won't want to try new weapons because of the marked drop in power they'll have to put up with for as long as it takes to grind out the upgrades.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Powerful weapons will still be distributed through stores/Emperor‚Äôs Gift. You can start with already high tier weapons to grind the Mastery, similar to what the game proposes at the moment. <br/><br/>Mastery will just open the toolbox to the player for them to experiment.<br/><br/>Mastery doesn't ‚Äúgate‚Äù a person from acquiring a weapon with a given blessing, it only gates you from freely being able to add it to any weapon of your choosing. The loot system can still allow players to shortcut to a more powerful blessing before they unlock it in the Mastery.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Is ‚Äòweapon potential‚Äô a new stat? Is it tied to the base power level? If it is a new unrelated stat does that mean a 371 power weapon with a low weapon potential rating has less possible power increase than a say 342 power weapon that has a high weapon potential rating? Please give us examples with actual numbers to compare.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Weapon Potential just refers to the stats distribution. For any weapon in the game, they actually have the potential to be maxed out. Every weapon now has the potential to reach a 380 stats rating. Note that maxing out does not mean reaching 80% on each stat: every weapon is created with a pool of stat points that have been distributed in the different stat buckets, and every weapon has the same potential maximum number of stats that can be distributed.<br/><br/><i><b>DISCLAIMER: The following images are NOT representative of the final UI / work for Itemization. They are meant to illustrate the different potential stat distributions of a maxed out weapon (the darker grey number).</b></i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/ce41257bbaa4de519ee4ffdc42d173e498e50c1a.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/4ddbdc90645dbbc4ea47b994ad5fcaffbcfb80a5.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Weapon Sharing</div><b>Question</b><br/>Sorry if this has been asked, but with this itemization rework, will characters that can use the same weapon archetypes have a shared inventory to those weapons? So no more fancy lasgun that only my Psyker can enjoy, now my Veteran and Zealot can too? This has been one of my biggest gripes.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, it will remain as it is today, where any item is unique to the character that has it.<br/><br/>However, we can say that we‚Äôre opening up more weapon families to be shared between all classes. It's still case by case, but for example, shotguns will be available for all classes.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Given that blessings are currently shared across characters, it‚Äôd be a massive step back if progress was silo‚Äôd.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The Mastery / blessings unlocked are shared by account. However, any applied Expertise is at an item level and character level. <br/><br/>Essentially, if you have the Infantry Lasgun weapon family at 100% unlocked on Character 1, when you go to Character 2 and find a new Infantry Lasgun, you‚Äôll have all the blessings unlocked on the new gun. But you‚Äôll need to spend the materials to apply any Expertise changes on Character 2.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/>Alright, that answers the first batch of questions. We will answer more! If anything in this post is unclear, please let us know below. This will help us collect more feedback and ensure we answer them in our future posts. <br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>]]></description>

<br/><b>Settle down yo‚Äãoz ‚Äãlot, an‚Äô get stuck in ta da details below!</b><br/><br/>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks will launch full speed into Early Access on the <b>6th of August 2024!</b> <br/> <br/>We can‚Äôt thank you enough for your relentless energy, feedback and support that has fueled the development of Speed Freeks. Our Open Beta was a thrill to watch unfold, and now we‚Äôre looking forward to sharing even more with you as we dash toward the game‚Äôs Early Access launch in the coming weeks.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c9b7c7e9cb981c9a982c8dfcde4d1298ff795965.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a4c7ffc59bc13f4a4bcde70f926f698df9868d67.png"/><br/><b>We‚Äôre often asked: will Speed Freeks be Free-to-Play?</b> <br/><br/><b>Yes!</b> Da mek boyz have confirmed that Speed Freeks will indeed be <b>Free to Play</b>, with plenty of snazzy loot to unlock for free. <br/><br/>For those who want to get extra snazzy, we have additional customization features that are entirely <b>optional</b> and most importantly, <b>not pay-to-win</b>.  We‚Äôll share more details about this as we near release but rest assured, there will be plenty of Orky loot for everybody.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a5c40f3c0b0d12335a889b1d95d453073f60237b.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a899f79a5c50c73ac3fa32916c823eb08d4f4dbe.png"/><br/>Speed Freeks‚Äô launch will mark its entry into Steam Early Access for a short period of time, allowing us to make some final adjustments ahead of the first full Speedwaagh, with a roadmap of content dropping later this year.  <br/> <br/>You can find answers to frequently asked Early Access questions below:<br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Why Early Access?</b></div>We've involved the Speed Freeks community in the game‚Äôs development since it began, releasing an open Alpha and open Beta along the way, plus have been testing the game extensively internally to make sure we‚Äôre on the right path ‚Äì taking into account all the valuable feedback that has come our way from those public tests. <br/><br/>Early Access expands the game's player base and extends this method of community-collaborated feedback in a bigger way. We‚Äôll use it to further refine and prioritize features, as well as our future roadmap. This is hugely helpful to our team in achieving its goal of releasing the most fun, balanced, stable and Orky version of Speed Freeks possible! <br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Approximately, how long will Speed Freeks be in Early Access? </b></div>We are aiming for an Early Access period of ‚Äãa ‚Äãfew months while we continue to refine our first proppa Speedwaaagh! Which will be released later this year. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version? </b></div>Whilst a variety of cool content and enhancements will be added during Early Access, the full release of the game will bring a much more honed gameplay experience along with its significant content drop. This will include a new map, new vehicle, new features and enhancements to the game, as well as tweaks and additions based on the feedback we received from you along the way!  <br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Will my progress carry over from Early Access into the games full release?</b></div>Yes, all rewards and unlocks earned during Early access will stay with your account when the game moves into launch and season one.<br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>What is the current state of the Early Access version? </b></div>We were very proud to read so many comments saying that the Speed Freeks Alpha and Beta Tests were more stable than a lot of fully released games! There are certainly bugs left to squash, but the game is in a good state. Logging on and partying up with your friends to krump some gitz, while unlocking rewards is a fun and stable experience.<br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Will Speed Freeks be priced differently during and after Early Access? </b></div>Speed Freeks will continue to be a Free To Play game.  <br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process? </b></div>We'll use surveys to ask questions directly and gather general feedback and suggestions with our public feedback board and bug tracker: https://speedfreeks40k.featureupvote.com/<br/><br/><br/>During the Alpha and Beta, you provided a ton of feedback which has directly influenced the direction of our development.  And as always, let us know in the comments below if you have anything to say about what we‚Äôre sharing with you today, too!   <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/1302d44b9ac8c676a459653879f1e6d845443095.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/f0468d2c6e34fa040bb1a0643136d23ab628e3d2.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Why do we have to sign up for an account?</b></div>Two things, mainly.  We'd like to gather telemetry to improve the game, plus contact the community via email through our newsletter. <b>Sharing telemetry data and signing up for the newsletter are both optional,</b> but we need the Speed Freeks account system to ask people if they want to opt in. <br/><br/>The <b>optional</b> telemetry is getting anonymous user data that helps us diagnose bugs and other issues, as well as gameplay info that will help us balance and improve the game overall.  Having this data also allows us to show you more detailed stats for things like vehicle ability usage, which will be shown in your Speed Freeks account. <br/><br/>The <b>optional</b> newsletter is valuable for pinging players about new stuff added to the game.  As a free to play live service title, it‚Äôs important to be able to inform active and inactive players about updates and new content.  For example, there were thousands of players that accessed the Alpha test last year that we couldn't directly invite back to the Beta because the Speed Freeks account wasn‚Äôt implemented at that time.  The newsletter can also send the more dedicated players guides, community content, stats overviews and other info that would interest them.  Again, this is optional. <br/><br/>We understand that some gamers are tired of making accounts, we get it.  But collecting anonymous user data allows us to improve the game, and the ability to get in touch with players directly impacts the number of users that will be playing it.  Free to play games have always survived with the assistance of user accounts, and we're asking you to make one so that it helps create a better, free experience that you guys can possibly enjoy for years. <br/><br/>The Speed Freeks account takes a few minutes to create, but we hope that you‚Äôll take that time to quickly sign up and try our game.  <br/><br/>Thanks for reading, and we look forward to joining you in the <b>W‚ÄãAAAGH!</b><br/><br/><b>You can read the Terms of Service and Use here: </b><br/>https://prismray.io/legal?agreementId=terms-of-services-and-use<br/><br/> <br/><b>Privacy Policy and Data Collection details are here:</b><br/>https://prismray.io/legal?agreementId=privacy-policy<br/><br/> <br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a1870939c66f347a73229de2a25a3a4130dfd720.png"/><br/>On behalf of Caged Element and PLAION, we‚Äôz shoutin‚Äô a big WAAAGH!

We‚Äôre interviewing different devs working on Darktide to share what it‚Äôs like to create the game. These dev blogs will include topics like level design and cinematics, voice acting and audio, and more (based on your suggestions)!<br/><br/>For today‚Äôs blog, we‚Äôre starting with level design and cinematics for Darktide. This is currently an introduction to these topics, because there is truly so much to talk about. If players are interested, we‚Äôd love to talk more about taking a mission to functional, adding in the art and audio cues, lighting and iteration, etc. Let us know!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Level Design </div><br/>While creating a level in Darktide always follows a well established production process - a production blueprint if you will - each new level brings its own set of challenges and creative opportunities. We think of ways to innovate and improve within the experience players have come to expect, for the sake of consistency. You may also have noticed we sometimes make changes to previously released levels after looking at how players interact with them. <br/><br/>Before we begin laying the foundation for a level, we take a step back and define the backstory and narrative for a mission. We ask questions like: What kind of location was it before current-day events? Is there a specific reason for Chaos forces to be there now? What is the Warbands‚Äô (or other parties..) interest in it? One typical question we always try to justify is: why couldn't Masozi simply fly us to the end of the level from the get-go? <br/>After answering these questions, we begin with a paper design of the mission, known as the Mission Design Document (MDD). The MDD becomes the blueprint for the mission, outlining how we envision it playing out. It includes detailed descriptions of every part of the mission, ensuring everyone on the team has a clear idea of the mission's flow.<br/><br/>The MDD details:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b> The Plot:</b> A short summary of the plot of the mission.<br/></li><li> <b>The Setting: </b>A detailed description of which part of the Hive the mission takes place and the different areas we intend the players to go through.<br/></li><li> <b>Game Mechanics:</b> The types of game mechanics we intend to use during the mission. Particularly how we envision the event in the mission to play and how we intend to challenge the players during the events.<br/></li><li> <b>Mission Areas:</b> Descriptions of different areas within the mission, which we call ‚Äúchunks.‚Äù </li></ul>We use the term ‚Äúchunks‚Äù to refer to different sections of a mission. Each chunk varies in gameplay to keep the experience fresh and engaging. A mission in Darktide is typically split into several chunks with distinct topologies that blend seamlessly together. <i>(Note: Comparing each chunk to a battlefield in the tabletop form of Warhammer 40,000 is not a stretch.)</i><br/><br/>When thinking of a chunk, envision a maze, street, or open plaza within a level. Designing in chunks allows us to offer variety, opportunities, and challenges tailored to different player archetypes.<br/>What makes a level fun depends on your playstyle, so we try to vary the gameplay spaces in a mission to give each playstyle its moment to shine and to provide interesting challenges. Since Darktide is primarily a co-op game, if you find yourself in a chunk that doesn't suit your playstyle, you‚Äôll ideally have a teammate with a build that's better suited for that environment.<br/><br/>Once we're happy with the MDD and everyone on the team has signed off on the ideas based on their expertise, we start building the mission in the editor. It takes a group effort to create a mission, involving not just level designers but also environment artists, level artists, sound designers, gameplay coders, lighting artists, writers, and more. This is where the fun really begins!<br/><br/><i>Note: Below you‚Äôll find some early design notes for different chunks within missions. As these are from initial planning, they may not represent the final versions of the levels you play today! But we thought they‚Äôd be interesting for players to see.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/56741654758033e6cfa796f3be8c36e9cf72b07a.png"/><br/><i>Chasm Logistratum - Chunk 2 </i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/f3cc8f92b19c911e5c528f7668fbc5e099fe983c.jpg"/><i>Chasm Logistratum - Chunk 3</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/db50b149040b59674200b3755c0987f56d8a401f.jpg"/><i>Chunk 1 - Relay Station TRS-150</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/3b16104b68a81f7bd05c07235614ab36b2490089.jpg"/><i>Chunk 4 - Relay Station TRS-150</i><br/><br/>When we start building a level in our engine, we use very simple geometry, a phase commonly known as gray box, white box, or blockout. This approach allows for quick design iteration until we're satisfied with the experience. Building the base of a level is similar to traditional painting or sculpting ‚Äì we begin with broad strokes and large shapes to get the scale right and do Warhammer 40,000 justice.<br/><br/>Once the blockout of the mission is in place and everything works as intended, we start playtesting. Initially, team members who are working on the mission test it. This helps us understand how the mission plays out and how the enemies behave. We often iterate a lot during this step, refining areas that don't play as intended. It's much easier and faster to make changes during the blockout phase than after adding the final art.<br/><br/>When we're happy with the basic layout, we add all the logic and smaller details to the mission. This includes pickup spawners, enemy spawners, and climb edges for enemy traversal. We also set up the logic for player characters, such as hang ledges, respawn locations, and health stations. Covers are added for both players and enemies to create engaging combat spaces. At this point, the mission should be fully playable from start to finish with all the necessary elements in place. We then playtest it with a larger group from the team, gather feedback, and iterate as much as possible.<br/><br/>The events in missions typically require the most time and iteration to perfect. These segments are complex because they must deliver both engaging combat encounters and clear narrative progression. Ensuring that players grasp the storyline amid intense combat is a significant challenge that demands the collective expertise of the entire team.<br/><br/>Moreover, these events are particularly challenging to block out successfully. They heavily rely on integrating various mission elements‚Äîsuch as art, lighting, effects, and voiceover‚Äîto effectively convey the unfolding narrative.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/efe55ca8982e204875f5165e6273180710cc902a.jpg"/><i>Chasm Logistratum Blockout</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/16bd56bcd1ec8453d6fa9dfd0e556c7b9b31c76f.jpg"/><i>Chasm Logistratum Final </i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/62dc586398779eecdc94a35767c79fea435758a8.jpg"/><i>Relay Station TRS-150 Blockout</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/432cc3e6873e4ffc2975f6afe8c923902d5207c1.jpg"/><i>Relay Station TRS-150 Final</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/de6e02a3a7963482f8c2db520cacee5b273579cc.jpg"/><i>Excise Vault Spireside-13 Blockout</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/f1faab35d995c414ddb287275369979374c41f44.jpg"/><i>Excise Vault Spireside-13 Final</i><br/><br/>We take the events as far as we can during block out and pray to the game developer gods that it will all work out in the end, worst case we will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with some other solution, and sometimes this might force us into rethinking the narrative of the mission completely which is something we try to avoid as much as possible but it did happen a few times during the development of Darktide.<br/><br/>This is the end of Part 1 to Level Design for Darktide. We‚Äôd like to discuss it in more detail in another 101 dev blog! Let us know if you‚Äôre interested.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Cinematics</div><br/>Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Tim. I worked with cinematics during the development of Darktide. I‚Äôm here to write a small rundown of how we make cinematics in Darktide!<br/>Of course, every cutscene starts with a bunch of planning, but I‚Äôll skip that part for the sake of brevity.<br/><br/>After planning, the first step we do in-engine is prototyping; we make a really ugly prototype to test out how things flow and if the script fits our planned shots. Once we have a prototype we feel okay with, we iterate on it. We add VFX, animations, character art, finetune the cameras and add audio (though not necessarily in that order).<br/><br/>Here‚Äôs an early prototype we made for the first cutscene in the Prologue (it‚Äôs very WIP to show you what the first iteration looks like for cinematics):<br/><br/>https://youtu.be/TOQM-bxNE_c <br/><br/>Since Darktide was still in the middle of being developed when creating this prototype, some things were gradually added as they were finished for other parts of the game. For example, we didn‚Äôt have the unit for the Poxburster until a bit further into production, so we used a WIP Poxwalker as a stand-in for this first prototype.<br/><br/>We use a visual programming system, called Flow, for most of the VFX and audio triggers. Essentially, we set up a sequence of animations and position keys, with some pretty simple scripting to trigger VFX and audio throughout a cutscene.<br/><br/>Here‚Äôs a quick example of what a part of the first cutscene in the prologue looks like within our editor (see the screenshot) as well as outside the editor (see the video). (Note: This prototype is without the VFX we added later).<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/aa01d2408f594f654caa9fb7f050d222e1f32e01.png"/><i>First Cutscene in Prologue in our Flow Editor</i><br/><br/>https://youtu.be/CCuCTf6p4CY <br/><br/>This is the end of Part 1 to Cinematics for Darktide. We‚Äôd like to discuss more details about the planning that goes into cinematics, and / or to share more examples.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/aa01d2408f594f654caa9fb7f050d222e1f32e01.png"/><br/><br/>OK! That‚Äôs the end of our first Darktide 101 dev blog. Let us know what you think and if you‚Äôd like to see more behind the scenes stuff like this. We‚Äôd be happy to share other similar topics with everyone. If you have any further questions for the teams working on level design and cinematics regarding what it‚Äôs like to develop, let us know in the comments.<br/><br/>Until next time!<br/>]]></description>

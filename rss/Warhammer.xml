This hotfix polishes up the Hive Scum class a bit, fixes various game issues &amp; crashes, and also increases the character slots for all players from 8 to <b>9</b>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">In the meantime, you can read the notes below. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1">Hive Scum</div><div class="bb_h2">Talent Tree Layout</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Dev note:</b> <i>“Hi everyone. This update sees a handful of changes to the layout of the Hive Scum Talent Tree. Mainly, we are addressing the sharp difficulty curve of early game Hive Scum by moving a few stronger talents from the later sections of the tree further up. What’s important to note is that outside of fixes and touch-ups, there are no direct balance changes to individual talents as of yet, so the overall power level of Hive Scum is the same. Even so, please consider this a light first stab at the overall Hive Scum feel, and know that we are keeping a watchful eye. Oh, and your talents will not be reset (but your talents might have moved around in the new layout!). Talk to you soon. - Teodor, class designer.”</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Sticky Hands’ has been replaced with ‘Quick and Deadly’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Quick and Deadly’ has been replaced with ‘Unload’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Unload’ has been replaced with ‘Moving Target’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Moving Target’ has been replaced with ‘Burst of Energy’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Burst of Energy’ has been replaced with ‘Cheap Shots’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Cheap Shots’ has been replaced with ‘Jittery’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Jittery’ has been replaced with ‘Tis But a Scratch’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Tis But a Scratch’ has been replaced with ‘Like the Wind’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Like the Wind’ has been replaced with ‘Untouchable’.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">‘Untouchable’ has been replaced with ‘Sticky Hands’.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Talent Fixes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Enemies killed by Chem Toxin from a direct Needle Pistol hit will now consistently trigger ‘Desperado’ and count for ‘Blinder/Blackout’ regeneration.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">The talents ‘Blessed Stimms’ and ‘Chemical Dependency’ will now be triggered when entering the proximity of a Stimm Supply loaded with a Stimm (once for each Stimm Supply deployment).</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed situations where Stimm Supply would fail to be placed due to not finding a valid position, resulting in it getting stuck in the player’s hands.

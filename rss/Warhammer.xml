A new trinket, a limited-time bundle, and a meeting across the 41st millennium. Starting April 30, we're celebrating the grimdark collision of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader! Fatshark and Owlcat Games are teaming up to bring a crossover event that nods to both games, and invites you deeper into the far corners of the 41st millennium.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">The Koronus Charm ‚Äì Prestige of House Von Valancius</div>Adorn your gear with this relic of a noble lineage and show your allegiance aboard the Mourningstar.<br/><br/><br/>This ornately-wrought charm is thought to have once belonged to a prominent member of the storied Rogue Trader dynasty House Von Valancius. Though knowledge of its function has long been lost to posterity, whirring mechanisms can be heard inside if you listen closely. Players will simply have to log into Warhammer 40,000: Darktide from April 30, to claim their reward. <br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">The Sapper Shovel: A Symbol of Survival</div>Once wielded by the desperate Rejects of Atoma Prime in their fight against heresy, the Sapper Shovel now finds its way into the hands of a mighty Rogue Trader. Heavy, brutal, and unrelenting, this weapon is more than just a tool, it‚Äôs a testament to defiance in the face of annihilation. Players can claim this fearsome tool in the Upperway location in Act I. Those who progressed further in the game will be able to claim the item from their chest.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Limited-Time: The Void and Hive Crossover Bundle</div>For a limited time, you can grab both Darktide and Rogue Trader in a single bundle. Whether you're leading a rogue trader dynasty among the stars or carving through heretics in the hive, this is your chance to experience the Imperium from two very different fronts.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/53107]]></description>

      <title>April Community Update</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500571481680380468</link>

<div class="bb_h2">Hello Space Marines!</div><br/>You‚Äôre in for a new Community Update, where we‚Äôll discuss what happened throughout April and what‚Äôs coming for the next months! Let‚Äôs begin.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">RECAP OF THE MONTH</div><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">THE TRYGON UPDATE üêç</div></u><br/>In April, we released the 7.0 ‚ÄúTrygon‚Äù Update. It contained both free and DLC content, including:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> A new PvE Map called Exfiltration and a new boss fight against the Trygon<br/></li><li> Two cosmetics DLCs: The Imperial Fists Champion Pack and the Space Wolves Chapter Pack<br/></li><li> The inferno Pistol, for both PvE and PvP (available for Assault, Vanguard, Sniper and Heavy)<br/></li><li> Private Lobbies in PvP<br/></li><li> Expanded Weapon Arsenal for all 6 classes<br/></li><li> New elements of customisation, including: Volupus Pink, Thousand Sons Blue, cloth colouring for Bulwark, hand customisation.<br/></li><li> Weapons perks and Prestige Perks were updated<br/></li><li> Several buffs, and bug fixes</li></ul>Read the details of the patch notes here!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Watch the trailer if you missed it üòâüëá</div><br/>
<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oAHVCnAXxY?fs=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" width="850"></iframe>
<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the 7.0 Update brought a bunch of unexpected bugs: for instance, matchmaking became a big issue. Saber Interactive deployed the 7.1 hotfix first to improve matchmaking stability. <br/><br/>Today, we pushed the 7.2 hotfix. It should bring a solution to most connectivity issues, specifically infinite ‚ÄúJoining Server‚Äù loops and black screens after completing an Operation.<br/><br/>We‚Äôre truly sorry for the inconvenience, we know how much of a bother it‚Äôs been for the past weeks.<br/><br/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">‚ÄúSEISMIC ACTIVITY‚Äù COMMUNITY EVENT</div></u><br/>Your mission has just ended. Were you successful?<br/><br/>This time your brief was to collectively bring down 200,000 Trygons between April 17 and 27.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/e785444e0b43efd977b239ec3397a01a19878e95.png"/><br/>The least we can say is: you CRUSHED it, Space Marines! It has been tallied that over 800,000 Trygons were obliterated over the course of these ten days.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/8668e574b45f477b1f283220facad92da71a07c7.png"/><br/><br/>Your faith holds firm, and the enemy lies in ruin. <br/><br/>As promised, your reward is the<b> Mark X Tacticus Breastplate</b>. Since, the question was raised: yes, you can change the colour of the skulls. <br/><br/>But that‚Äôs not all, to reward your commitment in this event, the ‚Äã<b>Porphyr Shield Chainsword skin</b> will be available to claim through PROS. The code will be shared to you on May 5th and until the release of the 8.0 Update. So, stay tuned!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/d6cc06d71d8d8af11d31de6852581846ce59040b.png"/><br/><br/>The Emperor provides.<br/><br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">WHAT WE‚ÄôRE WORKING ON</div><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">CODENAME: HORDE MODE</div></u><br/>With the Trygon update released, our focus has now shifted to Patch 8, and it is getting closer each day! ü§´<br/><br/>Today we would like to tease you a bit more about what it is going to be like. First of all, you will be able to play up to three players (or with 2 bots, just like in regular PvE) and you will get to fight waves of both Tyranids and Chaos. Difficulty will increase for each wave defeated, so you‚Äôll have to prepare yourself accordingly to vaporize as many waves as you can. Also, your class and weapon levels will be based on your PvE levels.<br/><br/><br/>Oh and here‚Äôs a sneak peek of the map! üëÄAs you can see, the action takes place in Kadaku.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/39ab253e1770992a8f6bfe33a4a793a907474ca8.png"/><br/>The ‚ÄúHorde Mode‚Äù release date and its actual in-game name will be announced at <i>[redactedüíÄüíÄ]</i>‚Ä¶ <br/><br/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">THE NEXT UPDATE</div></u><br/>You will have access to the PTS again to test the 8.0 update before the release. Stay tuned, we will give you more information later.<br/><br/>The 8.0 update will bring more free and DLC content to the game. We cannot unveil everything yet, but here‚Äôs a few things you can expect from it:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Blood Angels Cosmetic Pack<br/></li><li> White Scars Champion Pack<br/></li><li> Horde Mode<br/></li><li> Rebalancing of the Absolute difficulty following the community polls</li></ul>Last month, we did a community poll on Focus Together to collect your feedback and see what you were interested to see on the Absolute difficulty to differentiate it more from Lethal. You will see the changes we made as part of the 8.0 update. Expect an even tougher challenge!<br/><br/>And more, stay tuned ü§´<br/><br/>The release date will also be confirmed during the <i>[redactedüíÄüíÄ]</i><br/><br/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">FOCUS TOGETHER</div></u><br/>Since the release of Space Marine 2, you were encouraged to share your thoughts on the game and even suggest ideas on Focus Together. To this day, we‚Äôve implemented more than 40 ideas from the community, into the game. We always keep an eye on them.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/f8cb15eecd98ee97151f2335fde8cf5eebba2456.png"/><br/>Recently, we‚Äôve added the Trygon, the hand customisation, and released the Inferno Pistol.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/0c8ababb11377babf451bd8641abd5dd05a7d22e.png"/><br/><br/>We also added color customisation to the Bulwark.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/5d3a700fdbf3bb0416a87a2b1df262bd14fce5cc.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/c33da9c41e16b3b02e3bf0571ee317837dede092.png"/><br/><br/>We‚Äôve implemented a Bestiary with lore entries through the Datavault Update and weapons class restrictions have been lifted though the Trygon Update!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/60a07d9a8fcec5ed82c4ae30e63d0d96d3361211.png"/><br/><br/>The lenses colour customisation was made available with the Obelisk update, months ago.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/9873e218eaa1d9d3368181994aa523d042cd5292.png"/><br/><br/>Private PvP lobbies were implemented as well. And many others! üòä<br/><br/><br/>If your idea has received a lot of upvotes but still hasn‚Äôt gotten a response from the devs, it‚Äôs likely because it‚Äôs still too early for them to give a clear answer. They might be focused on other priorities for now, or they haven‚Äôt made a final decision on the matter yet.<br/><br/>We truly appreciate your enthusiasm and patience and we hope you understand that such things take time on our side. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π<br/><br/>Also, please remember to check if the idea you‚Äôre about to drop hasn‚Äôt already been entered by another user. Avoiding duplicates makes the job much easier on our side.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">THAT‚ÄôS IT FOR THIS MONTH</div><br/>As usual, let‚Äôs keep in touch on Discord and Focus Together. You can also follow us on our socials: Instagram, X, Facebook, Threads and Bluesky.<br/><br/>See you on the battlefield, Space Marines. <br/><br/><i>The Focus and Saber Teams. ü¶æ</i><br/><br/>]]></description>

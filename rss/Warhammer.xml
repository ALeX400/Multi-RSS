We have been investigating the disconnect issues that players have been facing and we believe that we have a solution to keep players from being kicked from the game. <br/><br/>Over the next hour, we will be terminating in-progress matches to roll out updated servers. You may be dropped back to the main menu while this fix rolls out. If this happens please restart the game and re-queue. <br/><br/>We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and thank you for your continued patience and support.]]></description>

OI YOU'Z GITZ!<br/><br/>We've fixed a couple critical issues that plagued the release of the game:<br/><br/>- <b>Paid items</b> on the store were <b>disappearing </b>into smokey air, but this has now been fixed.  Rest assured that any items you've purchased are still yours and will show up with no problems now<br/><br/>- <b>Teef packages</b> are now properly represented on Steam, so feel free to grab some Teef if ya like<br/><br/>- <b>Localization of languages</b> has been disabled for now since it's not quite ready for use yet (will be in an update)<br/><br/>Thanks for your patience on this, and if you still experience issues with Teef or paid items (or anything else) please let us know here or the Steam discussions, or the Discord<br/><br/>Happy krumpin!]]></description>

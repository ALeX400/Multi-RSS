      <title>Return of the Unrelenting Hordes - Special Event</title>

The fan-favorite Unrelenting Hordes Special event returns to Warhammer 40,000: Darktide! A platoon of Moebian 21st soldiers has been infected by the Blight. Their armour will make them harder to deal with than the usual hordes you encounter.<br/><br/>We thought we'd stopped this mess after that trouble at the cathedral. Well, you know what to do.<br/><br/>Play missions with a set of Special Conditions, ‚ÄúInfected Moebian 21st‚Äù, and as a team collect Grimoires or Scriptures to earn rewards. This condition will only be available during the event and will appear on both the Standard and Auric mission terminals. Similar to past events, the progress will be shared across all members of the strike team.<br/><br/>This event will start on Thursday, February 20, 2025. The rewards will be Ordo Dockets, Plasteel and Diamantine.]]></description>

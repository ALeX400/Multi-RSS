Just dropped a small patch before the weekend. Please be sure to restart Steam to make sure you've got it!<br/><br/><b>NOTE</b>: You may see less games in the game browser until more people download the update, as there will still be some people playing in the previous build.  Those games won't show up in the latest build and vise versa<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e0db447dc486730af2bd5402e608ced9bea38b7e.png"/><br/><br/>Here's whats up:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>improved skill calculation (and thus team balancing)<br/></li><li>Players can now switch to the losing team at any point in the match as long as the losing team has equal players or less<br/></li><li>Prevention of players to be able to join games that are in their ending phase to avoid issues.  Games in ending phase now show up greyed out in the game browser,<br/></li><li>Game browser now dynamically updates,<br/></li><li>Prevented votekick being able to kick host<br/></li><li>Crash bug fix relating to player challenges<br/></li><li>Longer challenges now show HUD popups more frequently (every 10% instead of 25%),<br/></li><li> Rukkatrukk Blood Axes kit gets hidden since its not supposed to be unlockable until later<br/></li><li>Fix for Trukk skulls kit texture issue,<br/></li><li>Fix for PLAY GAME screen explainer not accepting keyboard/gamepad inputs (Steam Deck suffered from this),<br/></li><li>Da Gorge map has expanded boundaries now, lighter nighttime version<br/></li><li>networking clean-up, more solidity,<br/></li><li> Progression data storage improvements,</li></ul>Major things up next:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Host "migration" so that if a host leaves or gets disconnected for any reason, the lobby of players is not disbanded, but instead is put in a game together with the same settings with a new host<br/></li><li>Hit reg improvements<br/></li><li>Warbands system (clans/clubs).  This was meant to go into the launch version but just had some UI still left to do on it</li></ul>Happy krumpin!<br/>Some of us devs should be playing over the weekend a bit so looking forward to SMASHIN' SUM GITS togetherÀêsteamthumbsupÀê<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e0db447dc486730af2bd5402e608ced9bea38b7e.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/880573fa3ef539bb061dfaa37ec62a776389e521.gif"/>]]></description>

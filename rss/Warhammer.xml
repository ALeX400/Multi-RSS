First and foremost, Darktide is a co-op game. It‚Äôs meant to be played with others. But right now, a player is a bit limited in forming a team. A player can either use the Mourningstar, or their friend list to form a party before starting a mission. It is too random.<br/><br/>We‚Äôve noticed players using third party places to find parties, such as Discord, Reddit, the Fatshark Forums. This increased even more from the Path of Redemption update because players wanted to group together to work on penances, etc.<br/><br/>Our goal was to provide a place for players to find other like-minded players within the game. For whatever content they wanted! Maybe it‚Äôs hardcore grinding, casually trying Auric (without worrying about being flamed), etc.<br/><br/>Further, we wanted to improve the overall social aspect of Darktide in general.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/bed04ea10cdab1b7a87150b0e481da674d3ab0ce.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What Features Will Come With the Party Finder?</div>This will be an evolving feature. Right now, players will be able to find like-minded players based on four criterias: Game Mode, Difficulty, Language and assorted Tags to define what the group is about.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Game Mode<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Adventure<br/></li><li> Maelstrom<br/></li><li> Special Assignments</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Difficulty<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Sedition<br/></li><li> Uprising<br/></li><li> Malice<br/></li><li> Heresy<br/></li><li> Damnation<br/></li><li> Auric - Hersey<br/></li><li> Auric - Damnation</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Language<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> English<br/></li><li> French<br/></li><li> German<br/></li><li> Spanish<br/></li><li> Italian<br/></li><li> Portuguese<br/></li><li> Polish<br/></li><li> Russian<br/></li><li> Cantonese<br/></li><li> Mandarin<br/></li><li> Japanese<br/></li><li> Korean</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Assorted Tags<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> All Welcome<br/></li><li> Quickplay<br/></li><li> Casual<br/></li><li> Hardcore<br/></li><li> Contract(s)<br/></li><li> Penances<br/></li><li> Power Leveling<br/></li><li> Grinding</li></ul></li></ul><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a28f63ef548e3610c6a97268f1848ba6033916b8.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/7d3c30c7415e92fb4bbfe6a23fd5562e3e84b87a.jpg"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/cdc71c56a5256957614ac5ad471f966303248851.jpg"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Building the Party Finder Together With Players</div>Earlier, we mentioned this would be an evolving feature. When we were planning this feature, we came up with a lot more tags and ways to form a party. However, we are working towards building Darktide together with players and inviting them into the conversation. We could‚Äôve added 200+ tags, but we didn‚Äôt want to add clutter which players might not engage with in the first place.<br/><br/>Instead, we want to optimize this feature together with players. We wanted to start with this solid base and invite everyone to tell us how we can make this feature work better for their gameplay style.<br/><br/>As players try out this feature from Sept. 26, let us know what tags you‚Äôd like us to include. Would you like a tag for only certain classes? (We saw someone ask if you can do an Ogryn-only team. This is something we could implement on a tag side.)<br/><br/>We‚Äôll be looking out for and we‚Äôll be collecting feedback on this topic from launch. Feel free to tag me (StrawHat) or create some threads to consolidate the feedback so it can be passed on to the team! (To set expectations, it‚Äôs likely that not every suggestion will make it into the Group Finder but we‚Äôll do our best to include the most requested features.)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/>OK, that‚Äôs it for now! Hopefully everyone understands our goals for this feature and how we‚Äôd like to build it up together with feedback from the community. This way we can continue to make Darktide the best it can be for players.<br/><br/>Until next time!<br/><br/>‚Äì The Darktide Team]]></description>

      <title>Introducing "Rolling Steel" - Dev Blog</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361210/view/4656248375959823389</link>

<img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/ce2a39a98fd7783c3294f5ffe3fecee04da0ad13.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Hello, Everyone!</div><br/>We heard you wanted some trains‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs time to unveil the newest mission coming to our Unlocked &amp; Loaded update this month: Rolling Steel. For this dev blog, we interviewed a Level Designer and Level Artist from our team who were in charge of bringing the vision to life: Jacopo and Roberto.<br/><br/>Our goal of this blog is to tell you about the new mission and how it formed, etc. without spoiling all the fun of playing it the first time for yourselves. We‚Äôll have to leave some things out, because we want players to still be surprised when they load into the mission for the first time. <br/><br/>Let‚Äôs get rolling. üöÇ (I‚Äôm a comical genius -Straw)<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Where Did the Idea for This Mission Start?</div><br/>The idea for ‚ÄúRolling Steel‚Äù began about a year and a half ago, following the release of Ascension Riser 31. In that mission, we experimented with creating a more dynamic end event where players fight atop an ascending platform in a massive vertical shaft. After completing that challenge, we wanted to create something with even more movement. A mission to explore more visually dynamic and immersive events. <br/><br/>Our devs continued working on this with the latest mission, Clandestium Gloriana, where players are in the lateral elevator.<br/><br/>A key moment that influenced this concept was a scene from the ‚ÄúRejects Will Rise‚Äù trailer, where a train crashes and explodes into a station. This powerful visual helped solidify the narrative and set the pace for the objectives in the mission. <br/><br/>It was intimidating to start. While we had worked on similar movements with Ascension Riser 31, we knew this would require a tech investment to create the movement we wanted players to feel. We didn‚Äôt want the background to be a constant loop of the same elements.  At first, the endeavour was put on hold. However, we saw the community's interest in a mission involving a train. This reignited our enthusiasm for the idea and it led us to resume development.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/5c624624ee53490adfd468e7dd75346ef863d1c0.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What Will Players Be Doing in Rolling Steel?</div>In Rolling Steel, players are thrust into a high-stakes scenario where they must stop a moving train hijacked by cultists who have repurposed it with tox bombs onboard to spread the Nurgle plague. The mission immediately begins with high-octane adrenaline as players are dropped directly onto the speeding train. From the beginning, players are immersed in the action. <br/><br/>The primary objective is to prevent the train from crashing into its destination and releasing tox gas. To do this, the players must work their way through a series of train cars. Each car presents unique challenges and escalating threats. Cultists will relentlessly defend the train, and the players will need to stick together and push forward quickly.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What are the New Objective Types?</div>Yes, we said quickly. One of the most significant additions to this mission is the timer as an overarching objective. We wanted to introduce this mechanic to create a stronger sense of tension and urgency throughout the mission.<br/><br/>The timer in "Rolling Steel" is intended to force players to move very quickly, adding a layer of pressure that should elevate the intensity of the gameplay. Our goal was to offer a new harder challenge that requires players to work more closely together to succeed. It is not like the classic missions where there is a mid-event and an end-event. Rather, it‚Äôs one full event from beginning to end. <br/><br/>We wanted to see what happens when you break the rules, or at least suspend them.<br/><br/>Additionally, we're experimenting with a potential new auspex minigame that also plays a part in the importance of teamwork and communication in the mission. (We‚Äôll leave this for you to learn more about through playing.)<br/><br/>Additionally, Rolling Steel is part of our effort to experiment with a different mission format, which we call Operations. It is a shorter mission than we‚Äôve created historically. By introducing shorter, more cinematic experiences, we hope to offer a fresh alternative to the normal types of missions in Darktide. Something else to sink your teeth into when you have the urge to slay heretics, but you‚Äôre more limited on time.<br/><br/>As this mission is somewhat of a test, we‚Äôre eager to hear feedback from our community. Your input will be invaluable in determining how we evolve these new types of missions in the future. (Thank you ahead of time!)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/bfd4ff8e3e88099c4d4033c2fbd8faf640f9945e.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Any Learnings From Past Missions?</div>Absolutely, we‚Äôve learned a great deal from designing past levels, but with "Rolling Steel," we also wanted to challenge ourselves and try new things.<br/><br/>One of the most significant changes is the level topology. Unlike our previous missions, which often feature wider environments, "Rolling Steel" has a highly linear layout, which naturally funnels players into more close-quarters combat scenarios. This shift strongly affected how we design encounters and balance the overall experience, especially considering the added pressure of a time constraint and how all these elements impact our combat director.<br/><br/>In many ways, "Rolling Steel" is informed by our past experiences, but it also represents a step towards new possibilities and gauge how these innovations resonate with our players.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Inspiration for the Environments</div>As mentioned, the Rejects Will Rise trailer was one of the inspirations. This Nurgle train is based on an industrial cargo train which creates more room for slaying. Then a heavy coating of 40k grimdark, as always! (That‚Äôs the best part). The art team did a tremendous job providing a variety of assets for us to include throughout the mission, and we look forward to players trying it out.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Music</div>When we told Jesper about the new type of mission and the timer, he was really excited. He said he immediately had some ideas in his head of what he could create for players to add to the rising tension. He delivered a certified banger, as always. It is a blend between a standard and a high intensity track, so when the heat ramps up, players will definitely feel it. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Future Missions</div>We are expecting players to ask if we‚Äôll have more missions on a train. The answer is‚Ä¶we‚Äôll see! üòâ Let us know what you‚Äôre feeling. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><br/>We can‚Äôt wait for players to start running this mission and trying out the new objective. Let us know how it feels and we‚Äôll be reading the feedback! <br/><br/>Until next time. May the Emperor protect!<br/>]]></description>

It is bristling with weapons and built for high-speed, destructive assaults.<br/><br/>A very fast and versatile vehicle, where only the skies are the limit of your game-play possibilities.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/7ba2bfcef2a4cf5006562ce4a44848f55bda9e6b.gif"/><br/><br/>In Speed Freeks, the Megatrakk Scrapjet is at its best when utilizing its speed to be where your team needs you to be. Having an ability which increases your speed helps you stay at high speeds. <br/>You are the hunter/seeker!<br/><br/>Keep your target in front of you and use your front mounted shootas and homing rokkits to grind them down. Then, finish them off with one well aimed Rokkit Kannon shot.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Abilities</div><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/ad185bcd4da91a001cb2f844d8422e944bec8e1e.png"/><br/><b>Shootas and Missiles -</b> Dakka spits from the front and rear of the vehicle depending on where you‚Äôre aiming. Missiles track the enemy you‚Äôre aiming at.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/286a26c1cdc69232478abea90a89109edc882f96.png"/><br/><b>Rokkit Kannon - </b> Fire a large Rokkit that deals high damage. Use it to finish off foes and its massive recoil to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/5d01fb1502925d79eb9ee6e6826f570a73c26971.png"/><br/><b>Nose Drill -</b> Spin up the drill and charge! Ram straight through enemies in your path.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/10f81d44f5ff8313ee330da0d2389ace04f7e7fa.png"/><br/><b>Dash -</b> The vehicle lunges violently forward and smashes enemies. The direction you are aiming will determine where the vehicle will go.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/2396d4899d5423a188fb0ef8defe5bc3228147c3.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>Your highest priority as the Scrapjet is figuring out what your team needs from you. Do they need an extra bomb carrier? Or someone to chase down that pesky Deffkilla Wartrike who‚Äôs been giving your Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy trouble. With the drill, you have an extra ability to keep the momentum that you‚Äôve gained from dashing. To become a speed demon with the Megatrakk Scrapjet, use the dash to accelerate up to high speeds or change directions, then use some of your boost, so that you don‚Äôt waste momentum, followed by using your drill. Alternate between Dashing, Boosting and using the drill.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/176e82cb2bb7c58632db9e6dac371af80302e87b.gif"/><br/><br/>The Rokkit Kannon has a strong knockback effect on your vehicle. If you want to take your skill to the next level practice spinning your car in the air and shooting the Rokkit Kannon downwards/backwards to give yourself a boost and fly further.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Team-ups</div><b>Shokkjump Dragsta ‚Äì</b> When playing Kill Konvoy, work together with a Shokkjump Dragsta to deliver the bomb. Together, you can become an unstoppable force as you use your sheer amount of speed to approach the enemy Stompa.<br/><br/><b>Looted Wagon ‚Äì</b> Working with a Looted Wagon, you can become a deadly combo by watching for when the Looted Wagon cripples someone with their Grot Bomm. You can then quickly swoop in and finish them off with your Rokkit Kannon.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/0541ac8355379153a2cdc7548f4f2b13cdc7858a.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Good Against</div><b>Deffkilla Wartrike ‚Äì</b> Because you can maintain your speed for longer and have more tools to accelerate with, the Deffkilla Wartrike will struggle to catch you. Get behind them and they won‚Äôt be able to escape once you‚Äôve gotten your eye on them. The homing missiles will make sure you hit your target as you run them down.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Weak Against</div><b>Kustom Boosta Blasta ‚Äì </b>Kustom Boosta Blasta doesn‚Äôt care about how fast you‚Äôre going and with their mid-long range gun they can shoot you while you‚Äôre flying through the sky. A good Kustom Boosta Blasta will stop your momentum with its grenade.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/cea39c73b401847e4769131ef9bcf104856771f6.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>On behalf of Caged Element and PLAION, we‚Äôz shoutin‚Äô a big WAAAGH!

With this release, the available rollback builds will be set to 0, and today‚Äôs build will go on to serve as the oldest rollback version as we release new updates to the game over the coming months.<br/><br/>We apologise to all our players who currently make regular use of our rollback releases, we know how beneficial this feature has become for many of you, and the responsibility for that falls entirely on us.<br/><br/>As mentioned during the launch of version 5.2, we aim to maintain one rollback build for each category: update, patch, hotfix, and release, for a total of 4 rollback builds. This supports players running heavily modified campaigns, helping to minimize delays while their mods are updated. Each subsequent build following today‚Äôs 5.2.6 Hotfix will remain available as a rollback option until we have one build in each category - 4 in total - at which point the oldest will be replaced by a newer one.</blockquote> <br/>As always, thank you all for your feedback and bug reports. If you experience any new bugs or issues after updating to 5.2.6 please be sure to report them over in our dedicated sub-forum.<br/><br/>See you on the battlefield!<br/><br/>‚ÄîThe <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><hr/><hr/><div class="bb_h1">‚ö† IMPORTANT</div><hr/><hr/><br/>If you experience any issues after downloading the update, please take a moment to <b>Verify the integrity of the game files</b> first to ensure there were no issues when downloading.

It is likely due to logging in after the above maintenance had started. We‚Äôll let players know when they can log in and check their Mastery progression.<br/><br/><b>Second</b>, some players are experiencing crashes. If players are running the game with FSR 3.1 Frame Generation enabled, and they are tabbing between the exclusive full screen and windows, they may crash. Further, if players run FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, but without any upscaling enabled (such as FSR 3.1, DLSS or XESS), they will crash upon entering the Mourningstar. <br/><br/>The current workaround is to:<br/><ol><li> Use borderless fullscreen;<br/></li><li> If they‚Äôre running the game with FSR 3.1 Frame Generation: Enable one of the Upscaling alternatives (FSR 3.1, DLSS or XESS).</li></ol>Alternatively:<br/><ol><li> Disable FSR 3.1 Frame Generation</li></ol>^ <i>We are working on a fix for this to be included in a hot fix. </i><br/>Thank you for your patience today as we work to get everyone up and running again soon. <br/>]]></description>

<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qqhc3mK06r0?fs=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" width="850"></iframe>
<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">I. What are we doing?</div><br/>We’re making Immortal Empires, as well as The Lost God prologue campaign, available for all owners of Total War: WARHAMMER I and II. If you own either of those games, Total War: WARHAMMER III will automatically be added to your library, with Immortal Empires and The Lost God campaign unlocked. If you already own WARHAMMER III, nothing will change for you.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">II. Why are we doing it?</div><br/>As we celebrate 25 incredible years of Total War - and look ahead to WARHAMMER’s 10th anniversary in 2026 - we wanted to do something special. Your passion and support for this trilogy have made Immortal Empires possible, and we couldn’t be more grateful. Now feels like the perfect moment to open its gates and invite everyone to experience a piece of the adventure.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">III. When are we doing it?</div><br/>On December the 4th at 1600 GMT.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">IV. How will it work?</div><br/>WARHAMMER I and II owners will have ‘Total War: WARHAMMER III’ automatically added to their libraries. Through this you will be able to access both The Lost God prologue campaign and Immortal Empires. Please note; even if you don’t own the full WARHAMMER III experience you can also purchase any of its associated DLCs to play in Immortal Empires.<br/><br/>There’s a lot more questions you’ll have about how this works and what’s changing. For further details please see our FAQ below. If your question isn’t explicitly answered there please head over to our Discord where the community team will be on hand to help.<br/><br/>See you on the battlefield!<br/><br/>– The Total War Team<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">FAQ</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">1. When is Immortal Empires unlocking?</div><br/>December the 4th.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">2. Is Immortal Empires a standalone game?</div><br/>No, you must own either Total War: WARHAMMER I, II or III in order to access Immortal Empires, and it will be accessible through the Total War: WARHAMMER III application in your Library.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">3. Can I purchase any DLC from the trilogy regardless of which game I own?</div><br/>Yes! For example; If you own WARHAMMER I, you can purchase DLC for WARHAMMER II and/or III and enjoy it within Immortal Empires. This makes it even easier to expand and tailor the experience to your liking.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">4. What happens if I already own WARHAMMER III?</div><br/>If you already own WARHAMMER III, your game experience will not change, and there is nothing you need to do in order to continue playing your owned content (but we would recommend recruiting a friend or seven and getting a co-op campaign rolling).<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">5. What has changed with this update?</div><br/>The primary change in this update is that owners of Total War: WARHAMMER I &amp; II will now have access to Immortal Empires and The Lost God campaign from WARHAMMER III.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">6. How do I access Immortal Empires from within WARHAMMER I and II?</div><br/>You don’t. Immortal Empires will not appear as a game mode in WARHAMMER I or II. In order to access Immortal Empires you will need to launch Total War: WARHAMMER III from your Steam or Epic Games library, which will be added to your library as part of this update.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">7. What am I gaining access to if I do not own Warhammer III?</div><br/>No. If you only own WARHAMMER I &amp; II, you are only gaining access to the Immortal Empires campaign and The Lost God prologue campaign. If you wish to own the other WARHAMMER III content such as the Realms of Chaos campaign and the Legendary Lords and their associated features, you must purchase the Total War: WARHAMMER III Upgrade Pack.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">8. How do I get access to WARHAMMER III’s other content?</div><br/>If you only own WARHAMMER I and/or II, you can purchase the WARHAMMER III Upgrade Pack to expand your gameplay experience.

How do I remove Total War: WARHAMMER III from my Library if I don’t want it?</div><br/>Follow the usual procedure for removing a game from your library by contacting Steam, Epic or Microsoft store support.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">10. How is Immortal Empires different from WARHAMMER I?</div><br/>Immortal Empires features a massively expanded map containing all of regions from the entire trilogy. Rebuilt from the ground up, its the biggest Total War sandbox ever made. is the culmination of a decade of the Total War: Warhammer franchise, and the ultimate way to play it.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">11. Does this mean my PC meets the requirements of WARHAMMER III?</div><br/>Please check the Total War: WARHAMMER III Upgrade Pack page to see the minimum specs needed to play Immortal Empires and The Lost God campaigns.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">12.

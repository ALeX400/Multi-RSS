We're pleased to announce that we've now rolled this hotfix out to all players, including one additional fix:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resolved a script error that prevented events from triggering after completing missions as Gorbad Ironclaw.</li></ul>Our original plan was to release this in late January but we wanted to get these changes out to you all as quickly as possible so you could all enjoy them. We're now working on Hotfix 6.0.4 which is currently aiming for the end of January, but if this changes we'll be sure to let you know!<br/><br/>For those who didn't opt-in to the Beta, here's a full list of changes in 6.0.3:<br/><br/><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Hotfix 6.0.3 Release Notes</div><br/><div class="bb_h2">SKULLTAKER UPDATES AND FIXES</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Adjusted Blood Hosts and Disciple forces so they no longer benefit from the Daemonic Reforging chance.<br/></li><li> Adjusted the effects of the Cloak of Skulls so that they now only apply when Skulltaker himself defeats a Lord.<br/></li><li> When playing as Skulltaker, the Legendary Lord 2x bonus for Champion‚Äôs Essence will now only be applied once. After defeating a Champion in battle, the bonus will no longer stack.<br/></li><li> Blood Hosts now increase the cost of the ‚ÄòBlood for the Blood God‚Äô occupation option while they are on the map. This means that the more active Blood Hosts there are, the more costly it becomes to create new Blood Hosts. This change addresses the over-reliance of Khorne factions on excessive Blood Host forces.<br/></li><li> Reduced the XP gain bonus from the Cloak of Skulls on the ‚ÄòDubois the Prescient‚Äô skull, from 25/50 to 20/40.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Bloodspeakers lacked mounts when playing as Valkia.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Heralds of Khorne and Bloodreapers on Blood Throne mounts were missing Siege Attacker.<br/></li><li> Fixed the 2D porthole for The Slaughtergard (Chosen of Khorne - Halberds) using the wrong image.<br/></li><li> Fixed a text inconsistency in the description of the Daemons Reforged effect for the Skulltakers faction.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">PERFORMANCE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resolved a rare crash that could occur during VFX rendering.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when loading saved Savage Orc Great Shaman lords.<br/></li><li> Fixed a potential crash when loading a battle in certain cases.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when loading the Black Orc Big Boss character.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when teleporting to the Great Drill of Hashut quest battle.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">CAMPAIGN</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">GENERAL/GAMEPLAY</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Erd Mentality Rebalance:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Melee Defence: 40 &gt; 20<br/></li><li> Ward Save: 40 &gt; 20<br/></li><li> Number of Squig Herds in range for maximum value: 10 &gt; 5</li></ul></li><li> Fixed an issue where Da Acid Burpa (Colossal Squig RoR) was not counting towards the unit requirements for the ‚ÄòSplode Da Big One Tactik‚Äô in Da Plan.<br/></li><li> Ogre Camps now take only 3 turns to be redeployed, instead of 5.<br/></li><li> Removed Destroy ‚ÄòKraka Drak‚Äô from Throgg and Astragoth‚Äôs victory conditions and replaced it with Malakai‚Äôs faction<br/></li><li> Nasty Skulkers, Rogue Idol, River Trolls, and Snotling Pump Wagon (base unit) have been added to Gorbad - Omens of Destruction DLC for use in his Da Plan feature.<br/></li><li> Resolved a script error that prevented events from triggering after completing missions as Gorbad Ironclaw.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">TECHNOLOGY TREE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The Hammer of Gork‚Äôs Blinded contact effect is no longer replaced by Dazed from the Orcs &amp; Goblins‚Äô Avalanche Smash technology.<br/></li><li> Eshin Maneater‚Äôs Weeping Blade effect is no longer replaced by Armour Sundering from the Ogres‚Äô Betta Plunda technology.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">SKILL TREE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where Snagla's ‚ÄòBeneath the Gloomy Canopy‚Äô skill would lose its Stalk effect when upgraded.<br/></li><li> Removed the ‚ÄòImmune to Contact Effects‚Äô from the Slaughtermaster's Poisonmaster skill, as they possess that attribute innately.<br/></li><li> Removed the Thundertusk and Stonehorn from the Hunter skill effects that provided Vanguard, Frenzy, and Stalk Hunter skills.<br/></li><li> Fixed the missing Idol of Gork Scrap upgrade for Savage Orc units.<br/></li><li> Fixed the Divinatory Authority skill incorrectly reducing cooldowns for Cold-Blooded instead of Focus Instincts.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">UNITS</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where Markus Wulfhart‚Äôs Imperial Regiments of Greatswords had a different tier to regular Greatswords.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">UI/UX</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a UI issue with the Ogre‚Äôs army ability ‚ÄòMeat Feast‚Äô, which incorrectly stated it affected multiple units when it only affects a single unit.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">BATTLE</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">UNITS</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where Colossal Squigs were missing Siege Attacker.<br/></li><li> Added missing MP unit caps to the following: Colossal Squig, Da Acif Burpa, Snagla Deff Throwa, Piggyback Knights, Slaughterbrute, Eshin Maneater, Skullcannon, Hellforged Bellowers, and Arachnarok Flinger.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Khorngors were still available for Warriors of Chaos when unit caps were active.<br/></li><li> Fixed the abilities ‚ÄòBathed in Blood‚Äô and ‚ÄòBlinding Radiance‚Äô being incorrectly labelled as active abilities.</li></ul><br/><hr/><br/>‚ÄãThanks to everyone who‚Äôs shared their feedback with us since the launch of Omens of Destruction and Update 6.0.

<div class="bb_h1">Dear Space Marines,</div><br/>The year is coming to an end, and we first and foremost want to assure you that 2025 will be just as epic as 2024. ‚≠ê<br/><br/>You‚Äôve been following our development very closely before and after the release of <i>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</i>, and we‚Äôve loved collaborating with the players to improve the game.<br/>But before we dive into what‚Äôs coming to the game next year, let‚Äôs look back together, shall we?<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">WARPING BACK TO SEPTEMBER!</div>We launched <i>Space Marine 2</i> on September 9 and it was a success! We‚Äôve been working on it for years and it has been a work of passion and dedication. Witnessing the warm welcome the players reserved for the game was the greatest reward and the best achievement to unlock after all these relentless years.<br/><br/>The enthusiasm motivated us to keep up the good work and make sure the game would remain up to the players‚Äô expectations. Then, we released 2 big updates and several hotfixes.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Update 4.0 - Termination ü©∏</div>Introduced a new PvE mission with a dreadful foe to annihilate: the Hierophant Bio-Titan. This update also introduced the much-awaited photomode in Operations mode, which you loved! Balancing tweaks were made too‚Ä¶<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/8ffc8ad485fe9383da0969a10dcf5260f6f622f5.png"/><br/>This update received mixed reviews because it increased the difficulty in an unpleasant way. Our mistake! We closely listened to your feedback and released Patch 4.1 a few days later to revert the unwanted effects.<br/>Paying attention to your feedback has been incredibly helpful to us, and it's something we want to continue doing next year.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Update 5.0 - Obelisk ü™Ω</div>We knew the Warhammer 40k fans were waiting for this one, for it introduced the Dark Angels Cosmetic pack, with the Dark Angels Champion, new weapons skins and more. <br/><br/>This update brought a new PvE map, and also introduced a new enemy: the Tzaangor Enlightened. Along with that, a few feature additions such as the new lens colors (which you‚Äôve also been waiting for) and the Neo-Volkite pistol, available in PvP, were also implemented.<br/>Finally, Space Marine 2 has been upgraded to 4K/60 FPS for PS5 Pro and now supports DLSS3 and FSR3.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">More and more Space Marines joining the ranks</div>In the span of 3 months, <i>Space Marine 2</i> reached the remarkable milestone of 5 million players, to our great delight. We want to sincerely thank all 5 million of you for this. ü•πüéâ<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/f7338178ead67bcd2ed86a236881ada717efb85b.jpg"/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Fan creations üì∑</div>Thousands of screenshots from the game were shared on social media (including some striking Titus selfies)<br/>Keep it coming, we love to see it! üì∑<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2baaf315acfaa5d66cbac17d79deea9529f4c07b.png"/><br/><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/da2f78e94b293059aa20b7578400d143a5c0451e.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/e328028882602a780c59f43f70d12185922736e6.jpg"/></div></div></div><div class="bb_h1">COMMUNITY EVENTS</div>There will continue to be in-game events in 2025. Currently, the ongoing Decimation Event invites you to win 10 times in Operations in order to unlock an exclusive skin: the Mark XI Hell‚Äôs Teeth Pattern Chainsword. You don‚Äôt want to skip this one, Space Marine, so gear up and head back to the battlefield already! ‚öîÔ∏è<br/><br/>The event starts on December 27 and ends on January 20<img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/8e374bcd4fd45a25f15bc4bc19b617f9e2b36c6f.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT FOR 2025?</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">Fresh content for PVP</div>PVP Players - We have heard you, and we know you feel left out. We will have your back in 2025 with brand new and exciting content for the PvP. First thing we can tease you with is the new PvP map (it will be set in a closed environment with many narrow passages pushing you to engage more in Closed Quartered Battles).<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/8bba97254756cf8618f983fe15a3c9bae1237453.png"/><br/><br/>Custom PvP lobbies will also be implemented in Patch 7.0: You will be able to play with modifiers and change the amount of players, up to 6v6 / You can change the timer limit for each match, the maximum limit score / you can have more than two players for each class (and have 6 snipers on your team if you want, even if it‚Äôs a questionable strategy!)<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">New PvE content</div>The hotly anticipated Horde Mode will arrive later in 2025. We‚Äôll keep you updated once we get closer to it!<br/>Prestige Rank will be introduced during season 3, allowing you to upgrade your classes even further.<br/>On top of that, new Operations and new Enemies will come to expand the content of <i>Space Marine 2</i>. To spice things up, a new difficulty level with new rewards will also be added.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">And our next Champion will be‚Ä¶ ü•Å </div>The Salamander Champion!! ü¶é And he will be a sniper, available in PvE and PvP. Let‚Äôs explain our choice a bit:<br/><ol><li> His cape is very cool (super important).<br/></li><li> An obvious choice for the Sniper Champion would have been to be a Raven Guard, but we have different plans for them.<br/></li><li> Everyone loves Salamanders, us included, and we really wanted to give them a Champion. Heavy and Tactical would have been good candidates, but Heavy was already taken, and we have a different idea for Tactical.</li></ol>Here‚Äôs a sneak peek: look at those flames. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/a62bc19a1e9e19f11e45fce9f8375b8a7e275d7f.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Customisation</div>We‚Äôll keep adding customisation elements (such as the Mark VI Corvus üòâ) throughout the year to represent more iconic Chapters of the Warhammer 40k universe.<br/>Battle Barge Expansion<br/><br/>The Datavault will make its entry on the Battle Barge next year. It will consist of a new area with unlockable information on most elements enemies from the game. Unlock them with a special currency earned through in-game achievements. We‚Äôll get back to you quickly in the beginning of 2025.<br/><br/>Take a first look at it üìö<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/c13c735ecee476e9e720dfdfe05672063e031e89.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">WE‚ÄôLL SEE YOU SOON, SPACE MARINES</div>2025 is near, whether or not you‚Äôre celebrating Christmas, we wish you a good end of 2024. Remember celebrating is cool, but protecting the Imperium is better. Don‚Äôt lose focus!<br/>Happy new year gamers. ü•ÇüéÜüéä<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><i>Focus &amp; Saber</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/e4ba024509c3934efbed4a0ff5e8207f507f25d0.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">For the Emperor</div><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2e279301e7245e4d4f4991c30208b3664bf66546.gif"/><br/><br/>]]></description>

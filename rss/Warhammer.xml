      <title>March Community Update</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500568489646358807</link>

<div class="bb_h2">Greetings Brothers and Sisters,</div><br/>Many announcements have taken place throughout March. Let‚Äôs rewind a bit, and then let‚Äôs dive into the upcoming content! We‚Äôll also tackle the polls taken to make the Absolute Difficulty more to your liking.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">MONTH‚ÄôS REWIND</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">We‚Äôve made a huge announcement ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</div><br/>Mid-March, we announced that <i>Space Marine 3</i> had begun development and we‚Äôre excited to see your enthusiasm, although we hear those of you who fear for <i>Space Marine 2</i> and its future support.<br/><br/>So let us set the record straight: <b><i>Space Marine 3</i> does not mean the end of <i>Space Marine 2</i>'s development. ‚ÄãFar from it.</b> No teams are shifting over, no one is abandoning the game, and our plans to bring more awesome content to <i>Space Marine 2</i> remain. We are working on much more content and surprises for the months to come, such as a new class, more operations, melee weapons, and more! Trust us, there are surprises even dataminers haven‚Äôt found out about :) <br/><br/>This announcement simply marks the genesis of a new project, <b>years away from release</b>. We‚Äôve made a decision and have just started the process.<br/><br/>Many of you were very excited for this project and this makes us incredibly happy and motivated. Thank you for the unwavering support.<br/><br/><br/>That being said, we still have a lot to offer to the players with <i>Space Marine 2</i>. <br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">We launched the PTS on March 13!</div><br/>The Public Test Server was made available mid-march and you‚Äôve been very dedicated and serious about it!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/5ec61352a7be0277f5d94254c2a9496f54626c7b.png"/><br/><br/>We‚Äôve opened a forum on Focus Together to let you voice your opinion on the content featured in the PTS. Even if we might not have enough time on our hands to reply to every thread, we‚Äôre collecting your thoughts and making adjustments on our side. So, thank you!<br/><br/>We already started to compile your feedback, and we‚Äôll implement some of them directly on a PTS update that will come early April. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Regarding your feedback on the PTS features, we want to tackle the most important one here:</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Prestige Perks are not gamechanger, they are too weak and not worth the effort.</i></li></ul><i>üí¨ Prestige Perks have not been conceived as game breaking perks meant to allow you to roll on late game content. Another way to say it is that we don‚Äôt want the Prestige Perks to be so strong they become ‚Äúmust-haves‚Äù for higher difficulties. We really want to emphasize that you don‚Äôt need Prestige Perks to beat Absolute difficulty. This would make grinding for them an obligation when we really want them as minor rewards for those who choose to pursue them. The idea behind Prestige Perks is to provide you with more replayability, so you actually have a purpose farming PvE content (other than purging for the Imperium of course!). We don't want players to feel like they need to base their builds upon prestige perks, otherwise it will feel like a forced grind. </i><br/><br/><b>Don‚Äôt forget that there‚Äôs a unique cosmetic for each class to unlock once you maxed out a class. </b><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Prestige Ranks are resetting the class progression to level 1, it will be tedious and too long to get level 25 again.</i></li></ul><i>üí¨ In recent updates we've increased the amount of xp players are getting in preparation for the prestige system. We've added extermination bonus, quick match bonus, plus new difficulties grant more xp.</i><br/><br/>On top of that we‚Äôll add an XP bonus to make your post-prestige progression faster.<br/><br/>Again, we are trying to strike the balance between having something to keep playing and not forcing players to grind for a hundred hours.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>The Prestige Perks for the Heavy Class are too centered around melee combat.</i></li></ul><i>üí¨ We are working on changes regarding the Heavy‚Äôs Prestige Perks to better integrate them for Heavy‚Äôs builds.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Assault should have access to the Inferno Pistol!</i></li></ul>üí¨<i> Absolutely, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôll include the weapon to Assault‚Äôs options starting from the next PTS update.</i><br/><br/>Join the players on Discord if you want to chat about this PTS and the future instances!<br/><br/>‚Äé <br/><div class="bb_h2">‚åõ Patch 7.0 - Trygon Update</div><br/>Patch 7.0 will be released in mid-April on all platforms. Let‚Äôs dissect the content together!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">New DLC content</div><br/><b>Space Wolves Chapter Pack üê∫</b><br/>‚Äã	‚Äã	‚Äã<br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/a23bd933bf6de3953f589ab4321607a22b467a93.jpg"/><br/>‚Äã<div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/972f2da5efa33dc0c6bacc52fc146fb8348f5f2e.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2e1a4ad9d85767cf862d6613ef3b04279b48434d.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/33ff795584ca36d68ab5654ee1965aec161ca86c.jpg"/></div></div></div>Behold the arsenal tied to this Chapter:‚Äã<br/>‚Äã<div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/6c21fdc88eddf684fe0a0c9a65132520135551f3.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/d0028a3208d331da60e019192ada80f7cbe64cb4.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2c67ef5d488f9628dd9249d676cf1ceea17be5f7.jpg"/></div></div></div>The Space Wolf Chapter Pack comes with its Great Companies.

As the name of the update hints, you will meet with a terrible new boss: the Trygon.<br/><br/>The Trygon is a giant Tyranid creature that can burrow itself in the ground and carve underground tunnels that can be used by smaller Tyranids to bypass the defense lines and coordinate surprise attacks. <br/><br/>‚ÄúExfiltration‚Äù takes place on Avarax. Your mission is to exfiltrate a Tech-Priest occupying an Adeptus Mechanicus facility on the planet. However, you‚Äôll have to cross a Trygon territory to reach the facility.

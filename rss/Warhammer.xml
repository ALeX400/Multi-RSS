      <title>An Update on Unit Recruitment Issues</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1142710/view/519725729918748466</link>

<div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>UPDATE \[OCTOBER 10TH]:</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>We have shared some community questions with the team regarding Beastmen, who are known to us as having similar issues with Idle Behaviour. The fixes we currently have in testing aren't showing any direct improvement to Beastmen, so it's evident to us from our tests that we'll need to conduct a similar investigation with them and see if we can include any improvements as a part of this Hotfix. We've started that work already, and will keep you updated.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Meanwhile we're seeing plenty of positives with Lizardmen and Tomb Kings in our testing. TK are still showing a low survival rate beyond turn 25, meanwhile LM are thriving, but most importantly they're both recruiting and correctly engaging with Campaigns.</i></p></div></div></div><p class="bb_paragraph">Hi all,</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We‚Äôve been investigating the issues affecting Campaign AI since the release of 6.3.1 and are working hard to restore it back to a better standard. I want to give you an update on why these issues have occurred, and where we are with our progress on fixing them.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">A Hotfix is in development, currently its singular focus is on Campaign AI Unit Cap Recruitment fixes and the bad AI behavior that stems from this issue. Hotfix 6.3.2 is presently scheduled for release next week. It entered the first phases of our testing earlier today and is showing positive signs of providing an improved experience to the game. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Over the last few weeks when responding to questions on this topic, we had originally planned to publish the fix as part of 7.0. Now that the investigations have been completed and we are almost there with a fix, it makes sense to decouple it from 7.0 to get it out as quickly as we can. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The issues with Campaign AI are unfortunately complex to resolve. We haven't been able to deliver an immediate fix as we needed to conduct some very thorough investigations into the root causes, but we are working as quickly as the complexity allows. We‚Äôll go into that complexity below for those who want the detail, but if you‚Äôre just looking for the headline: we‚Äôre on it.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Hotfix 6.3.2 aims to address the recent problem that we‚Äôve seen where factions aren‚Äôt recruiting units into their Armies, and the idle behavior that‚Äôs stemmed from that. This issue with recruitment has been a highly visible problem since the release of Update 6.3, but this issue wasn‚Äôt caused by 6.3 itself. We‚Äôve discovered that this issue has been present in the game prior to this update and affects factions where the AI is tasked with managing Unit Caps. We have found that the AI was building lists of units to recruit without taking caps into consideration, resulting in recruitment failing to occur and stalling the AI decision making process. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">These issues have been compounded by changes that we made to the different resources that are required to recruit units by the Lizardmen and Tomb Kings, and why you may have also seen issues like this happen with factions that use pooled resources (like Spawning Sequence, Meat, Oathgold, or Skulls) to recruit. Lizardmen and Tomb Kings will still face an uphill struggle in their campaigns when managed by the AI (they have challenging starting locations which regularly sees them defeated fairly early on) but they shouldn‚Äôt be fighting with both hands tied behind their back. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For a deeper look at what causes these issues, here‚Äôs Lead Technical Designer, Radoslav Borisov with detail about how our AI is currently behaving.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><hr/><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The way our AI handles unit recruitment occurs over several distinct steps.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">One of those steps is selecting a list of units to recruit into a specific force, with the goal of acquiring the necessary strength to perform a task.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">When the AI is mapping out its shopping list of units that it wants to recruit, unit caps are not currently taken into consideration in a proper fashion. This results in the recruitment action failing as soon as a unit's cap is exceeded.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Recruitment action failure then occurs. Should the AI decide that its next task should be to attack a settlement, it‚Äôs generating a recruitment action and then expecting an increase in force strength to a level where it feels the settlement garrison that it's targeted for attack can be defeated. Without the unit recruitment task‚Äôs successful resolution, it holds up the subsequent task and leaves the AI in a paralyzed state. It‚Äôs a cascade of failures that result in certain factions failing to complete any aggressive actions whatsoever. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">In order to be efficient in how resources are allocated and spent, the AI relies heavily on several beliefs around the current state of the game world.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Some examples of these assumptions are things like:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Cheapest unit that can be recruited anywhere in the faction</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Strongest unit that can be recruited anywhere</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Most cost-efficient unit (best cost to strength ratio)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Estimated number of turns to reach the recruitment location of the strongest/cheaper unit</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">Any mistakes when constructing these assumptions has been found to lead to a catastrophic failure in many of our AI systems.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">If the AI believes a unit is free and provides any meaningful strength increase it will not allocate any resources to buy units ‚Äì it wrongly believes it can fill its armies with powerful units for free and so will pursue that option and trigger a failure cascade.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">If the cost of a unit is not properly evaluated, the AI finds itself in situations where it has budgeted some money that ultimately ends up being insufficient, causing overspending and running them into an irrecoverable, or very slow to pay off debt.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This is where pooled resources come into play ‚Äì the AI‚Äôs ability to understand, plan and budget pooled resources is not ideal.  Lately, AI has not been factoring in pooled resource to its costs properly, leading to incorrect beliefs about what it can and cannot afford, resulting in action failure.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">These past weeks of investigation have shown to us that the majority of our internal systems were unprepared for actions that ostensibly could not fail, to fail. The cascading effect led to all sorts of problems ‚Äì the AI couldn‚Äôt change stances properly, attacking on the campaign failed, recruitment failed, laying siege failed, and so on.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We‚Äôve identified and resolved the leading causes for such failures, but it‚Äôs very likely there are other cases we are not yet aware of just yet. Resolving the immediately known causes of this problem is helping us to remove any denser levels of fog that may be obscuring other possible causes, and as they become known to us, we‚Äôll resolve those too.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">As it stands today, there are around 200 different pooled resources in the game and they are used in a large variety of ways. For us to be absolutely certain that everything is properly accounted for is a daunting task, but we will continue working on identifying and resolving any issues in the future, and will not deploy this Hotfix without careful monitoring of the effect it has, and will continue to stay committed to bringing more improvements as necessary.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">‚Äî Radoslav Borisov // Lead Technical Designer</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><hr/><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">News on Tides of Torment will take a back seat until we‚Äôve resolved this issue. We‚Äôre looking forward to giving you your first complete look at this next DLC, but fixing this comes first.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">In closing, please accept our apologies for the experience that you‚Äôre currently having with the game. I‚Äôll be active across our different community spaces helping to keep you informed on our progress as we move towards the release of Hotfix 6.3.2.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">‚Äî Freeman // Head of Community</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.</div><p class="bb_paragraph">SteamXFacebookInstagramDiscordBluesky</p>]]></description>

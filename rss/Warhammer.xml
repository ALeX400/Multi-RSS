After defeating a Champion in battle, the bonus will no longer stack.<br/></li><li> Blood Hosts now increase the cost of the ‚ÄòBlood for the Blood God‚Äô occupation option while they are on the map. This means that the more active Blood Hosts there are, the more costly it becomes to create new Blood Hosts. This change addresses the over-reliance of Khorne factions on excessive Blood Host forces.<br/></li><li> Reduced the XP gain bonus from the Cloak of Skulls on the ‚ÄòDubois the Prescient‚Äô skull, from 25/50 to 20/40.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Bloodspeakers lacked mounts when playing as Valkia.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Heralds of Khorne and Bloodreapers on Blood Throne mounts were missing Siege Attacker.<br/></li><li> Fixed the 2D porthole for The Slaughtergard (Chosen of Khorne - Halberds) using the wrong image.<br/></li><li> Fixed a text inconsistency in the description of the Daemons Reforged effect for the Skulltakers faction.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">PERFORMANCE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resolved a rare crash that could occur during VFX rendering.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when loading saved Savage Orc Great Shaman lords.<br/></li><li> Fixed a potential crash when loading a battle in certain cases.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when loading the Black Orc Big Boss character.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when teleporting to the Great Drill of Hashut quest battle.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">CAMPAIGN</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">GENERAL/GAMEPLAY</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Erd Mentality Rebalance:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Melee Defence: 40 &gt;

This can take some time depending on your hard drive speeds.<br/><br/>The full release of Hotfix 6.0.3 is currently aiming for this Friday, and when this happens your game will automatically switch to the main release.<br/><br/><b>Please note:</b> If you update to 6.0.3 early, you will only be able to play multiplayer with other players who are also opted in to the 6.0.3 Beta until the update rolls out to all players. You can switch back to 6.0.2 at any time by selecting ‚ÄòNone‚Äô in the Betas dropdown menu.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>‚ÄãThanks to everyone who‚Äôs shared their feedback with us since the launch of Omens of Destruction and Update 6.0. This will be our last game update before we power down for a couple of weeks to rest, recuperate and eat our body weight in mince pies. We‚Äôll be back in 2025, ready and raring to kick back into gear.<br/><br/>Happy Holidays!<br/><br/>‚ÄîThe <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

We've done some work on this so hopefully it's better, but these are the types of deep crashes that are hard to reproduce and diagnose.

This episode gives full focus to our next faction, Norsca, and its newest Legendary Lord: Sayl The Faithless.<br/><br/>Creative Director Todor Nikolov, Lead Designer Vasil Nikolov, and Art Director Stoyan Stoyanov sit down with myself, subbing in for KingGobbo who recently welcomed two baby Mangler Squigs to his family and will be spending some well-earned time off whilst we keep the wheels turning. Congratulations to the Colemans from all of us across Total War!<br/><br/>Watch this full episode of What‚Äôs Next right here on the Total War YouTube Channel üëáüëÄ<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>We were thrilled to reveal Sayl alongside our friends across gaming at yesterday's Skulls Showcase, which if you missed you can check it out here.<br/><br/>Unlike past Skulls events, this year we haven‚Äôt released a free legendary lord as we‚Äôve shifted our priorities over the past year to introduce more free content through our game updates, but we didn‚Äôt want you to think we‚Äôd forgotten about you all the same. 6.2 is not too far beyond the horizon, bringing with it some new units:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Blood Knights (Sword &amp; Shield)<br/></li><li> Hobgoblin Bolt Throwa</li></ul>You‚Äôll find an early preview of additional content coming to 6.2 in this episode of What‚Äôs Next, and we‚Äôll be back in the next few weeks with more information about our next title update.<br/><br/>And What‚Äôs Next will return at the end of June with a look at our third and final faction for Tides of Torment. We‚Äôll have more behind the scenes looks to show and share with you in the mean-time, and until then, let us know what you‚Äôve loved hearing about today, we always enjoy reading through your feedback!<br/><br/>See you on the battlefields,<br/><br/>‚Äî Freeman // Head of Community<br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

(this announcement is now outdated)<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">EDIT: Since this was posted, there has been a major fixes update to the game and the connection issues are resolved!</div>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2078450/view/515210714689832129<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/279b1bfeef8269e1ab24fcb3f2bc68f2b5baa623.png"/><br/><br/>Hey folks. <br/><br/>Today we officially launched Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks on Steam, and whilst the game is now officially out of Early Access, we know the transition has not gone smoothly for many of you. <br/><br/>Connectivity problems caused by our shift from dedicated servers to a player-hosted system have made it difficult for players to find and join matches consistently. We deployed an update shortly after launch today in an attempt to address some of these issues, but unfortunately it did not resolve the core problems. <br/><br/>The development team is working through the night to bring the game back to full online functionality as soon as possible and fully focused on identifying and implementing a reliable fix. <br/><br/>We‚Äôre hugely grateful to the community for your patience, feedback, and support. Every bug report and shared log is helping us move faster towards a solution. <br/> <br/>We‚Äôll continue to provide regular updates as work progresses. Please do continue to report bugs, issues and any hiccups you have had so far &amp; we'll continue to answer questions in the discussions as we see them.<br/><br/>Thank for your your patience.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/4781ddc91481ba36d458573c5494dcd7dffc2910.png"/>]]></description>

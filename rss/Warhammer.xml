Yet.<br/></li><li> Solomorne will no longer contradict himself in different conversations regarding the fate and traditions;<br/></li><li> Solomorne now has reactivity to the Death Cult Temple;<br/></li><li> Solomorne now has reactivity to completion of the Electrodynamic Cenobium;<br/></li><li> Introduction dialogue with the Marshal has received an additional more respectful dialogue option to address him;<br/></li><li> Reworded a dialogue option in one of conversations with Solomorne, where the Lord Captain asks a question over something Solomorne has just given an extensive answer for;<br/></li><li> You can now order the overseer on Vheabos-VI to investigate the attempt on Solomorne's life;<br/></li><li> You can no longer assign Maive to become a governor if you decided to conduct Exterminatus - that's too much for the poor girl;<br/></li><li> Passing all skill checks in a dialogue with the Prefect and using the associated dialogue options now causes an additional reaction from the Arbites;<br/></li><li> One of the dialogue options during the trial in the Palace of Justice was very vague in what exactly the Rogue Trader's verdict was - fixed, it is now more clear;<br/></li><li> Maive's words will no longer show as Bluff's in one of the dialogues;<br/></li><li> Added some new Abelard's reactivity to Leethus;<br/></li><li> Added some additional reactivity to separation from the rest of the party on Thassera;<br/></li><li> Added Solomorne's concerns about Thassertium during the final dialogue on Thassera;<br/></li><li> Added more information regarding the Tithe to the Encyclopedia;<br/></li><li> Added crowd reaction to Marazhai and Yrliet's appearance on Thassera;<br/></li><li> Added another available answer for a dialogue with the Prefect, where you hide the nature of Thassertium;<br/></li><li> Added an option to ask Governor Ruoldo on Thassera about his origins;<br/></li><li> Added an article about the Arbites ranks to the Encyclopedia;<br/></li><li> Added an additional, more gentle dialogue option to end the dance with Solomorne during his romance scene;<br/></li><li> For some reason, instead of Vigdis, Ravor was establishing vox contact with Captain Sargona. The oddity was fixed, and Vigdis is back at her duty.<br/></li><li> Fixed minor description inconsistency regarding the servitor orchestra on Thassera;<br/></li><li> Fixed a narrative inconsistency on Janus, where Solomorne tells Vyatt that the Tithe from Janus is always paid in time, yet further conversation revolves around shuttles being blown off orbit by rebels;<br/></li><li> Fixed a couple of cases where dialogues in Lex Imperialis content that implied the Rogue Trader knew certain information that they haven't actually discovered yet;<br/></li><li> After sending Solomorne away, he sometimes remained on the voidship, still available normally - fixed, he will now leave once and for all if told to;<br/></li><li> Added an additional dialogue option to describe Solomorne in a more positive manner to the Administratum clerk;<br/></li><li> Added additional reactivity for Maive after the final battle at Thassera;<br/></li><li> Added additional NPC banter to Thassera;<br/></li><li> Added additional companion reactivity on Thassera;</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3">Void Shadows Content</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Repeatedly clicking the option to ask about the cultist temple in Kibellah's dialogue no longer causes the dialogue to break;<br/></li><li> Removed an error speaker case at the Freight Line dialogue;<br/></li><li> The flute man will disappear from the lower decks after the events related to him unfold;<br/></li><li> Kibellah would sometimes comment on Janus events as if she's there while in completely different location - fixed;<br/></li><li> Kibellah will now redress in Electrodynamic Cenobium along with the rest of the party;<br/></li><li> Added new reactivity to the Infernus master and the master of Discipline after the genestealer interrogation;<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug with the dialogue in the Death Cult trial scene, where dialogue options to punish officers and workers were internally reversed and caused incorrect reactions;<br/></li><li> Added a new, more neutral option to the dialogue with Jocasta and the Magus that is more fitting for an Iconoclast Rogue Trader;<br/></li><li> Companions will no longer question the Nemesite's nature while bantering if the Nemesite was already defeated;<br/></li><li> Added additional advice from companions to make it clear that if he player decides to agree with Zacchary Weisz and ignore the ritual, the consequences will be dire and irreversible (and lock you out of the DLC content);</li></ul><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">General narrative changes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Changed the dialogue option in the first Abelard's quest that sent Senechal to deal with the problem himself, to make it more aggressive and obvious that the Rogue Trader does not want to be involved in Abelard's personal matters. That should help the player understand that this decision will have negative consequences (and cause Abelard‚Äôs second quest to fail automatically because the stern man will not come seeking aid before it‚Äôs too late). <br/></li><li> When Pasqal's second quest was failed or skipped, his dialogues sometimes didn't reflect that - fixed;<br/></li><li> The Footfall 'zoo' didn't register the player's previous Heretical decision - fixed;<br/></li><li> Removed a couple of incorrect [draft] tags from NPC banter on Footfall;<br/></li><li> Player now needs to learn about the existence of the 'gift' of Kor's head to gain access to the option of blowing up the pirate ships;<br/></li><li> Pasqal's age in years that was mentioned in one of the dialogues, contradicted the rest of the events of the game and was retconned to never be specified directly;<br/></li><li> Pasqal surprisingly still had a [draft] dialogue related to the Halo device - fixed;<br/></li><li> One of the objectives in the Critical Tasks quest was impossible to complete if not done before Magnae Accessio - fixed;<br/></li><li> One of dialogue options in Pasqal's dialogue on the voidship bridge appeared only once, becoming inaccessible if the player didn't click the option immediately - fixed;<br/></li><li> Minor text adjustments for the dialogue with governor Drivestem regarding Sauerback and Gaprak families during the Magnae Accessio ceremony;<br/></li><li> Many minor narrative fixes to colony events;<br/></li><li> Many minor narrative fixes to colony chronicles;<br/></li><li> Idira will no longer talk about Commorragh like she was there if you didn't take her with you;<br/></li><li> Heinrix will no longer insert himself into the blood bath dialogue if he's not in the party. Innocence proves nothing, but Heinrix, please, this is not the first time you‚Äôre doing this!<br/></li><li> Heinrix managed to somehow throw a glaring look on Yrliet on the voidship bridge scene after Commorragh, even if she was left behind in the Dark City - fixed;<br/></li><li> Heinrix managed to somehow throw a glaring look on Yrliet on the voidship bridge scene after Commorragh, even if he wasn't present because he was sent back to Calcazar - fixed;<br/></li><li> Heinrix could voice his suspicions over the potential corruption of Kiava Gamma even after the party has already been there and dealt with it -

fixed;<br/></li><li> Fixed an error speaker case in the Rykad Minoris Star Port;<br/></li><li> Depending on the timing of arrival to Rykad Minoris, Cassia, Idira and Crime Lord RT will consistently recognize whether the Astra Militarum soldier that meets them is a traitor or not - previously, they used to contradict each other;</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3">Act II</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> During the conversation with the Fabricator-Censor on Kiava Gamma, it was possible to motivate Abelard and Argenta multiple times, and Abelard's response was incorrectly showing as spoken by the Forgefiend - fixed;</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Act III</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> In the first dialogue with Nocturne of Oblivion, the Rogue Trader will now remember if the lore (xenos) check during the trial was passed and the Lord Captain already figured out the nature of this mysterious figure;<br/></li><li> The Rogue Trader can no longer ask Nocturne of Oblivion how to find Yrliet in Act III if she was already killed;<br/></li><li> Argenta will no longer talk about the Commissar being dead if he was kept alive;<br/></li><li> Argenta will no longer complain about killing the Commissar at Comorragh if she already knows what he did;</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Act IV</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> When visiting the Watcher Station in the Lex Imperialis expansion, Idira no longer hears the whispers if she wears the Psi-Stifler;<br/></li><li> When asked about his plans for the future after completing his quest, Marazhai continued to give the old dialogue lines, still anticipating the events in the quest as if they haven't unfolded yet - fixed;<br/></li><li> Octaviana no longer talks about Jae in Act IV as if she was alive if the Rogue Trader executed her;<br/></li><li> Octaviana and Jae now actually sit visually closer during the Footfall party, as described;<br/></li><li> Incendia no longer scoops the brain of the condemned man if the Rogue Trader has already executed him;<br/></li><li> Fixed an error speaker case in one of the dialogues in Pasqal's second quest;<br/></li><li> Fixed a duplicate phrase spoken by one of the Aeldari at Quetza Temer;<br/></li><li> Fixed a case of Error Speaker in the dialogue with Chorda on Footfall;</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3">Act V</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Xavier Calcazar will no longer be surprised by the Lord Captain's arrival to the Epitaph if he was the one inviting them there;<br/></li><li> If the player is allied to Calcazar and comes to Act V on his invitation, the message from the officers that the enemy at the gate was defeated is no longer displayed;<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug that caused the dialogue about the force shield at the Epitaph to never start;</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h2">Mechanics</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">Balance</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The amount of experience required for a level up has been exponentially increased with every level, to compensate for the player power increase through DLC and patch content;<br/><br/></li><li> A scrutinous consistency pass was made over all cases of obtaining experience in Act I, for a smoother progression;<br/><br/></li><li> Extensive review of companion starter builds to make them more effective and get rid of talents that are unfitting for their role in combat or useless for them;<br/><br/></li><li> Certain Bladedancer and Executioner abilities have seen a serious redesign and balance updates:<br/><br/><br/><b>Bladedancer - Death From Above and Death Waltz</b><br/><br/>After every jump from Death From Above or Death Waltz, the Bladedancer receives a stacking debuff of -20% Dodge and -10% STR, -10% PER up to -50% until the beginning of their next turn.<br/><br/><br/><b>Executioner - Forced Repentance</b><br/><br/>The target now takes a resistance check for every DoT type it has on itself when the ability procs. On a successful resistance check, the effect fails for that DoT type and is not applied. Typically, you‚Äôll see about ~15-30% procs resisted, depending on target type and level.<br/><br/><br/><b>Executioner - Scourging Strikes </b><br/><br/>The formula was changed from (2*StrB) to (StrB + PerB) to reduce scaling and allow for more diverse build options.<br/><br/><b>Executioner - Where it Hurts</b><br/><br/>The effect of this ability is subject to the same resistance checks for every DoT type as described in Forced Repentance, failing to consume that DoT type on successful resistance. The target can also no longer gain new stacks of the DoT effect that was already removed with this ability, until the end of the turn.<br/><br/><b>Executioner - Carnival of Misery</b><br/><br/>This ability was completely redesigned, becoming a single-target melee attack that causes damage equal to 4x the damage from DoTs on the target. DoTs are not consumed by this attack.<br/><br/>The upgrades for Carnival Misery are now as follows:<br/><br/>Upgrade 1: Any target affected by Executioner‚Äôs DoTs can‚Äôt use armour against DoTs.

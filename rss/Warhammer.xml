      <title>Mod Support - A Message from the Game Director</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957</link>

<div class="bb_h2">Hello, Space Marines</div><br/>We‚Äôve seen incredible community engagement since launch, and we‚Äôve noticed that some players have started to create and share mods for Space Marine 2. We wanted to make a game that was moddable from the start (this is why our game pack files are not encrypted, for example). It's always a pleasure for me, as a developer, to see what our community can create. Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity.<br/><br/>However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players. Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don‚Äôt have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods.<br/><br/>This is why, starting with our next big update in December, mods will be prohibited from public online sessions. That means that you will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed.<br/><br/>However, we know that mods are a source of fun and creativity, and they will still be allowed in private Operations lobbies. We will continue to provide all necessary server infrastructure so you can play online with your friends with mods. Once we add custom Eternal War lobbies, mods will work for them as well.<br/><br/>We will also be providing an easy entry point to our backend for games with mods installed, so modders won‚Äôt have to spend time hacking the game executable after each patch. If we somehow break this pipeline for mods by accident in the future, we‚Äôll fix it. In addition to that, we will be releasing some of our tools to modders so they can develop mods with greater ease.<br/><br/>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.<br/><br/>The Emperor protects.<br/><br/>‚ÄîDmitriy Grigorenko, Game Director]]></description>

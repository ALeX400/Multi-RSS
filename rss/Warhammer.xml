<div class="bb_h2">Greetings Brothers and Sisters,</div><br/>Many announcements have taken place throughout March. Let’s rewind a bit, and then let’s dive into the upcoming content! We’ll also tackle the polls taken to make the Absolute Difficulty more to your liking.<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">MONTH’S REWIND</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">We’ve made a huge announcement ⭐⭐⭐</div><br/>Mid-March, we announced that <i>Space Marine 3</i> had begun development and we’re excited to see your enthusiasm, although we hear those of you who fear for <i>Space Marine 2</i> and its future support.<br/><br/>So let us set the record straight: <b><i>Space Marine 3</i> does not mean the end of <i>Space Marine 2</i>'s development. ​Far from it.</b> No teams are shifting over, no one is abandoning the game, and our plans to bring more awesome content to <i>Space Marine 2</i> remain. We are working on much more content and surprises for the months to come, such as a new class, more operations, melee weapons, and more! Trust us, there are surprises even dataminers haven’t found out about :) <br/><br/>This announcement simply marks the genesis of a new project, <b>years away from release</b>. We’ve made a decision and have just started the process.<br/><br/>Many of you were very excited for this project and this makes us incredibly happy and motivated. Thank you for the unwavering support.<br/><br/><br/>That being said, we still have a lot to offer to the players with <i>Space Marine 2</i>. <br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">We launched the PTS on March 13!</div><br/>The Public Test Server was made available mid-march and you’ve been very dedicated and serious about it!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/5ec61352a7be0277f5d94254c2a9496f54626c7b.png"/><br/><br/>We’ve opened a forum on Focus Together to let you voice your opinion on the content featured in the PTS. Even if we might not have enough time on our hands to reply to every thread, we’re collecting your thoughts and making adjustments on our side. So, thank you!<br/><br/>We already started to compile your feedback, and we’ll implement some of them directly on a PTS update that will come early April. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Regarding your feedback on the PTS features, we want to tackle the most important one here:</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Prestige Perks are not gamechanger, they are too weak and not worth the effort.</i></li></ul><i>💬 Prestige Perks have not been conceived as game breaking perks meant to allow you to roll on late game content. Another way to say it is that we don’t want the Prestige Perks to be so strong they become “must-haves” for higher difficulties. We really want to emphasize that you don’t need Prestige Perks to beat Absolute difficulty. This would make grinding for them an obligation when we really want them as minor rewards for those who choose to pursue them. The idea behind Prestige Perks is to provide you with more replayability, so you actually have a purpose farming PvE content (other than purging for the Imperium of course!). We don't want players to feel like they need to base their builds upon prestige perks, otherwise it will feel like a forced grind. </i><br/><br/><b>Don’t forget that there’s a unique cosmetic for each class to unlock once you maxed out a class. </b><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Prestige Ranks are resetting the class progression to level 1, it will be tedious and too long to get level 25 again.</i></li></ul><i>💬 In recent updates we've increased the amount of xp players are getting in preparation for the prestige system. We've added extermination bonus, quick match bonus, plus new difficulties grant more xp.</i><br/><br/>On top of that we’ll add an XP bonus to make your post-prestige progression faster.<br/><br/>Again, we are trying to strike the balance between having something to keep playing and not forcing players to grind for a hundred hours.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>The Prestige Perks for the Heavy Class are too centered around melee combat.</i></li></ul><i>💬 We are working on changes regarding the Heavy’s Prestige Perks to better integrate them for Heavy’s builds.</i><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Assault should have access to the Inferno Pistol!</i></li></ul>💬<i> Absolutely, that’s why we’ll include the weapon to Assault’s options starting from the next PTS update.</i><br/><br/>Join the players on Discord if you want to chat about this PTS and the future instances!<br/><br/>‎ <br/><div class="bb_h2">⌛ Patch 7.0 - Trygon Update</div><br/>Patch 7.0 will be released in mid-April on all platforms. Let’s dissect the content together!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">New DLC content</div><br/><b>Space Wolves Chapter Pack 🐺</b><br/>​	​	​<br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/a23bd933bf6de3953f589ab4321607a22b467a93.jpg"/><br/>​<div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/972f2da5efa33dc0c6bacc52fc146fb8348f5f2e.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2e1a4ad9d85767cf862d6613ef3b04279b48434d.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/33ff795584ca36d68ab5654ee1965aec161ca86c.jpg"/></div></div></div>Behold the arsenal tied to this Chapter:​<br/>​<div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/6c21fdc88eddf684fe0a0c9a65132520135551f3.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/d0028a3208d331da60e019192ada80f7cbe64cb4.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2c67ef5d488f9628dd9249d676cf1ceea17be5f7.jpg"/></div></div></div>The Space Wolf Chapter Pack comes with its Great Companies. See below:<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/b7292fb19932826f77217c6dc365825a02fe1bf1.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Imperial Fists Champion Pack ✊</div><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/33468439454839669c5da543c35d6b18cb3eca9c.jpg"/>​<div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/3030c804842966e9b08b0c01ac26bd696a5d7611.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/9def04cb1b7febe37b749d404b8dcd7cdf7c6b1e.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/7de3b9e48cfcd4b5aafdcffd5cec24766685feaa.jpg"/></div></div></div>​<br/><div class="bb_h2">New Map for PvE 🏜️</div><br/>The new Exfiltration map is coming with Patch 7.0! As the name of the update hints, you will meet with a terrible new boss: the Trygon.<br/><br/>The Trygon is a giant Tyranid creature that can burrow itself in the ground and carve underground tunnels that can be used by smaller Tyranids to bypass the defense lines and coordinate surprise attacks. <br/><br/>“Exfiltration” takes place on Avarax. Your mission is to exfiltrate a Tech-Priest occupying an Adeptus Mechanicus facility on the planet. However, you’ll have to cross a Trygon territory to reach the facility. You’ll have to deal with the relentless assaults of the creature to complete your mission.<br/>​<div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/6d795d2fb87b144f79149b65a205ca8e2dabd001.png"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/60c6580d8d46bec867e7a665facec922ac347de3.png"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/7a7be398f91df64a5ccbb2f96716df3ba4a1fcbf.png"/></div></div></div><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/d8f554761ea9c6fe1a831eeeeeb6d84084322254.png"/><br/><br/>Speaking of PvE, as discussed before in the PTS section, more features will be tweaked. Prestige Ranks will become unlockable, and weapon class restrictions will be adjusted, allowing classes to access more weapons. Additionally, PvE matchmaking will be improved, reducing the chances of joining a team with the same class.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Regarding PvP ⚔️</div><br/><b>Patch 7.0 will bring Private Lobbies to PvP!</b> Also, we made matchmaking improvements for better team balancing.<br/><br/>Private Lobbies will give you the opportunity to customise your PvP experience, with many adjustable options!

Try it on the PTS ⚙️</div><br/>You can try patch 7.0’s WIP content early if you’re playing on Steam! Only thing you need to do is to install the Public Test Server. Here’s a quick tutorial on how to do it. We promise it’s easy!<br/><br/>You can already read the changelog of Patch 7.0 here.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">🆙 March Community Event</div><br/>From March 24 to 30th, XP rewards for both Operations and Eternal war are increased by 25%.<br/>So head back to the battlefield, it’s time to put in the work.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/94d84317678899aa9c34c28ef5ebcd81d8e82497.png"/><br/>You won’t need PROS for this Event.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">💡 Ideas on Focus Together</div><br/>We see your ideas and are doing our best to give them a status and leave comments when we can. However, they remain extremely numerous so please be patient, and remember that we will mainly tackle ideas that have been upvoted with the most G2G points.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">🔖 Results of the Absolute Difficulty polls</div><br/>First of all, we want to kindly thank you for your input! We’re working hard to improve the game and make it to the players’ liking. The Absolute Difficulty, as expressed in the previous Community Update, was tough to balance, so we’re grateful for your inputs. <br/><br/><b>Let’s see the results!</b><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> You’ve voted for more enemies on Absolute Difficulty. With a total of 74.64% votes for and 25.36% against.<br/><br/></li><li> You’ve voted against augmenting the Ammo refills limitations. With a total of 24.75%  votes for and 75.25% against.<br/><br/></li><li> You’ve voted for more enemy aggressiveness. With a total of 70.47% votes for and 29.53% against.<br/><br/></li><li> You’ve voted against increasing enemy health and damage. With a total of 15.84%  votes for and 84.15% against.</li></ul>Your feedback on both the Absolute Difficulty poll and PTS content is well taken. We are planning to make some careful changes in Patch 8.0.<br/><br/>That’s it for this month! As always, we want to thank you for your dedication and your passion! Seeing your feedback and comments on the game really drives us to deliver more and more content. Space Marine 2 wouldn’t be the game it is now without you, and we’re far from finished with this title! <br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">The Emperor Protects!</div><br/><i>The Saber &amp; Focus teams</i>]]></description>

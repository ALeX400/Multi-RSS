<div class="bb_h3"><b>ORKTOBER IS COMIN'!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">"Wotz da big guff, ya git?"  </p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Orktober</b> is when we start dropping details about our <i>massive</i> update coming for <b>Warhammer Day</b> in late October<b>ü§ò</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Stuff like:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Creation Tools</b> for building levels/races, plus online workshop support to share them</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New <b>Vehicle</b> (revealed in Oct)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New <b>Maps</b> for all modes</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New <b>WAAAGH!

There's already some pretty wild community made Kustom Rally races out there and we've only had a handful of people engage with it.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Once you'z get the <i>real</i> tools, it will open up a wealth of possibilities. Like we mentioned last time, this is the first Warhammer game ever to have level building tools like this.

<div class="bb_h1">Hello Everyone!</div><p class="bb_paragraph">You‚Äôve met Molly in our Introducing: The Cyber-Mastiff - Dev Blog so we thought it was time we introduced you to the rest of the pets of Fatshark!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>Monty</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/1aa441e1aa77fd0799bd21b28a59b7a0d0dd6595.jpg"/><b>Name:</b> Monty aka Monster or Egg<br/><b>Age:</b> 3<br/><i>Monty‚Äôs Owner is Kitefin!</i><br/><b>Bio:</b> Monty is a little mixture of several breeds (4, and I bet you can‚Äôt guess them all!), he is somehow super energetic and also the laziest dog I have ever met. He‚Äôd happily spend all day in bed if he could and actually runs away from me when I pick up his lead to take him out, but at the same time goes absolutely nuts for fetch and any kind of ball game. For a little while as well he did doggy agility and was not too bad at it despite his little legs. He refused to really do any of it until the day I bought cheese with me as a reward and then he decided he actually did know how to do it and was just being stubborn. Go figure.<br/><b>Fun Fact:</b> One of the naming choices for your Cyber-Mastiff is after Monty.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>Scooby</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/0d66e01021c425b1d4fdaef2986b9785e96d0963.jpg"/><b>Name: </b>Scooby (Scoobster/Scoobert/Bubek)<br/><b>Age: </b>7<br/><b>Bio: </b>Scooby is a mini Jack Russell that thinks he‚Äôs the star of his own cartoon. Anxiety? Absolutely. Goofy snack gremlin? Also yes. Training him to roll over was like teaching a goldfish to ride a bike. But once he got it, he started rolling for funsies and now assumes every spin deserves a treat. Classic Scooby logic. His hobbies include cuddling, snacking, and being everyone‚Äôs emotional support goofball.<br/><b>Fun Fact/Bonus talent: </b>Professional mushroom detective. Mushroom pickers have nothing on Scooby.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>Bobby</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/d902981f1ad53bb08ea884fb7f1229d2b1c151e4.png"/><b>Name: </b>Bobby<br/><b>Age: </b>2<br/><b>Bio: </b>Bobby is a British Shorthair with the relatively rare lilac ticked coat variation. His personality is truly special‚Äîhe‚Äôs almost like a little person. He follows me everywhere I go in the apartment, waits outside the bathroom for me, and, best of all, he absolutely loves playing hide-and-seek.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Every evening, I hide behind the bed and wait for him to jump out and ‚Äòscare‚Äô me. When he does, he lets out a proud little meow, his eyes sparkling with excitement, and then he dashes off to hide so I can find him.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Bobby has two favorite positions he loves to sit or lie in. Often, we‚Äôll find him lying on his back with his belly up, which is his unique way of asking for attention. He also likes to sit upright like a little squirrel, with his front paws resting in front of him.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">One of Bobby‚Äôs favorite treats is boiled egg yolk‚Äîhe usually pushes the egg white aside. His favorite time of day is when he gets to lie in the sun on the balcony.<br/><b>Fun Fact:</b> He has an Instagram account: @mr_bobby_thecat.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>Dexter</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/ba152b9b486c26c097383012ecebf84183aebc2b.jpg"/><b>Name: </b>Dexter aka Fatboy or Lupu<br/><b>Age: </b>7<br/><i>Dexter‚Äôs owner is Lev!</i><br/><b>Bio: </b>Dexter is a swish tuxedo gentleman. He was rescued at 3 years old from a hoarder‚Äôs home having been neglected, and has an amusing habit of licking plastic, likely due to these earlier years. I was actually catfished by Dexter, as his adoption photo was very outdated, and when I went to collect him he was a much chonkier boy!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">A classic cat - he lives for food, comfort and mischief. He‚Äôs incredibly affectionate (has no concept of personal space) loving cuddles and snoozing under a duvet. On the odd occasion that he isn‚Äôt being lazy, he‚Äôs pushing his luck with questionable parkour and zoomies.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Hands down the most vocal cat I‚Äôve ever encountered. He‚Äôll always remind you when it‚Äôs time for food, often 2 hours before for good measure.<br/><b>Fun Fact:</b> His favourite toy is his shark. Great taste!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>Duo Duo</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/f66a48fd6971ff8c149984a6db2e08dc7dc61b45.jpg"/><b>Name: </b>Duo Duo<br/><b>Age: </b>11<br/><b>Bio: </b>I picked this piggy up from the streets thinking I did him a favor. Now he just sunbathes and screams for shrimps. No dignity remains.<br/><b>Fun Fact: </b>He will only eat poached shrimps from a specific brand.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>Mochi &amp; Tai</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/4a42413e005862fc5dfdf281cef86c2d75e3b797.png"/><b>Names: </b>Mochi (Left) &amp; Tai (Right)<br/><b>Ages: </b>8 Months (They‚Äôre both rescues, Mochi was found when he was around 2 months old, Tai was found about a month later. From what we can tell they‚Äôre the same age but it‚Äôs hard to tell when you find them on the street.)<br/><i>Mochi &amp; Tai‚Äôs Owners are Quickpaw!</i><br/><b>Bio: </b>They‚Äôre SUPER close! While Tai was extremely scared of Mochi for the first couple of days, by the third day he realized he wasn‚Äôt aggressive and just wanted to play and they‚Äôve been best buds ever since, they bonded really well! They‚Äôre always playfighting together or cuddling and grooming each other.<br/><b>Fun Facts: </b>Mochi is a climber, while Tai is a jumper.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>Reymond</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/33836af815b475085ea6662ae1ba840f9b654ea3.jpg"/><br/><b>Name: </b>Reymond<br/><b>Age: </b>Around 5<br/><i>Reymond‚Äôs Owner is Catfish!</i><br/><b>Bio: </b>He was a foster cat of mine but fell in love with him and now he is staying! He was found in someone‚Äôs garden living off birdseed.<br/><b>Fun Fact: </b>He couldn‚Äôt meow when he first got to me, but now has learnt a very squeaky meow to communicate that he would like food.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">These are only a small handful of the amazing pets of Fatshark, we hope you enjoyed meeting them!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We know many of you are eager to see what‚Äôs coming next. We‚Äôll be sharing more about the upcoming update soon, so keep an eye out for our next blogs!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">‚Äì The Darktide Team</p>]]></description>

We've been seeing many reports about hit registration issues and rest assured, this is our top priority to fix.<br/><br/>We've also seen reports of "cheating" associated with the hit registration issue, but those people are not cheating, it's just something going on with the net code.<br/><br/>We have however seen a few reports of confirmed cheaters and we're already taking steps against them.<br/><br/>Apologies for the issues so far! We're just two days into launch now and with the game live and being consistently played by thousands of players, new issues are popping up that we hadn't seen before, we're doing our best to address them. <br/><br/>Thanks for your patience and support.]]></description>

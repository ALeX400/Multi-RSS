We have been investigating the disconnect issues that players have been facing and we believe that we have a solution to keep players from being kicked from the game. <br/><br/>Over the next hour, we will be terminating in-progress matches to roll out updated servers. You may be dropped back to the main menu while this fix rolls out. If this happens please restart the game and re-queue. <br/><br/>We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and thank you for your continued patience and support.]]></description>

You can easily add your voice to the games development by using our feedback and bug reporting system here: https://speedfreeks40k.featureupvote.com/<br/><br/><br/>We‚Äôve much planned during Early Access. After monitoring the first fully public forays into Speed Freeks, we will finalize and and share our Roadmap with you.  <br/><br/>We hope you will come along and enjoy the ride with us. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/7a2d5deb45f38fff9959e0e8f132fc4362b507e7.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/f0468d2c6e34fa040bb1a0643136d23ab628e3d2.png"/><br/><br/><b>Why do we have to sign up for an account?</b><br/><br/>Two things, mainly.  We would like to gather telemetry to improve the game, plus contact the community via email through our newsletter. Sharing telemetry data and signing up for the newsletter are both optional, but we need the Speed Freeks account system to ask people if they want to opt in.  <br/><br/>The <b>optional telemetry </b> is getting anonymous user data that helps us diagnose bugs and other issues, as well as gameplay info that will help us balance and improve the game overall.  Having this data also allows us to show you more detailed stats for things like vehicle ability usage, which will be shown in your Speed Freeks account.  <br/><br/>The <b>optional newsletter </b> is valuable for pinging players about new stuff added to the game.  As a free to play live service title, it‚Äôs important to be able to inform active and inactive players about updates and new content.  For example, there were thousands of players that accessed the Alpha test last year that we couldn't directly invite back to the Beta because the Speed Freeks account wasn‚Äôt implemented at that time.  The newsletter can also send the more dedicated players guides, community content, stats overviews and other info that would interest them.  Again, this is optional.  <br/><br/>We understand that some gamers are tired of making accounts, we get it.  But collecting anonymous user data allows us to improve the game, and the ability to get in touch with players directly impacts the number of users that will be playing it.  Free to play games have always survived with the assistance of user accounts, and we're asking you to make one so that it helps create a better, free experience that you guys can possibly enjoy for years.  <br/><br/>The Speed Freeks account takes a few minutes to create, but we hope that you‚Äôll take that time to quickly sign up and try our game.   <br/><br/>Click here to read the Terms of Service and Use. <br/> <br/>Click here to find Privacy Policy and Data Collection details.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/9b066a8320e3935e8dffce91368395c1e90945ca.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a9c04148e5c2b05df99b1ea46c5b553e77574520.png"/><br/><br/><b>The game is in Early Access and the current launch version has the following known issues:</b><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">CRITICAL</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> When respawning in a match, <b>you may lose your vehicle kit customization</b>, with the game reverting to the default kit.  We're working quickly to fix this issue</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">GENERAL</div> <ul class="bb_ul"><li> The PLAY GAME button in the main menu may be greyed out for a short amount of time while the game connects to the backend. If it does not become available, restart the game <br/></li><li> The left mouse button can sometimes stop working and the player is unable to shoot for a brief time.  This happens rarely, and only to some users. <br/></li><li> Sometimes explosion VFX and burnt chassis will not spawn when a vehicle explodes, but this happens infrequently <br/></li><li> If you are experiencing very high mouse sensitivity issues, please go to the settings and set sensitivity to the lowest value. <br/></li><li> After getting destroyed, the player may not be able to click anything in the respawn screen and will need to quit to the menu. But this issue is rare. <br/></li><li> If joining a game as a party, you may occasionally get put onto opposing teams <br/></li><li> There is an issue with some vehicle textures looking messed up using certain kits <br/></li><li> In Kill Konvoy the Stompas may desync somewhat, so you may see them teleport back and forth, but this is rare <br/></li><li> Ork animations in the MVP/Player Recap screens might appear broken, but rarely <br/></li><li> AFK kicking engages at 1 minute and does not warn the player before throwing them back to the main menu <br/></li><li> If you are having issues successfully shooting other players, check your ping on the scoreboard.  If it is over 100, then you are likely playing on a server outside of your region <br/></li><li> Gamepad auto aim assist is not implemented yet, so we recommend using mouse and keyboard. There is very little aim assist for gamepad aiming  <br/></li><li> There is no form of team balancing yet, but the teams are shuffled after every match <br/></li><li> Players may spawn with ‚Äústuck‚Äù inputs for driving or firing a weapon. Just press these inputs again to fix it <br/></li><li> Unlocking vehicles mid-game can cause them to be not usable until next match. Instead the player will get the next vehicle in the grid if selecting the newly unlocked vehicle <br/></li><li> If you are kicked back to the menu from a loading screen, please click PLAY GAME -&gt; FIND GAME again <br/></li><li> The low health screen effect may persist even when the player‚Äôs health is replenished. This should fix itself after next death</li></ul> <div class="bb_h3">GRAPHICS </div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> There is currently no automatic graphic settings based on hardware. There are no presets for LOW/MED/HIGH/EPIC yet either <br/></li><li> Sometimes textures may not load fully, causing them to look blurry. They should fix themselves after a while but if they do not, please go into the settings menu and set texture quality to a lower value <br/></li><li> When setting Anti-Aliasing to none, this can also negatively affect how the krumped kam and end of match sequence looks <br/></li><li> Resolutions under 1280x720 are not fully supported </li></ul><div class="bb_h3">VEHICLES </div><div class="bb_h3">Boomdakka Snazzwagon </div> <ul class="bb_ul"><li> The smoke left over from Billowing Smoke may disappear and reappear again if the user gets killed </li></ul> <div class="bb_h3">Deffkilla Wartrike </div> <ul class="bb_ul"><li> The Wartrike‚Äôs grapple line can sometimes clip through world geometry after attaching to a victim. This is unavoidable for the time being <br/></li><li> The Wartrike can sometimes spin when driving diagonally on certain slopes </li></ul> <div class="bb_h3">Grot Mega Tank </div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The crosshair is sometimes transparent when it shouldn‚Äôt be. Transparent crosshair indicates that the current aiming direction is outside of range </li></ul> <div class="bb_h3">Looted Wagon </div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The Grot Bomm sometimes may not appear to do damage, but this is a rare occurrence. This could be attributed to latency issues between players, but is potentially a bug where damage does not get applied </li></ul> <div class="bb_h3">Shokkjump Dragsta </div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The Dragsta can sometimes spin when driving diagonally on certain slopes </li></ul> <div class="bb_h3">NETWORKING </div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Depending on ping, hit detection on a player‚Äôs machine may be different than that seen on the server <br/></li><li> On rare occasion, a match may not be full, with one team missing a player <br/></li><li> If matchmaking doesn‚Äôt work, please try again a few minutes later </li></ul> <div class="bb_h3">CUSTOMIZATION </div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> When respawning in a match, <b>you may lose your vehicle kit customization</b>, with the game reverting to the default kit.  We're working quickly to fix this issue<br/></li><li> The Presets system is still WIP, but should work most of the time <br/></li><li> Customizations for vehicles may sometimes be reverted to defaults while playing ingame, but then look properly assigned when returning to the main menu <br/></li><li> Some colour swatch slots at the top of the paints grid may not be assigned to anything, or look empty at first <br/></li><li> Some vehicles such as the Squigbuggy, do not have enough colour customization slots and therefore a small section of them may not be customizable<br/></li><li> Item rewards from the Open Beta currently may not show up in game, despite the player having achieved them.  We are working on this and will make sure all Beta rewards are assigned to players who earned them.</li></ul> <br/><div class="bb_h3">PARTY SYSTEM </div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Leaving a game while in a party will force you to leave that party <br/></li><li> Players need to leave their current party before accepting an invite to a new one <br/></li><li> If a party host has already entered a match with their limited party before someone has accepted a party invite, that person accepting the party invite will not join the match the party is already in.

<img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/39760201/1b7e1f2b75505d5fac1fab6e42aab8bef98257c5.png"/><br/><br/>Hey folks,<br/><br/>Our QA teams are currently hard at work doing their final testing for Hotfix 6.0.2, and it‚Äôs our aim to publish this update this Friday, 20th December, so that we can get these changes out to you before we power down for the Holidays. This hotfix brings with it a number of adjustments following on from last week's Update 6.0, including fixes to Ogre Camp and Vampire Count stances, some improvements to one of Golgfag‚Äôs victory conditions and much more, as well as fixes for those known issues originally detailed in our message last week.<br/><br/>Whilst we‚Äôre completing all our own final checks, if you‚Äôre a Steam user we‚Äôve given you the opportunity to download this hotfix right now as an opt-in Beta branch, allowing you to take an early look at what we‚Äôre changing, and press on with your campaigns. Instructions on how to do this can be found at the bottom of this post.<br/><br/>If all goes well, we‚Äôll release this Hotfix to all players on Friday, and anyone who opts into the Beta will be able to continue with any campaign progress they make in the meantime. If we need to change up our plans, we‚Äôll be loud across all our community channels with revised timing for the update.<br/><br/>Let‚Äôs dive straight into what‚Äôs included!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Hotfix 6.0.2 Release Notes</div><br/><div class="bb_h2">HIGHLIGHTS</div>‚Äã<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where, if the Ogre Camp ranks up, its stance reverts to Raiding stance.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where, if an Ogre Camp recruits units from within itself, it drops out of Encamp stance and switches to Raiding stance.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Vampire Counts were missing the ambush stance.<br/></li><li> Added Lightning Strike to Skarsnik's 'Ready &amp;

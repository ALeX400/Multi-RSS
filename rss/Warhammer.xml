      <title>Improving AI in Campaign - Part 2</title>

<img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/39760201/bcdccc31dce1c9277de102a15a62e7e283534c91.png"/><br/><br/>Hey folks,<br/><br/>The time has come for us to talk a little more about Campaign AI, what we‚Äôve been working on in the wake of the first Beta, and how we‚Äôve used your feedback to help steer this big oft-unwieldy ship in the right direction.<br/><br/>We‚Äôre pleased to reveal that tomorrow (Thursday 10th April) we‚Äôll be launching our next Campaign AI Beta on Steam, once again giving you the chance to test out our next stage of tweaks and adjustments and provide us with your immensely valuable feedback. If you took part in our last Beta, we‚Äôd love to get your thoughts on this latest round of changes, and if you missed out last time, this is the perfect chance to see what we‚Äôve been working on and have your voice heard. You‚Äôll find instructions on how to access the Beta at the bottom if this blog when it goes live tomorrow, so check back when you see us confirm it‚Äôs live.<br/><br/>As ever, you‚Äôll be able to discuss these changes and provide feedback in our dedicated Campaign AI Beta forum in the CA Community, as well as via a survey that we‚Äôll be running alongside the Beta. These links will appear here tomorrow, and you‚Äôll also find a link to the survey in-game, on the News Feed when you‚Äôre playing the Beta itself.<br/><br/>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of what Rado and the team have been up to, we‚Äôd also like to share that this project will henceforth be inducted into our rekindled Proving Grounds initiative. Some of you may recall this initiative from the WH2 days, but for those who don‚Äôt, let me give you a brief introduction to what the Proving Grounds are:<br/><br/>The Proving Grounds first debuted back in 2020 and gave our devs the opportunity to explore radical solutions and test systemic changes to core gameplay features, while giving you the opportunity to try out these changes and provide feedback on them.<br/><br/>Of course, there‚Äôs no guarantee that these tested changes make it into the main game, but it allows our devs to think outside the box a little and allows you to have your voices heard on what can be some pretty sweeping changes to core parts of the game.<br/><br/>Basically, it‚Äôs a chance for us all to work together on improving WH3 for the greater good. The Greater Good.<br/><br/>With this current phase of Proving Grounds, we're quietly confident that these Campaign AI changes are moving in the right direction. These new changes we're now testing for will help to show us what further refinements we need to make before we consider bringing them into the main game, and how that might impact the difficulty of our player experience.<br/><br/>Looking beyond this Proving Ground, we have a team internally starting to explore changes that we think we can make to Sieges, and are hoping to bring you more on that in the summer.<br/><br/>With that admin out of the way, it‚Äôs once again time to hand over to the almighty Radoslav. Be sure to check back tomorrow for all the details on how to access this new Campaign AI Beta!<br/><br/>‚Äî Steve Coleman // Senior Community Manager // Apprentice (Proving-)Groundskeeper<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">üëâ READ THE FULL BLOG üëà</div><br/><br/>‚Äî The <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

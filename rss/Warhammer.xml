<p class="bb_paragraph">This free update adds a <b>new arena, new buff families and new Memory Echoes</b> to Mortis Trials, Darktide’s roguelike and wave-based mode. The update also brings a <b>new weapon family, two new weapon marks, a new enemy, talent tree updates, a time-limited Special Event,</b> and more!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Bound By Duty will be available for free to all Darktide players across all platforms on September 23, 2025.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Mortis Trials arena, Theatre of Rectitude</b>: Re-enter the visions summoned by the ship’s Psyker, Sefoni, in an all-new arena inspired by the Clandestium Gloriana mission and its frozen Adeptus Mechanicus Foundryplex.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Two new Indulgences archetypes: </b>offering additional buffs expanding the breadth of combat styles within Mortis Trials.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Emperor Favored:</b> Grants increase to critical chance and critical damage, plus effects that trigger on critical hits. These buffs stack: early gains may seem modest, but they compound to support powerful crit-focused builds later in a run.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Goliath:</b> Centers on mobility and resilience rather than damage reduction: immunity to Suppression and Stagger, stamina boosts, and crowd-control options. One notable buff staggers enemies when you sprint, letting you plow through hordes even when cornered.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Memory Echoes:</b> Several new chapters that expand NPC backstories and reveal more of the Mourningstar’s past through Sefoni’s visions between waves.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Enemy, Scab Plasma Gunner</b>: A dangerous new Specialist enemy joins Darktide’s roster. The Scab Plasma Gunner wields a powerful plasma weapon, forcing players to adapt their tactics and brace for intense, high-damage attacks. Expect to feel the heat in any mission where this adversary appears.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Veteran weapon, the Power Falchion: </b>A single-edged, one‑handed power weapon that plays as a counterpart to the Power Sword. Its Special action works like the Zealot’s Relic Blade: activating the Special action empowers the Falchion until its heat bar fills, at which point it overheats and the Special is locked until the bar empties. This weapon family comes with two marks.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Bolt Pistol and Boltgun marks: </b>Bolt Pistol Mk VI Godwyn‑Branx and Boltgun Mk III Locke. Both marks emphasize explosive effects: larger explosions and significantly more explosive damage on hit or kill compared with other marks in their families.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Talent Reworks and Class balances:</b> increased flexibility and player agency around the Veteran, Zealot and Psyker trees by providing a more open layout. The overarching goal was to bring better balance, more build diversity, and more meaningful choices across all classes. The Ogryn and Arbites talents also got a light touch-up!</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Special Event, Smuggled Munitions:</b> Forces of the Traitorous 6th have raided local plasma weapon caches. Players will have to out these dangerous squads and dispatch them. A flashlight will not go amiss as this event will always be attached to low visibility conditions such as Ventilation Purge, Lights Out or Power Supply Interruption. </p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Havoc Modifier, Contaminated Stimms:</b> Darktide’s endgame mode will have a new modifier joining the existing roster. Face challenging tides of enemies using stimms to reinforce themselves. In addition, the previously run Special event Rotten Armor will return once again as a modifier for Havoc.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Quality of Life changes:</b> a few improvements will be coming to Darktide, including a dodge counter, a new on-screen indicator showing remaining dodges. This is to ensure players always know when they can evade and when they’re out of effective dodges. Players will also be able to replay missions from the Battle for Tertium campaign. </p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h1">Twitch Drops</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/ad2e4a9698f2d4e6a772e73bf56f8cfe97e89ea1.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Earn the Protector of Tertium cosmetics by watching eligible Twitch streams!

<div class="bb_h2"><b>​Hello Space Marines,</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">A new hotfix is now live on every platform. It fixes critical issues such as the Assault’s Ascension perk dealing friendly-fire damage, Stratagems having more Battlefield Conditions than listed and more. Also, the Sniper’s Camo Cloak activation cost change (which was initially planned for 11.0) has also been pushed on this update. Read the complete patch notes below:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>PATCH NOTES</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKS</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Heroic Chainsword:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Rebalanced base stats.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Reworked its perk: Light-&gt;Heavy-&gt;Heavy combo now ends with a Stomp attack.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">All Heavy attacks damage increased by 15%.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Stratagems:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an issue where Daily Stratagems could have more Battlefield Conditions than listed.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Camo Cloak's activation cost:</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The activation cost of the Sniper ability has been changed. Now it works this way: </p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">The first three uses of Camo Cloak in a row do not take away energy by themselves (the ability consumes energy, as before). The fourth activation takes away 5% of energy instantly, each subsequent one takes away a little more. After the last use, there is a 10-second timer, after which the activation cost again becomes zero.</p></li></ul><blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>With the right perk set up, you can still do 5-6 cloak cancels in a row. Cloak cancel will still be very rewarding to learn and to do, but you won't be able to abuse it endlessly while staying invisible and invulnerable to enemies.</i></p></blockquote><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Spawn Director:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">The number of Chaos Spawns in packs is slightly reduced and now matches Tyranid Warriors.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>GENERAL FIXES</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed damage for the Power Backstep attack when the Power Wave perk is selected for Power Axe.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Improved flame weapons VFX visibility for allies.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an issue that prevented bots from entering elevators in Exfiltration operation.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed perks dealing friendly fire damage.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed PvP connectivity issues.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Minor localization fixes.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Minor UI fixes.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">ESRB update pop-up: A pop-up will appear on the main menu to inform you of an update of the ESRB rating. This pop-up will only appear once. </p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Please note that this update of our rating is just here to properly reflect what was already in-game for several months. There has been no change to our monetization system, and no changes are planned.</i></p></li></ul></li></ul>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h3"><b>ORKTOBER IS COMIN'!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">"Wotz da big guff, ya git?"  </p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Orktober</b> is when we start dropping details about our <i>massive</i> update coming for <b>Warhammer Day</b> in late October<b>🤘</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Stuff like:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Creation Tools</b> for building levels/races, plus online workshop support to share them</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New <b>Vehicle</b> (revealed in Oct)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New <b>Maps</b> for all modes</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New <b>WAAAGH! Path</b> with some very cool unlocks</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">+ More</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">This will probably be the game's biggest update yet, and will mark a time where Speed Freeks is the bestest, most greenest, most Orkiest game that ever Orked - and will be the best version so far.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We're really excited to get it into your hands, and not just saying that as a standard PR thing, we <i>really</i> want to see what people do with the Creation Tools. There's already some pretty wild community made Kustom Rally races out there and we've only had a handful of people engage with it.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Once you'z get the <i>real</i> tools, it will open up a wealth of possibilities. Like we mentioned last time, this is the first Warhammer game ever to have level building tools like this.

Plus, this gives all players the chance to get their name up high on the boards now ːsteamthumbsupː</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We wanted to do this work a while ago, but it needed to sync up with some backend data stuff that has just been finished (multiplayer games be hard, y'all), so now that it's done we can have lasting leaderboards.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">if you still notice issues though, please mention to us and we'll get onto addressing them</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h1">Heroes and Pactsworn!</div> <br/>Welcome to the <b>last</b> out of five weekends of the Versus Spotlight events. Every week, we‚Äôll take a closer look at one of the Ubersreik 5 and one of the Pactsworn Specials.

This week's spotlight will be on the hearty <b>Bardin</b> and the nasty <b>Warpfire Thrower!</b><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Previous Spotlight's Rewards</div>As said in the the previous post, we changed the end date for the event from Sunday to Wednesday, which was more than enough to reach and beat the new ambitious target of 250K kills!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/416bf23cd4e304f304252b63875723aac82853f0.png"/><br/>The rewards for the previous spotlight were delivered yesterday, so check your inventory!

Now just the final stretch!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">This Week's Rewards</div>There are unique rewards to unlock weekly, all earned by the community as a whole through completion of the Kill-Counter.

Since the launch in August, da Mek Boyz have nabbed and utilized your feedback to make a ton of fixes and quality of life improvements, plus changes to game modes, maps and vehicles.  This has led to a really solid foundation for the game, and it‚Äôs been truly humbling to see all of your positive comments and hear about all the fun players are having.<br/><br/>This week Early Access Update #4 landed which continues to grow and evolve the game into something we hope you‚Äôll enjoy coming back to for a long time. This patch greatly improves Deff Rally mode, adding more racing and dynamic combat encounters, plus adds alternate weapons/abilities for some vehicles as a limited time mode, creating armament variety for each class.  It also brings the usual improvements we‚Äôve been doing since launch in terms of bug fixes and quality of life stuff for the game. If you‚Äôve not grabbed it yet, get on it!<br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/302045a8e552b15b6f7bdba12f6cc56723b6a4b5.png"/><br/>We want your feedback!<br/><br/>Closing out the end of 2024 and looking to the future, we want to hear from our valued community as we continue to roar through the grimdark wasteland together. This new survey will help us better understand what is important to you gits, with the results directly influencing our ongoing development of the game. So please give it a shot below!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/dffc9865e78ec717e30a35320c40c6a47c727808.png"/><div class="bb_h2"><b>Click for Feedback Survey</b></div><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/87acda9033493108f66ab7c96205a970c7120a29.png"/><br/>In terms of the next update, rest assured that we are hard at work developing new features and improvements, including a more traditional Combat Racing game mode prototype -  which we want to get into your hands to start playing as soon as possible. As usual, we‚Äôre going to develop this feature alongside your feedback, and especially in this case, where it will become a permanent mode for the game in the future.<br/><br/>Further on from that next patch, we‚Äôre speeding towards the full launch of this game out of early access and into version 1.0.  We‚Äôve got some really exciting things coming with that version and will be sharing some info about it in the new year. We can‚Äôt say much yet, but there will be a lot to look forward to in 2025 and beyond, so keep yer enginez burnin‚Äô n‚Äô yer dakka ready! <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/995ffe8e717de04ab7a9f557c54780e617c1da15.png"/><br/><br/>Our ultimate goal is to make Speed Freeks one of the greatest combat racing games of all time, and as we solidify the base game towards it‚Äôs full release, we‚Äôre confident it will be a rich and rewarding experience for Warhammer 40,000 Ork fans and general vehicular combat fans alike. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/bff6e97958bf7cec3025c8f54db27b7e22dbc4ee.png"/><br/>Before we forget, here‚Äôs a bit of a sneak peek showing a new map coming your way next year called Da Dust Up! This map starts in an Ork fortress up on a big hill, then speeds down into the valley for some intense racin‚Äô and fightin‚Äô.  We‚Äôll drop more info about this map and others as we get closer to their release.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/45e28095664ec8f8352612f4ff3fe3b58e7e3b76.png"/><br/>Finally, a proppa big thanks again to all you‚Äôz gits for being a part of this important development period called Early Access. You‚Äôve had, and will continue to have, a substantial impact on the game as a whole. As much as it can be difficult to have the game live during this time, we are truly thankful to have you on this journey with us and encourage you to keep helping us through this fun and experimental phase of game development. <br/><br/>It really motivates us to have such dedicated and crazed fans of the game already and also gives us confidence of where this game can go in the future.<br/><br/>As always, feel free to drop your feedback and suggestions in the comments or the usual social spaces linked below. If there‚Äôs anything you think really needs fixing or improving, or if you have a feature suggestion that you think will have a big impact on the game, we‚Äôre happy to hear about it. <br/>On behalf of Caged Element and PLAION, we‚Äôz shoutin‚Äô a big WAAAGH!

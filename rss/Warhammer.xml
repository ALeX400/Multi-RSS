This was caused by the game subtracting the previous tribute from the income without resetting the tribute value, leading to repeated incorrect deductions. We missed this specific issue initially, but we believe this updated solution resolves all related problems.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue with the 'Continue Campaign' button in Launcher not continuing the campaign, and instead redirecting to the main game screen.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when players overcast a spell while commanding a unit with multiple shot types in battle. This issue was identified and resolved thanks to detailed reports from our community forums!<br/></li><li> Fixed the following abilities not affecting units that were not nearby when the battle began:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Rune of Stoicism<br/></li><li> Ancestor Rune<br/></li><li> Rune of Courage<br/></li><li> Spirit Conduit (Hierotitan)</li></ul></li><li> Fixed an issue when the general was removed from the military force, the unit would become a colonel and be treated by the UI like a hero rather than a normal unit.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where river crossing battle maps would not trigger when fighting on river crossings or alongside rivers on the Immortal Empires campaign map.<br/></li><li> Fixed rendering issues with Pistoliers unit which would result the rider model not being visible.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where playing custom battles as Daemons of Chaos, using the Shadow Legion colour scheme, the army abilities would be missing.<br/></li><li> Fixed plate armor opacity issues with several Empire units.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug when moving Thorek on Anvil mount in campaign, which would lead to his model tilting backwards during the move animation.<br/></li><li> Explosive ammunition for Hochland Long Rifles no longer reduces penetration value from 1 to 0.<br/></li><li> Tempest from the Lore of High Magic now matches its visual duration at 17 seconds for both regular and overcast.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Dark Elf buildings that reduce slave count only functioned correctly when constructed by the player. Captured settlements with pre-existing economic buildings did not reduce slave count until these buildings were upgraded or replaced. This fix ensures that the slave count reduction feature works as intended immediately upon acquiring such buildings.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash in multiplayer campaign games where completing the Changeling Cult building "Ravaging Host" in another player's settlement would cause the game to crash. This was due to a Lua error in the script that was meant to trigger a dilemma for the player upon discovering the cult.<br/></li><li> Fixed some instances of skills that penalise enemy hero success chance instead being granted to the enemy, making them penalise your success chance.<br/></li><li> Fixed issue where a placeholder icon would show on some Shadowy Dealing actions.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where a military force with plague was able to get infected and lost its ability to use the switching plagues mechanic.<br/></li><li> Fixing an audio issue with the Mechanical Steed mount which was not triggering surface appropriate footsteps.<br/></li><li> After a long tug-of-war with his rot beast, Kayzk has finally recovered his blade, which he now wields in all its disgusting glory.<br/></li><li> One player watching the Immortal Empires flyby will no longer block the other players' actions, sometimes causing desync.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the chance of a magic item dropping or being stolen was not being correctly modified by effects on Heroes embedded in the army.<br/></li><li> The Black Staff item's bound power of darkness now matches regular power of darkness.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> +0.3 winds per second.<br/></li><li> +does equivalent self damage.</li></ul></li><li> Added missing page-turning sound effects for Blue Scribes.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where armies would get replenished to 100% after being defeated and sacked. Now they will be replenished only by the desired amount of 25%.<br/></li><li> Added missing lava and portal sound effects to Bleeding Spire map.</li></ul><br/>Thanks for all of your bug reports and feedback, all of which have been extremely valuable in helping our teams investigate and resolve issues as quickly as possible!

      <title>Itemization Rework Q&amp;A Part 1 - Dev Blog</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361210/view/4369138365429916217</link>

<div class="bb_h1">Heyo Everyone, </div><br/>Earlier this month, we released an Introduction to Itemization dev blog. After sharing the first looks of Itemization, we got a lot of messages from players. We collected over 13 pages of feedback, questions and concerns. As promised, we're following up on them.<br/><br/>While we cannot answer all of those questions yet, as some things are still being decided and iterated upon, we wanted to answer a batch of them today. We will continue to share more answers as we move closer to release! We want to hear more of your feedback and opinions through this dialogue.<br/><br/><i>Note: All of the questions we’re answering in this are pulled directly from the comments on the Forums, Reddit and Discord. We kept the players’ wording instead of writing our own questions.</i><br/><br/>Before we dive in, we want to make it clear for those who might’ve missed prior communications: WE ARE BREAKING THE LOCKS WITH THIS REWORK. 🔓<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Questions From Players</div><div class="bb_h2">Blessings / Transferring Weapons to New Systems</div><b>Question</b><br/><i>When StrawHat said that players will begin with a headstart in the new system, does that mean that we won't have access to blessings we did previously and therefore forcing us to grind for the tiers all over again?</i><br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, the actual blessing sticker book will be translated to experience into Mastery. It does mean that you actually can even learn blessings you didn't before if wanted.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>What if I already have a perfect 550?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Already owned weapons won’t be touched, they’ll remain intact.<br/>(Note: We are doing some blessing tweaks and balances with this update to accommodate for the new system, so some numbers might change.)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Soooo... my old weapons don't just disappear right? Guys, it took me 500+ hours to get all the stuff I want through your RNG casino, so that would be more than just a little bummer. Will already unlocked weapons be converted 100%?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, they won’t disappear and they will stay 100% intact as they are. You will keep the entire arsenal of weapons that you have acquired previously. <br/>(Note: We are doing some blessing tweaks and balances with this update to accommodate for the new system, so some numbers might change.)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Mastery and Expertise Systems</div><b>Question</b><br/>How does Mastery XP work? Do you get more for higher difficulty missions? What if you fail a run?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The amount of Mastery XP is based on what difficulty the player plays. The higher the difficulty, the higher amount of XP is awarded. Experience gained will remain the same, no matter the weapon you use the most during a mission.<br/><br/>If you fail a run, you will be awarded a portion of the XP just as with normal Experience and Ordo Docket rewards.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Mastery is not tied to a specific weapon in your inventory. It has its own progress per weapon family that includes all marks, that unlocks blessings and perks for that weapon family. Do I have that right?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. Playing with any weapon (different marks) within a weapon family will progress that entire weapon family’s Mastery. Note: There can be several weapon families within the same school of weapons, such as Lasguns and Autoguns. They each have multiple weapon families, containing a number of Marks (e.g. Infantry Autoguns and Braced Autoguns).<br/>TL;DR - If you play with a Lasgun Family A Mark X, you will progress your Mastery into Lasgun Family A. So every other weapon mark in Family A will benefit from the Mastery progression into Mark X.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>There's no farming blessings at all anymore. You just directly unlock the ones you want with the Mastery points. At full Mastery you'll have all blessings at all levels unlocked. (Yes or no?)<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. As you gain Mastery with a Weapon Family you unlock blessing points (among other things); these points can then be freely used to unlock any blessing of your choosing: the more blessings you unlock, the more powerful versions of blessings you are able to unlock. When you have reached full Mastery with a weapon family you will have unlocked all the blessings available for that family. Moreover, in the new system, you’ll be able to freely swap out any blessings and perks on any weapon, at any level of Mastery, without them becoming locked after two changes.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>So every weapon we buy/earn has a random-ish stat cap, and our Mastery of that weapon’s family (so autoguns, shotguns, etc) lets us build that up via expertise?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. We are still working out the finer details of this system. But in essence, as you gain Mastery you will unlock more Expertise within that weapon family. You can then choose to invest into that weapon and increase the stats of the weapon while keeping the predetermined stat distribution the weapon was created with.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Miscellaneous Concerns</div><b>Question</b><br/>This system is the anti-choice system, it’s the system that forces you to grind every single weapon family before you can try a build.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The Mastery system is an addition to the existing crafting system that allows players to steadily unlock every Blessing for a weapon family, instead of relying exclusively on RNG to obtain them.<br/><br/>True, there will be some grind to fully unlock all the blessings at their most powerful tier for a weapon family. The system however lets you have full freedom in which blessings you unlock, and in what order, so being able to unlock a specific blessing for a build should be a manageable time investment. We are still experimenting with the exact time investment needed to fully unlock all blessings for a certain weapons family. We are also adding more tiers to most blessings, making previously higher tier blessings available at lower tiers.<br/><br/>Also, loot is still part of the system. The fact that we are still keeping the RNG loot system in place (Emperor's Gift, Sire Melk’s Requisitorium, The Armoury Exchange, and the ability to Consecrate weapons at Hadron’s Shrine with random upgrades, etc) will allow players to get to weapon builds that they have not unlocked in their Mastery before they actually get there. The loot system will be able to shortcut you to things that you have not yet unlocked.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>If the only way to upgrade a weapon is to use it, players won't want to try new weapons because of the marked drop in power they'll have to put up with for as long as it takes to grind out the upgrades.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Powerful weapons will still be distributed through stores/Emperor’s Gift. You can start with already high tier weapons to grind the Mastery, similar to what the game proposes at the moment. <br/><br/>Mastery will just open the toolbox to the player for them to experiment.<br/><br/>Mastery doesn't “gate” a person from acquiring a weapon with a given blessing, it only gates you from freely being able to add it to any weapon of your choosing. The loot system can still allow players to shortcut to a more powerful blessing before they unlock it in the Mastery.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Is ‘weapon potential’ a new stat? Is it tied to the base power level? If it is a new unrelated stat does that mean a 371 power weapon with a low weapon potential rating has less possible power increase than a say 342 power weapon that has a high weapon potential rating? Please give us examples with actual numbers to compare.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Weapon Potential just refers to the stats distribution. For any weapon in the game, they actually have the potential to be maxed out. Every weapon now has the potential to reach a 380 stats rating. Note that maxing out does not mean reaching 80% on each stat: every weapon is created with a pool of stat points that have been distributed in the different stat buckets, and every weapon has the same potential maximum number of stats that can be distributed.<br/><br/><i><b>DISCLAIMER: The following images are NOT representative of the final UI / work for Itemization. They are meant to illustrate the different potential stat distributions of a maxed out weapon (the darker grey number).</b></i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/ce41257bbaa4de519ee4ffdc42d173e498e50c1a.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/4ddbdc90645dbbc4ea47b994ad5fcaffbcfb80a5.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Weapon Sharing</div><b>Question</b><br/>Sorry if this has been asked, but with this itemization rework, will characters that can use the same weapon archetypes have a shared inventory to those weapons? So no more fancy lasgun that only my Psyker can enjoy, now my Veteran and Zealot can too? This has been one of my biggest gripes.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, it will remain as it is today, where any item is unique to the character that has it.<br/><br/>However, we can say that we’re opening up more weapon families to be shared between all classes. It's still case by case, but for example, shotguns will be available for all classes.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Given that blessings are currently shared across characters, it’d be a massive step back if progress was silo’d.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The Mastery / blessings unlocked are shared by account. However, any applied Expertise is at an item level and character level. <br/><br/>Essentially, if you have the Infantry Lasgun weapon family at 100% unlocked on Character 1, when you go to Character 2 and find a new Infantry Lasgun, you’ll have all the blessings unlocked on the new gun. But you’ll need to spend the materials to apply any Expertise changes on Character 2.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/>Alright, that answers the first batch of questions. We will answer more! If anything in this post is unclear, please let us know below. This will help us collect more feedback and ensure we answer them in our future posts. <br/><br/>Thank you!<br/>]]></description>

<br/><b>Settle down yo​oz ​lot, an’ get stuck in ta da details below!</b><br/><br/>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks will launch full speed into Early Access on the <b>6th of August 2024!</b> <br/> <br/>We can’t thank you enough for your relentless energy, feedback and support that has fueled the development of Speed Freeks. Our Open Beta was a thrill to watch unfold, and now we’re looking forward to sharing even more with you as we dash toward the game’s Early Access launch in the coming weeks.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c9b7c7e9cb981c9a982c8dfcde4d1298ff795965.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a4c7ffc59bc13f4a4bcde70f926f698df9868d67.png"/><br/><b>We’re often asked: will Speed Freeks be Free-to-Play?</b> <br/><br/><b>Yes!</b> Da mek boyz have confirmed that Speed Freeks will indeed be <b>Free to Play</b>, with plenty of snazzy loot to unlock for free. <br/><br/>For those who want to get extra snazzy, we have additional customization features that are entirely <b>optional</b> and most importantly, <b>not pay-to-win</b>.  We’ll share more details about this as we near release but rest assured, there will be plenty of Orky loot for everybody.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a5c40f3c0b0d12335a889b1d95d453073f60237b.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a899f79a5c50c73ac3fa32916c823eb08d4f4dbe.png"/><br/>Speed Freeks’ launch will mark its entry into Steam Early Access for a short period of time, allowing us to make some final adjustments ahead of the first full Speedwaagh, with a roadmap of content dropping later this year.  <br/> <br/>You can find answers to frequently asked Early Access questions below:<br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Why Early Access?</b></div>We've involved the Speed Freeks community in the game’s development since it began, releasing an open Alpha and open Beta along the way, plus have been testing the game extensively internally to make sure we’re on the right path – taking into account all the valuable feedback that has come our way from those public tests. <br/><br/>Early Access expands the game's player base and extends this method of community-collaborated feedback in a bigger way. We’ll use it to further refine and prioritize features, as well as our future roadmap. This is hugely helpful to our team in achieving its goal of releasing the most fun, balanced, stable and Orky version of Speed Freeks possible! <br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Approximately, how long will Speed Freeks be in Early Access? </b></div>We are aiming for an Early Access period of ​a ​few months while we continue to refine our first proppa Speedwaaagh! Which will be released later this year. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version? </b></div>Whilst a variety of cool content and enhancements will be added during Early Access, the full release of the game will bring a much more honed gameplay experience along with its significant content drop. This will include a new map, new vehicle, new features and enhancements to the game, as well as tweaks and additions based on the feedback we received from you along the way!  <br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Will my progress carry over from Early Access into the games full release?</b></div>Yes, all rewards and unlocks earned during Early access will stay with your account when the game moves into launch and season one.<br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>What is the current state of the Early Access version? </b></div>We were very proud to read so many comments saying that the Speed Freeks Alpha and Beta Tests were more stable than a lot of fully released games! There are certainly bugs left to squash, but the game is in a good state. Logging on and partying up with your friends to krump some gitz, while unlocking rewards is a fun and stable experience.<br/> <br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Will Speed Freeks be priced differently during and after Early Access? </b></div>Speed Freeks will continue to be a Free To Play game.  <br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process? </b></div>We'll use surveys to ask questions directly and gather general feedback and suggestions with our public feedback board and bug tracker: https://speedfreeks40k.featureupvote.com/<br/><br/><br/>During the Alpha and Beta, you provided a ton of feedback which has directly influenced the direction of our development.  And as always, let us know in the comments below if you have anything to say about what we’re sharing with you today, too!   <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/1302d44b9ac8c676a459653879f1e6d845443095.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/f0468d2c6e34fa040bb1a0643136d23ab628e3d2.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Why do we have to sign up for an account?</b></div>Two things, mainly.  We'd like to gather telemetry to improve the game, plus contact the community via email through our newsletter. <b>Sharing telemetry data and signing up for the newsletter are both optional,</b> but we need the Speed Freeks account system to ask people if they want to opt in. <br/><br/>The <b>optional</b> telemetry is getting anonymous user data that helps us diagnose bugs and other issues, as well as gameplay info that will help us balance and improve the game overall.  Having this data also allows us to show you more detailed stats for things like vehicle ability usage, which will be shown in your Speed Freeks account. <br/><br/>The <b>optional</b> newsletter is valuable for pinging players about new stuff added to the game.  As a free to play live service title, it’s important to be able to inform active and inactive players about updates and new content.  For example, there were thousands of players that accessed the Alpha test last year that we couldn't directly invite back to the Beta because the Speed Freeks account wasn’t implemented at that time.  The newsletter can also send the more dedicated players guides, community content, stats overviews and other info that would interest them.  Again, this is optional. <br/><br/>We understand that some gamers are tired of making accounts, we get it.

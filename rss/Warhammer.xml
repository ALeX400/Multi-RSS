OI LADZ, WE‚ÄôZ BACK!<br/><br/>Hey all you freeks that love speed, here‚Äôs the big news we were talking about‚Ä¶<br/><br/>SPEED FREEKS is leaving early access and <b>launching version 1.0 next week on May 22nd</b>, the same day of the <b>Warhammer SKULLS</b> showcase.<br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/845eabe737acbb6705f39c2d0e3c2ae015a32278.png"/><br/><br/><br/>This 1.0 launch signifies a few major things, one being that we‚Äôve got a new publisher, <b>Wired Productions</b>.  Why does this matter to you?  Well, with this publishing switch-up comes big changes to the way the game currently works, meaning <b>it‚Äôs no longer Free-to-Play</b> (which had most of its content behind a paywall), and instead is <b>now a low-priced game</b> that comes with the majority of its content included.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>An important note for those of you who played the early access version of the game: you will be getting the launch version for <b>free</b>!  It‚Äôs already in your library and will update to 1.0 on May 22nd.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e0db447dc486730af2bd5402e608ced9bea38b7e.png"/><br/><br/>Us moving away from F2P also means that we can do things like:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Have <b>player-hosted matches</b> with custom settings, including creating bots-only games if desired<br/></li><li>Have <b>private games</b> functionality<br/></li><li>Add a <b>new Free-Roam mode</b> to explore any map and create <b>custom races</b> - an awesome feature that helps illustrate how much more agency players have over the game<br/></li><li><b>Remove the 3rd party PROS account</b> that was previously mandatory</li></ul>Plenty more things to reveal, including <b>new content</b> as well, but you'll have to wait until launch day!<br/><br/>Now, to finalize the conversion of moving the game away from F2P, we‚Äôll need to take it offline for a couple days, so <b>SPEED FREEKS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO PLAY from Tuesday May 20th until Thursday the 22nd, when the game launches version 1.0</b>. We apologize for the inconvenience, but this is a necessary step towards launching with the new changes.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/98bc62a0a96ba422c4e7d22cdb2b4f90f0b6fdab.png"/><br/>In the meantime, we hope you have a wonderful weekend, and we‚Äôll say that we‚Äôre very excited to see how everyone likes the revamped and improved full launch of Speed Freeks!<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks will be available May 22nd at a <b>special discounted price of just $15.99, 15.99‚Ç¨ and ¬£12.99</b>.<br/><br/>Prepare to GET STUCK IN!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/45e28095664ec8f8352612f4ff3fe3b58e7e3b76.png"/>]]></description>

OI LADZ!  Quick one here...<br/><br/>We needed to drop a heads up about some <i><b>very</b></i> exciting SPEED FREEKS news we'll be sharing tomorrow, May 16th!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as a byproduct of the exciting changes, the game is going to be unavailable to download for new players for a period of time while we re-tool some things on the backend. Existing players will be unable to connect to matchmaking and play during this period.<br/><br/>This downtime was something we expected to occur tomorrow afternoon, but ended up taking effect 12 hours earlier than anticipated - so we apologize for the inconvenience. But we expect that our players will be quite happy with what we are going to reveal once we do.<br/><br/>We'll share additional information ASAP as to when players can can get back to racin' n' krumpin', plus drop the exciting news about the future of the Speed Freeks tomorrow.  We're eager to share...<br/><br/>SEE YOU'Z THEN!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/a9ddc031a54d7d0169b5555691b580f941f20bd9.png"/>]]></description>

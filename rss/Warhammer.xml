We've done some work on this so hopefully it's better, but these are the types of deep crashes that are hard to reproduce and diagnose.  We'll continue to work on it<br/>Note: try to run as few things in the background when playing the game as possible</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Game browser can sometimes - but rarely - show nothing, or a loading icon<br/>Please just restart the game if this happens, and try not to refresh the game browser constantly or it will bug out</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>There's an issue with servers using the same name and it confusing the game,</li></ul><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/995ffe8e717de04ab7a9f557c54780e617c1da15.png"/><div class="bb_h3">What's coming soon‚ùì</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Improvements to team balancing and team switching,<br/></li><li>Improvements to hit reg üôè<br/></li><li>Vehicle balance improvements<br/></li><li>General improvements and fixes<br/></li><li>Warbands, which are like a clan/club feature.

This episode gives full focus to our next faction, Norsca, and its newest Legendary Lord: Sayl The Faithless.<br/><br/>Creative Director Todor Nikolov, Lead Designer Vasil Nikolov, and Art Director Stoyan Stoyanov sit down with myself, subbing in for KingGobbo who recently welcomed two baby Mangler Squigs to his family and will be spending some well-earned time off whilst we keep the wheels turning. Congratulations to the Colemans from all of us across Total War!<br/><br/>Watch this full episode of What‚Äôs Next right here on the Total War YouTube Channel üëáüëÄ<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>We were thrilled to reveal Sayl alongside our friends across gaming at yesterday's Skulls Showcase, which if you missed you can check it out here.<br/><br/>Unlike past Skulls events, this year we haven‚Äôt released a free legendary lord as we‚Äôve shifted our priorities over the past year to introduce more free content through our game updates, but we didn‚Äôt want you to think we‚Äôd forgotten about you all the same. 6.2 is not too far beyond the horizon, bringing with it some new units:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Blood Knights (Sword &amp; Shield)<br/></li><li> Hobgoblin Bolt Throwa</li></ul>You‚Äôll find an early preview of additional content coming to 6.2 in this episode of What‚Äôs Next, and we‚Äôll be back in the next few weeks with more information about our next title update.<br/><br/>And What‚Äôs Next will return at the end of June with a look at our third and final faction for Tides of Torment. We‚Äôll have more behind the scenes looks to show and share with you in the mean-time, and until then, let us know what you‚Äôve loved hearing about today, we always enjoy reading through your feedback!<br/><br/>See you on the battlefields,<br/><br/>‚Äî Freeman // Head of Community<br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

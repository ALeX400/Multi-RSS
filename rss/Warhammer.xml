The fellow in question is the Shaman-Sorcerer chieftain of Norsca’s Dolgan tribe and, if you’ll pardon my Orkish, he’s an ABSOLUTE GIT!<br/><br/>Yep, Sayl the Faithless has earned his title many times over, but most notably through the grim events which propelled him to leadership. As one of seven sorcerous apprentices who acted as guides for the Dolgan tribe, Sayl manipulated his master, Schalkain the Vile, into conducting a daemonic ritual. When the incantations reached their crescendo, Sayl sabotaged the ritual, unleashing a wild gyre of Chaotic energies. Schalkain promptly popped like a meat-balloon, and Sayl’s fellow apprentices were mangled together to form the jabbering Chaos Spawn known as Nightmaw. It was quite the party, and Sayl literally made a friend for life.<br/><br/>But those who play with fire tend to get burned, and Sayl himself didn’t entirely dodge the fireworks. Mutated and struck blind by the surging effects of the botched ritual, Sayl was cursed forevermore to endure visions of the Realm of Chaos. And while most would find such an outcome somewhat distracting, not Sayl… his hunger for ever-greater power only grew to monstrous proportions. He immediately seized the reins of the Dolgan tribe who now follow him – more out of fear than favour - on his quest for arcane might.<br/><br/>Sayl’s campaign is one of ceaseless self-empowerment and the perfidious manipulation of others. It takes the best of Norscan gameplay, including many of the new mechanics we’ve engineered in the long-awaited Norsca overhaul which lands alongside Tides of Torment (more on this in our next blog!). In short, his campaign is a raidey, pillagey, rip-snorting tour-de-force which begins at Mountain’s End in the far north-east of the Immortal Empires map, and lets you expand where you will from there. You won’t make many friends along the way, but with Sayl’s gift for Machiavellian meddling, and Nightmaw at his beck-and-call, who needs ‘em?<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">👉 READ THE FULL BLOG HERE 👈</div><br/><br/>— The <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

We have just rolled out Hotfix 6.0.1, which addresses these issues:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Reverted various splash attack max target counts to match at least the minimum number of splash zones units have in metadata.<br/><br/><i>Dev note: In 6.0.0 we made a change to the maximum number of targets a splash attack can hit based on a weapon strength ratio, this change was originally intended to apply to single entity units only and inadvertently was applied to monstrous infantry, cavalry and infantry units. This caused a series of issues with how our splash attacks are calculated, we have reverted the changes to these units while maintaining the single entity splash attack changes. After this hotfix you will see monstrous infantry, cavalry and infantry return to their pre-patch 6.0.0 state. There is a chance this may still affect some units, so please do keep reporting any issues you come across so we can investigate further.</i><br/><br/></li><li> Added missing text strings from a small number of tooltips.<br/><br/><i>Dev note:  Whilst we're aware of other issues present in the game at the moment, currently set to be addressed in a further Hotfix releasing later this week, we had the opportunity to include this one as part of today‚Äôs fix, and isn't representative of our current prioritisation of certain issues.</i></li></ul><br/>By implementing these necessary changes today, it has also rolled out some additional battle balancing adjustments that we‚Äôve been working on. A full list of these changes will follow later today as an addition to our 6.0 Battle Balance Details thread, so please check back for the full details!<br/><br/>Although today's hotfix does not include any of the items originally disclosed in our known issues post, please rest assured that we will be back later this week with an additional hotfix to address those and more.<br/><br/>As always, thank you for your ongoing feedback and for your patience while we investigate and address these issues. If you encounter any new problems after updating to version 6.0.1, please let us know in our dedicated bug reporting sub-forum.<br/><br/>See you on the battlefield!<br/><br/>‚Äî The <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><hr/><hr/><div class="bb_h1">‚ö† IMPORTANT</div><hr/><hr/><br/>If you experience any issues after downloading the update, please take a moment to <b>Verify the integrity of the game files</b> first to ensure there were no issues when downloading.

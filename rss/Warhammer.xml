This can take some time depending on your hard drive speeds.<br/><br/>The full release of Hotfix 6.0.3 is currently aiming for this Friday, and when this happens your game will automatically switch to the main release.<br/><br/><b>Please note:</b> If you update to 6.0.3 early, you will only be able to play multiplayer with other players who are also opted in to the 6.0.3 Beta until the update rolls out to all players. You can switch back to 6.0.2 at any time by selecting ‚ÄòNone‚Äô in the Betas dropdown menu.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>‚ÄãThanks to everyone who‚Äôs shared their feedback with us since the launch of Omens of Destruction and Update 6.0. This will be our last game update before we power down for a couple of weeks to rest, recuperate and eat our body weight in mince pies. We‚Äôll be back in 2025, ready and raring to kick back into gear.<br/><br/>Happy Holidays!<br/><br/>‚ÄîThe <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

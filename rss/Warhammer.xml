We are happier with what we have right now compared to what we had on release, because before Patch 3 Chaos missions were unpopular. Still, we think that currently Operations mode is a bit too easy.<br/><br/>Overall these changes are going to make Operations mode harder, but it is difficult to measure by how much. We will continue to monitor those changes and will continue to adjust the balance of Operations mode. This is not the last change."</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/77d9a5a41619ea98270373892a36817546f0002e.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>PVP</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Increased delay between announcer messages in PvP.<br/></li><li> The starting animation of the Grapnel Launcher for the Vanguard is shorter in PvP.<br/></li><li> Fixed Power Fist in PvP dealing too much damage with short charged attacks.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"><b>AI</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Enemy Dodges: Globally replaced full invulnerability on dodge moves of enemies with heavy melee damage resistance.<br/></li><li> Rubric Marine with Boltgun: Disengage teleport max distance is slightly reduced.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"><b>CUSTOMISATION</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> More options for colours customisation for Chaos:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Tertiary colours: Sotek Green, Night Lords Blue, Death Guard Green, Khorne Red.</li></ul></li><li> Decal colours: Sotek Green, Khorne Red.<br/></li><li> Colours: Added Liberator Gold colour to default for primary and secondary colours palettes.<br/></li><li> Fixed a lot of issues with display of colours, now they should be more lore accurate (Mechanicus Standard Grey, Ushabti Bone, Phoenician Purple, The Fang, Iron Hands Steel, Retributor Armour).<br/></li><li> Decals: Added new Chaos faction decals for the right shoulder.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"><b>LEVELS</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Vox Liberatis - Daemonhost: Disabled respawn until the last altar in the final arena.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"><b>GENERAL FIXES</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where the Assault perk "Ascension" could kill its owner.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the Sniper perk "Targeted Shot" wasn‚Äôt always working in some cases.<br/></li><li> Fixed an unintended animation cancel with the Bulwark by using the block, which resulted in faster attacks.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue with the Tactical team perk "Close Targeting" not triggering properly.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue with the Tactical perk "Radiating Impact" not triggering properly.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue with the Sniper perk "Guardian Protocol" cooldown not working properly.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where sound was lost after switching the speaker configuration.<br/></li><li> Fixed several issues in Trials.<br/></li><li> Fixed several issues that were causing loss of saves.<br/></li><li> The Thunder Hammer perk "Patience Rewarded" description is now accurate with its actual effect (added "When your Health is below 30%‚Äù part).<br/></li><li> Lots of minor UI fixes and improvements.<br/></li><li> Lots of minor animation fixes and improvements.<br/></li><li> Localisation fixes.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"><b>TECH</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Crash fixes and general stability improvements.<br/></li><li> Fixed several connectivity issues causing disconnects for players.<br/></li><li> Slightly improved performance.<br/></li><li> Fixed issues controllers not working with Steam Input enabled.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"><b>RENDER IMPROVEMENTS</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> General improvements and fixes.</li></ul><br/>

Commissar Darinda Dukane has assumed command of the Moebian 53rd regiment - the famed Steelheads. These stalwart troops have been deployed to Tertium at the behest of the Planetary Governor, Lord Margrave, who is disturbed by the perceived lack of progress made by the Inquisition.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">But what is a Commissar of the Astra Militarum?</div>The Commissars of the Officio Prefectus are fearsome, iron-fisted authoritarians who keep the wheels of the Astra Militarum in motion. To the masses of Humanity, most of whom recognise the black greatcoat, peaked cap and polished boots of a Commissar from hab-block propaganda frescoes or grainy recruitment vids, these inflexible men and women are Imperial authority made manifest. Their amorphous remit is to ensure that all do their duty in the Emperor‚Äôs name, and the high rank and wide-ranging powers of these Departmento Munitorum agents give them leeway to enforce discipline at all levels. Should discipline and morale falter, should orders fail to be obeyed in anything less than exemplary and immediate fashion, it is these ruthless men and women in black who take whatever steps necessary to restore order ‚Äì<br/>no matter the cost.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">A Commanding Presence</div>Commissars rarely assume direct command of a regiment and the circumstances by which Commissar Dukane came to head up the 53rd remain shrouded in mystery - or are at least snarled up in the processes of the Imperium‚Äôs infamous bureaucracy. However, it is plain that she enjoys the full confidence of the sectors lord militant, and has swiftly moved to assume immediate control of the Atoman warzone, masterminding aggressive deployments by the 53rd and rallying the winnowed survivors of the Moebian 21st - until now, the only official Astra Militarum presence in Tertium.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Uneasy Allies</div>With initial drop zones secured, Dukane has taken station on the Mourningstar and even now casts a suspicious eye over Grendyl‚Äôs warband, whose motives and masters she clearly does not trust. Nonetheless, she is too practical not to recognise the necessity of allies and has assigned the finest drill sergeants of the 53rd to tutor the rejects in proper weapons drill. Expendable allies they might be, but every heretic the members of the warband eliminates is one less heretic to stand in her path.<br/><br/>But not everything is going Dukane‚Äôs way. Tertium‚Äôs insidious cult refuses to let this upstart newcomer foil their long-held plans. Even as the 53rd secures new ground the heretics prepare to strike a humbling blow, presenting Sergeant-Major Morrow with an opportunity to prove the warband‚Äôs worth‚Ä¶<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>]]></description>

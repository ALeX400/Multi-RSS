<div class="bb_h2">Greetings, Space Marines!</div><br/>We‚Äôre only 41 days away from the release of <i>Space Marine 2</i>; it‚Äôs the perfect time for our monthly Community Update!<i> (got it? 41 days? 41st Millenium?üòâüòâ)</i> We can sense the excitement growing as the release gets closer, and even more, since we announced that <br/><br/><b><div class="bb_h1"><i>SPACE MARINE 2</i> IS OFFICIALLY GOLD </div></b><br/>For those unfamiliar with the gaming industry, this means that the game has been approved by Microsoft and Sony and that we‚Äôve been given the green light for the production of our retail boxes. Though we‚Äôll continue to work on polish until the release, this essentially means that the game is ready.<br/><br/>This is a huge milestone for the teams and another major step towards the game‚Äôs full release on <b>September 9</b>, so we‚Äôre very proud to share the good news with you all.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/f2446b3f3ca06c5cdc594355c9f372f2319148cd.gif"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></div><br/>Over the past months, we‚Äôve seen many questions about the precise features of the game. We‚Äôll try to tackle a few here:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Do I need to have played <i>Space Marine 1</i> to go into <i>Space Marine 2</i>? <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Not at all! While there are returning characters, it's a fresh story that can be understood as its own without having played the first game.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Will the game be available on GeForce Now? <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Yes.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Will it be possible to pre-download the game before the release?<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> No.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Is there couch co-op?<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> No, co-op features will only be available online.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Does the game require to be ‚Äúalways online‚Äù to play?<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Offline mode is available for the campaign <br/></li><li> PVE can be played offline, but you won't have access to progression if you do not connect to the servers.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> How long does it take to complete the campaign?<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> On average, the campaign should take between 10 to 12 hours to complete. This can vary depending on the difficulty and your player profile.</li></ul></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> What are the PC specs?<br/> <ul class="bb_ul"><li> At this moment, we are conducting the final PC specs tests. We‚Äôre very aware that it‚Äôs one of the most awaited information on the game, and we will come back to you within the next couple of weeks with the recommended and minimum specs.</li></ul></li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>What‚Äôs next in August?</b></div><br/>We know you‚Äôre super thirsty for more content so be assured that you do not need to worry, you can expect more videos to pop up on our YouTube and social media channels (Discord, Twitter, Facebook). <br/>Talking about videos, we‚Äôre currently publishing on our secondary channel a series of short videos detailing some aspects of the game: weapons, enemies, environments‚Ä¶ <br/><br/>You'll find the complete playlist <b>here</b>.<br/><br/>Amongst the upcoming short videos, there will be more weapons, a rundown of the different PvE classes, and more!<br/><br/>On top of that, you can expect co-op previews to start dropping during August, with content creators starting publishing videos on their side as well. <br/><br/>Next, we‚Äôll detail the post-launch content of Space Marine 2 in a blog article that should be published around mid-August.<br/><br/>Finally, we‚Äôre reaching the final stages of our North America Tour, with Chicago (August 16-18) and Toronto (August 22-25) being the final places where you‚Äôll be able to put your hands on Space Marine 2‚Äôs demo before the release. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/1775b7d9acd2d9d530728b5ab5361daa9a3ab05f.jpg"/><br/><br/>Aaand that‚Äôs it for this month! We hope you‚Äôre as excited as we are! <br/>We‚Äôre really in the final weeks before the launch of Space Marine 2, it truly feels unreal and we can‚Äôt wait to see you play the game! <br/><br/>See you next month!<br/><b>The Emperor protects</b><br/>]]></description>

A mid-ranged vehicle who lays down Dakka upon the battlefield from afar and uses their utility to stay at a distance. <br/><br/>In Speed Freeks this versatile vehicle allows for a lot of different playstyles to suit the scenarios you find yourself in. Whether it‚Äôs using your mobility to help out with objectives, laying down fire on the battlefield, helping to pick off key targets or putting pressure on the enemy tanks.<br/><br/>The base speed of this vehicle is average, tied with the Boomdakka Snazzwagon. However, the Burna Exhaust ability is a strong movement tool that opens a lot of possibilities, such as jumping onto a roof to escape enemies, getting extra airtime to recharge your boost bar, or using Dash right as you land to convert vertical speed into horizontal speed. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/b09f0fbdabff31ddd0d90ffe6e1290afadc13069.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Abilities</div><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c92d9b0654284f8bf398169b2199225006cf54ac.png"/><br/><b>Rivet Kannon </b><br/>This fearsome tool-turned-weapon fires a thunderous hail of heated rivets. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/0e303f935d8c5c8569613e8ff6105caf47c9ce3f.png"/><br/><b>Stikkbomb </b><br/>Hurl a Stikkbomb ‚Äãto damage and disrupt enemy vehicles. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/d1486798446edb272631dbef4ef558bc29c0b991.png"/><br/><b>Burna Exhaust </b><br/>An explosion of flame‚Äã from the exhausts‚Äã lifts the Kustom Boosta-Blasta off the ground. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/4346af90da9a6945385d1ba4948228ea4512fdb0.png"/><br/><b>Dash </b><br/>The vehicle lunges violently forward and smashes enemies.

Never get too close to close ranged opponents, and never be too far away from long ranged opponents. As the Kustom Boosta-Blasta you are useful at many different ranges, use it to your advantage and be at the range your opponents are weak at. <br/><br/>Use your utility to keep opponents at the distance you want them at. Throw the grenade to throw them off their track or jump up to high ground where they can‚Äôt reach you. You decide where you want to fight. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/ec50a319871e11ed3ff2f181a3e6a940b3281d1f.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Team-Ups</div><b>The Snazzwagon</b> and Boosta-Blasta are a potent combo, with both vehicles having escape and/or disorientation abilities in Billowing Smoke and the Stikkbomb.

This was caused by the game subtracting the previous tribute from the income without resetting the tribute value, leading to repeated incorrect deductions. We missed this specific issue initially, but we believe this updated solution resolves all related problems.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue with the 'Continue Campaign' button in Launcher not continuing the campaign, and instead redirecting to the main game screen.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when players overcast a spell while commanding a unit with multiple shot types in battle. This issue was identified and resolved thanks to detailed reports from our community forums!<br/></li><li> Fixed the following abilities not affecting units that were not nearby when the battle began:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Rune of Stoicism<br/></li><li> Ancestor Rune<br/></li><li> Rune of Courage<br/></li><li> Spirit Conduit (Hierotitan)</li></ul></li><li> Fixed an issue when the general was removed from the military force, the unit would become a colonel and be treated by the UI like a hero rather than a normal unit.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where river crossing battle maps would not trigger when fighting on river crossings or alongside rivers on the Immortal Empires campaign map.<br/></li><li> Fixed rendering issues with Pistoliers unit which would result the rider model not being visible.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where playing custom battles as Daemons of Chaos, using the Shadow Legion colour scheme, the army abilities would be missing.<br/></li><li> Fixed plate armor opacity issues with several Empire units.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug when moving Thorek on Anvil mount in campaign, which would lead to his model tilting backwards during the move animation.<br/></li><li> Explosive ammunition for Hochland Long Rifles no longer reduces penetration value from 1 to 0.<br/></li><li> Tempest from the Lore of High Magic now matches its visual duration at 17 seconds for both regular and overcast.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Dark Elf buildings that reduce slave count only functioned correctly when constructed by the player. Captured settlements with pre-existing economic buildings did not reduce slave count until these buildings were upgraded or replaced. This fix ensures that the slave count reduction feature works as intended immediately upon acquiring such buildings.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash in multiplayer campaign games where completing the Changeling Cult building "Ravaging Host" in another player's settlement would cause the game to crash. This was due to a Lua error in the script that was meant to trigger a dilemma for the player upon discovering the cult.<br/></li><li> Fixed some instances of skills that penalise enemy hero success chance instead being granted to the enemy, making them penalise your success chance.<br/></li><li> Fixed issue where a placeholder icon would show on some Shadowy Dealing actions.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where a military force with plague was able to get infected and lost its ability to use the switching plagues mechanic.<br/></li><li> Fixing an audio issue with the Mechanical Steed mount which was not triggering surface appropriate footsteps.<br/></li><li> After a long tug-of-war with his rot beast, Kayzk has finally recovered his blade, which he now wields in all its disgusting glory.<br/></li><li> One player watching the Immortal Empires flyby will no longer block the other players' actions, sometimes causing desync.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the chance of a magic item dropping or being stolen was not being correctly modified by effects on Heroes embedded in the army.<br/></li><li> The Black Staff item's bound power of darkness now matches regular power of darkness.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> +0.3 winds per second.<br/></li><li> +does equivalent self damage.</li></ul></li><li> Added missing page-turning sound effects for Blue Scribes.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where armies would get replenished to 100% after being defeated and sacked. Now they will be replenished only by the desired amount of 25%.<br/></li><li> Added missing lava and portal sound effects to Bleeding Spire map.</li></ul><br/>Thanks for all of your bug reports and feedback, all of which have been extremely valuable in helping our teams investigate and resolve issues as quickly as possible!

      <title>Itemization Rework Q&amp;A Part 1 - Dev Blog</title>

<div class="bb_h1">Heyo Everyone, </div><br/>Earlier this month, we released an Introduction to Itemization dev blog. After sharing the first looks of Itemization, we got a lot of messages from players. We collected over 13 pages of feedback, questions and concerns. As promised, we're following up on them.<br/><br/>While we cannot answer all of those questions yet, as some things are still being decided and iterated upon, we wanted to answer a batch of them today. We will continue to share more answers as we move closer to release! We want to hear more of your feedback and opinions through this dialogue.<br/><br/><i>Note: All of the questions we‚Äôre answering in this are pulled directly from the comments on the Forums, Reddit and Discord. We kept the players‚Äô wording instead of writing our own questions.</i><br/><br/>Before we dive in, we want to make it clear for those who might‚Äôve missed prior communications: WE ARE BREAKING THE LOCKS WITH THIS REWORK. üîì<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Questions From Players</div><div class="bb_h2">Blessings / Transferring Weapons to New Systems</div><b>Question</b><br/><i>When StrawHat said that players will begin with a headstart in the new system, does that mean that we won't have access to blessings we did previously and therefore forcing us to grind for the tiers all over again?</i><br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, the actual blessing sticker book will be translated to experience into Mastery. It does mean that you actually can even learn blessings you didn't before if wanted.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>What if I already have a perfect 550?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Already owned weapons won‚Äôt be touched, they‚Äôll remain intact.<br/>(Note: We are doing some blessing tweaks and balances with this update to accommodate for the new system, so some numbers might change.)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Soooo... my old weapons don't just disappear right? Guys, it took me 500+ hours to get all the stuff I want through your RNG casino, so that would be more than just a little bummer. Will already unlocked weapons be converted 100%?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, they won‚Äôt disappear and they will stay 100% intact as they are. You will keep the entire arsenal of weapons that you have acquired previously. <br/>(Note: We are doing some blessing tweaks and balances with this update to accommodate for the new system, so some numbers might change.)<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Mastery and Expertise Systems</div><b>Question</b><br/>How does Mastery XP work? Do you get more for higher difficulty missions? What if you fail a run?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The amount of Mastery XP is based on what difficulty the player plays. The higher the difficulty, the higher amount of XP is awarded. Experience gained will remain the same, no matter the weapon you use the most during a mission.<br/><br/>If you fail a run, you will be awarded a portion of the XP just as with normal Experience and Ordo Docket rewards.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Mastery is not tied to a specific weapon in your inventory. It has its own progress per weapon family that includes all marks, that unlocks blessings and perks for that weapon family. Do I have that right?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. Playing with any weapon (different marks) within a weapon family will progress that entire weapon family‚Äôs Mastery. Note: There can be several weapon families within the same school of weapons, such as Lasguns and Autoguns. They each have multiple weapon families, containing a number of Marks (e.g. Infantry Autoguns and Braced Autoguns).<br/>TL;DR - If you play with a Lasgun Family A Mark X, you will progress your Mastery into Lasgun Family A. So every other weapon mark in Family A will benefit from the Mastery progression into Mark X.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>There's no farming blessings at all anymore. You just directly unlock the ones you want with the Mastery points. At full Mastery you'll have all blessings at all levels unlocked. (Yes or no?)<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. As you gain Mastery with a Weapon Family you unlock blessing points (among other things); these points can then be freely used to unlock any blessing of your choosing: the more blessings you unlock, the more powerful versions of blessings you are able to unlock. When you have reached full Mastery with a weapon family you will have unlocked all the blessings available for that family. Moreover, in the new system, you‚Äôll be able to freely swap out any blessings and perks on any weapon, at any level of Mastery, without them becoming locked after two changes.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>So every weapon we buy/earn has a random-ish stat cap, and our Mastery of that weapon‚Äôs family (so autoguns, shotguns, etc) lets us build that up via expertise?<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Yes. We are still working out the finer details of this system. But in essence, as you gain Mastery you will unlock more Expertise within that weapon family. You can then choose to invest into that weapon and increase the stats of the weapon while keeping the predetermined stat distribution the weapon was created with.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Miscellaneous Concerns</div><b>Question</b><br/>This system is the anti-choice system, it‚Äôs the system that forces you to grind every single weapon family before you can try a build.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The Mastery system is an addition to the existing crafting system that allows players to steadily unlock every Blessing for a weapon family, instead of relying exclusively on RNG to obtain them.<br/><br/>True, there will be some grind to fully unlock all the blessings at their most powerful tier for a weapon family. The system however lets you have full freedom in which blessings you unlock, and in what order, so being able to unlock a specific blessing for a build should be a manageable time investment. We are still experimenting with the exact time investment needed to fully unlock all blessings for a certain weapons family. We are also adding more tiers to most blessings, making previously higher tier blessings available at lower tiers.<br/><br/>Also, loot is still part of the system. The fact that we are still keeping the RNG loot system in place (Emperor's Gift, Sire Melk‚Äôs Requisitorium, The Armoury Exchange, and the ability to Consecrate weapons at Hadron‚Äôs Shrine with random upgrades, etc) will allow players to get to weapon builds that they have not unlocked in their Mastery before they actually get there. The loot system will be able to shortcut you to things that you have not yet unlocked.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>If the only way to upgrade a weapon is to use it, players won't want to try new weapons because of the marked drop in power they'll have to put up with for as long as it takes to grind out the upgrades.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Powerful weapons will still be distributed through stores/Emperor‚Äôs Gift. You can start with already high tier weapons to grind the Mastery, similar to what the game proposes at the moment. <br/><br/>Mastery will just open the toolbox to the player for them to experiment.<br/><br/>Mastery doesn't ‚Äúgate‚Äù a person from acquiring a weapon with a given blessing, it only gates you from freely being able to add it to any weapon of your choosing. The loot system can still allow players to shortcut to a more powerful blessing before they unlock it in the Mastery.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Is ‚Äòweapon potential‚Äô a new stat? Is it tied to the base power level? If it is a new unrelated stat does that mean a 371 power weapon with a low weapon potential rating has less possible power increase than a say 342 power weapon that has a high weapon potential rating? Please give us examples with actual numbers to compare.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>Weapon Potential just refers to the stats distribution. For any weapon in the game, they actually have the potential to be maxed out. Every weapon now has the potential to reach a 380 stats rating. Note that maxing out does not mean reaching 80% on each stat: every weapon is created with a pool of stat points that have been distributed in the different stat buckets, and every weapon has the same potential maximum number of stats that can be distributed.<br/><br/><i><b>DISCLAIMER: The following images are NOT representative of the final UI / work for Itemization.

So no more fancy lasgun that only my Psyker can enjoy, now my Veteran and Zealot can too? This has been one of my biggest gripes.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>No, it will remain as it is today, where any item is unique to the character that has it.<br/><br/>However, we can say that we‚Äôre opening up more weapon families to be shared between all classes. It's still case by case, but for example, shotguns will be available for all classes.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/><b>Question</b><br/>Given that blessings are currently shared across characters, it‚Äôd be a massive step back if progress was silo‚Äôd.<br/><br/><b>Answer</b><br/>The Mastery / blessings unlocked are shared by account. However, any applied Expertise is at an item level and character level. <br/><br/>Essentially, if you have the Infantry Lasgun weapon family at 100% unlocked on Character 1, when you go to Character 2 and find a new Infantry Lasgun, you‚Äôll have all the blessings unlocked on the new gun. But you‚Äôll need to spend the materials to apply any Expertise changes on Character 2.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/>Alright, that answers the first batch of questions.

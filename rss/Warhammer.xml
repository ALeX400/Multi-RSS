Xenos and Chaos minions are not the only things threatening Humanity in the grim darkness of the 41st millennium. Even among humans, there are many who would seek to attack the power of the Imperium from within. But regardless of whether the criminal is driven by personal gain or the heresy of mercy, the outcome is always the same. Justice will not be denied, and any encounter with the Adeptus Arbites is inevitably followed by a quick sentence and swift execution.<br/><br/>The Arbites will not be bribed, intimidated, or swayed by heartfelt pleas. Their lives are spent serving the Lex Imperialis, a holy code of laws tracing back to the Emperor's own decrees. Their prayers are ancient codices, their duty—to collect the tithe that fuels the Imperium’s war machine on countless fronts and any who would dare threaten it. Each member of the Adeptus Arbites has undergone rigorous training at the Schola Progenium and is granted access to first-class weaponry, including powerful shotguns, heavy shields, and deadly cyber-familiars. Their name has become synonymous with the fear of Imperium Law, and their appearance means swift judgement and certain retribution.<br/><br/>Solomorne Anthar embodies this implacable justice, which cannot be swayed or thwarted by wealth or lofty titles. Years of service have purged him of all human qualities, for his duty demands absolute commitment. Only one creature has ever earned the Proctor’s affection: Glaito the Cyber-Mastiff, a living weapon of the Lex Imperialis, and the most loyal of companions.<br/><br/>For Solomorne, the world is simple and clear: everything must conform to the order established by the God-Emperor, and there is no excuse, and no mercy, for any violators of the Lex Imperialis. No sacrifice is too great if it is made to uphold His Law, and only the authority of the holy Warrant can force the Arbitrator to bow his head. But even in the Koronus Expanse, where crime runs rampant and the Adeptus Arbites lack both numbers and resources, Solomorne is determined to follow the letter of the Law until he draws his final breath.<br/><br/>Yet, even the most unbreakable principles may crack under a single fatal flaw. Beset by enemies of Humanity, riven with contradictions, and full of terrible secrets, the Koronus Expanse will become the catalyst for events that will push Solomorne to the brink—and show just how strong his faith in the Lex Imperialis truly is.<br/><br/>Meet him tomorrow in the Lex Imperialis expansion!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/3daca1b1520b2f040c475b1cb9ce0a688c6903ec.jpg"/><br/>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h1">Introducing: Adeptus Arbites</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Adeptus Arbites have arrived – Darktide’s first Class DLC. Get the Arbites Class on all platforms today, you can choose between the Standard Edition and the Deluxe Edition. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">[dynamiclink href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710910/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Arbites_Class/"][/dynamiclink][dynamiclink href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710950/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Arbites_Class_Deluxe_Edition/"][/dynamiclink]</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/0d846a0ad5d8dc966d34f07b734659eff2f41325.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/02ae078b9cb1ac80e59c8037b1d7dec0521a25cd.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Adeptus Arbites enforce the Lex Imperialis – the Imperial Law. The institution’s most visible officers, known as Arbitrators, are utterly unforgiving of those who dare transgress the Law. They are swift to unleash brutal punishment upon those guilty of threatening the Imperium’s working, and no one is beyond their long reach.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">They have been present on Tertium for at least as long as Inquisitor Grendyl’s forces, investigating anomalies in the planet’s Tithe offerings.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The situation has grown so grave that Marshall Vortern has decided that the long arm of the Imperial Lex needs to take a firmer grasp of the situation.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>It is worth noting that the Arbites’ arrival takes place after the events of the Battle for Tertium,</b> so while you can absolutely play as an Arbites through the new campaign, some of the story scenes will not be addressed to your type of character. For this reason, we suggest playing the Battle for Tertium for the first time with one of the core characters.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>Cyber-Mastiff</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Arbitrator's loyal companion and best friend will join you in the slaying of lawbreakers and other scum. After you’re finished with customizing its name and looks, you’ll soon have it fighting alongside you. The Cyber-Mastiff has its own Passive target selection, which it will use to help you against anything that comes too close. You can also command it to attack a specific target, which will override any behaviour of its own. To command your Mastiff, you simply double-tap your Tag Input on any enemy that is eligible to be Tagged.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/7f114b1ed9183c8abae5457a9d9e9741eb727749.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">When the Cyber-Mastiff attacks a Human-Sized enemy, it will pounce on it, knocking it down and keeping it that way until it kills the enemy, or you order it to attack something else. When attacking any larger enemy the Mastiff will do a jump attack, staggering and dealing damage to the enemy.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Note: You can change the Command from Double-Tap to Single-Tap in your Input Settings. You can also enable and disable Outlines as well as Names, for your and other Arbitrator’s Companions.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/d596ac49b151d421e2128f5f12bc112eaaf2f9f6.jpg"/></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>Talent Tree</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">As an Arbitrator you have plenty of options when it comes to how you wish to play.

Use this Special to shift the tide of battle, either by attacking disoriented enemies or executing a tactical reposition.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"> <b>Branx Mk VI Arbites Shock Maul and Suppression Shield</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This mark is especially easy to use, with immediate access to simple Strikedown attack chains but also Relentless and Vanguard strikes, all with high Impact values.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><u>Attacks</u></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Light 1:</b> Moderately fast, vertical Strikedown attack with good Damage against all armour types.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Light 2:</b> Moderately fast, diagonal Vanguard attack with good Cleave.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Light 3:</b> Fast bash Strikedown attack performed with the shield.

However, the fastest way of reaching the Strikedown strikes requires some Stamina expenditure.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><u>Attacks</u></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Light 1:</b> Fast, horizontal Relentless attack with good Impact and Cleave properties.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Light 2:</b> Fast, horizontal Relentless attack with good Impact and Cleave properties.

<div class="bb_h1">Hey Everyone, </div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1">Upcoming New Class: Adeptus Arbites</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Darktide’s first Class DLC is soon available to all players! The release of the DLC is planned for later in the afternoon (June 23rd), <b>around 16:00 CEST - 07:00 PDT</b>. Get the Arbites Class on all platforms today at the price of $11.99 / €11.99.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"> [dynamiclink href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710910/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Arbites_Class/"][/dynamiclink]<img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/0d846a0ad5d8dc966d34f07b734659eff2f41325.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b><u>Free Update: Battle for Tertium</u></b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"> <img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/e1eaaf207f64427e750d3ee704a8abff37e7793b.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">The Battle for Tertium</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The core player experience has been reworked to provide a new clearer narrative focus, following the conflict of the Battle for Tertium. Players will now experience a linear campaign with new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. This new progression path is designed to ease in new players and gradually unlock features that were previously gated by character level.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/41f4ff6d56fd7030ba34047f87d4dbdd979bfb1a.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">While previously each new player’s experience was completely random, the Battle for Tertium narrative presents maps, enemies and characters in a specific order, allowing players to discover all aspects of the game at a much better pace.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The story missions play the same as regular missions, except that these missions have a more tight control over which enemies spawn. You might also hear some new VO lines during missions, and some brand new mission debrief cinematics when completing each mission.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Existing players with characters at level 10 or higher can choose to skip the story or play it from the beginning.</b> Players who change their minds about playing the campaign can opt out by using the Personality Scourge at the Barber-Chirurgeon. <b>Note</b>: If you decide to skip the story when you first log-in with this update, <i>you cannot revert this decision. The only way to play the story after choosing to skip it is to create a new character.</i> <b>Additional note</b>: The option to replay story missions at any time is still in progress. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>It is worth noting that the Arbites’ arrival takes place after the events of the Battle for Tertium,</b> so while you can absolutely play as an Arbites through the new campaign (once the class releases, later today!), some of the story scenes will not be addressed to your type of character. For this reason, we suggest playing the Battle for Tertium for the first time with one of the core characters.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Mission Board Rework</div><p class="bb_paragraph">A new mission board system will be bringing several changes to how you engage with missions and difficulties. <b>Missions are no longer tied to a specific difficulty, allowing you to select a mission and then choose the difficulty you want.</b> This will effectively increase the amount of mission options available for players of all difficulty levels. While most circumstances remain consistent across difficulty levels, some are disabled on lower difficulties. <b>Notably, Maelstrom missions are exclusive to the Heresy and Auric difficulties.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/5a7678117e2d8e5f33643296c61a91c71467da2c.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Additionally, the difficulty system has also been overhauled. <b>You now unlock new difficulties by completing missions rather than leveling up your characters.</b> You must prove your skills at your current maximum difficulty to unlock access to the next one. We intend to create a motivation for new players to master the game step by step, and for veteran players to feel assured that their teammates have earned the right to be there.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">You will make progress by playing missions at your current maximum difficulty. Completing missions advances your progress. Mission Failures reduce your progress slightly but you will never be demoted to a lower difficulty. Higher difficulties will require you to complete more missions to unlock them.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For existing characters, your difficulty progression will be migrated based on their character level and completed missions.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Auric is now a standalone difficulty tier</b>, placed above Damnation. We felt that Auric Heresy fell in an awkward spot compared to Damnation, with the increased mission options per difficulty, we decided it was best to turn Auric into its own difficulty level. Additionally, <b>we have removed Sedition difficulty and made a few minor changes to Uprising to take its place</b>, as we felt there was too much downtime with too few enemies between hordes. These changes aim to keep you in the action more often.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>Mortis Trials</b></div><div class="bb_h2"><b>The Secrets of the Shipmistress</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">Sefoni’s indiscretions are getting worse! During Mortis Trials, keen-eared Rejects now have the opportunity to sift pieces of Shipmistress Brahms’ past from the psychic chatter. How did she inherit the Mourningstar? What is she hiding? Is she really on the same side as Grendyl, let alone his irksome busybodies? Delve deeper into all these and more across dozens of new memory echoes, unlockable by claiming victory in the Mortis Trials!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Dev Note:</b> <i>If you've ever wanted to relisten to the memory echoes you've unlocked in the Mortis Trials, you should take a look behind the pillars in the Meat Grinder.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>New difficulty for Mortis Trials</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">Since the release of Mortis Trials we have noticed people requesting a higher challenge in Mortis Trials!

This will make the weapon snappier and more responsive in different situations.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we took a pass on all attacks to tweak active windows, ranges and hitboxes to be better aligned with their animations. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk I</b>, we added a new Heavy Strikedown attack, only reached from Light 3. In turn, the Light 3 attack is now reachable also from the Push action, and has an increased baseline power multiplier.  </p><p class="bb_paragraph">These additions will grant additional options to a mark which was lacking in single target attacks. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk IV</b>, we raised the power level multiplier of the Light 4 attack as it was very far into the attack chain and not particularly enticing. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk VII</b>, we increased the power level multiplier of the Pushfollow and Light 3 attacks while also changing the possible combos after a Riposte attack. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">Now after a successful Special Parry, the combo will chain into the Pushfollow attack instead of Light 3; as the Pushfollow attack still chains into

To be powerful with utility but scarce, so that you should consider saving it for difficult encounter</i>s.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Are there synergies planned between the weapons and the rest of the Arbites’ Talent Tree?</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Arbites talent tree has several nodes which enhance and/or are triggered by Blocking, which the <b>Shock Maul &amp; Suppression Shield</b> and the <b>Shotpistol &amp; Riot Shield</b> can easily utilize due to their strong block properties.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The <b>Arbites Shock Maul</b> can benefit from any source of Electrocution to trigger its powerful Special Stun, while also having the ability to slot in the High Voltage weapon blessing.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>How does the special work on the Shock Maul &amp; Suppression Shield?</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Upon blocking attacks, the absorbed energy is converted into the Special gauge, indicated diegetically from a display in the inner side of the shield. The Special gauge also slowly refills passively over time.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">When the gauge is at least half full, performing the Special input consumes half of the gauge and then triggers a high intensity shockwave in a cone in front of the shield, staggering nearby enemies and inflicting a high amount of Suppression in a large area.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Block properties of the shield are active while performing the Special, meaning it can be used as a safe way to turn the tempo of an engagement from defensive to offensive, but also to disorient ranged enemies before closing in for the kill.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>What were the influences for these weapons?</b><br/>The inspiration for the shotgun was actually the Kill Team: Exaction Squad miniatures. A large Will of the Lex dispensing shotgun!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Arbites shotgun Mk III:</b><br/>To elaborate. We imagined a large pump-action shotgun. Mk III comes with a duckbill muzzle (Horizontal spread with dynamic choke).</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The intent for it is to be great at clearing large hordes with hipfire, and competent elite single-target Aim Down Sights. Excelling at close to mid range. This should make for a versatile gun with interesting second-to-second gameplay.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Arbites shotgun Mk VIII:</b><br/>While still being a large pump-action shotgun, the Mk VIII comes with an extended barrel and is a standard spread heavy-hitter variant. Intended for mid range, with armor piercing capabilities - it serves better as a single target focus weapon.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Shotpistol &amp; Riot Shield:</b><br/>Introducing the first ranged weapon with a shield in Darktide.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We wanted to create what you would expect from an Arbites hand-cannon and shield, offering a unique playstyle that blends offense and defense.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Shotpistol unleashes devastating pellets and allows blocking while firing. This is a different weapon compared to existing revolvers. For close encounters and melee combat, use the special to push attack or heavy shield swipe.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Shock Maul + Suppression Shield:</b><br/>The idea for this weapon was to use the shield to promote blocking as a useful tool alongside the other damage-avoiding mechanics, whilst also giving it a Special which can be activated to turn the tide from defense to offense.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We also added some attacks using the shield itself, giving it a dual-wielding feel.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Arbites Shock Maul:</b><br/>The Adeptus Arbites field a large amount of mauls, so we wanted to explore the niche further by playing on their shock/stun repressive properties.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This weapon employs a primer mechanic, where the Stun from the Special attacks is triggered only if hitting an already Electrocuted enemy.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Since staggering with any attack triggers Electrocution, this creates a two-stage combo structure where players want to be looking at sources of bonus Impact and Electrocution to be able to follow-up immediately with a Special attack.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Do the shield weapons have any unique blocking properties?</b><br/>The <b>Shock Maul &amp; Suppression Shield</b> can block Ranged attacks coming from a frontal angle, while also being able to block normally unblockable attacks (e.g. Crushers’ overhead slams).</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The weapon also has a high base Stamina value and a stronger than usual Push.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Arbites Shotpistol + Riot Shield</b> can be used to block both ranged and melee attacks, while maintaining the ability to shoot when blocking.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">Animations</div><p class="bb_paragraph">To round this dev blog out, we’re going to talk about the animations with some of our animators, Jonas and Julia.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>What was it like animating these new weapons?</b><br/>A different experience than usual for sure! There was quite a lot of going back and forth, adjusting the size and shape of the weapons to make sure that it fit well with the feeling of the combat loop of Darktide. The general feel that I wanted to go for with the Arbites weapons was heavy, methodical and relentless. I also looked up at some reference material of Arbites figurines and lore to get an idea of their behavior.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This time around I didn’t have any matching props for an assault shield, so I posed around using a cardboard cut-out to test and feel how to animate certain motions and actions. The Shotpistol reload actually came to be through me testing around with holding a prop gun in different unconventional ways. As usual, I probably looked like a reject finding out what guns are for the first time.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">At first with the Shock Maul &amp; Suppression Shield, I animated the shield much slower and heavier, but at some point it felt too similar to the Ogryn slabshield and I made it a bit faster and lighter in motion. This decision made it a bit easier to incorporate the shield into the light attack chains.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Instead of making the shield feel slow and sluggish, I tried to mix it up a bit by making the<br/>Shock maul feel a bit more top-heavy instead. In the end I animated the Shock maul together<br/>with the shield to have a bit more anticipation and windups in the animations and having the<br/>impact feel a bit more like a baton. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Were there any challenges in the development of the Arbites’ weapons?</b><br/>In general I think there was a fun challenge in animating weapons with shields. Especially ranged weapons that kinda require you to use both hands when reloading or for a similar action. As an animator on Darktide I really want to highlight reloads or any other unique weapon interactions as much as possible.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">I think Shotpistol and Shield have been the most challenging weapon overall because of how<br/>you can cancel reload to go into a block. That is, since this weapon has a third state that allows<br/>you to block when you run out of ammo in-clip, it creates a lot of unexpected interactions for when going to reload and from reload or to any other disrupting action. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Which is your favourite weapon that you’ve worked on for Arbites?</b><br/>Hard to say to be completely honest. I think I like the Shotpistol and Shield most because of<br/>how different it is in comparison to other weapons. But I also really like how the new Shock Maul feels. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph">My favorite is the Shotgun, I think the model itself is really cool with its chunkyness and with the special ammo casings visible on top, and the designers did a great job with how it plays. I feel like the law! - Julia</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Are there any unique animations associated with them?</b><br/>The Shotgun’s special ammo reload received a bit of a different animation than usual. There is special ammo attached to the top of the Shotgun model, which provided an opportunity to make an animation where you pick the ammo off one by one from the model itself instead of having the ammo arrive from out-of-frame. - Julia</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>How long do animations for these take?</b><br/>It depends on the weapon and how it is going to work, but it can definitely take a while! Which was the case for the Arbites weapon family. Since we didn’t have any weapon family in Darktide that has a shield (Except for you Ogryn, you lovely brute), we chose to animate almost everything from scratch. Using Ogryn animations for this wouldn’t have worked because of rig and size differences.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">There are about 220~ different animations for each weapon family/pattern that needs to work well together in a lot of different ways due to how fast-paced and high-action Darktide is. Around 50% of my time is spent on putting everything together in the state-machine, making sure that all the animations blend well. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>What is your creative process?</b><br/>First I figure out how the weapon I’m going to animate actually functions, and try to find solid references for how they’re used. Then, for first person animations, I’m a big fan of using a GoPro as a sketching tool to showcase my early ideas and choreography. I attach it to my face (Yes, face! It looks ridiculous!) or chest, find a suitable weapon prop and then do some first person recording. It enables shaping and showcasing early ideas without having to spend any time in animation software or the game engine.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">But even without a GoPro, I like to act out the movement for more complex animations, like reloads for example. For me, it enables my first blockout pass to have passable motions and pacing, and having that to begin with makes it easier for me to push and exaggerate the timing within the movements to a speed that I myself am not able to do, but will be smooth and believable in the game context. - Julia</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The process I have is that I usually look up references for different weapons that I start working on, and learn more about the what, why and how on functionalities. Using those references on stances/poses/handlings I go further with the process of testing out motions myself with props and see what feels and looks convincing and good. After brainstorming ideas and testing around I start animating and tweaking so that it works for first-person view. - Jonas</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Any fun bits of trivia?</b><br/>When recording motion capture for the Shock Mine, we used a duct tape roll as our prop! - Julia</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Thank you for reading our dev blog on the making of your new weapons in your new Arbites Class, releasing on <b>June 23, 2025</b> on all platforms.

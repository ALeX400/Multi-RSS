There have been endless words and fanatical ramblings ‚Äì enough to last several lifetimes ‚Äì and most are just background noise. That statement, though‚Ä¶ it carries weight. Enforced inactivity leads to a degradation of body and mind and so I must keep both active. The first comes with physical recovery. The other will hopefully come from committing some of my myriad thoughts to this journal.<br/><br/>How long have I been here? Days, certainly. Weeks, perhaps. Months? Possibly. I no longer know. There has been much pain, but I know that pain must be endured so that the body may be reshaped and that is what is happening. There is pain, at times excruciating, but I endure. I must endure. Because if I don‚Äôt, who will there be left to dole out retribution for my loss? Rodin‚Äôs death at the hands of the warband will not go unpunished and must be addressed. I swear it.<br/><br/>I have so many questions that have no answers. Who brought me here? Why was I spared when he was not? What happens next? All I seem to have are questions and time to think about them. What is time, really? When you get down to it, I mean. Is it even a real thing? Is it just a construct of a social system that has an obsession with its own mortality? What other species counts down the seconds to its own oblivion in the way that the Imperium of Mankind does? Such limited scope. Such narrow vision. Entropy is an inevitability: why bother wasting an existence waiting for it when you could be living?<br/><br/>It seems I have a second chance, including the opportunity to think and come out with the same foolish rhetoric of my new companions.<br/><br/>It‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôm a fighter. A soldier. I‚Äôm no orator or scribe given to flights of fancy. But things change. People change. I should be dead, but I am not. They talk to me earnestly of the Grandfather‚Äôs gift, of what I will become to them, but I fail to see the appeal. These people brought me here and I will play their game. For now, at least, we are travelling the same way, flotsam and jetsam borne ever-onward by the unrelenting tide of time.<br/><br/>There are choices ahead but I will not be distracted from my core objectives. I will avenge my brother and I will pay my debt to these people. Once those duties are discharged, what happens next remains to be seen. Thoughts of the way forward don‚Äôt burden me, neither am I afraid of them. He always said to me that there was no fear that cannot be overcome, no belief that cannot be challenged, no hope that cannot be dissolved in the acidic bile of truth. No, there is no fear.<br/><br/>There is something, though. Trepidation, anticipation, excitement‚Ä¶ the breath you draw before you dive, not knowing if you‚Äôre going to surface after you hit the water. The step off the cliff-edge, trusting that the fall is not going to smash your body to smithereens. The thrill of continued existence against all the odds. It‚Äôs invigorating and gives me strength and purpose to do what must be done.<br/><br/>I have already survived against all likelihood. I will endure and I shall not falter. My brother, you will not be forgotten.<br/><br/><i>Falter not, wither not.</i><br/><br/>Take a breath and jump.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>]]></description>

This will be a developer diary that gives you a look into what is coming as part of Patch 5.2 and this time around I'll also talk a little bit wider than that about what to expect going forward for our updates and how you can help shape them.<br/><br/>First though a bit of backstory. When I think back to the very first DLC we ever made for the Total War: WARHAMMER trilogy, Call of the Beastmen, there was a moment where Rich and I discussed adding the moon cycle mechanic to the race. At the time this seemed like a tiny addition, and indeed it was compared to the kind of features we do now, but I always consider that moment monumental as for me it was the first instance of us pushing a boundary, trying to do something a little bit different that we hadn't done before, to add more than was originally planned, and we did it just because it was cool, we thought players would like it and we wanted the DLC to be as special as it could be.<br/><br/>I think it's that moment that set us on a path to try to do more for all new content, to keep pushing our own expectations for what new content for the game could be, to always be on the lookout for what special idea we could do next, and I really do believe it's that precedent that created a mindset for what got us here now with the absolutely insane scale of content we have. This way of working, to always be pushing, meant that over the years we tried a lot of new things, some that didn't work so well, others that were massive successes, but all the while our content was growing in scope and complexity, and we were learning.<br/><br/>This you will all know by now has had a few effects; I think our content got better over time, which is fantastic, but this improvement has meant that the content we created in the past grows more outdated as time progresses, either because it was made without the knowledge, lessons, or technology we now have. This is where your, and our, desire for the old content to be reworked or updated comes from - not failure, but progress and success. It's something we've been cognizant of for a long time, hence our many reworks and updates, and it's something we want to continue to do going forward.<br/><br/>I think it's a blessing to be able to have such a vivid view of how you as a designer, and as a team, have improved in your craft over the better part of a decade, but of course that does mean we have some work to do. Let's talk about that work.<br/><br/><div class="bb_code"><div class="bb_h3"><b>üìú Read full 5.2 Dev Blog here</b></div></div><br/>‚ÄîThe <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

      <title>New Archetypes in the Void Shadows DLC</title>

In the upcoming DLC, the Lord Captain will come face to face with an Imperial Death Cult. These masters of assassination demonstrate their devotion to the God-Emperor by studying every facet and aspect of death: their grotesque rituals and bloody sacrifices conceal, like a sheath, the sophisticated art of slaughter's honed blade. To understand first-hand the lethal grace of their craft, simply examine the arsenal of abilities possessed by Kibellah ‚Äî a Death Cult representative seeking to join your retinue. The new archetypes available at character creation were specifically designed to reflect the terrifying efficiency of the Death Cult.<br/><br/>Let's take a closer look at the new archetypes in the Void Shadows DLC: the first-tier archetype ‚Äî the <b>Bladedancer</b> and the second-tier archetype ‚Äî the <b>Executioner</b>. Both are primarily focused on attributes desirable for any melee combatant. These new archetypes not only complement each other excellently but also open up numerous lucrative synergies with existing character-build options.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1"><b>Bladedancer</b></div><br/><b>Available Second-Tier Archetypes: </b>Assassin, Master Tactician, Arch-Militant, Executioner.<br/><b>Characteristics: </b>Weapon Skill, Strength, Toughness, Agility.<br/><b>Skills: </b>Athletics, Medicine, Carouse, Awareness, Demolition.<br/><br/>The Bladedancer is an elusive acrobat, skillfully manoeuvring through the battlefield in a deadly dance. With each kill, they gain charges of<b> Death From Above</b>: an ability allowing the Bladedancer to perform a short jump, dealing damage to all enemies in the impact zone. <b>Death From Above</b> damage scales with Agility and Weapon Skill. If such a display of prowess isn't enough, the <b>Death Waltz </b>heroic act enables the Bladedancer to repeat this pirouette multiple times in succession: the more Agility the character has, the longer they can continue this dance of death. And when deep behind enemy lines, completely surrounded, the Bladedancer can effortlessly return to the cell where they began their turn by utilising the<b> Acrobatic Artistry</b> ability, leaving bewildered foes unable to punish the bladedancer‚Äôs incisive incursions. This impressive arsenal will satisfy anyone looking for ease of strategic positioning and manoeuvrability across the battlefield, such as a Master Tactician or Arch-Militant.<br/><br/>But what if the "death" in <b>Death Waltz </b>attracts you more than the "dance?" The Bladedancer is ready to shed blood, whether it be that of their enemies, allies, or even their own. Performing a blood sacrifice, forfeiting their own life force, the Bladedancer strikes swiftly and precisely, critically injuring their foes. This deadly focus can also serve as a defensive measure: the Bladedancer's mastery with two-handed and dual-wielded swords is so great that they can conceal themselves in a literal <b>Blade Shroud</b>, reflecting incoming shots back at their enemies, albeit at the cost of overstraining and damaging themselves.<br/><br/><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/827877966616854558/1273203232520404993/reaper-2.gif?ex=66bdc269&amp;is=66bc70e9&amp;hm=08c0695f86290252e0f3f200a518fde87c53e05b61a2bc6932ee7b49faaabdb1&amp;"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1"><b>Executioner</b></div><br/><b>Available First-Tier Archetypes: </b>Warrior, Operative, Bladedancer.<br/><b>Characteristics: </b>Weapon Skill, Strength, Toughness, Intelligence.<br/><b>Skills: </b>Athletics, Medicine, Lore (Imperium), Lore (Xenos).<br/><br/>This archetype is available to Warriors, Operatives, or Bladedancers who revel in the heart-wrenching screams of their victims. The Executioner specialises in manipulating damage-over-time effects, vastly increasing their potency and converting them into debilitating injuries. Each of the Executioner's strikes is meticulously calculated to maximise the deadliness of afflictions on their enemies: comprehensive knowledge of anatomy allows this gruesome warrior to dismantle foes piece by piece, deepening lacerations and intensifying haemorrhaging as their knowledge of Medicine increases.<br/><br/>The Executioner is perfect for characters with the Biomancer or Pyromancer Psyker origins. Connoisseurs of incendiary bombs, toxic grenades, flamethrowers, needle weaponry, and other exotic instruments of pain will also find the Executioner especially delightful.<br/><br/>With <b>Reckless Abandon</b>, the Executioner carelessly plunges the entire battlefield into excruciating agony, sharing in the torment themself and enhancing damage-over-time effects at the cost of their own health. The Executioner can then hurl all opposition into peril with their heroic act: <b>Carnival of Misery</b> ‚Äî foes are set ablaze, poisoned, and suffer heavy bleeding. But that‚Äôs not all, for the Executioner's heroic act doubles the damage over time of these effects! And after all their foes are burning, poisoned, and bleeding, you can savour in their agony until they fall silent, for the terrifying master of torture draws power from their very suffering. By way of the <b>Gift of Torment</b> ability, the Executioner receives bonuses to armour, evasion, and deflection, scaling with the number of enemies afflicted by damage-over-time effects.<br/><br/>And, finally, the Executioner‚Äôs <b>Where It Hurts</b> initiates the toccata-finale in their wonderful symphony of pain. After using this free-action ability, the Executioner‚Äôs next attack immediately triggers a burst of multiple damage-over-time procs on the target, ending those effects along with the lives of their hapless victims.<br/><br/><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/827877966616854558/1273203232134402069/reaper-1.gif?ex=66bdc269&amp;is=66bc70e9&amp;hm=a1593cb5e6233152a40d1b70864590c5c00415f69c5d654b6cecdacdb934f51e&amp;"/><br/><br/>Be the fiercest adversary your foes have ever encountered ‚Äî call forth a typhoon of blood with a whirlwind of attacks and let them tremble in your wake! Armed with new, powerful abilities, you and Kibellah will paint the battlefield in the noble hues of the Death Cult: an exhilarating performance for you and a convocation of doom for those who dare to confront you. See you in the first DLC amidst the Void Shadows!<br/>]]></description>

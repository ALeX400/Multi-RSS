Lord Captains!<br/><br/>The <b>Lex Imperialis</b> expansion for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is just around the corner, and today, we begin our reveals with its biggest and most exciting feature:<br/><br/><b>The Familiars!</b><br/><br/>From the hints we dropped in our latest AMA, and with the expansion revolving around the Adeptus Arbites, many of you have already figured out that the good boy is on his way. <br/><br/>What most of you probably didn't expect is that there is not one but <b>FOUR</b> creatures that may now accompany your Rogue Trader, thanks to the brand new <b>second-tier Overseer archetype</b>!<br/><br/>Abelard, introduce:<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">1) The Cyber-Mastiff</div><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/10901e59314e3bcf961f618736fdbc433f0936a2.gif"/><br/><br/>Often seen accompanying Rogue Traders with the Arbites origin, these mechanized canine predators provide martial support during both combat and exploration, protecting their master with utmost ferocity. Notably, Solomorne Anthar, the new companion hailing from the ranks of the Adeptus Arbites, also employs one of these fearless beasts.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">2) The Psyber-Raven</div><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/060882ad49c7762354213fe42a4cfb49f12e633f.gif"/><br/><br/>Available to Psykers, these specially bred avian creatures channel and amplify their master's psychic abilities, increasing their range, damage and number of possible targets, as well as providing additional effects.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">3) The Servoskull Swarm</div><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/7c610c59ad38251677be6525567e9fa7f2df4e94.gif"/><br/><br/>A useful tool often employed by imperial Officers and Operatives, these constellations of hovering servo-skulls provide surveillance, relay their master's abilities across the battlefield, and excel at harassing the enemy.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">4) The Cyber-Eagle</div><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/a065f0ef40e602ea1923ab1023d8fe54268d27bc.gif"/><br/><br/>Valued by imperial Officers and Operatives for their speed and agility, these cybernetic aerial predators soar high above the battlefield, diving on command to blind and maim their master's enemies. They may also serve as the perfect distraction, sowing confusion among enemy ranks, and even potentially causing friendly fire.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/6ddc018f169b32c66b7417efce1eb4dac4156604.png"/><br/><br/>Are you ready to unleash your new potential?<br/><br/>Stay tuned ‚Äî we'll be sharing more about the new <b>Overseer</b> archetype, the new <b>Arbites</b> origin, and other info about the Lex Imperialis expansion soon!<br/>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h1">Hey Everyone,</div> <br/>Hotfix #66 (1.7.4) is currently rolling out across our platforms. In the meantime, you can read the notes below.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>General Fixes</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where players could fail to dodge-slide when using weapons with quick but short dodges.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the UI was showing Ogryn emotes with a New marker, but no new emotes were available.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the 'Precognition' Blessing for Duelling Swords and Combat Blades incorrectly showed a duration of 5s instead of 2s.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that could happen at the end of the Vigil Station Oblivium mission.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"><b>Havoc Changes &amp; Fixes</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where players could join other‚Äôs Havoc Assignments while they are still locked in to their own Assignment.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where a Havoc mission vote expiring could lead to the initiator being locked in to their Assignment.<br/></li><li> Fixed occasional spurious demotion when cancelling the ongoing Havoc Assignment.<br/></li><li> Fixed end-of-round view displaying a loss after winning a Havoc level 40 Assignment.<br/></li><li> Group Finder request-to-join list will no longer scroll back to top upon getting new requests.<br/></li><li> Increased Horde Strike type ‚ÄúBlockade Sandwich‚Äù trigger distance from 20 to 50.<br/></li><li> Dev Note: This strike may happen if the Strike Team tries to backtrack too far.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3"><b>Havoc Campaign - Mission Pool and Mutator Rotation </b></div>Every third week during a Havoc Campaign, we are rotating the mission pool and mutator pool. One or two missions and mutators will swap out during this time. Some may have noticed this already happened this week!<br/><br/><b>Mission Pool</b><br/><i>Outgoing</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Clandestium Gloriana<br/></i></li><li> Dark Communion</li></ul>[/i][/list]<br/><i>Incoming</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Excise Vault Spireside-13<br/></i></li><li> Consignment Yard HL 17-36</li></ul>[/i][/list]<br/><b>Mutators</b><br/><i>Outgoing</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>None.</i></li></ul><i>Incoming</i><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i>Moebian 21st</i></li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Havoc Derank Changes</b></div>The Derank changes to Havoc that we shared in our dev blog earlier this month are going live with this hotfix. <br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> A player of a higher Assignment Rank will not lose a charge upon being a participant in a lower ranked mission that failed.<br/></li><li> Assignment Rank 40 players will not be able to lose a charge through gameplay means at all.<br/></li><li> For those at Assignment Rank 40, they do not stand to gain anything by attempting their assignment again. Therefore, we‚Äôve made it so they can continue to try different builds and challenges to keep it interesting.</li></ul><br/>We had some questions about how Assignment Rank 40 players may change their Assignment:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Play it and win;<br/></li><li> Wait for the weekly reset;<br/></li><li> Play with another Assignment Rank 40 player and beat it;<br/></li><li> Manually derank to Assignment Rank 39, beat it (within 3 charges), get a new assignment. </li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Mortis Trials Fixes &amp; Tweaks</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where players would not get their Indulgences pool initialized, which would make it impossible for them to get Indulgence buff choices after the waves 3, 6 and 9. <br/></li><li> Dev Note: This happened to players that were part of the starting Strike Team but spawned later than the rest due to slow loading.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the server region option was not taken into account when matchmaking for Mortis Trials.</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Cosmetic Fixes</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where gaps would appear between the torso and arms while wearing the Psyker ‚ÄúBlind Witch‚Äôs Leash Raiment‚Äù upperbody cosmetic.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue with floating ornaments on the ‚Äú ‚ÄùPlan A‚Äù Vostroyan Rippergun ‚Äú weapon skin.<br/></li><li> Fixed the ability for blood effects to tint the entire body of the ‚Äú ‚ÄùLast Stand‚Äù Vostroyan Lasgun ‚Äú weapon skin red when using the bayonet attack.</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>Havoc Known Issue - Visual Only </b></div>After losing a mission, rejects with a higher Havoc rank helping out rejects with a lower Havoc rank may encounter an animation showing them losing a charge, even though they didn‚Äôt. This is purely a visual (animated?) issue. <br/><br/><i>(E.g. player A is rank 30 with 1 charge left and tries to help player B with their rank 10 assignment. After losing, player A gets an animation showing them go from 2 charges to 1. In reality they had 1 charge before the mission, and will still have 1 charge when they get back to the Havoc menu.)</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/><br/>]]></description>

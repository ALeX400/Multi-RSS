<div class="bb_h2"><b>Hello Space Marines!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">A few days ago, we released Patch 8.0 - Siege Update, including the Siege Mode, White Scars and Blood Angels Cosmetics, along with several improvements and minor changes. If you haven‚Äôt already, you should definitely read the full patch here<b>.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfnMHm-HvSI5LHVaMNjbipHYJAL34Q1SMZhHaaIfa-l9Zf1CPwlHzIrUjnU7QL0gzqqt-7MlpGl8gQtHOqymJn7atNKCr82Z_JPMDvi35RmyDD8tJy0HeTbahL7e1HuBKMeMkXm2A?key=EmFw4LBOwmmVaxw8jiOYWA"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Now let‚Äôs rewind a bit, and mostly: let‚Äôs discuss <b>what‚Äôs coming as the first year of content is slowly coming to an end.</b> Shall we?</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>WHAT COMES AFTER YEAR ONE? üßê</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">As promised, we‚Äôre excited to share more details with you, and even more will be revealed in the upcoming Community Updates <b>this July and August.</b> For now, here are a few things we can confirm:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We‚Äôre happy to announce that a<b>¬†second year of both free and DLC content included in a new yearly season pass is on the way!¬†</b>This extended support to Space Marine 2 has been possible thanks to your unwavering support, so once again, thank you very much for being part of it!. Expect new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and‚Ä¶ more üëÄ It‚Äôs too early to provide more info, but stay tuned! üòâ</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Also, to celebrate the first anniversary of the game, <b>a large-scale update is planned for September,</b> the 10.0 major update. Update 9.0 will not bring new content, but only balancing changes.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Unfortunately, that also means that the new PvP mode we were planning to release alongside the 9.0 update will be postponed to this big 10.0 update as well. While we can‚Äôt show you how it looks, the least we can do is to reveal what this new mode will be about:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">This new mode will take place on a new map.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">It will oppose 2 sides, but it won‚Äôt be Loyalist VS Chaos like in regular PvP. Instead, Chaos will face‚Ä¶ Chaos.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Last but not least, you‚Äôll be able to take control of the Helbrute. Yup.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">As this new game mode is centered around Chaos, <b>new Chaos armours will also be added to the game.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">A new <b>melee weapon</b> will also be added as part of this big 10.0 Update: the <b>Power Axe</b>! It will have its own moveset, execution animations etc‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll show you more on this weapon later on, but here‚Äôs a first look!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/b9d4da70b5f382d137a5fc2c8a7c87556b8e5053.png"/><i>Work in progress, final version is subject to change</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we announced a while ago that we are working on a new class for PvE and PvP. We‚Äôre now advanced enough in its development to announce that the new class will be a <u><b>Techmarine</b></u>! We‚Äôll reveal more about this new class in the next community updates, so stay tuned!¬†</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>PATCH 8.0 IN DETAILS ‚öôÔ∏è</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Patch 8.0 - Siege Update was available via the Public Test Server on Steam. Thanks to your feedback, we‚Äôve made a bunch of tweaks and improvements for the live game release of the Patch. So, thank you for your participation! Let‚Äôs briefly review the content, or read the full patch notes for more details!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>SIEGE MODE</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">Siege Mode is the new big feature coming with the Siege Update! Check the¬†May Community Update for more details about the gameplay mechanics of this mode.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For those who played on the PTS and provided us with feedback, we heard you loud and clear! You expressed your disappointment regarding the timer. So we changed it a bit. Now, it goes as follows:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">‚è±Ô∏è <u>The timer has changed!</u>‚è±Ô∏è</p><blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>The biggest criticism regarding Siege mode from the community was the wave timer limit. It exists only for technical reasons, because killing lots of enemies causes memory fragmentation (which, to simplify, would cause a crash after a certain threshold).</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>We've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer. Timer got reworked, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can get to a very short time on higher waves, there is a timer for the entire session and each time you beat a wave the timer increases. We've also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves so enemies will get stronger faster after the 15th wave. These changes will make players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. </i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Also, with some optimizations coming down later we think we can get rid of the timer entirely.</i></p></blockquote><p class="bb_paragraph">We truly hope you‚Äôre enjoying Siege Mode as much as we are and we‚Äôre still open to feedback!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>WHITE SCARS CHAPTER PACK</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Assault Class Champion comes with several cosmetics and 3 exclusive weapons skins for the Occulus Bolt Carbine, the Stalker Bolt Rifle, and the Combat Knife.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/b066256ea388e1db5bd6cd8e09d0c10107cd25eb.jpg"/></p>[carousel]<img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/c0fc4a0e132d08919324e6e27654fe15b3958f0a.jpg"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/0254e5bfaa406e0d3d52e12db225d7cd3bd87237.jpg"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/9f0a261a65d0e9e65f99d2e59ec33868f81f85c4.jpg"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/6db692fa5ef96c40a3454b8eafdfcf58f7d9b219.jpg"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/b73fa5f9b8a36fa2e713d59c294a66e6f6151489.jpg"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/b4c834898fa174b67debd3bf94cb8ed02cab7f98.jpg"/>[/carousel]<p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>WHITE SCARS SUCCESSOR CHAPTERS</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">The White Scars Successor Chapters are the Dark Hunters, Destroyers, Mantis Warriors, Marauders, Rampagers, Solar Hawks, Storm Lords, Storm Reapers.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/655eb173ed2eca7c774a8e168c2a24b8467f1e0b.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>BLOOD ANGEL COSMETIC PACK</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/e9b00e197758eebd0757f8b7881c56347bd9766e.jpg"/></p>[carousel]<img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2fb39e0f5017cf83ce924c48783bd696c67ac436.jpg"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/46d0d37e4263b8b2ba15f7bd6d5127e61871dc7b.jpg"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/6b8123edd3debacc0b18ab3e0d9d99dd7d4347a5.jpg"/>[/carousel]<p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>BLOOD ANGELS SUCCESSOR CHAPTERS</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Blood Angels Successor Chapters are the Angels Penitent, Angels Sanguine, Atlantian Spears, Blood Dragons, Blood Scythes, Flesh Eaters, Flesh Tearers, and Lamenters.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/7a6af15513e741d68664e97913333b2c31905a3b.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>TWITCH DROPS COME WITH PATCH 8.0 üìΩÔ∏è</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">To celebrate the release of Patch 8.0, Twitch Drops return!

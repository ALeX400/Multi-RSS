<div class="bb_h2"><b>Greetings Space Marines 👋</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The end of the year is near, so let us spoil you with some Patch 12 spoilers and then, let’s rewind on what happened lately on Space Marine 2!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>A LITTLE TEASER NEVER KILLED NOBODY…</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We’re heading towards the end of the year, which means we’re getting closer to the addition of the Techmarine! It’s time for us to start sharing a bit of what we’ve been cooking for this new class: </p><p class="bb_paragraph">First, the Techmarine comes with its iconic new weapon: the <b>Omnissian Axe</b>.

In addition to that, the Techmarine has a passive ability to restore Tarantula Sentry Guns that can spawn on existing PvE levels. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">Lastly, you might wonder which Traitor Legion the Chaos Techmarine will be associated with in PvP. We cannot spoil too much right now, but we’ll make sure to give you more details in the upcoming weeks. 😉</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Here’s your first look at him!</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2fd9048b2c6e0be6a10f90f46b41c76e12a968a6.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We are also planning a <b>PTS session</b> for Patch 12, so you’ll be able to test the Techmarine in advance and give us feedback on it.

<div class="bb_h1">Heroes!</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Last weekend we had a Free-To-Keep event, where any players who didn’t yet own Vermintide 2 could claim it and add it to their libraries for free, to celebrate 10 Years of Tide.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">During this event, a staggering <b>5.9 million</b> players have become Heroes and joined the endless ratslaying, bringing us up to a total of <b>25 million lifetime players </b>since launch!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/ace0a3e4964b8ac71e2004814ab0bae4720728f7.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“A decade on and players are still charging into Vermintide 2, that’s amazing to witness. At Fatshark, our goal has always been to make games that people love to play, and this weekend proved that the passion endures.” ~ Joakim Setterberg, Design Director for Vermintide</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We’re so grateful to have so many people try our game and experience the world of Warhammer Fantasy through it! The years pass but our passion for this game does not. We’re still putting out free content and updating this game that we cherish and love so much, such as the recently released Return to the Reik.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p>

It would mean the world to us to get your vote and celebrate this awesome game and this fantastic community!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">That’s all for now, but look forward to hearing more from us in December for Gifts of the Wolf Father!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">~ The Vermintide Team</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/c0200b6a5a19b902ba4583c51ea307671217a8e3.png"/></p>]]></description>

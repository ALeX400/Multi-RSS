<div class="bb_h2">Hi Space Marines! ‚≠ê </div><br/>The Public Test Server opens March 13! Check out this quick FAQ to help you get started and ready before launch.<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png"/><br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What‚Äôs a Public Test Server?</div><br/>Space Marine 2‚Äôs Public Test Server works as a separate version of the game featuring WIP content and features. Share your feedback to help us refine the patch before its official release. Your input provides an important perspective that will be reviewed by the developer team and have an impact on further game updates.<br/><br/><b>Since this is a test environment, expect the unfinished content and possible bugs. As you will access it through a different game version, your progression will not be tracked.</b> For each PTS update, you will land on the game with levels maxed out and all weapons unlocked.<br/><br/>Please note that the DLCs won‚Äôt be available, regardless of whether you own them.<br/>‚Äé <br/>Since the PTS is "Public", you are free to create content based on it. No NDA will be included.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Which platforms can access the PTS?</div><br/>The PTS is only available on PC via Steam. It is not accessible on consoles (PlayStation/Xbox) or through the Epic Games Store.<br/><br/>Now, let‚Äôs see how to install it üëá<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">üìù <u>Tutorial on how to access PTS via Steam:</u></div><br/><div class="bb_h3">Just follow these simple steps:</div><ol><li> Open the Steam client.<br/></li><li> Log in with the account that owns Space Marine 2.<br/></li><li> Go to your Steam Library.<br/></li><li> Look for ‚Äú<b>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Public Test Server</b>‚Äù under your Space Marine 2 entry.<br/></li><li> (Optional) Right-click on your Library entry and go to Properties. In the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù tab, set the game‚Äôs default Language to ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù. <i>Translations may still be work-in-progress when you try the new content out on the PTS. <b>As a result, we recommend setting the game to English</b>.</i><br/></li><li> Once you‚Äôve clicked on this entry, install the Public Test Server content. This install instance is not related to the base game, your files will remain in separate directories and all future updates will also be distinct, meaning that your current progression will not be affected by the time you spend on the PTS.</li></ol><b>When the install is complete, the Public Test Server is ready to launch!</b><br/><br/>Click ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù like you would with any other game!<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Can I try every single feature that will be implemented with the next Patch?</div>Most upcoming content will be available to you. However, we won‚Äôt share content that is too buggy or hasn‚Äôt undergone the necessary approvals on our side at the time of the PTS release. Also, some content might be present on the PTS, but not accessible to the players. For instance, you may see new Champions in the Armouring Hall but won‚Äôt be able to try them.<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">How long will the PTS be active?</div><br/>The PTS will run until Patch 7.0 officially launches.<br/><br/>After that, it will go dormant until the next major PTS update.<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Will my progress be saved?</div><br/>No, because the PTS runs as a completely separate game version. It does not carry over your previous progress in the game; instead, it provides all players with a default maxed-out level and weapons. This ensures that you won‚Äôt have to spend time to unlock all the features, especially the Prestige Ranks.<br/><br/>It will also not save your progress nor transfer it to the official game version afterwards.<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Is multiplayer available on the PTS?</div><br/>Yes, even private PvP lobbies will work so you can invite your Brothers and Sisters to play!<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Do mods work with the PTS?</div><br/>Mods won't work with the PTS. <b>Enabling them will cause the PTS to crash at launch. Please, make sure to disable them beforehand.</b><br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">How can I give feedback?</div><br/>We need your feedback!<br/><br/>As mentioned in previous Community Updates, the primary purpose of the Public Test Server is to gather your feedback on new content, changes, and balancing tweaks we plan to implement in the game.<br/><br/><b>Our main focus will be on PvE Prestige Ranks and Weapon Perks. Feedback on these two items will be the most beneficial.</b><br/><br/>We‚Äôve set up dedicated forum threads on Focus Together to let you voice your opinion, which you can find here.<br/><br/>Thank you for helping us make Space Marine 2 the best it can be!<br/>‚Äé <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/0a6ea410f462d2a5b6950db04e11ef0cb86b247b.png"/><br/> ‚Äé <br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">What‚Äôs included in Patch 7.0 on the PTS?</div><br/>For this first session, you‚Äôll be able to check the upcoming content of Patch 7.0, which includes:<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">PvE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>PvE Prestige Ranks</b><br/></li><li> PvE New Map - Exfiltration (excluding final bossfight). Please note that when reaching the final boss arena, the "Victory" screen starts as soon as you interact with the terminal and the classic mission end behaviour follows (loadings, result screens and return to Battle Barge).<br/></li><li> Weapons Class Restrictions changed (PvE Only: classes now have access to more weapons)<br/></li><li> Improved PvE Matchmaking (reduces the chance of joining a team with the same class)</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">PvP</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Custom PvP Lobby</b><br/></li><li> Matchmaking improvements for better team balancing</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">GENERAL</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Weapons Perks Rework</b><br/></li><li> <b>New Secondary Weapon - Inferno Pistol (PvE and PvP).</b><br/></li><li> New Colors available in the Armouring Hall: Volupus Pink + Thousand Sons Blue<br/></li><li> Cloth coloring for Bulwark<br/></li><li> Option to color hands separately from arms</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">DLC</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ‚ÄúSpace Wolves‚Äù Chapter Pack: present in-game but not playable.<br/></li><li> "Imperial Fist" Champion Pack: present in-game but not playable.</li></ul><br/>Thank you for your dedication.<br/><div class="bb_h3">The Emperor Protects.</div>]]></description>

That should help the player understand that this decision will have negative consequences (and cause Abelard’s second quest to fail automatically because the stern man will not come seeking aid before it’s too late). <br/></li><li> When Pasqal's second quest was failed or skipped, his dialogues sometimes didn't reflect that - fixed;<br/></li><li> The Footfall 'zoo' didn't register the player's previous Heretical decision - fixed;<br/></li><li> Removed a couple of incorrect [draft] tags from NPC banter on Footfall;<br/></li><li> Player now needs to learn about the existence of the 'gift' of Kor's head to gain access to the option of blowing up the pirate ships;<br/></li><li> Pasqal's age in years that was mentioned in one of the dialogues, contradicted the rest of the events of the game and was retconned to never be specified directly;<br/></li><li> Pasqal surprisingly still had a [draft] dialogue related to the Halo device - fixed;<br/></li><li> One of the objectives in the Critical Tasks quest was impossible to complete if not done before Magnae Accessio - fixed;<br/></li><li> One of dialogue options in Pasqal's dialogue on the voidship bridge appeared only once, becoming inaccessible if the player didn't click the option immediately - fixed;<br/></li><li> Minor text adjustments for the dialogue with governor Drivestem regarding Sauerback and Gaprak families during the Magnae Accessio ceremony;<br/></li><li> Many minor narrative fixes to colony events;<br/></li><li> Many minor narrative fixes to colony chronicles;<br/></li><li> Idira will no longer talk about Commorragh like she was there if you didn't take her with you;<br/></li><li> Heinrix will no longer insert himself into the blood bath dialogue if he's not in the party. Innocence proves nothing, but Heinrix, please, this is not the first time you’re doing this!<br/></li><li> Heinrix managed to somehow throw a glaring look on Yrliet on the voidship bridge scene after Commorragh, even if she was left behind in the Dark City -

fixed;<br/></li><li> Fixed an error speaker case in the Rykad Minoris Star Port;<br/></li><li> Depending on the timing of arrival to Rykad Minoris, Cassia, Idira and Crime Lord RT will consistently recognize whether the Astra Militarum soldier that meets them is a traitor or not - previously, they used to contradict each other;</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3">Act II</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> During the conversation with the Fabricator-Censor on Kiava Gamma, it was possible to motivate Abelard and Argenta multiple times, and Abelard's response was incorrectly showing as spoken by the Forgefiend - fixed;</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Act III</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> In the first dialogue with Nocturne of Oblivion, the Rogue Trader will now remember if the lore (xenos) check during the trial was passed and the Lord Captain already figured out the nature of this mysterious figure;<br/></li><li> The Rogue Trader can no longer ask Nocturne of Oblivion how to find Yrliet in Act III if she was already killed;<br/></li><li> Argenta will no longer talk about the Commissar being dead if he was kept alive;<br/></li><li> Argenta will no longer complain about killing the Commissar at Comorragh if she already knows what he did;</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Act IV</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> When visiting the Watcher Station in the Lex Imperialis expansion, Idira no longer hears the whispers if she wears the Psi-Stifler;<br/></li><li> When asked about his plans for the future after completing his quest, Marazhai continued to give the old dialogue lines, still anticipating the events in the quest as if they haven't unfolded yet - fixed;<br/></li><li> Octaviana no longer talks about Jae in Act IV as if she was alive if the Rogue Trader executed her;<br/></li><li> Octaviana and Jae now actually sit visually closer during the Footfall party, as described;<br/></li><li> Incendia no longer scoops the brain of the condemned man if the Rogue Trader has already executed him;<br/></li><li> Fixed an error speaker case in one of the dialogues in Pasqal's second quest;<br/></li><li> Fixed a duplicate phrase spoken by one of the Aeldari at Quetza Temer;<br/></li><li> Fixed a case of Error Speaker in the dialogue with Chorda on Footfall;</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3">Act V</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Xavier Calcazar will no longer be surprised by the Lord Captain's arrival to the Epitaph if he was the one inviting them there;<br/></li><li> If the player is allied to Calcazar and comes to Act V on his invitation, the message from the officers that the enemy at the gate was defeated is no longer displayed;<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug that caused the dialogue about the force shield at the Epitaph to never start;</li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h2">Mechanics</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">Balance</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The amount of experience required for a level up has been exponentially increased with every level, to compensate for the player power increase through DLC and patch content;<br/><br/></li><li> A scrutinous consistency pass was made over all cases of obtaining experience in Act I, for a smoother progression;<br/><br/></li><li> Extensive review of companion starter builds to make them more effective and get rid of talents that are unfitting for their role in combat or useless for them;<br/><br/></li><li> Certain Bladedancer and Executioner abilities have seen a serious redesign and balance updates:<br/><br/><br/><b>Bladedancer - Death From Above and Death Waltz</b><br/><br/>After every jump from Death From Above or Death Waltz, the Bladedancer receives a stacking debuff of -20% Dodge and -10% STR, -10% PER up to -50% until the beginning of their next turn.<br/><br/><br/><b>Executioner - Forced Repentance</b><br/><br/>The target now takes a resistance check for every DoT type it has on itself when the ability procs. On a successful resistance check, the effect fails for that DoT type and is not applied. Typically, you’ll see about ~15-30% procs resisted, depending on target type and level.<br/><br/><br/><b>Executioner - Scourging Strikes </b><br/><br/>The formula was changed from (2*StrB) to (StrB + PerB) to reduce scaling and allow for more diverse build options.<br/><br/><b>Executioner - Where it Hurts</b><br/><br/>The effect of this ability is subject to the same resistance checks for every DoT type as described in Forced Repentance, failing to consume that DoT type on successful resistance. The target can also no longer gain new stacks of the DoT effect that was already removed with this ability, until the end of the turn.<br/><br/><b>Executioner - Carnival of Misery</b><br/><br/>This ability was completely redesigned, becoming a single-target melee attack that causes damage equal to 4x the damage from DoTs on the target. DoTs are not consumed by this attack.<br/><br/>The upgrades for Carnival Misery are now as follows:<br/><br/>Upgrade 1: Any target affected by Executioner’s DoTs can’t use armour against DoTs. Works on the target of the Carnival of Misery.<br/>Upgrade 2: Carnival of Misery effect also procs for other enemies within 6 cells.<br/>Upgrade 3: Executioner’s DoTs deal 100% more damage until the end of combat.<br/>Upgrade 4: Any DoTs on Executioner himself no longer deal damage, but heal him instead.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">General</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Astra Militarum Commander, Ministorum Priest, Navy Officer and Commissar origins have seen a massive redesign and were effectively remade from scratch to bring them in line with the newer and stronger origins;<br/><br/></li><li> Lord Captain’s Familiar will now visually change and get new abilities depending on Conviction:<br/><br/><br/>- Exclusive Iconoclast: Fanatic feature for the Servoskull Swarm added; receiving injuries or even falling unconscious no longer affects Momentum negatively while you're around the familiar;<br/><br/>- Exclusive Iconoclast: Fanatic feature for the Psyber-Raven added; staying near the familiar gradually increases characteristics and also protects from Daemons;<br/><br/>- Exclusive Iconoclast: Fanatic feature for the Cyber-Mastiff added; all allies adjacent to the familiar now restore wounds at the start of their turn and take less damage overall;<br/><br/>- Exclusive Iconoclast: Fanatic feature for the Cyber-Eagle added; by just flying past, the familiar grants its allies' defence; <br/><br/>- Exclusive Heretical: Fanatic feature for the Servoskull Swarm added; all allies around the familiar now have more AP if enough creatures have died near; <br/><br/>- Exclusive Heretical: Fanatic feature for the Psyber-Raven added; while the Overseer is in the Relaying area, all damage they'd receive is retargeted to random allies instead; <br/><br/>- Exclusive Heretical: Fanatic feature for the Cyber-Mastiff added; the familiar now deals additional Fire damage and can't miss the Burning targets; <br/><br/>- Exclusive Heretical: Fanatic feature for the Cyber-Eagle added; the familiar now makes the Obstructed targets even more effective against their own allies; <br/><br/>- Exclusive Dogmatic: Fanatic feature for the Servoskull Swarm added; the familiar now grants bonus Resolve to all non-Xenos allies around it while also increasing all damage dealt to the enemies of Humanity;<br/><br/>- Exclusive Dogmatic: Fanatic feature for the Psyber-Raven added; once per round, relaying psy-abilities is followed by a purification blast;<br/><br/>- Exclusive Dogmatic: Fanatic feature for the Cyber-Mastiff added; successful attacks allow the familiar to survive through lethal damage; <br/><br/>- Exclusive Dogmatic: Fanatic feature for the Cyber-Eagle added; the familiar now grants Resolve and other bonuses to all non-Xenos allies;</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Added new talents to support Plasma, Webber, Arc Rifle, Aeldari and Drukhari weapons:<br/><br/><br/>- 5 new common talents for webbers - become your own friendly neighbour!<br/>- 5 new common and 1 new Pasqal-specific talents for Arc Rifles - unleash the lightning!<br/>- 3 new common, 1 Yrliet-specific and 1 Marazhai-specific talents for Aeldari/Drukhari weapons - blasphemous xenotech for the good of the Imperium.<br/>- 5 new common talents for plasma weapons -- including new and exciting AoE pattern and updated visuals;</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Added 5 new talents for Exemplar with Overseer archetype;</li></ul><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Improved Arc Rifle performance: added base weapon class bonus, reduced AP cost of shots to 1 AP<br/></li><li> Reworked plasma overheat mechanics: Overheat stacks are now visible, the explosion chance is consistent and there is both passive and more... extreme methods of removing heat.<br/></li><li> Added scaling for webbers with chapters;<br/></li><li> Fixed incorrect calculation for Plasma Overcharge Protocols;<br/></li><li> Consistency pass on mechanical interaction with immobilized and slowed effects inflicted by webbers;<br/></li><li> Restored missing crit damage bonus on Sniper Rifles.

There's moving scrap everywhere, lots of verticality to take advantage of, and a massive trench in the second half which leads to a big scrap dump for the final stretch.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We think this is one of the best Konvoy maps yet, and we think you'll agree once you play it a couple times 👍</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/12ac9dfc13732a526cef153d6148ed15b99737ce.gif"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">It's also got a spooky secondary lighting version:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/4db8b1cdd9ed38eb2398b0465bb913900bbecc90.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Deff Rally - Deff Gorge</b> is a DR version of Kill Konvoy - Da Gorge, after a snowfall and the area has been somewhat abandoned. The level's alternate lighting is quite striking having a sunset contrasting with the snowy ground.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Gorge makes for a great race playground, and you'll see what we mean when you play it. There's also an area that has players race through a forest, a first in Speed Freeks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/2596c12d411b84bcb4aa721df6345ca474ee645d.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/0b0ce87b0a10bd780e9a24cb39e810caf5f02993.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/f2d598885360d6c535eed4043f5a4e69e76daf5e.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e0db447dc486730af2bd5402e608ced9bea38b7e.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">DA MUSIC 🎵</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Any proppa git likes a badass tune, and our resident musicians Cave Bat have created a fantastic new tune for the main menu, so you can jam out while customizing ridez and checking stats.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Really happy with how this song turned out, so we're eager to see what da freeks think of it.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e0db447dc486730af2bd5402e608ced9bea38b7e.png"/></div><div class="bb_h2">DA STEAM DECK</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Just a quick note about steam deck, is that we've seen a severe issue reported where performance will drop to 0-3 fps for periods of time - we're assuming due to shader compilation.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This is strange because it seemed to have starting happening a couple months ago, either after one of our patches (where we didn't change anything related) or a Steam OS update.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We're investigating the issue and will try to have something done for next week's update but we can't promise anything at this time, since although we can reproduce it, it's difficult seeing what the cause is.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We'll keep you <b>Steam Deck</b> users up to date on any fixes for this.

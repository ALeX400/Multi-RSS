<div class="bb_h1">Dear players,</div><br/>We recently launched our new community-oriented platform - Focus Together - and you’ve made good use of it! ✨<br/><br/>Join <b>Focus Together</b> here:<br/><br/><br/><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.focus-entmt.com%2F" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/fec44739cc231ee0e0f0b4631eb2aa240e1fea0f.png"/></a><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">We’ve started reading your ideas, so here’s a first Q&amp;A!</div><br/>You, the players, were invited to help us improve the game by submitting your ideas and upvoting others’. And you flooded the forum with posts! Don’t feel left behind if you’ve posted feedback on Discord, Reddit, Steam, or Twitter: we also check all other platforms. But Focus Together is our main platform for feedback! We are so glad to see such enthusiasm and dedication coming from the community. <br/><br/>But these ideas are wasted if we don’t address them! So here are a few answers to your hottest topics!<br/><br/>Before you read this Q&amp;A, many of the submitted ideas are features planned for the future and have already been communicated via the roadmap. If you missed it, make sure you take note of it here: <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/a18468b9407c3de92af500bac7e0f07bdc13140d.jpg"/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">CONNECTIVITY ISSUES</div></u><br/>We know some of you are experiencing server issues, loss of saves or impossibility to connect with friends. We are ramping up our server capacity to reduce the load on them, and are working day and night to reduce the issues. This is a top priority for the team. A bigger patch is planned soon to improve this topic further, alongside new content.<br/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">AI BOTS</div></u><br/><b>Question: Bots are regularly mentioned as inefficient, making solo games significantly harder, and you suggested we work on them. According to you, they don’t participate in focusing on objectives or don’t do enough in tense situations.</b><br/><br/>Answer: Bots seem a bit passive because we don’t want them to take the spotlight from the player. However, they can sometimes be a bit too passive. In the next patch, we have a few improvements of their behavior against boss fights in the campaign. We are also considering improving their involvement during specific objectives in the campaign for a later patch.<br/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">CAMPAIGN</div></u><br/><b>Q: Veteran difficulty is said to be too hard in solo as the bots don’t help with the objectives.</b><br/><br/>A: We will adjust Veteran difficulty in a future patch. It will remain challenging but it will be slightly more fair because we will tweak AI aggressiveness on this difficulty. Other difficulties will remain untouched.<br/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">ABOUT PVE…</div></u><br/><div class="bb_h3">BALANCING</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Q: Assault is often listed as less powerful than other classes: the jump pack in PVE loses its versatility compared to the one in the campaign</b>.<br/></li><li> A: We are still collecting data on this issue to see how we can work on it.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: The Blocking weapon trait is seen by the community as a bad thing for melee weapons as it removes the potential for mastery (because there is no “perfect” parry window). </b><br/></li><li> A: We fully agree that this is a bummer, and we’ll definitely make changes in a future patch.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Bolt Rifle family is underperforming while Melta Gun is considered OP</b><br/></li><li> A: We have noticed a bug where the Melta allows the user to heal above the contested health, we aim to fix this in the next patch. As for the rest of weapon balancing, we hear you, and some weapons can underdeliver on the power fantasy at higher difficulty levels. We also recognize that enemies can be too bullet spongy on higher difficulty, which is not much fun. That’s the core issue, rather than the bolters themselves. For now, we are testing some tweaks in difficulty to make the enemies have less health but keep the engaging difficulty.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">QUALITY OF LIFE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Q: You asked to be able to have several of the same class, in Operations mode. There is also frustration in matchmaking when two players want to be the same class</b>.<br/></li><li> A: For now, we are focusing on improving matchmaking so that you will not matchmake with players of the same class. This is not an easy fix, so it will take us some time to roll it out. As for using the same class, we don't want to change that rule for regular matchmaking, but we are considering it as an expansion of private lobbies in the future. It will take us time to finish it.<br/><br/></li><li><b>Q: It was observed that players tend to show toxic behaviors as they get kicked late during a game made by a group of friends to let their friend get the XP.</b> <br/></li><li> A: We understand this is unfair, and each player will receive XP based on his actual involvement in the mission.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Saved loadouts don’t include skill tree customization, making them less relevant</b>.<br/></li><li> A: This is not a priority for us at the moment.</li></ul><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/08c2fc08db5591229d46435f3671ee8d884ed1b0.jpg"/><br/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">ABOUT PVP…</div></u><br/><div class="bb_h3">MATCHMAKING</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Q: You have suggested making it possible to tag as a squad of 6.</b><br/></li><li> A: We understand this need. We want to add custom PvP lobbies and give players more control over the match (for example: frag limit, class restriction, etc.). It's not that easy to make and it takes time! So please bear with us while we work on it, and we will let you know when we have clearer visibility on when it will be released.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">BALANCING</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Q: It was brought to our attention that shock grenades are OP. Also, many of you consider melee to be underpowered.</b><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Assault is considered weak in PVP. Bulwark is overpowered in capture zones. And, Heavy is overpowered: too much damage for its durability.</b><br/></li><li> A: Regarding pvp balancing, we are currently reading and crunching the data. We don't want to make rash decisions before seeing the global picture. At the moment we are checking the most common topics such as melee balancing, shock grenades, bulwark &amp; heavy being too present in capture game modes. Expect some tweaks in the first big content patch but not before.<br/></li><li> <b>Q: No team balancing after matches creates unbalanced matches for several matches in a row.</b><br/></li><li> A: We have heard this many times, and we want to improve this in future patches. We are looking into it!</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">SPAWNING</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Q: Spawning locations can create spawn-kill situations.</b><br/></li><li> A: This will be tweaked with some parameters in a future patch. We will implement spawn protection.</li></ul><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/7a52fb9bb939884e854a211c37021a4b5b07ee02.jpg"/><br/><br/><u><div class="bb_h2">MOST UPVOTED TOPICS ON FOCUS TOGETHER</div></u><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Q: Are we getting new colors for the lenses?</b><br/></li><li> A: New lens colors are planned and coming soon in the next big patch!<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: You asked to pick the Chaos Space Marines Legions you want for every classes:</b><br/></li><li> A: There are many lore restrictions preventing us from doing this (For instance: We cannot make a sniper with a World Eater armor). It is very tricky to match armor pieces for Chaos. Armor pieces have different sizes and styles, will clip through each other, etc. Also, in PvP it is important to be able to recognize an enemy’s class, and we want to keep the visual identity of each of them. Now, we will not keep it as it is and would like to expand Chaos customization, but the reality is they won't be as modular as the Loyalist.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Many of you have asked for new classes: </b><br/></li><li> A: That is definitely something we are heavily discussing. Adding a new class is quite heavy on production as we also need to create all the customization, PVP Chaos model variant, and animation set depending on what we go for. We'll keep you updated about this topic.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: About the missing armor colors: </b><br/></li><li> A: We aim to expand specific color masks, such as hand, decals or facemask, in upcoming patches. We will be adding all successor chapters eventually. ;) <br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Adding new melee weapons: </b><br/></li><li> A: New melee weapons would definitely be an extremely cool addition. Making a weapon and designing it is fine, but we need to make all finisher animations for it. It will take time.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Customizing your Marine’s face: </b><br/></li><li> A: Not a quick fix, but we will add an option to change your Marine’s face!<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Optimizing PvP Crossplay: </b><br/></li><li> A: We need more time to discuss that. Custom PvP lobbies will solve a good part of the issue.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Thunderhawk Customization: </b><br/></li><li> A: Doing full Battlebarge and Thunderhawk customization is very cool but not up in our priority list. We prefer to focus our art teams on creating new maps.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Pyreblaster in PvE or PvP: </b><br/></li><li> A: We will add it but it will take time because of visual and gameplay progression. We’ll keep you updated!<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: To be able to customize the AI squad mates: </b><br/></li><li> A: Still in discussions.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Delete Custom Armor Profile: </b><br/></li><li> A: We worked on this. In the next patch, you will be able to overwrite a custom preset with a default one.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: FoV Slider and Left / Right Shoulder swap: </b><br/></li><li> A: FoV slider is not something we are comfortable with, as it can degrade the visual aspect of the game. And on top of that, it is very complex. Our game is not a first person shooter, the camera that we have is very cinematic and constantly changes position and FoV based on what you are doing. Still, we understand that is a very popular request so we are considering it anyway. <br/></li><li> As for the shoulder swap,if we are to implement shoulder swap we will need to support it for all melee animations and transitions because everything in melee combat was made based on the fact that you hold pistol in the left hand and melee weapon in the right hand (because it looks badass). Nevertheless, shoulder swap is a feature we will not add in the game.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: Get rid of class restriction on cloaks and tabards:</b><br/></li><li> A: These are part of class identity; you get to recognize snipers because of those elements.<br/><br/></li><li> <b>Q: I-Frames on gun-strikes: </b><br/></li><li> A: Gun-strikes are a risk/reward action, and it is very easy to spam. We specifically did not put an i-frame on it for balancing reasons, and we are not looking to change this intention.</li></ul><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/cc3aed7958211debea435753e0cc3a461dae6b59.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">We hope this first batch of Q&amp;As has answered your hot topics!

It’s a lightning-fast marvel born from Ork innovation. It can punch a warp tunnel through reality, to quickly cross the battlefield, leaving chaos and destruction in its wake.<br/><br/>In Speed Freeks, the Shokkjump Dragsta uses its speed to convince the enemy that it’s everywhere on the battlefield all at once. That, combined with its range, makes it a menace that will always find a way to get a shot in on you. There’s no escape.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/77df52c06c9393d7e41d96e4808649148a26cbb4.png"/><br/>With the the Shokkjump Dragsta, you are fast, and so you can be anywhere you choose. The most important part of playing this vehicle is keeping an open eye for opportunities and using your speed to be where you’re needed. Whether it’s flying to the front lines and helping take out key targets or going back to help your own allies stay alive.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Abilities</div><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/1802e7f25de932e3d2285ded3dcc33a9ffb4bcbf.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><br/><b>Shokk Rifle -</b> The Shokk Rifle delivers accurate, long-range damage thanks to its targeting Squig.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/cd5e461a26cfac01250d4cc63ee0db62b9435bdc.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><br/><b>Rokkit Launcha -</b> Fire a burst of explosive Rokkits at the targeted vehicle.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/522c88d555a5ec297bcab5b0806d9a775b25ae5e.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><br/><b>Shokk Tunnel -</b> The Shokkjump Dragsta zooms forward, shrouded by its shokk technology and temporarily invisible to other players.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/10f81d44f5ff8313ee330da0d2389ace04f7e7fa.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><br/><b>Dash -</b> The vehicle lunges violently forward and smashes enemies. The direction you are aiming at determines where the vehicle will go.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/27efc4db2f9d3ad7a446fd677a490fa47095699c.png"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>Keeping up your speed is important as the Shokkjump Dragsta, make sure to alternate between using your boost, Shokk Tunnel and Dash to keep the speed up. Your Rokkit Launcha fires homing missiles and can reach people who hide behind corners.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/82dc50357e247821ef99b629fa8b3e018a0a731f.gif"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Team-Ups</div> <b>Deffkilla Wartrike –</b> Using the range of your Shokk Rifle you can help soften up enemies while your friendly Deffkilla Wartrike goes in for the kill. Sometimes, they will survive with very low health and using your speed there’s no way they can escape.<br/><br/><b>Looted Wagon –</b> Keep an eye on who your Looted Wagon is shooting at. When they get an enemy low on health, they’ll drive away to hide. Using your speed and range you can pick of targets as they try to recover.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c0616ad3070d44f66ccc656e58bc979f7b1482be.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Good Against </div><b>Boomdakka Snazzwagon –</b> With the low mobility of the Boomdakka Snazzwagon you can use your speed to get behind them and decide when to fight them and when to get away. It will not be fast enough to chase you, nor the range to hit you.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Weak Against </div><br/><b>Deffkilla Wartrike –</b> Be careful of the Deffkilla Wartrike as they can use its Hook to keep up with you or bring you to a stop. As you cannot shoot backwards, having a Deffkilla Wartrike chasing you down can prove fatal without support. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c322f0610c70559ada8b5083dd79ff56d259c764.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>On behalf of Caged Element and PLAION, we’z shoutin’ a big WAAAGH!

Today, we're rolling out Hotfix 5.2.4 to address a specific issue that has been affecting some of you during your Warriors of Chaos campaigns.<br/> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resolves a crash to desktop (CTD) that could occur when pressing the 'Choose Path' button in the 'Path to Glory' panel.</li></ul>We know how frustrating crashes can be, especially when you're deep into the chaos of battle, and we appreciate your patience while we worked to get this fix out to you.<br/> <br/>Additionally, we want to provide some clarity regarding a note from Hotfix 5.2.3: "The AI-controlled Lord will no longer withdraw when ambushed if it has a good chance of winning." The change is not specific to Lords. The correct information is that the battle AI will not withdraw when ambushed if its army has at least 75% of the attacker's army strength. Army strength is calculated by the sum of its units' strength. While this unit strength value is not visible to players, it is a key factor in AI decision-making, greatly enhancing its battle strategies in many situations.<br/> <br/>We are also aware of a separate issue, not addressed in this fix, where an army may retreat in battle after already retreating earlier in the same turn, causing the entire army to be wiped out. We are actively investigating this and appreciate your reports and feedback on the matter.<br/> <br/>As always, thank you for your continued support and feedback—it helps us keep improving the game. If you run into any new issues after updating to 5.2.4, please report them in our dedicated bug reporting sub-forum.<br/> <br/>See you on the battlefield!<br/><br/>—The <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><hr/><hr/><div class="bb_h1">⚠ IMPORTANT</div><hr/><hr/><br/>If you experience any issues after downloading the update, please take a moment to <b>Verify the integrity of the game files</b> first to ensure there were no issues when downloading. A step-by-step guide can be found in this article.<br/><br/>If the issues persist, please visit our support site for additional troubleshooting steps and assistance.<br/><br/><hr/><hr/><div class="bb_h1">🧱 MOD WARNING</div><hr/><hr/><br/>Please note that user-generated mods may have compatibility issues with new game updates. If you are encountering performance or stability issues following a release, is recommended that you disable any mods you're running.

Lord Captain! <br/><br/>It's been over eight months since the game released. During this time, we've turned to you more than once for advice on how to make your journey more comfortable. The post-release survey was one such occasion. An astounding 15241 people took part in it, which, according to our esteemed Lexmechanics' calculations, took them a collective total of 335302 minutes to complete. <br/><br/>We immensely appreciate the effort you're putting into further improving the game. Based on the survey results, we've already fixed numerous “sore spots” such as the behaviour of the cargo interface in the game's third act, or the miscalculated difficulty levels in skill checks. As a thank you for the work you've done, we're going to share the most interesting community perspectives that were reflected in the survey results. <br/><br/>With a passion for all things precise, as is typical of any servant of the Omnissiah, our Lexmechanics have drawn up a report for you that is rich in intriguing correlations and captivating data tables:<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Introductory Notes</div><br/>Worth mentioning first is the fact that by four months after release, more than half of all survey participants had clocked over a hundred hours in the game. That might’ve been surprising if the player base didn't consist overwhelmingly of CRPG fans. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/71c032bea871693540e4ab12f0930349d2586f20.png"/><br/>We knew that releasing a game in the Warhammer 40,000 universe meant submitting it to the scrutiny of demanding critics. A mere 7% had no or only cursory experience with the setting. We enjoy assuming the role of guides on the journey to the dark future, and we are proud to say that players trust us with the job: a whopping 96% of captains had their expectations of the setting's atmosphere met, to the incredible delight of the Warhammer fans among the game's creators. But enough bragging! On to the more fascinating facts, as well as some disconcerting ones.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Interface</div><br/>Regardless of whether a Rogue Trader was a Dogmatic or followed one of the Radical paths, all of them equally disliked loot-related hassles, be it their ship's cargo management or their party's inventory. The organising, the sorting, the tedium of managing a huge number of items, and especially the situations where stolen loot would, upon recovery, return to a bag instead of where it had previously belonged, were things that frustrated our players a great deal. We've fixed some of those problems and are still working on others. <br/><br/>It's worth noting that while most Rogue Traders were torn between Puritanism and Radicalism, 89 among them preferred to altogether skip delving into the value system.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Ground Combat</div><br/>While picking through loot was a mostly unrewarding experience, obtaining it was quite another matter. On average, players gave the ground-combat system 4.3 points out of five, which surpassed the Beta rating for this metric. <br/><br/>57% of participants thought the Lord Captain had been through just the right number of ordeals. Among the rest, opinions were split between those who'd prefer more ordeals and those who envisioned a more peaceful life for the protagonist. Luckily for the Rogue Trader, the well-wishers outnumbered the daredevils nearly two-to-one.<br/><br/>We'd always known that Warrants of Trade were granted only to Humanity's bravest. But this time, they showed themselves to be quite deft as well. Players who opted to skip the character-build part and go straight for the Story mode were satisfied with the challenges they faced. For their part, those who started the game on a higher difficulty level would’ve preferred to challenge yet fiercer foes than the ones they actually encountered. Indeed, the higher the difficulty a player selected, the likelier they were to report a dearth of worthy opponents. Worry not! Our latest major update has made significant changes to the balance of archetypes. Perhaps now the Imperium's enemies will present a serious hurdle in your path.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/f3ec1fdcf4ffa719104351324244b5a755f0880b.png"/><br/>Speaking of archetypes, in the survey, we asked you lots of questions about your characters' combat abilities. These were the results: over 60% of survey participants got a taste of Exemplar, the third tier in a character's career. Other archetypes available earlier in the game saw yet greater use, with the top spots going to Soldier and Officer, which had some form of involvement in the Lord Captain's adventures in over 90% of cases.<br/>Soldier and Officer also topped the list of audience-favourite archetypes. Great Strategist came bottom of that list, their difficult-to-execute stratagems earning many an indignant comment.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/681fea00d72defa0a88da1ee8a2e31115c84892a.png"/><br/>Notably, the special abilities players deemed to be the most powerful (and perhaps overpowered) were Arch-Militant's Wildfire, Soldier's Rapid Fire, and Assassin's Death Whisper. Operative's Intimidation was deemed the weakest.<br/><br/>When it came to key mechanics, Officer shone once again with their ability to grant an extra turn to an ally. You liked both the mechanics and the spirit of this archetype's abilities.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/85b6b3f5bb059a28fe0957e5b1bd02af3da7069c.png"/><br/><br/>However, there'd be no point in any of those skills without someone to use them on, now would there? Who among the Rogue Trader and their retinue's opponents emerged as the most popular one, and who as the most detested? Alas, these questions cannot be answered without spoilers. But if you've conquered the Koronus Expanse before, you could probably make a guess, and it would probably be correct.<br/><br/><span class="bb_spoiler"><span>We don't know what the exact reason was, between the earliness of the encounter, the pesky sniper on the roof, the untiring parries, and the endless attempts to preserve each of the three shuttles, but there's no doubt that Aurora, also known as the Chaos Space Marine, won the hearts of the largest number of Rogue Traders.</span></span><br/><br/><span class="bb_spoiler"><span>Edge of Daybreak and his gang were the next biggest favourite. Forgefiend closes the top three.</span></span><br/><br/>Interestingly, most of the negative combat experiences were caused by encounters that involved no bosses or named characters. Case in point, mid-flight battles.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Character Creation</div><br/>Creating and customising a character is a key aspect of any role-playing game. To make sure no Rogue Trader lacked in individually tailored options, we added over 500 talents to the game! Many players hinted that we might have tried too hard there... Thus 37% of participants would have liked the options to be fewer. The same percentage said the number of options matched their expectations. There were also those who didn't find enough variety, but the former two outnumbered these four to one.<br/><br/>As for the Rogue Trader's Origin, the majority's preference leaned firmly toward Sanctioned Psyker. Voidborn Psyker was therefore the most popular combination, ahead by almost a third of the runner-up, Imperial World Noble.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/6ad55f7d121aec523261ff8ed6a0b98cb4bbae5a.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Companions and NPCs</div><br/>We've asked you before to share your first impressions of the companions, and the poll results were quite unambiguous: Argenta led in every category! Although she's still a favourite, the Lord Captain has by now had the opportunity to form a more comprehensive picture of their retinue's other members.<br/><br/>This time around, we looked at the following criteria in our companions: interesting story, dialogue, and interactions; mechanical efficiency; best romance; and most attractive. Let's go through these in order.<br/><br/>The Rogue Trader's loyal Seneschal emerged as their most interesting companion. This choice surprised us and would probably surprise Abelard himself! He'd most likely be flattered too. <br/>Pasqal's <i>multifaceted</i> personality also got its fair share of attention.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/3c6d75ad410fe2cce9fb7bac414c333d6c38ea4c.png"/><br/>Owing to her unique origin, Cassia came first in combat efficiency.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/5f177bc2ecdb6fcae7831a9dcdf8041853b36e85.png"/><br/>Her heart-stealing efficiency put her in the lead as well. And keep this document far from the Inquisition's eyes, for Yrliet and Marazhai were a very close second and third. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/b90c1e04c86fcc5851336f0431b137a05cf187a5.png"/><br/>Naturally, these statistics would've been incomplete without Argenta taking at least one of the top spots. Her fervour in combat and her zealous smile won over many.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/5501ebd689509354ddc231cb7c73d2aece7bc73e.png"/><br/>Now what about those who can only be observed from the sidelines? We left this as a free-form question so that participants could name whatever non-player character they wanted as their favourite. After meticulously sifting through over 5,000 comments, we had the following top ten: a Koronus Expanse All Stars according to the heir of House von Valancius.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/dbe7791dd4dd34b337bdd73440d6c304f03b850c.png"/><br/>There's a high likelihood that the vote results might have been altered by an organisation we've been unable to trace. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion</div><br/>As the cogitators hum and the Lexmechanics rhythmically count off the figures, the time to part has crept unnoticed upon us.

It pits two teams of eight against each other in a race to capture points. The first one there, scores big for their team.  <br/><br/>Getting there first is, on paper, the easy part. You and your team then must hold the capture point as the enemy arrives, and the frenzy of bullets unfurls. Holding the point increases how many points you earn. Control is easy to lose, so keeping the capture point is crucial for victory. <br/><br/>Eventually, the point is secured, and a mad dash to reach and dominate the next point begins.  <br/> <br/>When all Capture points have been fought over, a final high Orktane race to the finish line beings to see who‚Äôs the ultimate speedy Ork. Your placement in the final race will decide how many points you earn, so it‚Äôs all about getting there faster than your opponents. Death, naturally, will slow you down.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/612062d68d7a35884219a907993bdfcb1b59ba2c.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>Each vehicle has unique roles and abilities that come to life in Deff Rally. We can‚Äôt wait to see how you play it and evolve the game-mode. Here‚Äôs some examples of how vehicles can be played in Deff Rally. <br/><br/><b>Boomdakka Snazzwagon ‚Äì</b> With the Snazzagon being better in mid-close ranges, it excels when on the offense taking back the point or getting into the heart of the enemy team. <br/><br/><b>Defkilla Wartrike ‚Äì</b> Because the Deffkilla Wartrike will struggle if it sits still on a capture point, you will often see it drive around taking down key enemy targets, such as Rukkatrukk Squigbuggies or long ranged vehicles. <br/><br/><b>Shokkjump Dragsta ‚Äì</b> The Shokkjump Dragsta is fast, so getting to the next objective first, or winning the race is where the Shokkjump Dragsta really shines. <br/><br/><b>Kustom Boosta Blasta ‚Äì</b> With some of the best mid to long ranges, chipping away at enemies while they‚Äôre approaching the capture point is a specialty of this vehicle. Soften them up for your team. <br/><br/><b>Looted Wagon ‚Äì</b> With heavy damage at long range, one well-placed shot from the Looted Wagon can decide if a push onto the point will succeed or not. <br/><br/><b>Grot Mega Tank ‚Äì</b> As the heaviest of the bunch, dislodging a Grot Mega Tank from the point after they‚Äôve gotten settled is a struggle. Hold the point while your team is focused on stopping the enemy attack is where the Grot Mega Tank excels. <br/><br/><b>Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy ‚Äì</b> Don't underestimate the Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy because they can quickly get their team back to full health and ready for the next enemy push onto the point. Recovering your teams' health stops them from being krumped and ultimately delayed while respawning. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c603ec0a4576ad8b56527c5b6ea0076f2baf2ddb.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>Your feedback this past year has helped us balance and shape Deff Rally into what you will see with August 6th release. <br/><br/>This game mode will continue to evolve with your feedback so don‚Äôt hesitate to leave your thoughts over on our feedback and bug reporting board: https://speedfreeks40k.featureupvote.com/ <br/><br/>With four maps available on early access release, and changes to the ones you know we‚Äôre excited to get you back in as fast as possible! <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/cf69ebec1314f26aef699ada21bfa45f7a8651c2.png"/><br/>On behalf of Caged Element and PLAION, we‚Äôz shoutin‚Äô a big WAAAGH!

We‚Äôre very aware that it‚Äôs one of the most awaited information on the game, and we will come back to you within the next couple of weeks with the recommended and minimum specs.</li></ul></li></ul><br/><div class="bb_h3"><b>What‚Äôs next in August?</b></div><br/>We know you‚Äôre super thirsty for more content so be assured that you do not need to worry, you can expect more videos to pop up on our YouTube and social media channels (Discord, Twitter, Facebook). <br/>Talking about videos, we‚Äôre currently publishing on our secondary channel a series of short videos detailing some aspects of the game: weapons, enemies, environments‚Ä¶ <br/><br/>You'll find the complete playlist <b>here</b>.<br/><br/>Amongst the upcoming short videos, there will be more weapons, a rundown of the different PvE classes, and more!<br/><br/>On top of that, you can expect co-op previews to start dropping during August, with content creators starting publishing videos on their side as well. <br/><br/>Next, we‚Äôll detail the post-launch content of Space Marine 2 in a blog article that should be published around mid-August.<br/><br/>Finally, we‚Äôre reaching the final stages of our North America Tour, with Chicago (August 16-18) and Toronto (August 22-25) being the final places where you‚Äôll be able to put your hands on Space Marine 2‚Äôs demo before the release. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/1775b7d9acd2d9d530728b5ab5361daa9a3ab05f.jpg"/><br/><br/>Aaand that‚Äôs it for this month!

A mid-ranged vehicle who lays down Dakka upon the battlefield from afar and uses their utility to stay at a distance. <br/><br/>In Speed Freeks this versatile vehicle allows for a lot of different playstyles to suit the scenarios you find yourself in. Whether it‚Äôs using your mobility to help out with objectives, laying down fire on the battlefield, helping to pick off key targets or putting pressure on the enemy tanks.<br/><br/>The base speed of this vehicle is average, tied with the Boomdakka Snazzwagon. However, the Burna Exhaust ability is a strong movement tool that opens a lot of possibilities, such as jumping onto a roof to escape enemies, getting extra airtime to recharge your boost bar, or using Dash right as you land to convert vertical speed into horizontal speed. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/b09f0fbdabff31ddd0d90ffe6e1290afadc13069.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Abilities</div><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c92d9b0654284f8bf398169b2199225006cf54ac.png"/><br/><b>Rivet Kannon </b><br/>This fearsome tool-turned-weapon fires a thunderous hail of heated rivets. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/0e303f935d8c5c8569613e8ff6105caf47c9ce3f.png"/><br/><b>Stikkbomb </b><br/>Hurl a Stikkbomb ‚Äãto damage and disrupt enemy vehicles. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/d1486798446edb272631dbef4ef558bc29c0b991.png"/><br/><b>Burna Exhaust </b><br/>An explosion of flame‚Äã from the exhausts‚Äã lifts the Kustom Boosta-Blasta off the ground. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/4346af90da9a6945385d1ba4948228ea4512fdb0.png"/><br/><b>Dash </b><br/>The vehicle lunges violently forward and smashes enemies. The direction you are aiming determines where the vehicle will go. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e57a81468738a0f5e750742154d74a58cc20f19f.png"/><br/><br/>Managing your range is key to playing the Kustom Boosta-Blasta. Never get too close to close ranged opponents, and never be too far away from long ranged opponents. As the Kustom Boosta-Blasta you are useful at many different ranges, use it to your advantage and be at the range your opponents are weak at. <br/><br/>Use your utility to keep opponents at the distance you want them at. Throw the grenade to throw them off their track or jump up to high ground where they can‚Äôt reach you. You decide where you want to fight. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/ec50a319871e11ed3ff2f181a3e6a940b3281d1f.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Team-Ups</div><b>The Snazzwagon</b> and Boosta-Blasta are a potent combo, with both vehicles having escape and/or disorientation abilities in Billowing Smoke and the Stikkbomb. This duo can be frustrating for the opposition ‚Äì and fun for those driving them.   <br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Good Against </div><b>Looted Wagon ‚Äì</b> Using walls and terrain you can stay out of enemy fire, while putting pressure on the Looted Wagon.

This was caused by the game subtracting the previous tribute from the income without resetting the tribute value, leading to repeated incorrect deductions. We missed this specific issue initially, but we believe this updated solution resolves all related problems.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue with the 'Continue Campaign' button in Launcher not continuing the campaign, and instead redirecting to the main game screen.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash that occurred when players overcast a spell while commanding a unit with multiple shot types in battle. This issue was identified and resolved thanks to detailed reports from our community forums!<br/></li><li> Fixed the following abilities not affecting units that were not nearby when the battle began:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Rune of Stoicism<br/></li><li> Ancestor Rune<br/></li><li> Rune of Courage<br/></li><li> Spirit Conduit (Hierotitan)</li></ul></li><li> Fixed an issue when the general was removed from the military force, the unit would become a colonel and be treated by the UI like a hero rather than a normal unit.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where river crossing battle maps would not trigger when fighting on river crossings or alongside rivers on the Immortal Empires campaign map.<br/></li><li> Fixed rendering issues with Pistoliers unit which would result the rider model not being visible.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where playing custom battles as Daemons of Chaos, using the Shadow Legion colour scheme, the army abilities would be missing.<br/></li><li> Fixed plate armor opacity issues with several Empire units.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug when moving Thorek on Anvil mount in campaign, which would lead to his model tilting backwards during the move animation.<br/></li><li> Explosive ammunition for Hochland Long Rifles no longer reduces penetration value from 1 to 0.<br/></li><li> Tempest from the Lore of High Magic now matches its visual duration at 17 seconds for both regular and overcast.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Dark Elf buildings that reduce slave count only functioned correctly when constructed by the player. Captured settlements with pre-existing economic buildings did not reduce slave count until these buildings were upgraded or replaced. This fix ensures that the slave count reduction feature works as intended immediately upon acquiring such buildings.<br/></li><li> Fixed a crash in multiplayer campaign games where completing the Changeling Cult building "Ravaging Host" in another player's settlement would cause the game to crash. This was due to a Lua error in the script that was meant to trigger a dilemma for the player upon discovering the cult.<br/></li><li> Fixed some instances of skills that penalise enemy hero success chance instead being granted to the enemy, making them penalise your success chance.<br/></li><li> Fixed issue where a placeholder icon would show on some Shadowy Dealing actions.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where a military force with plague was able to get infected and lost its ability to use the switching plagues mechanic.<br/></li><li> Fixing an audio issue with the Mechanical Steed mount which was not triggering surface appropriate footsteps.<br/></li><li> After a long tug-of-war with his rot beast, Kayzk has finally recovered his blade, which he now wields in all its disgusting glory.<br/></li><li> One player watching the Immortal Empires flyby will no longer block the other players' actions, sometimes causing desync.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the chance of a magic item dropping or being stolen was not being correctly modified by effects on Heroes embedded in the army.<br/></li><li> The Black Staff item's bound power of darkness now matches regular power of darkness.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> +0.3 winds per second.<br/></li><li> +does equivalent self damage.</li></ul></li><li> Added missing page-turning sound effects for Blue Scribes.<br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where armies would get replenished to 100% after being defeated and sacked. Now they will be replenished only by the desired amount of 25%.<br/></li><li> Added missing lava and portal sound effects to Bleeding Spire map.</li></ul><br/>Thanks for all of your bug reports and feedback, all of which have been extremely valuable in helping our teams investigate and resolve issues as quickly as possible!

Greetings folks!<br/> <br/>Back in June I sat down with Rich, Sean and Victor from the WARHAMMER III development team to share some juicy new details on what's coming to the game in the next DLC, as well as our approach to interim patches coming between now and the next DLC's arrival. In case you've been living under an Ogre-sized rock these past couple of months, you can check it out right here.<br/> <br/>Recently I hopped back on the sofa to chat with Rich and Sean, plus Design Director Mitch Heastie, to chat more about what's coming in 6.0 get some insight on what sort of content you can also expect to see in our future interim patches.<br/> <br/>Allow your eyes to absorb it here:<br/><br/>
<iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTHkI2GSVJw?fs=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" width="850"></iframe>
<br/><br/>As with last time, this is a pretty new format for us, so please do share your thoughts with us along with any suggestions on what you'd like to see more of next time!<br/><br/>You can also head over to the official Discord server and the CA Community to share your hopes and dreams regarding future refreshes and reworks. Who knows, maybe Mitch will agree with you and make some magic happen!<br/><br/>We aim to be back with more news on our next major patch, 5.3, towards the end of October, so until then, we'll see you on the battlefield!<br/><br/>— <i>Steve // Senior Community Manager</i><br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

Now, after razing, an attacking army will move away one hex beyond the zone of control radius, while a surviving army will move three hexes away from the settlement. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where playing as Slaanesh and using the ‘Pleasure Hunt’ pleasurable activity could sometimes apply its effects multiple times. <br/></li><li> The Star-Metal Talons upgrade in Ikit Claw's Forbidden Workshop no longer grants vanguard deployment to Warp Grinder units, as they already have this attribute. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where effects providing immunity or damage resistance to attrition also affected desertion, such as in cases of bankruptcy. <br/></li><li> The Elector Count of Hochland position no longer provides a movement range bonus twice.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">​ABILITIES/SKILLS/TRAITS</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Hero units that join Cathay caravans will now have spells or abilities where appropriate. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where upgrading a Chaos Sorcerer (Death) to a Nurgle Chaos Sorcerer (Death) would result in gaining the wrong trait. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where some effects meant for Nurgle characters were incorrectly applied to the Slaanesh Chaos Sorcerer.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">ANCILLARIES</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ​The Experimental Explosive item gained from Cathay caravans can now be transferred to other characters. </li></ul><div class="bb_h3">​TECH TREE</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where researching the ‘Grand Throne Chamber’ technology would unlock the Dwarf Lord ‘Mikael Leadstrong,’ who is meant to be obtained through legendary grudges. </li></ul><div class="bb_h3">RECRUITMENT</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ​The effects of different levels of province control no longer impact recruitment costs for Tomb Kings, as they do not incur recruitment costs. <br/></li><li> Character recruitment from buildings like The Deeps &amp; Gardens of Morr was overriding normal character recruitment. Now, only the recruitment option with the highest lord rank will be displayed.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">MISSIONS/VICTORY CONDITIONS </div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where some missions would double their settlement count when reloading saves. </li></ul>​<br/><div class="bb_h3">CAMPAIGN UI/UX </div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where Harmony effects on buildings would display as a negative value when adding Yin. <br/></li><li> Added help page buttons to the Nurgle Plagues and Tamurkhan's Chieftains panels. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where players couldn't undo spent skill points for heroes. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the Spices UI panel displayed landmarks alongside resource buildings at the Fortress of Dawn. <br/></li><li> Removed text references in the help pages to Chaos factions automatically declaring war to align with the intended design. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the help pages would open behind the Bloodlines panel when playing as Vampire Counts. <br/></li><li> Fixed a display issue with army zone of control where old VFX instances remained after moving an army in ambush stance. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the scroll position in the Allied Recruitment panel would reset when selecting a unit from an outpost as the first unit to be recruited; the scroll now stays in its correct position after selecting a unit, improving the recruitment flow. <br/></li><li> Clicking on the pin of a recruitable unit card should now correctly pin/unpin the card. <br/></li><li> Tweaked the entry in the effect lists of the Item Gained event popup to resolve occasional text bleeding issues in the UI. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the Athel Loren landmark buildings did not display the landmark icon or tooltip. <br/></li><li> Resolved an issue where clicking on Pieces of Eight mission scrolls as the Vampire Coast incorrectly navigated to the Missions panel. The scrolls now correctly direct players to the Pieces of Eight panel, ensuring smoother navigation during treasure hunts.</li></ul>​<div class="bb_h3">CAMPAIGN ENVIRONMENT</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue on the campaign map where a horse in the Tor Saroir region (Averlorn start position) was clipping through an altar, improving visual consistency in the area. </li></ul><div class="bb_h2">BATTLE</div> <br/><div class="bb_h3">​GENERAL/GAMEPLAY</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where High Elf towers and some of the walls behind them would disappear after being destroyed in siege battles, while still functioning as intact barriers. Towers now leave rubble behind, and walls remain visible post-destruction. <br/><i><b>DEV NOTE:</b> We are aware of ongoing related issues with other High Elves siege map destruction and are continuing to investigate. </i><br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the enemy reinforcements displayed in the Event Message did not match those shown in the Objectives Panel for the Battle for the Armour of Glimril Scales quest battle. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the Altar of Spawns settlement was not using the Norsca minor settlement battle map.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">​BATTLE AI</div>​<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The AI is now less likely to use the General unit for solo harassment or outflanking. <br/></li><li> The AI-controlled Lord will no longer withdraw when ambushed if it has a good chance of winning. <br/></li><li> Fixed pathfinding on certain river maps to prevent the AI from attempting to cross through the water. <br/></li><li> Fixed a rare bug where enemy units were routing toward the player's units. <br/></li><li> Now, the reinforcements AI will join the fight more quickly if the main army is engaged in melee. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the AI was attempting to go to the river while the enemy was already on the same side. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the defending AI was constantly reforming in land battles. <br/></li><li> Now, the AI will attempt to synchronize the river assault groups based on the player’s positioning when passing through different crossings.<br/><i><b>DEV NOTE:</b> Previously, if the player was defending at only one location, the AI would lose units while those crossing at another location did not engage in combat. Now, the first group will wait until the second group crosses the river, allowing them to attack together.</i></li></ul><div class="bb_h3">UNITS GENERAL / ANIMATIONS</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where Razorgor would move too far from the chariot during one of the attack animations. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the Daemon Prince of Khorne was missing one of the weapons during flying attack animations. <br/></li><li> Hans Valhirsson, the ghost dwarf, is no longer allowed to appear in ranked armies. <br/></li><li> Resolved an issue where parts of the Reiksguard and Empire Knights' helmets would disappear when viewed from behind at different levels of detail (LODs) during battles. <br/></li><li> Resolved an issue with the High Elf Princess's torso and arm armor textures distorting at certain LOD, ensuring consistent visual quality at different camera distances. <br/></li><li> Fixed the missing arm and blackened cape of High Queen Khalida at LOD3 and LOD4 levels. <br/></li><li> Fixed the visual problems with the leg armor of the Steed of Slaanesh model at different LODs. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the Lahmian Vampire Lord's head texture does not appear correctly at certain LOD levels.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">ENVIRONMENT</div>​<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Addressed several visual issues, including missing objects, texture problems, floating objects on the Badlands Wastelands map and Ice Witch Mountains – Kislev Mountains map, misplaced assets in the Haunted Forest, Dragon River Run, Black Ark, and pixelated fallen trees on the Baron’s Bluff map, among others. <br/></li><li> Moved certain objects out of the playable area on the Parched Pass - Southlands Mountains map to align with the intended design. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where an ogre camp battle map would occasionally load incorrectly in the Badlands marsh area of the campaign map. <br/></li><li> Fixed a lighting issue in the Battle of the Great Hall of Greasus. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where ground units could be deployed mid-air on the Karak Azgaraz – Dwarfs map. <br/></li><li> Fixed camera collision issues with certain assets, including those in multiplayer maps.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">​BATTLE UI/UX</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ​The unit card for 'The Big One' in Thorek Ironbrow's quest battle, 'Klad Brakak,' is now correct. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the Unit Info UI element would not appear during replays if it had been disabled during the actual battle; players can now toggle unit details in replays, so they are no longer stuck with the settings from the most recent battle.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">MULTIPLAYER</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where the battle difficulty selected in the multiplayer campaign lobby would change by one tier for each player when the campaign started. <br/></li><li> It is no longer possible to issue orders to a military force while a player is selecting a new general for the orphaned army.</li></ul><hr/><br/><br/>As always, thanks for your bug reports and feedback.

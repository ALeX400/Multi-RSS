<div class="bb_h1">Hello Everyone,</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Alongside the release of the Arbites Class on June 23, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide will also receive a free update, dubbed Battle for Tertium.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">New Player Journey</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The core player experience has been reworked to provide a new clearer narrative focus, following the conflict of the Battle for Tertium. Players will now experience a linear campaign with new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. This new progression path is designed to ease in new players and gradually unlock features that were previously gated by character level. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">While previously each new player’s experience was completely random, the Battle for Tertium narrative presents maps, enemies and characters in a specific order, allowing players to discover all aspects of the game at a much better pace.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The story missions play the same as regular missions, except that these missions have a more tight control over which enemies spawn. You might also hear some new VO lines during missions, and some brand new mission debrief cinematics when completing each mission.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Existing players with characters at level 10 or higher can choose to skip the story or play it from the beginning</b>. Players who change their minds about playing the campaign can opt out by using the Personality Scourge at the Chirurgeon. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">Mission Board Rework</div><p class="bb_paragraph">A new mission board system will be bringing several changes to how you engage with missions and difficulties. Missions are no longer tied to a specific difficulty, allowing you to select a mission and then choose the difficulty you want. This will effectively increase the amount of mission options available for players of all difficulty levels. While most circumstances remain consistent across difficulty levels, some are disabled on lower difficulties. Notably, Maelstrom missions are exclusive to the Heresy and Auric difficulties.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Additionally, the difficulty system has also been overhauled. You now unlock new difficulties by completing missions rather than leveling up your characters. You must prove your skills at your current maximum difficulty to unlock access to the next one. We intend to create a motivation for new players to master the game step by step, and for veteran players to feel assured that their teammates have earned the right to be there.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">You will make progress by playing missions at your current maximum difficulty. Completing missions advances your progress. Failure reduces progress but very slightly. Additionally, you will never be demoted to a lower difficulty tier, regardless of how many missions you fail. Higher difficulties will require you to complete more missions to unlock them.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For existing characters, your difficulty progression will be migrated based on their character level and completed missions.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Auric is now a standalone difficulty tier, placed above Damnation. We felt that Auric Heresy fell in an awkward spot compared to Damnation, with the increased mission options per difficulty, we decided it was best to turn Auric into its own difficulty level. Additionally, we have removed Sedition difficulty and made a few minor changes to Uprising to take its place, as we felt there was too much downtime with too few enemies between hordes. These changes aim to keep you in the action more often.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>Mortis Trials</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>The Secrets of the Shipmistress</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Sefoni’s indiscretions are getting worse! During Mortis Trials, keen-eared Rejects now have the opportunity to sift pieces of Shipmistress Brahms’ past from the psychic chatter. How did she inherit the Mourningstar? What is she hiding? Is she really on the same side as Grendyl, let alone his irksome busybodies? Delve deeper into all these and more across dozens of new memory echoes, unlockable by claiming victory in the Mortis Trials!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Dev Note: </b><i>If you've ever wanted to relisten to the memory echoes you've unlocked in the Mortis Trials, you should take a look behind the pillars in the meat grinder.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New difficulty for Mortis Trials</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Since the release of Mortis Trials we have noticed people requesting a higher challenge in Mortis Trials! So, we are adding a new difficulty, Auric, as well as some other small changes.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">There will now be a shorter time in between waves.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Waves will now have more enemies and enemy types increasing variety.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">We are changing the base difficulty to match an Auric difficulty mission.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">Weapon Balancing</div><p class="bb_paragraph">This initial set of balance adjustments focuses on improving underperforming weapons so they can better compete with top-tier options.

<div class="bb_h2">Hey Everyone!</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Welcome to a new series of balancing blogs for Darktide! Going forward we will be doing regular balance changes to the game alongside big updates. As part of this journey we want to include you, the community, by sharing our intended changes early on to gather feedback and ensure our intention matches your expectations. Let's begin by discussing our approach to balancing Darktide. We strive to create a balanced game environment, recognizing that perfect balance in a PvE-focused game may be unattainable and perhaps unnecessary. However, a reasonable level of balance among weapons is essential. This ensures players feel empowered to experiment with various setups and choose options that are both enjoyable and engaging for their playstyle.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This initial set of balance adjustments focuses on improving underperforming weapons so they can better compete with top-tier options. Some of these changes also pave the way for new weapons, such as the powerful signature shotgun coming with the Arbites class. Adjustments to existing shotguns were made to ensure the Arbites weapons feel satisfying without completely overshadowing their existing counterparts.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">While we are aware of some currently powerful weapons that need addressing, we chose to first elevate the lower-performing options rather than immediately nerfing the top ones.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Detailed explanations of the specific changes to each weapon are provided below. Going forward, we plan to implement more frequent balance updates to keep the game fresh, address outliers, and introduce new and interesting playstyles. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">List:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Coming changes in 1.8.0</i></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>"Devil's Claw" Swords</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Tactical Axes</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Shock Mauls</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Heavy Eviscerators</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Helbore Lasguns</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Combat Shotguns</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Double-barreled Shotgun</i></p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Catachan "Devil's Claw" Swords</div><p class="bb_paragraph">This batch of changes for the Devil’s Claw swords aims at further reinforcing the crowd control and reliability of the family.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We increased the offensive properties of the Light attack profiles, while also significantly increasing the armour damage modifiers of the Heavy Strikedown and Special Riposte profiles against specific armour types.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We improved the base Stamina statistic, reduced the minimum Block time (the amount of time that the Block stance must be maintained after performing the input) and allowed for most attacks and attack starts to be performed while sprinting.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This will make the weapon snappier and more responsive in different situations.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we took a pass on all attacks to tweak active windows, ranges and hitboxes to be better aligned with their animations.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk I</b>, we added a new Heavy Strikedown attack, only reached from Light 3. In turn, the Light 3 attack is now reachable also from the Push action, and has an increased baseline power multiplier. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">These additions will grant additional options to a mark which was lacking in single target attacks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk IV</b>, we raised the power level multiplier of the Light 4 attack as it was very far into the attack chain and not particularly enticing.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk VII</b>, we increased the power level multiplier of the Pushfollow and Light 3 attacks while also changing the possible combos after a Riposte attack.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Now after a successful Special Parry, the combo will chain into the Pushfollow attack instead of Light 3; as the Pushfollow attack still chains into Light 3, this will give the mark a new unique chain.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Catachan "Devil's Claw"

Axes</div><p class="bb_paragraph">While sporting overall good mobility, the Tactical Axes had only average Sprint values.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We significantly improved their Sprint profile, while also allowing for most attacks and attack starts to be performed while sprinting. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">We also significantly raised the damage of the Special attacks and added a new profile for the Heavy Strikedowns with a vertical or uppercut direction, with increased damage and Carapace armour modifier. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we took a pass on all attacks to tweak active windows, ranges and hitboxes to be better aligned with their animations. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk II</b>, we added a power level boost to the Light 3 attack, as it is further into the attack chain, and to both Special attacks, as they are slower compared to the other two marks. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk IV</b>, we upgraded the damage profile for both Heavy attacks and slightly lowered their chain timings, as they are both performed in a vertical or uppercut direction. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk VII</b>, we added a power level boost to all Light attacks, as they inflict a higher movement speed penalty compared to the Lights of the other marks, and changed the Heavy 2 profile to the new Heavy Strikedown. </p><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Atrox Tactical Axes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Damage profiles</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Light Assassin</p><ul

class="bb_paragraph">The Shock Mauls, while being dependable in inflicting stagger, were also below average in damage output and overall not very exciting. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">We increased the damage against the 1st target on most profiles, with a particularly large bonus to the Heavy Strikedown and Special attacks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We also enhanced the base Stamina template, and tweaked hitboxes and active windows of some attacks to better align with their animations. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the attacks with an uppercut direction (Light 3 on the <b>Mk Ia</b> / Light 4 on the <b>Mk III</b>) we slightly delayed the start of the attack active window to make it easier to connect with weakspots. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, for the <b>Mk Ia</b>, we added power level multipliers to the Light 3 and Light 4 attacks, to make them a more enticing combo alternative to just returning to Heavy 1. </p><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes

class="bb_paragraph">The Eviscerators thunder was in part stolen by the Relic Blades, which have overall better cleave properties while also being no slouch in the single target department. </p><p

      <title>New Tools of War — Shields</title>

With the Adeptus Arbites becoming directly involved in the affairs of the von Valancius protectorate in the upcoming Lex Imperialis expansion, it is only logical to talk about their iconic tool - shields!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/e33a14703f1210f6ca0f03207ca0cf8e7d78fcce.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Defensive Capabilities Taken to a New Level</div><br/>Shields are a brand new type of equipment introduced with the Lex Imperialis expansion. They will soon become available across the whole game for all players, even those without the DLC, and will come in a variety of shapes and designs:<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/df3e0bf8bd8c3b0a388358a855bf96f30b2721e0.jpg"/><br/><br/>Shields are considered a special kind of one-handed melee weapon and take up a total of two weapon slots, one from each weapon set. You can attack, parry, and make attacks of opportunity with shields in melee, but their main purpose is suppression and negating damage. <br/><br/>And they are quite effective at that. Abelard approves!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/869f6d145437547f72ab2446c3bcb9781cb5e0f9.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Preventing the Damage</div><br/>Shields provide a new stat called <b>Block</b>, which gives the wielder a chance to completely negate the incoming attack, similar to how <b>Parry</b> and <b>Dodge</b> function (and stacking with them!). The chance to <b>block</b> is determined by the shield itself, and is not affected by the wearer’s or the attacker’s stats. It can, however, be modified by various items and talents.<br/><br/><b>Block</b> works against both melee and ranged attacks. It is especially effective against burst attacks - once any hit from a burst attack is blocked, the remaining hits are negated automatically. A blocked attack can also never overpenetrate!<br/><br/>Predictably, shields will not save you against psychic powers.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/b6904c4daf6a36252c86b7cc511d9fff541893dd.gif"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Tactical Advantages</div><br/>All archetypes have access to shields, which offers a rich layer of new tactical opportunities for defensive gameplay with dedicated tank characters. To allow for even more build variety, we’re adding multiple new universally available talents that boost shield effectiveness.<br/><br/>Here are some examples:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Shield Mastery</b> allows the shield to only occupy a slot in a single weapon set.<br/></li><li> <b>Defensive Manoeuvre</b> allows the bearer to regain <b>2 MP</b> after attacking with a shield.<br/></li><li> <b>Strong Hand</b> gives the wielder <b>+5% block</b> and allows them to deal <b>+50% </b>more damage when attacking with a shield.</li></ul><br/><b>Subductor</b>, one of the specialties of the new Arbitrator origin, is specifically designed with a shield in mind. These assault specialists have access to a set of additional talents and abilities that further boost the effectiveness of shields, such as charging forward with a shield, automatically scoring critical hits with shield attacks on immobilized or prone enemies, gaining a bonus to Toughness that scales from Block, or even reflecting enemy attacks back at them!<br/><br/>The only characters in the Lord Captain’s retinue who cannot use shields are the xenos, who rely on agility rather than this crude Imperial method of protection, Pasqal, and the mighty Ulfar, who believes that the best defense is a brutal offense.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/26d784beeecdaeac7ab543c197c08fdc4177f202.jpg"/><br/><br/>Beyond often having special effects, each shield also always provides a wielder, of any archetype, with the special ability <b>Stalwart Defence</b>. It allows them to select a zone and immediately end the turn, significantly increasing <b>block</b> chance against all enemies in that zone and making an attack of opportunity in response to the first successfully <b>blocked</b> melee attack from each of these enemies:<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/f4dfe1927eb360f22898c0d0a8f52a4581abe0e8.gif"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Challenges </div><br/>Where there is a tool, there will always be those who make use of it. In Lex Imperialis, allies and enemies will also take advantage of shields, requiring new tactics in order to deal with the additional protection they provide.<br/><br/>Some existing talents such as <b>Take Aim!</b> or <b>Deadeye Shot</b> have been updated with additional effects to reduce block, and multiple new items across the game have been added to interact with these new mechanics. <br/><br/>How do you plan to build your retinue with shields in mind, Lord Captain?<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/5372f4f249d0955bdf6d7d8c53179df6c5031e90.jpg"/><br/><br/>See you soon in the Lex Imperialis expansion!<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

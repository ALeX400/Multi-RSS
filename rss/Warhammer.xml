<div class="bb_h3"><b>Greetings Space Marines,</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We hope you had a wonderful and sunny summertime. ‚òÄÔ∏è</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The whole team wants to thank you for the warm welcome you gave to the previous Community Update. We were so pleased to see your enthusiasm for the Chaos Spawn, Black Templars, the new PVP game mode, etc!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">You also asked us for news about Techmarine, and we've got some this month!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This Community Update has a bunch of surprises and a community survey, so read it carefully! üòâ</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Let‚Äôs start off with the BIG news! ‚ú®</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>YEAR 2 IS JUST ROUND THE CORNER!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We‚Äôre so close! The second year of content for <i>Space Marine 2</i> is about to begin.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Let‚Äôs take a look at the free content first and then DLC Content, in this trailer!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">https://youtu.be/CxtlJ06u_lc</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Expect the Patches to be released at a similar pace to what we were used to during the first year of content updates. Several PVE missions, the Techmarine class coming with Patch 12, cosmetics for Blood Angels, Carcharodons, Iron Hands and much more await with this Season Pass.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Check the Roadmap!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://medias.community.focus-entmt.com/forums/mzulft/SpaceMarine2_Roadmap_YearTwoBattlePlan_3840x2160-1.jpg"/><b> </b></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>PATCH 10 - ANNIVERSARY UPDATE</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Anniversary Update is planned to be rolled out on¬†<b>September 4</b>! It‚Äôs a free update, but also marks the release of the Season Pass II and its first two DLCs. üìÖ¬†</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Let‚Äôs see the content of this Patch in more detail, shall we?</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>THE CHAOS ARMOUR PACK:</b></div><div class="bb_h2"><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://medias.community.focus-entmt.com/forums/mzulft/swaglords_driplegion.jpg"/></div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Chaos Armour Pack is coming for free. You‚Äôll finally be able to change the armour set of your Heretic Astartes in PvP, but you‚Äôll have to unlock the set first. Each class will require you to score a certain amount of kills per match to unlock the corresponding skin.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>NEW GAME MODES:¬†</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>HELBRUTE ONSLAUGHT (PVP)</b></div><div class="bb_h3"><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://medias.community.focus-entmt.com/forums/mzulft/disturbingthepeace.jpg"/></div><p class="bb_paragraph">A brand new mode will be added with this update, and will be playable on all maps. Here‚Äôs your brief:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Two teams of Chaos Marines will fight to control strategic areas, but also to take control of the Helbrute. The first team to take control of an objective gets to control the Helbrute, until the opposite team takes it down. One player gets to control the Helbrute at a time, and this player will be picked randomly among players who participated in securing the control point. For the team that failed to secure the first control point to have the Helbrute on their side, they will need to slay their opponents‚Äô Helbrute and secure a new designated control point.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Controlling the Helbrute grants the team a strong advantage, but killing it rewards significant amounts of points to your team. One last thing, the Helbrute uses a Helbrute Thunder Hammer in melee, and a Plasma Cannon in range, and it can unleash a battle cry with its special skill to regenerate its HP.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>STRATAGEMS (PVE)</b></div><div class="bb_h3"><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://medias.community.focus-entmt.com/forums/mzulft/itsraweceek.jpg"/></div><p class="bb_paragraph">Stratagems are a completely new PvE game mode. Unlike ‚Äúclassic‚Äù Operations, there are only 2 difficulty modes: ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù and ‚ÄúHard‚Äù. What makes this new game mode different are the various Battlefield Conditions, which will change every day and week and make each operation completely different from what you‚Äôre used to.¬†</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Battlefield Conditions can either help or hinder your progress. Upon successful completion, you will receive a new currency called ‚ÄúAccolades‚Äù, which can be exchanged for valuable rewards.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">There are weekly and daily Stratagems, and each Operation has their own set of modifiers. Here are a few examples of them:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Summoner</b>: Every uninterrupted call for Reinforcements summons the Extremis enemy.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Where you aiming at</b>: Friendly fire damage from firearms and explosives is enabled</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Cadia Stands</b>: Imperial Guards spawn on levels.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Hunted</b>: An unkillable Lictor constantly pursues you. Dealing enough damage will scare it away for a brief time. üòà</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">And many others that you‚Äôll have to discover for yourself! ü§´</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>NEW PVP AND PVE MAPS</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>OPERATION: VORTEX</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Astropathic Relay has once again fallen silent. Investigate and cleanse the relay of any lingering heretical presence.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This map has a special, unique boss, the Mutalith Vortex Beast. We don‚Äôt want to spoil too much, you‚Äôll have to wait for the update to drop on September 4 to discover its moveset! üòâ</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfI7xGN0QrETcwqCofK_NLvWVt6gVO4hPfPW67dfJUq__eQbfIW134VuPYBp0hXL_IUzyUTj0PvyMfTrT-nEsFuVYd3liltxTrvf7Irq77HwoEnIVFpRugxid828Erq2aRwC7HSfg?key=dOQE4xvpEEh4K5d6e-V9UA"/></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>ETERNAL WAR MAP - BRIDGE</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">A new PvP map will also be added, called ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù. With long hallways and small tunnels, this map offers diversified battles and multiple possible strategies to dominate the battlefield.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Here‚Äôs how it looks:</p><p class="bb_paragraph">https://youtu.be/AWAWsPwdW0o?si=T-wHAYVEsaUWCBar</p><div class="bb_h3"><b>WEAPONS TO BE ADDED IN THE ARMOURY ü™ì</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b></b>Two months ago, we showed you the Power Axe for the first time. Today, let us introduce the Power Axe in action!¬†</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">https://youtu.be/tqUtykgad20?si=bdJhy369zqyTpgdt</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Hero Weapon Variants will also be implemented. These variations can be exchanged against Accolades (from playing Stratagems Mode, more on that new mode below). They fall in a new mastery tier named Heroic, which is even more powerful than Relic. For example, here‚Äôs the Xenophase Blade, the Heroic version of the Power Sword, and the Combi Melta, the Heroic version of the Bolt Rifle:</p><p class="bb_paragraph">‚Äã</p><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://medias.community.focus-entmt.com/forums/mzulft/komm_susser_tod.png"/></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><img crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://medias.community.focus-entmt.com/forums/mzulft/thereisnotechmarine.png"/></p></div></div></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2"><b>NEW MAJORIS ENEMY: CHAOS SPAWN</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Brace yourself Space Marines, this one might give you a hard time. Coming with a total of 3 variations, the Chaos Spawn enters the fight.¬†</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Swifter and more agile than its bulk suggests, the Chaos Spawn constitutes a formidable enemy.¬†</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Stand ready.

This time round, we focused on four key areas of improvement; fixes for idle AI, Chaos Dwarfs not recruiting enough high-tier units, Golgfag Maneater idle issues, and improvements to how the Ogre Kingdoms AI uses Camps. Additional fixes across battle and campaign are also being implemented in this hotfix, and you can read the full list of everything included in the release notes linked below.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">👉 READ THE FULL HOTFIX 6.3.4 NOTES HERE 👈</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Our teams will now switch their focus to readying 7.0 for it's release on December 4th, alongside the release of Tides of Torment. We have reserved ample patching time to follow up on any issues we want to address following 7.0's release and before we break for the Holidays, but Campaign AI will return as a focus for us in the new year. Whilst we've been able to address many of the impactful issues highlighted in recent months, there's more that we want to do, and we'll be looking to return to this topic as soon as we're able.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We’ll share more details on what’s coming up after this when we can, and in the meantime, thank you for your patience while we work on maintaining and improving WH3.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Until then, see you on the battlefield!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">— Steve // Senior Community Manager</p><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><hr/><hr/><div class="bb_h1">⚠ IMPORTANT</div><hr/><hr/><p class="bb_paragraph">If you experience any issues after downloading the update, please take a moment to <b>Verify the integrity of the game files</b> first to ensure there were no issues when downloading.

<div class="bb_h3">We noticed a nasty crash slipped through the cracks, so that's been fixed now ːsteamthumbsupː</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Other notes:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">We're also aware that there's issues with a couple vehicle kits going invisible due to the new code around proximity fading when the camera is close to it. We're looking into why this is happening. In the meantime if you could please use a different kit temporarily, would be great.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Steam Deck</b> still has pretty bad performance issues that we're looking into. They seemingly popped up in one of the summertime patches, so we're narrowing down which change could have caused it. Apologies for the issue, we're on top of it though</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">We are also looking into server host performance, as hosting a full server can be pretty heavy on a player's PC. Hopefully improving performance here will help with any server desync issues as well</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">We're working on fixing other things as well, plus finishing up the <b>Creation Mode</b> <b>LEVEL EDITOR</b> + <b>Workshop</b> for release later this month.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Stay tuned for more news on that</p>]]></description>

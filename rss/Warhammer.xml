https://store.steampowered.com/app/2078450<br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e0116ec05eff55017e6235593c103d50dbd2c39d.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/e9b4a53073b276c2f1263407dc173fba002b775d.png"/><br/>The Boomdakka Snazzwagon makes up for its lack of armor with unbridled quantities of searing bullets thrown at its enemies. For enemies, first come the bullets, then comes the smoke - then the embrace of fiery death.<br/><br/>Race around in a haze of heat as you unleash an onslaught of bullets from your Mek Speshul, ignite enemies with your burna bottles and drown them in exhaust smoke to shroud your escape. <br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/b3d74b9e58b39c193c1c5f2ff1851a3f0ddae11b.png"/><br/>As far as speed goes, the Boomdakka Snazzwagon falls in the middle of the pack, faster than the Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy and the same speed as the Kustom Boosta Blasta. However, with no special movement ability, mastering the Dash ability that all buggies have is key to keeping up with your mob.<br/><br/>The Dash is a powerful acceleration tool that is essential for the Snazzwagon to close the gap and make use of its deadly but inaccurate main gun. It can also be used to change direction quickly: combine it with the handbrake to whip the vehicle around and point your weapons in the right direction. <br/><br/>In Speedfreeks the Snazzwagon is best used up close and personal, quickly injecting yourself in and out of battle in a flurry of bullets, or supporting your Mob into ferocious battle, dealing sneaky damage while they absorb some hits. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/750639e301d93a4b3cda0a04bddd867c817351db.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Abilities</div><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/506ad1bc98bdf2138d0cd5c39dfa352f0c3bb02e.png"/> <br/><b>Souped-up Speshul</b><br/>Unleash a roaring wave of dakka. Extremely high fire rate but with extremely poor accuracy.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/737b871295b207db83ea9aeb8eb41ad8377312ce.png"/> <br/><b>Burna Bottle</b><br/>Toss a Burna Bottle that sets enemies on fire and sends them running in fear.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/2688261a06df7218a0db4d8a9477d4c849e0bb5e.png"/> <br/><b>Billowing Fumes</b><br/>Flood the engine to spew a trail of blinding smoke.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/10f81d44f5ff8313ee330da0d2389ace04f7e7fa.png"/> <br/><b>Dash</b><br/>The vehicle lunges violently forward and smashes enemies. The direction you are aiming for determines where the vehicle will go.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/da5ab02b8ff4d8f0d742083e1925b16b4f5645c2.png"/><br/><br/><b>Pro tip:</b> You can only shoot enemies within 180 degrees in front of you, so try to stay near teammates and maneuver in and out of battle.  Use your Burna Bottle as frequently as possible, but save your Billowing Fumes ability for a murky escape when someone decides to heavily target you. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Team-Ups:</div><b>Grot Mega Tank</b> â€“ Since the Snazzwagonâ€™s armor isnâ€™t the best, using a Grot Mega Tank as mobile cover can be a good strategy, with it also helping you drown nearby enemies in dakka.<br/><br/><b>Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy</b> â€“ Use your Billowing Fumes ability to shroud any Squigbuggies in need of hiding or an escape, and be sure to spray dakka and smash some Burna Bottles in the vicinity for extra damage to enemies in the smoke.<br/><br/><b>Kustom Boosta Blasta</b> â€“ The Snazzwagon and Boosta-Blasta are a potent combo, with both vehicles having escape and/or disorientation abilities in Billowing Smoke and the Stikkbomb. This duo can be frustrating for the opposition â€“ and fun for those driving them. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/fcc35b4582383744332d965a528bfba0c7eff5ff.gif"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Good Against</div><b>Looted Wagon</b> â€“ If caught alone, a Looted Wagon can be circled in smoke then blasted with bullets and fire in a short time.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/85701898b54d4cc00c1e84e862f9a8d14e044922.png"/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Weak Against</div><b>Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy</b> â€“ With a Squigbuggy generally hiding behind the front-line repairing enemies, itâ€™s hard to penetrate and get close to them compared to other vehicles with a movement ability.<br/><br/><b>Shokkjump Dragsta</b> â€“ With the speed of the Shokkjump Dragsta they will weave in and out of combat with you, and try to get around you to shoot you from the back. Stay near allies to help deal with them.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/30a18781f38c1e7e16b3fd95d9c72345b856c4e3.gif"/><br/><br/>On behalf of Caged Element and PLAION, weâ€™z shoutinâ€™ a big WAAAGH!

      <title>Localization Tool for Our Community</title>

Lord Captain!<br/><br/>We sometimes receive requests from players interested in creating a fan localization of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader into languages â€‹â€‹that are not represented in the game. We are very happy with such enthusiasm and would like to help our fans in such a glorious deed!<br/><br/>We want to share with you a localization tool that you can use to create your own translation:<br/><br/>https://github.com/OwlcatGames/LocalizationTool<br/><br/>This is an open repository that contains the Localization Tool. You can use it for both Rogue Trader and Wrath of the Righteous fan translation/mod-making (you can even utilize it for your own projects).<br/><br/>To start the fan translation process, you should feed the tool with the game strings. As for Rogue Trader, you can find them inside a mod template archive that is stored on your computer (the game should be installed on your device). The example path for Steam - Steam\steamapps\common\Warhammer 40,000 Rogue Trader\Modding\WhRtModificationTemplate.tar  <br/><br/>The text lines in the tool are divided into columns for ease of searching and translation. You can quickly find the needed line or term in it.<br/><br/>In addition, this tool allows you to conveniently edit any in-game text, for example, correct existing dialogue lines or descriptions. This may be of particular interest to mod creators.<br/><br/>We will be thrilled if this helps you in your endeavors!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/09819f66e266f3d5811513eca204534340e37c96.jpg"/>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h2"><b>Greetings Space Marines,</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">First and foremost, we would like to wish you all the best for the new year. We hope that 2026 will be another great year for gaming, and we look forward to bringing more content to Space Marine 2 and seeing players enjoy it. There’s still a lot to come in the upcoming months, bear with us! 💙</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Speaking of updates, today, we’ve released a small hotfix (11.3) that brings compatibility with Microsoft Store versions. Also, Patch 12 - Techmarine Update is next! Let’s detail the content together.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/ade137b3af7da2cd7366c3c7762ccf4175375754.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>A RECAP OF PATCH 12’S CONTENT</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">We’re targeting the <b>end of February</b> for the release. Stay tuned.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>SOME TECHMARINE NEWS ⚙️</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph">The wait is almost over! To make it more tolerable, we might give you as many details as we can about this new Class. A detailed Devblog was published a few days ago. If you missed it, read it now, <u>right here</u>!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">And if you’re too lazy to read all the details, here’s a summary. 😉</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>What is this new Techmarine class like?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Techmarines are specialists in crowd control and area defense. In melee, they’re able to take on large groups of enemies with their Omnissian Axe, and they also shine in mid-range combat thanks to their firearms arsenal.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Techmarine’s Special Abilities reinforce this “area defense specialist” aspect. First, the Tarantula Sentry Gun. When a Techmarine is in the squad, Tarantula Sentry Guns spawn on the map and can only be activated by the Techmarine. Once activated, they will automatically shoot at nearby enemies, until they run out of ammo or are destroyed.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Secondly, your Special Ability is the Servo-Gun, which unleashes a powerful volley on enemies, and can be upgraded with the class perks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Techmarine class will be available in all PvE and PvP modes when Patch 12 drops, for free of course. No DLC or in-game purchases required.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/429bbef9cad561ef56b6749b5b9a063fcaefb2ed.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Here’s a closer look at the Omnissian Axe, both for Loyalists and Chaos!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_th"><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/1c76d410576c5c4b4a8ec6dd1b9c41a0bfd932d6.png"/></p></div><div class="bb_table_th"><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/431e95bdb9db7b5214e9b77280e30f8eef6e8e9a.png"/></p></div></div></div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Please note that the Techmarine is the only Class allowed to bear the Omnissian Axe</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">As some of you might have guessed, the Chaos counterpart to the Techmarine in PvP will be a Red Corsairs Warpsmith. </p><div class="bb_h3"><b>NEW PVE MAP “DISRUPTION”</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">With Patch 12 will come a new PVE map named “Disruption”! 💥</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Here’s the brief for your next mission:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Combat Squad Veridian must reinforce a battalion of Cadians besieged by a Tyranid swarm, when an urgent missive from an Ecclesiarchy Priest alerts them to a Thousand Sons ritual profaning a nearby Cathedral. Both onslaughts must be disrupted to prevent a domino effect that will jeopardise concurrent operations elsewhere on Avarax.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">And here’s how it looks!</p>[carousel]<img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/212dbf8ab568f359b40ca7de20c33d049187c6f8.png"/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/3889a8c3d1d1441cee177c07cf3fdafbc713afaf.png"/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/82b31cc49b30bee25470ba65da0cf936bcd53cc4.png"/>[/carousel]<p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>TWO NEW COSMETIC DLCs ARE COMING</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Coming with Patch 12.0, 2 new cosmetic DLCs are on their way! This time, customise your experience with the Raven Guard Champion Pack and the Carcharodons Cosmetic Pack! 🦅🦈 </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>Raven Guard Champion Pack</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/4c47c4c6382ecee21cc6def475af99a965aa75bd.png"/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/1c510735425244fafbc3aecbab5e8dae5bd8ca9a.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Raven Guard Champion will be associated with the Assault class. Let’s see which elements will be compatible separately with other classes:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Helm: Tactical / Assault / Vanguard / Bulwark / Sniper / Heavy</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Wargear: Tactical (tabard) / Sniper (cape)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">L. Pauldron: Tactical / Assault / Bulwark / Heavy </p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">R. Pauldron: Tactical / Assault / Vanguard / Bulwark / Sniper</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Chestplate: Tactical / Assault</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">L. Gauntlet: Tactical / Assault / Bulwark</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">R. Gauntlet: Tactical / Assault / Bulwark</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">L. Greave: Tactical (without thrusters) / Assault / Bulwark (without thrusters) </p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">R. Greave: Tactical (without thrusters) / Assault / Bulwark (without thrusters)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Backpack: Assault</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">The Raven Guard Champion Pack also includes its Bolt Pistol skin.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/21335e21b14c55f93e1158eebe1107e6a377e7c9.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>Carcharodons Cosmetic Pack</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Carcharodons Cosmetic pack includes 2 Helms, 1 Left Pauldron, 1 Right Pauldron and 1 Chestplate.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Unlike the other Cosmetic Packs, the Carcharodons Cosmetic Pack does not add a new Heraldry page to unlock the cosmetic items. Instead, the armour pieces will be automatically unlocked and added to your armour sets once you purchase the pack.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/bb1b9829061e453a2d4fbdc6b0d3e5d6f3e55a21.png"/></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>WHAT’S MORE?</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">That's not all, the Techmarine Update also brings:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">20 new modifiers for the Stratagems mode</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">You can now swap the different Space Marine heads (for example, you can use the "Assault" default head on the Sniper)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">A new equipment has been added: the Restorative Stimms. It takes the slot of your Medicae Stimms, and it will provide a different way to heal your Space Marine's wounds: instead of "burst" of heal, it will regenerate your HP overtime, and also generate contested health (up to 100% of your missing HP, which means you effectively can regen all of your missing HP when used correctly)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">3 new Heroic Weapon variants for the Combat Knife (Fencing), the Heavy Bolt Rifle (Combi Grenade Launcher) and the Omnissian Axe (Fencing). Although the three Heroic Weapons were not part of the initial plan, we were so encouraged by your enthusiasm that we chose to add them to our roadmap.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/17f3b8caa6ad37cb972478632bc312ce1b50c527.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>THE PUBLIC TEST SERVER IS LIVE!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗓️ PTS is now live on Steam, on Jan 29, and ends Feb 6th. So, go ahead and have a first taste of Patch 12 while you can! You can read the patch notes here.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Please note that since the PTS is a “work in progress” version of the final patch, all the gameplay elements such as all the Techmarine customisation elements or the Voice Selector for the Voice Pack DLC are not implemented yet. Rest assured, they will be ready when Patch 12 releases.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">To access the PTS, follow our tutorial here. <b>Since Steam recent changes, you now have to tick the “Tools” box in the Library menu to see the PTS. </b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/b6a6346500e155b3abd233e270662451073b57cd.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>VOICE PACKS FAQ 🗣️</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We announced our intention to release a Voice Pack last month, and you naturally had a few questions about it! We’ll try to address all the most frequently asked questions hereafter.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/9d45fa947e0d7b09ff50e357caeeb8bb75da141b.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <b><i>What will be the price of the Voice Pack?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ The Voice Pack will be sold at $4,99.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <b><i>When will we be able to buy the Voice Pack?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ The Voice Pack drops with Patch 12, at the end of February. Purchases will open at the same time the patch rolls out.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <b><i>How many voice lines are contained in the Voice Pack?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ It will contain over 450 voicelines per Chapter, dubbed in the 7 audio languages already supported by the game, and introduce unique lines based on the Chapter (for example, the Space Wolf will shout “<i>For the Allfather</i>” instead of the usual “<i>For the Emperor</i>”) and your Space Marine will shout these new lines. Same goes for the Social Wheel emotes.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">And for those who may be wondering: We’re happy to confirm that each and every one of this Voice Pack’s 1300+ total voice lines were performed by a real voice actor, as our commitment to quality remains absolute.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Voice Actors (english):</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Thomas Mitchells (Blood Angels)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Andrew James Spooner (Space Wolves)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Kris W. Laudrum (Black Templars)</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <b><i>What do they sound like? Can I get a sneak peek?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ Sure! Here is one snippet per Chapter:</p>

<p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <b><i>Will there be individual Packs? Or, are the 3 heads tied in the same Pack?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ The Voice Pack comes with a set of three new heads for PvE. All three heads (Space Wolf, Blood Angel, Black Templars) are part of the same Voice Pack. They cannot be sold separately.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>❓ Can I equip one Chapter’s head with another Chapter’s voice?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ Yes, you can equip one Chapter’s head with another Chapter’s voice. Voices and heads aren’t tied together.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>❓ Is the Voice Pack Class-Specific? For example: is the Space Wolf for Vanguard only?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ No, they aren’t class-restricted. You will hear the new voice lines regardless of the Class you’ve picked.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">❓ <b><i>Will other Chapters get a Voice Pack in the future?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ Absolutely! A second Voice Pack is in the making. We’ll reveal which Chapters will receive it, later this year. Stay tuned! 🗣️</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b><i>❓ Will the original heads that are in the game now be interchangeable as well?</i></b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">🗨️ Yes.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>THAT’S IT FOR THIS MONTH!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Thank you for your support!

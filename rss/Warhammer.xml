<div class="bb_h1">Dear Space Marines,</div><br/>The year is coming to an end, and we first and foremost want to assure you that 2025 will be just as epic as 2024. ‚≠ê<br/><br/>You‚Äôve been following our development very closely before and after the release of <i>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</i>, and we‚Äôve loved collaborating with the players to improve the game.<br/>But before we dive into what‚Äôs coming to the game next year, let‚Äôs look back together, shall we?<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">WARPING BACK TO SEPTEMBER!</div>We launched <i>Space Marine 2</i> on September 9 and it was a success! We‚Äôve been working on it for years and it has been a work of passion and dedication. Witnessing the warm welcome the players reserved for the game was the greatest reward and the best achievement to unlock after all these relentless years.<br/><br/>The enthusiasm motivated us to keep up the good work and make sure the game would remain up to the players‚Äô expectations. Then, we released 2 big updates and several hotfixes.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Update 4.0 - Termination ü©∏</div>Introduced a new PvE mission with a dreadful foe to annihilate: the Hierophant Bio-Titan. This update also introduced the much-awaited photomode in Operations mode, which you loved! Balancing tweaks were made too‚Ä¶<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/8ffc8ad485fe9383da0969a10dcf5260f6f622f5.png"/><br/>This update received mixed reviews because it increased the difficulty in an unpleasant way. Our mistake! We closely listened to your feedback and released Patch 4.1 a few days later to revert the unwanted effects.<br/>Paying attention to your feedback has been incredibly helpful to us, and it's something we want to continue doing next year.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Update 5.0 - Obelisk ü™Ω</div>We knew the Warhammer 40k fans were waiting for this one, for it introduced the Dark Angels Cosmetic pack, with the Dark Angels Champion, new weapons skins and more. <br/><br/>This update brought a new PvE map, and also introduced a new enemy: the Tzaangor Enlightened. Along with that, a few feature additions such as the new lens colors (which you‚Äôve also been waiting for) and the Neo-Volkite pistol, available in PvP, were also implemented.<br/>Finally, Space Marine 2 has been upgraded to 4K/60 FPS for PS5 Pro and now supports DLSS3 and FSR3.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">More and more Space Marines joining the ranks</div>In the span of 3 months, <i>Space Marine 2</i> reached the remarkable milestone of 5 million players, to our great delight. We want to sincerely thank all 5 million of you for this. ü•πüéâ<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/f7338178ead67bcd2ed86a236881ada717efb85b.jpg"/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Fan creations üì∑</div>Thousands of screenshots from the game were shared on social media (including some striking Titus selfies)<br/>Keep it coming, we love to see it! üì∑<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2baaf315acfaa5d66cbac17d79deea9529f4c07b.png"/><br/><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/da2f78e94b293059aa20b7578400d143a5c0451e.jpg"/></div><div class="bb_table_td"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/e328028882602a780c59f43f70d12185922736e6.jpg"/></div></div></div><div class="bb_h1">COMMUNITY EVENTS</div>There will continue to be in-game events in 2025. Currently, the ongoing Decimation Event invites you to win 10 times in Operations in order to unlock an exclusive skin: the Mark XI Hell‚Äôs Teeth Pattern Chainsword. You don‚Äôt want to skip this one, Space Marine, so gear up and head back to the battlefield already! ‚öîÔ∏è<br/><br/>The event starts on December 27 and ends on January 20<img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/8e374bcd4fd45a25f15bc4bc19b617f9e2b36c6f.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT FOR 2025?</div><br/><div class="bb_h3">Fresh content for PVP</div>PVP Players - We have heard you, and we know you feel left out. We will have your back in 2025 with brand new and exciting content for the PvP. First thing we can tease you with is the new PvP map (it will be set in a closed environment with many narrow passages pushing you to engage more in Closed Quartered Battles).<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/8bba97254756cf8618f983fe15a3c9bae1237453.png"/><br/><br/>Custom PvP lobbies will also be implemented in Patch 7.0: You will be able to play with modifiers and change the amount of players, up to 6v6 / You can change the timer limit for each match, the maximum limit score / you can have more than two players for each class (and have 6 snipers on your team if you want, even if it‚Äôs a questionable strategy!)<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">New PvE content</div>The hotly anticipated Horde Mode will arrive later in 2025. We‚Äôll keep you updated once we get closer to it!<br/>Prestige Rank will be introduced during season 3, allowing you to upgrade your classes even further.<br/>On top of that, new Operations and new Enemies will come to expand the content of <i>Space Marine 2</i>. To spice things up, a new difficulty level with new rewards will also be added.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">And our next Champion will be‚Ä¶ ü•Å </div>The Salamander Champion!! ü¶é And he will be a sniper, available in PvE and PvP. Let‚Äôs explain our choice a bit:<br/><ol><li> His cape is very cool (super important).<br/></li><li> An obvious choice for the Sniper Champion would have been to be a Raven Guard, but we have different plans for them.<br/></li><li> Everyone loves Salamanders, us included, and we really wanted to give them a Champion. Heavy and Tactical would have been good candidates, but Heavy was already taken, and we have a different idea for Tactical.</li></ol>Here‚Äôs a sneak peek: look at those flames. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/a62bc19a1e9e19f11e45fce9f8375b8a7e275d7f.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Customisation</div>We‚Äôll keep adding customisation elements (such as the Mark VI Corvus üòâ) throughout the year to represent more iconic Chapters of the Warhammer 40k universe.<br/>Battle Barge Expansion<br/><br/>The Datavault will make its entry on the Battle Barge next year. It will consist of a new area with unlockable information on most elements enemies from the game. Unlock them with a special currency earned through in-game achievements. We‚Äôll get back to you quickly in the beginning of 2025.<br/><br/>Take a first look at it üìö<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/c13c735ecee476e9e720dfdfe05672063e031e89.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">WE‚ÄôLL SEE YOU SOON, SPACE MARINES</div>2025 is near, whether or not you‚Äôre celebrating Christmas, we wish you a good end of 2024. Remember celebrating is cool, but protecting the Imperium is better. Don‚Äôt lose focus!<br/>Happy new year gamers. ü•ÇüéÜüéä<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><i>Focus &amp; Saber</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/e4ba024509c3934efbed4a0ff5e8207f507f25d0.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">For the Emperor</div><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/2e279301e7245e4d4f4991c30208b3664bf66546.gif"/><br/><br/>]]></description>

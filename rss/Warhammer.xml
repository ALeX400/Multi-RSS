Join Senior Community Manager Pingu as she sits down with Rich, Todor and Milcho from the WARHAMMER 3 development team to talk about whatâ€™s coming to the High Elves, as well as whatâ€™s changed since our previous Whatâ€™s Next videos earlier this year.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>We look forward to sharing more of the content with you nearer to release. In the meantime, we hope those of you who have opted in to the Patch 6.3 Beta are enjoying the updates to the game. The full version will be launching next Thursday, so if you donâ€™t want to hop into the Beta, you wonâ€™t have long to wait to get your hands on it.<br/><br/>You can also join us on Twitch and YouTube for some Patch 6.3 Gameplay with Josh and Liam on Tuesday 2nd September for an even deeper dive into some of the changes.<br/><br/>Until next time!<br/><br/>â€” The <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

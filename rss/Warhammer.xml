Armed to the teeth, it tears through enemies with relentless, unpredictable fury. <br/><br/>This is a defensive vehicle with healing capabilities. Stand behind your allies and aid them. If you like seeing your team shine, this is the vehicle for you. <br/><br/>In Speed Freeks the Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy is best used behind your team near the front lines. Keeping your allies alive. Be careful, with your healing capabilities you become one of the most important pieces on your team. Expect the enemies to come for you, so stay near your team to keep alive. <br/><br/>The speed of the Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy is slightly below average, which it makes up for with an above average health value. As such, positioning is extremely important, as it's harder to escape from dangerous situations. Save your dash ability for when you need it or keep up a high enough average speed with good boost management so that you are hard to pin down. Or you could just always hide behind your allied Grot Mega Tank! <br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/7d957f866a631bf68a3e02f08a44f3cffbad59de.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Abilities</div><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/c1b24cbb0d9318993ee0b23e4b716f3025423e0a.png"/><br/><b>Squig Launchas</b> <br/>Boom Squigs burst forth from the Ork-wielded Squig Launcha <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/d56ccd56cf47dec5a984be3d69ca544608ca1223.png"/><br/><b>Grub Squig</b> <br/>The Squig Launcha fires a bunch of Grub Squigs that heal allies <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/d58a954880fe0a908aca74f7ce16748d14a0e6f7.png"/><br/><b>Squig Mine</b> <br/>Drop three Squig Mines that stick to anything they touch and explode when enemies get too close<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/10f81d44f5ff8313ee330da0d2389ace04f7e7fa.png"/><br/><b>Dash</b> <br/>The vehicle lunges violently forward and smashes enemies. The direction you are aiming at will determine where the vehicle will go. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/79d5ca72d85b8f02c2df7e75a9d2f01a7d1e30eb.png"/><br/><br/>Staying alive as the Rukkatrukk Squigbuggy is your highest priority. Hide behind your team, stay near someone who will protect you, and make sure you know where you’re going if someone comes for you. This allows you to keep everyone else alive. If you are there, it’s harder to take down your team. <br/><br/>Keep an eye on your team’s health and which enemies could become a threat to you. Keep track of their Deffkilla Wartrike players, and Looted Wagon to stay out of harm. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/0e9d54fcbed52d517a0c4f46df5587f18a5e4f6f.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Team-ups</div><b>Grot Mega Tank –</b> This beefy boy will keep you safe. Keep him alive and it’ll be dangerous for the enemies to come close, as they will have to avoid its plough. You can also use the Grot Mega Tank as a wall from enemies. <br/><br/><b>Boomdakka Snazzwagon –</b> Keeping a Snazzwagon alive can be your ticket to winning the game. Snazzwagon deals heavy damage to anyone who gets close to you, and a good Snazzwagon will realize when there’s an enemy coming for you and use their Billowing Fumes to protect you. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Good Against </div><b>Booomdakka Snazzwagon –</b> With it being one of the slower vehicles, the Boomdakka Snazzwagon will struggle to catch and take you down. While you can keep your mob alive and negate the damage output from its firepower. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Weak Against </div><b>Deffkilla Wartrike –</b> This vehicle will be trying to go for you in every situation they’re allowed to. It’ll sneak into your Mob, take you out, and get back out again. Make sure you’re always near full health and if you aren’t, stay back and keep an eye on it so that you don’t get jumped. <br/><br/><b>Looted Wagon –</b> This tank will try to shoot you from afar. If you’re not careful you will always be driving around with half health because of your foes Looted Wagon at the back. Make sure to use the terrain and your larger vehicles to make it impossible for the Looted Wagon to get a clear line of sight on you. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/67287117c1d91613deb37fd7faf437bacc5b7c13.png"/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/b04aceaa0796094da124ac638049eb6d8ef6b28b.gif"/><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/6a7aba8acaa8b3f4d93db8dc8e970a806779b1b2.png"/><br/><br/>On behalf of Caged Element and PLAION, we’z shoutin’ a big WAAAGH!

<br/><div class="bb_h1">Heroes and Pactsworn!</div><br/>Starting now, the <b>Versus Beta August Test (or BAT!) is live!</b> If you haven't already, make sure to sign up by heading to Vermintide 2's Steam Store page and hitting 'Request Access' on the Playtest!<br/><br/><a class="bb_link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/" rel="" target="_blank"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/f50095364f3c45bf9921e5f3d1973d1eec4e7a44.png"/></a><br/><br/>As mentioned before, <b>this Beta is open to ANYONE</b>, even non-owners of Vermintide 2! Make sure to spread the word to anyone who might be interested! Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your pets, tell strangers!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/731d03f5dcbe0aa23cc7185eb7e64bcc9d99e73e.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">What is Versus?</div>Versus is an <b>upcoming <u>free</u> new Game mode</b> for Warhammer: Vermintide 2! It’s an asymmetrical PvP+E experience pitting up to 4 Heroes against our AI enemies and up to 4 special players, what we call Pactsworn. A match will take place over several rounds, with each team swapping places between playing the Heroes and the Pactsworn each round. To simplify, each round consists of the Hero team playing a regular game akin to Adventure mode, while the Pactsworn players have to stop them.<br/><br/><i>Learn more about playing as the <b>Heroes</b></i><br/><i>Learn more about playing as the <b>Pactsworn</b> (yes-yes!)</i><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">What's new for this Beta?</div>Plenty! We have two big features to highlight: <b>Matchmaking changes</b> and <b>The Horde</b> ability. Alongside that we've also done various <b>balance adjustments</b> and <b>quality of life changes</b> based on previous tests' feedback!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">The Horde Ability</div>One of the bigger features in the Beta is the Pactsworns’ new Horde Ability, available to each of the Pactsworn players on their own individual cooldown. When fully charged and ready, <b>Pactsworn players are able to rally a small horde, spawning a group of AI enemies fighting for them onto the battlefield.</b> This means that Packmasters can summon cover-kin to blend in for sneaky charges, Ratling Gunners can distract Heroes with melee fodder before laying down fire, <i>or the team can sync up and trigger all Hordes at the same time and overwhelm the opposition.</i><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Cooldown Reduction:</b> While the ability re-charges slowly over time, it is possible to quicken the progress by damaging the enemy team. Play well, and you’ll be able to send barrage after barrage.<br/></li><li> <b>Carry over:</b> Ability bar progress is carried over between deaths.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">Matchmaking</div>In the Alphas there were no guardrails preventing (for instance) solo queuing new players to meet an experienced four-stack, meaning that the experience could vary wildly from session to session. This, along with other reported issues, led to us reworking our matchmaking systems. <br/><br/>The new system should, on average, result in <b>lower queue times</b>, finding servers closer to you (resulting in <b>lower latency</b>), and <b>more even games</b> (for example, by trying to pair together premade groups). It will also allow us to more easily monitor the matchmaking in real-time and act quicker if we notice that something isn't working as intended.<br/><br/>It won’t stop variously skilled players from meeting up occasionally, but at least the system should be able to favour other match setups. We hope that this will lead to more balanced and fun games, as well as lay a better foundation for future feedback.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Features and Gameplay Changes</div><div class="bb_h3">Gamepad Support</div>Controllers/Gamepads are now properly supported for Versus! Now that we are rounding up the core set of features we can finalize button assignments and focus on input tweaking to bring the controller experience up to par. For gamepad gamers out there, please let us know any feedback you have about the new implementation in this Beta!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Pactsworn HUD and UI</div>We have re-done a lot of the Pactsworns’ heads-up-display in terms of art, gameplay and general quality of life.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> New <b>Horde Ability progress bar.</b><br/></li><li> <b>Updated Health bars.</b><br/></li><li> <b>Ability Bar:</b> Each Pactsworn has all of their available moves and abilities listed in the HUD, with cooldowns and input clearly shown in an effort to make the characters easier to pick  play.<br/></li><li> <b>Updated enemy health bars:</b> Wounds, Streak Damage, Regular– and Temporary HP are now displayed directly above the Heroes’ heads.<br/></li><li> <b>Ally information:</b> Your fellow Pactsworns’ respawn timers are now displayed above their heads along with their names, hopefully making teamwork easier to pull off.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Ping adjustments</div>The ping/tagging system has been adjusted to be more responsive, particularly noticeable for the Hero side. As in Adventure mode, <b>pings should now be instantaneous and prioritize marking enemies better.</b> This should make the system more responsive, intuitive and fluid, <b>while still retaining the ability to place world markers and use the Social Wheel for more detailed callouts.</b><br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Health Draughts and Medical Supplies</div>We are reconsidering how we should view health pick-ups in Versus. We want healing to have intent and consequences, and to be something that Pactsworn are able to make use of as well.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Level placement:</b> <b>We have moved all healing supplies to be more prominent on each level’s main path.</b> By becoming easy to see “hot spots”, we should be able to create even more interesting and intense scenarios, inviting the Pactsworn to use them for ambushes.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Other Changes</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Updated the visual effects on the Warpfire Thrower and the Poison Wind Globadier.</b> On top of looking better, these new VFX should better reflect the effective Area of Effect of their abilities when active.<br/></li><li> <b>Adjusted objectives in Against the Grain</b> to deter speedrunning and running ahead of the team.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">Balance Changes</div><div class="bb_h3">Poison Wind Globadier</div>The Globadier has remained an undisputed menace throughout the Alpha period, and we still want to keep him that way, but things will be a little different for the Beta. <b>We've lowered the base damage of a globe's gas, but also added a ramping damage curve to Poison Wind tick damage</b>, meaning damage increases exponentially over time.<br/>Mindlessly throwing globes won’t be as effective anymore, but catching unfortunate Heroes in a bad spot will create just as much chaos as before.<br/><div class="bb_h3">Ratling Gunner</div>The Ratling Gunner has received a healthy check-up on some basic values that should <b>make him a bit more dexterous and effective at range</b> (where he should be shining best).<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Decreased start up and reload duration.<br/></li><li> Increased effective range and bullet speed.<br/></li><li> Decreased bullet spread.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">Packmaster</div>When a Packmaster hooks a Hero and walks off an edge, <b>the Hero will now hang from the ledge instead of falling to their doom.</b> Was fun while it lasted, hehehe.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">Bile Troll</div>Introduced in our last test, the Bile Troll is a rare, playable boss that one random player will get to play as each round. He is large, in charge, and full of gross green stuff. For the Beta, we have focused on getting in a bit more polish and making him more fun to use.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Adjusted movement acceleration</b> to give a more sluggish and weighty feel to the character, as well as to limit twitchy movement.<br/></li><li> <b>Reworked the Bile Vomit attack</b> on a few different points:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The ability now has the option to be charged and held, letting players aim more accurately and prepare their attack. Hold the F key to start charging and let go to puke.<br/></li><li> Added an aim indicator to better display where the vomit will land and the rough ground area that gets covered.</li></ul></li></ul><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/214b4f4b445b197bd3f636e2f464888b7e325464.png"/><br/><br/>As always, we hope you have tons of fun playing Versus! <b>Enjoy the Beta, invite your friends, and give us ALL of your feedback!</b> We rely on you, your experiences and your opinions to perfect this exciting new game mode!<br/><br/><i>If you have any more doubts or questions, check out our FAQ.</i><br/>]]></description>

      <title>Developer Blog - Versus Open Beta Test</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/6716642128543606899</link>

<div class="bb_h1">Heroes and Pactsworn,</div><br/>Hi my name is <b>Joakim Setterberg</b> and I’m the Design Director on Vermintide 2. In this devblog I want to talk about Versus’ upcoming <b>Beta August Test</b> - or BAT - coming August 21st. With the BAT we’re wrapping up most of the larger systems and features of the core game mode. With a few exceptions, our main focus up to release will be to work with surrounding systems and refining the content, to polish the Versus experience and, to quote the team, <i>“fix the jank”</i>.<br/><br/>First, a note on feedback. <b>For every test we do we collect as much of your feedback as possible to find out what we can improve and fix.</b> We sort it, rank it, and talk about what we want to accomplish for the next test. Sometimes there’s a straight-forward way to solve a problem or to implement a suggestion, but other times we’ll go in a slightly different direction, if we believe a problem lies elsewhere. That takes us to our two big features we’re introducing for the BAT: the <b>Pactsworn Horde ability</b> and <b>matchmaking</b>.<br/><br/>Feedback from the last test, the RAT, showed that you wanted something more for the Pactsworn gameplay - like abilities or talents. We also saw requests for notifications when director controlled Hordes were about to spawn, or calls to introduce a Pactsworn special with horde summoning as a singular purpose. These were good requests, but we felt that the Pactsworn side would play even stronger if Hordes were more integrated in active player combat, rather than being played reactive. In the finest Clan Moulder tradition <i>we stitched everything together</i>.<br/><br/><b>The Horde ability gives all Pactsworn specials a way to summon a small Horde on their own,</b> introducing a tactical element to the gameplay loop. This means that Packmasters can summon cover-kin to blend in for sneaky charges, Ratling Gunners can distract Heroes with melee fodder before laying down fire, or the team can sync up and trigger all Hordes at the same time and overwhelm the opposition. <b>The Horde ability is on a timed cooldown,</b> which decreases faster with successful attacks with your current Pactsworn special and carries over between deaths.<br/>We are excited to see how you interact with this new feature and hear what you think about it, looking forward to your feedback on this one.<br/><br/>A bit trickier were various feedback regarding Pactsworn or Hero balancing, speed running, match quitters and a general feeling of unfairness: all valid points, which we’ll be tackling moving forwards, but this also highlighted one big underlying issue: <b>the lack of matchmaking.</b> In the Alphas there were no guardrails preventing (for instance) solo queuing new players to meet an experienced four-stack, meaning that the experience could vary wildly from session to session. We believe that some of the “unbalanced experience” feedback may originate from this.<br/><br/>For the Beta, we’ve opted to <b>rework our current matchmaking system.</b> It's always been in our mind to improve it as much as possible, and after hearing your feedback from the Alphas we decided to go with a new solution for Versus. The new system should, on average, result in <b>lower queue times,</b> finding servers closer to you (resulting in <b>lower latency</b>), and <b>more even games</b> (for example, by trying to pair together premade groups). It will also allow us to more easily monitor the matchmaking in real-time and act quicker if we notice that something isn't working as we intended.<br/><br/>It won’t stop variously skilled players from meeting up occasionally, but at least the system should be able to favour other match setups. We hope that this will lead to more balanced and fun games, as well as lay a better foundation for future feedback.<br/><br/>On the usability side <b>we are adding gamepad support</b> for those who enjoy button mashing over keyboard smashing. Now that we are rounding up the core feature set we can finalize button assignments and focus on input tweaking to bring the controller experience up to par.<br/><br/>On the quality of life, balancing and bug fixes side there’s a number of things that are changed since the RAT. Some highlights include:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> We’ve updated the <b>Pactsworn UI</b> to display more useful information.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Enemy healthbars now also display stuff like <b>remaining Wounds</b> and shows <b>regular and temporary HP</b> as separate.<br/></li><li> Your <b>Pactsworn’s abilities</b> and moves are all displayed in the HUD and it also shows <b>their cooldowns.</b><br/></li><li> <b>Allies </b>now have their <b>names and respawn timers</b> shown above their heads, hopefully making teamwork easier.</li></ul></li><li> We have <b>moved all healing supplies</b> to be more prominent on each level’s main path. By becoming easy to see “hot spots”, we should be able to create even more interesting and intense scenarios, inviting the Pactsworn to use them for ambushes.<br/></li><li> Based on prior test feedback we’ve made the <b>Bile Troll a bit slower</b> and less twitchy, but also gave him the ability to <b>hold his vomit attack</b> to aim it better before launching it.<br/></li><li> <b>Buffed the Ratling Gunner</b> by speeding up his ramp up and reload times as well as improving his effective range.<br/></li><li> <b>Nerfed the Globadier slightly</b> by making the initial damage of a globe lower but making that damage ramp up dramatically over time. <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Mindlessly throwing globes won’t be as effective anymore, but catching unfortunate Heroes in a bad spot will create just as much chaos as before.</li></ul></li><li> <b>Tweaked some objectives on Against the Grain</b> to deter speedrunning and running ahead.<br/></li><li> <b>Tweaked the VFX for the Warpfire Thrower and Globadier.</b> On top of looking better, these should be easier to read in first person and more accurately show the actual area of effect.</li></ul>For all of these features we are of course looking for further testing and feedback.<br/><br/>After the BAT ends, we aim to do at least one more Beta test focusing on some final systems and whatever adjustments come from the feedback we receive during this test. We unfortunately can’t give any details on what it’ll contain at this time, but we’ll tell you guys more when we get there.<br/><br/><i>On behalf of the entire Vermintide team, thank you for helping shape Versus into something great. See you in a BAT!</i>]]></description>

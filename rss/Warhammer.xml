Lord Captain! <br/><br/>It's been over eight months since the game released. During this time, we've turned to you more than once for advice on how to make your journey more comfortable. The post-release survey was one such occasion. An astounding 15241 people took part in it, which, according to our esteemed Lexmechanics' calculations, took them a collective total of 335302 minutes to complete. <br/><br/>We immensely appreciate the effort you're putting into further improving the game. Based on the survey results, we've already fixed numerous “sore spots” such as the behaviour of the cargo interface in the game's third act, or the miscalculated difficulty levels in skill checks. As a thank you for the work you've done, we're going to share the most interesting community perspectives that were reflected in the survey results. <br/><br/>With a passion for all things precise, as is typical of any servant of the Omnissiah, our Lexmechanics have drawn up a report for you that is rich in intriguing correlations and captivating data tables:<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Introductory Notes</div><br/>Worth mentioning first is the fact that by four months after release, more than half of all survey participants had clocked over a hundred hours in the game. That might’ve been surprising if the player base didn't consist overwhelmingly of CRPG fans. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/71c032bea871693540e4ab12f0930349d2586f20.png"/><br/>We knew that releasing a game in the Warhammer 40,000 universe meant submitting it to the scrutiny of demanding critics. A mere 7% had no or only cursory experience with the setting. We enjoy assuming the role of guides on the journey to the dark future, and we are proud to say that players trust us with the job: a whopping 96% of captains had their expectations of the setting's atmosphere met, to the incredible delight of the Warhammer fans among the game's creators. But enough bragging! On to the more fascinating facts, as well as some disconcerting ones.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Interface</div><br/>Regardless of whether a Rogue Trader was a Dogmatic or followed one of the Radical paths, all of them equally disliked loot-related hassles, be it their ship's cargo management or their party's inventory. The organising, the sorting, the tedium of managing a huge number of items, and especially the situations where stolen loot would, upon recovery, return to a bag instead of where it had previously belonged, were things that frustrated our players a great deal. We've fixed some of those problems and are still working on others. <br/><br/>It's worth noting that while most Rogue Traders were torn between Puritanism and Radicalism, 89 among them preferred to altogether skip delving into the value system.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Ground Combat</div><br/>While picking through loot was a mostly unrewarding experience, obtaining it was quite another matter. On average, players gave the ground-combat system 4.3 points out of five, which surpassed the Beta rating for this metric. <br/><br/>57% of participants thought the Lord Captain had been through just the right number of ordeals. Among the rest, opinions were split between those who'd prefer more ordeals and those who envisioned a more peaceful life for the protagonist. Luckily for the Rogue Trader, the well-wishers outnumbered the daredevils nearly two-to-one.<br/><br/>We'd always known that Warrants of Trade were granted only to Humanity's bravest. But this time, they showed themselves to be quite deft as well. Players who opted to skip the character-build part and go straight for the Story mode were satisfied with the challenges they faced. For their part, those who started the game on a higher difficulty level would’ve preferred to challenge yet fiercer foes than the ones they actually encountered. Indeed, the higher the difficulty a player selected, the likelier they were to report a dearth of worthy opponents. Worry not! Our latest major update has made significant changes to the balance of archetypes. Perhaps now the Imperium's enemies will present a serious hurdle in your path.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/f3ec1fdcf4ffa719104351324244b5a755f0880b.png"/><br/>Speaking of archetypes, in the survey, we asked you lots of questions about your characters' combat abilities. These were the results: over 60% of survey participants got a taste of Exemplar, the third tier in a character's career. Other archetypes available earlier in the game saw yet greater use, with the top spots going to Soldier and Officer, which had some form of involvement in the Lord Captain's adventures in over 90% of cases.<br/>Soldier and Officer also topped the list of audience-favourite archetypes. Great Strategist came bottom of that list, their difficult-to-execute stratagems earning many an indignant comment.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/681fea00d72defa0a88da1ee8a2e31115c84892a.png"/><br/>Notably, the special abilities players deemed to be the most powerful (and perhaps overpowered) were Arch-Militant's Wildfire, Soldier's Rapid Fire, and Assassin's Death Whisper. Operative's Intimidation was deemed the weakest.<br/><br/>When it came to key mechanics, Officer shone once again with their ability to grant an extra turn to an ally. You liked both the mechanics and the spirit of this archetype's abilities.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/85b6b3f5bb059a28fe0957e5b1bd02af3da7069c.png"/><br/><br/>However, there'd be no point in any of those skills without someone to use them on, now would there? Who among the Rogue Trader and their retinue's opponents emerged as the most popular one, and who as the most detested? Alas, these questions cannot be answered without spoilers. But if you've conquered the Koronus Expanse before, you could probably make a guess, and it would probably be correct.<br/><br/><span class="bb_spoiler"><span>We don't know what the exact reason was, between the earliness of the encounter, the pesky sniper on the roof, the untiring parries, and the endless attempts to preserve each of the three shuttles, but there's no doubt that Aurora, also known as the Chaos Space Marine, won the hearts of the largest number of Rogue Traders.</span></span><br/><br/><span class="bb_spoiler"><span>Edge of Daybreak and his gang were the next biggest favourite. Forgefiend closes the top three.</span></span><br/><br/>Interestingly, most of the negative combat experiences were caused by encounters that involved no bosses or named characters. Case in point, mid-flight battles.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Character Creation</div><br/>Creating and customising a character is a key aspect of any role-playing game. To make sure no Rogue Trader lacked in individually tailored options, we added over 500 talents to the game! Many players hinted that we might have tried too hard there... Thus 37% of participants would have liked the options to be fewer. The same percentage said the number of options matched their expectations. There were also those who didn't find enough variety, but the former two outnumbered these four to one.<br/><br/>As for the Rogue Trader's Origin, the majority's preference leaned firmly toward Sanctioned Psyker. Voidborn Psyker was therefore the most popular combination, ahead by almost a third of the runner-up, Imperial World Noble.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/6ad55f7d121aec523261ff8ed6a0b98cb4bbae5a.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Companions and NPCs</div><br/>We've asked you before to share your first impressions of the companions, and the poll results were quite unambiguous: Argenta led in every category! Although she's still a favourite, the Lord Captain has by now had the opportunity to form a more comprehensive picture of their retinue's other members.<br/><br/>This time around, we looked at the following criteria in our companions: interesting story, dialogue, and interactions; mechanical efficiency; best romance; and most attractive. Let's go through these in order.<br/><br/>The Rogue Trader's loyal Seneschal emerged as their most interesting companion. This choice surprised us and would probably surprise Abelard himself! He'd most likely be flattered too. <br/>Pasqal's <i>multifaceted</i> personality also got its fair share of attention.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/3c6d75ad410fe2cce9fb7bac414c333d6c38ea4c.png"/><br/>Owing to her unique origin, Cassia came first in combat efficiency.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/5f177bc2ecdb6fcae7831a9dcdf8041853b36e85.png"/><br/>Her heart-stealing efficiency put her in the lead as well. And keep this document far from the Inquisition's eyes, for Yrliet and Marazhai were a very close second and third. <br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/b90c1e04c86fcc5851336f0431b137a05cf187a5.png"/><br/>Naturally, these statistics would've been incomplete without Argenta taking at least one of the top spots. Her fervour in combat and her zealous smile won over many.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/5501ebd689509354ddc231cb7c73d2aece7bc73e.png"/><br/>Now what about those who can only be observed from the sidelines? We left this as a free-form question so that participants could name whatever non-player character they wanted as their favourite. After meticulously sifting through over 5,000 comments, we had the following top ten: a Koronus Expanse All Stars according to the heir of House von Valancius.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/dbe7791dd4dd34b337bdd73440d6c304f03b850c.png"/><br/>There's a high likelihood that the vote results might have been altered by an organisation we've been unable to trace. <br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion</div><br/>As the cogitators hum and the Lexmechanics rhythmically count off the figures, the time to part has crept unnoticed upon us. We truly hope you've found it interesting to see these survey results and to learn more about the way you play. We certainly have. Collecting and reading your responses for this article felt like discussing our favourite game with friends! We found it incredibly interesting to hear what aspects of the game you liked the most, where you spent the most time, and which moments delighted you the most. It was an interesting conversation with a lot of takeaways for us regarding the gameplay, your personal preferences, and ways we might improve the game.<br/><br/>As the Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader team, we'd like to say a big thank you to each and every one of you. Your responses, opinions, and ideas are genuinely important to us as we, too, are passionate fans. Seeing your engagement and enthusiasm is what inspires us day to day as we work to bring this universe to life. <br/><br/>That's all for now, but more is on the way: we're already preparing new updates and content which we're sure you're going to like. Follow the news and brace yourselves for more thrilling adventures in the Koronus Expanse. Thanks for being with us, and see you soon, friends!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

Greetings folks!<br/> <br/>Back in June I sat down with Rich, Sean and Victor from the WARHAMMER III development team to share some juicy new details on what's coming to the game in the next DLC, as well as our approach to interim patches coming between now and the next DLC's arrival.

Now, after razing, an attacking army will move away one hex beyond the zone of control radius, while a surviving army will move three hexes away from the settlement. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where playing as Slaanesh and using the ‘Pleasure Hunt’ pleasurable activity could sometimes apply its effects multiple times. <br/></li><li> The Star-Metal Talons upgrade in Ikit Claw's Forbidden Workshop no longer grants vanguard deployment to Warp Grinder units, as they already have this attribute. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where effects providing immunity or damage resistance to attrition also affected desertion, such as in cases of bankruptcy. <br/></li><li> The Elector Count of Hochland position no longer provides a movement range bonus twice.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">​ABILITIES/SKILLS/TRAITS</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Hero units that join Cathay caravans will now have spells or abilities where appropriate. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where upgrading a Chaos Sorcerer (Death) to a Nurgle Chaos Sorcerer (Death) would result in gaining the wrong trait. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where some effects meant for Nurgle characters were incorrectly applied to the Slaanesh Chaos Sorcerer.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">ANCILLARIES</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ​The Experimental Explosive item gained from Cathay caravans can now be transferred to other characters. </li></ul><div class="bb_h3">​TECH TREE</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where researching the ‘Grand Throne Chamber’ technology would unlock the Dwarf Lord ‘Mikael Leadstrong,’ who is meant to be obtained through legendary grudges. </li></ul><div class="bb_h3">RECRUITMENT</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ​The effects of different levels of province control no longer impact recruitment costs for Tomb Kings, as they do not incur recruitment costs. <br/></li><li> Character recruitment from buildings like The Deeps &amp; Gardens of Morr was overriding normal character recruitment. Now, only the recruitment option with the highest lord rank will be displayed.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">MISSIONS/VICTORY CONDITIONS </div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where some missions would double their settlement count when reloading saves. </li></ul>​<br/><div class="bb_h3">CAMPAIGN UI/UX </div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where Harmony effects on buildings would display as a negative value when adding Yin. <br/></li><li> Added help page buttons to the Nurgle Plagues and Tamurkhan's Chieftains panels. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where players couldn't undo spent skill points for heroes. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the Spices UI panel displayed landmarks alongside resource buildings at the Fortress of Dawn. <br/></li><li> Removed text references in the help pages to Chaos factions automatically declaring war to align with the intended design. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the help pages would open behind the Bloodlines panel when playing as Vampire Counts. <br/></li><li> Fixed a display issue with army zone of control where old VFX instances remained after moving an army in ambush stance. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the scroll position in the Allied Recruitment panel would reset when selecting a unit from an outpost as the first unit to be recruited; the scroll now stays in its correct position after selecting a unit, improving the recruitment flow. <br/></li><li> Clicking on the pin of a recruitable unit card should now correctly pin/unpin the card. <br/></li><li> Tweaked the entry in the effect lists of the Item Gained event popup to resolve occasional text bleeding issues in the UI. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the Athel Loren landmark buildings did not display the landmark icon or tooltip. <br/></li><li> Resolved an issue where clicking on Pieces of Eight mission scrolls as the Vampire Coast incorrectly navigated to the Missions panel. The scrolls now correctly direct players to the Pieces of Eight panel, ensuring smoother navigation during treasure hunts.</li></ul>​<div class="bb_h3">CAMPAIGN ENVIRONMENT</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue on the campaign map where a horse in the Tor Saroir region (Averlorn start position) was clipping through an altar, improving visual consistency in the area. </li></ul><div class="bb_h2">BATTLE</div> <br/><div class="bb_h3">​GENERAL/GAMEPLAY</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where High Elf towers and some of the walls behind them would disappear after being destroyed in siege battles, while still functioning as intact barriers. Towers now leave rubble behind, and walls remain visible post-destruction. <br/><i><b>DEV NOTE:</b> We are aware of ongoing related issues with other High Elves siege map destruction and are continuing to investigate. </i><br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the enemy reinforcements displayed in the Event Message did not match those shown in the Objectives Panel for the Battle for the Armour of Glimril Scales quest battle. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the Altar of Spawns settlement was not using the Norsca minor settlement battle map.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">​BATTLE AI</div>​<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> The AI is now less likely to use the General unit for solo harassment or outflanking. <br/></li><li> The AI-controlled Lord will no longer withdraw when ambushed if it has a good chance of winning. <br/></li><li> Fixed pathfinding on certain river maps to prevent the AI from attempting to cross through the water. <br/></li><li> Fixed a rare bug where enemy units were routing toward the player's units. <br/></li><li> Now, the reinforcements AI will join the fight more quickly if the main army is engaged in melee. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the AI was attempting to go to the river while the enemy was already on the same side. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the defending AI was constantly reforming in land battles. <br/></li><li> Now, the AI will attempt to synchronize the river assault groups based on the player’s positioning when passing through different crossings.<br/><i><b>DEV NOTE:</b> Previously, if the player was defending at only one location, the AI would lose units while those crossing at another location did not engage in combat. Now, the first group will wait until the second group crosses the river, allowing them to attack together.</i></li></ul><div class="bb_h3">UNITS GENERAL / ANIMATIONS</div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where Razorgor would move too far from the chariot during one of the attack animations. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the Daemon Prince of Khorne was missing one of the weapons during flying attack animations. <br/></li><li> Hans Valhirsson, the ghost dwarf, is no longer allowed to appear in ranked armies. <br/></li><li> Resolved an issue where parts of the Reiksguard and Empire Knights' helmets would disappear when viewed from behind at different levels of detail (LODs) during battles. <br/></li><li> Resolved an issue with the High Elf Princess's torso and arm armor textures distorting at certain LOD, ensuring consistent visual quality at different camera distances. <br/></li><li> Fixed the missing arm and blackened cape of High Queen Khalida at LOD3 and LOD4 levels. <br/></li><li> Fixed the visual problems with the leg armor of the Steed of Slaanesh model at different LODs. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where the Lahmian Vampire Lord's head texture does not appear correctly at certain LOD levels.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">ENVIRONMENT</div>​<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Addressed several visual issues, including missing objects, texture problems, floating objects on the Badlands Wastelands map and Ice Witch Mountains – Kislev Mountains map, misplaced assets in the Haunted Forest, Dragon River Run, Black Ark, and pixelated fallen trees on the Baron’s Bluff map, among others. <br/></li><li> Moved certain objects out of the playable area on the Parched Pass - Southlands Mountains map to align with the intended design. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where an ogre camp battle map would occasionally load incorrectly in the Badlands marsh area of the campaign map. <br/></li><li> Fixed a lighting issue in the Battle of the Great Hall of Greasus. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where ground units could be deployed mid-air on the Karak Azgaraz – Dwarfs map. <br/></li><li> Fixed camera collision issues with certain assets, including those in multiplayer maps.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">​BATTLE UI/UX</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ​The unit card for 'The Big One' in Thorek Ironbrow's quest battle, 'Klad Brakak,' is now correct. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the Unit Info UI element would not appear during replays if it had been disabled during the actual battle; players can now toggle unit details in replays, so they are no longer stuck with the settings from the most recent battle.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">MULTIPLAYER</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where the battle difficulty selected in the multiplayer campaign lobby would change by one tier for each player when the campaign started. <br/></li><li> It is no longer possible to issue orders to a military force while a player is selecting a new general for the orphaned army.</li></ul><hr/><br/><br/>As always, thanks for your bug reports and feedback.

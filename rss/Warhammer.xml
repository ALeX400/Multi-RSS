While our Heroes may have foiled Rasknitt, there’s plenty other vermin are eager to hatch their own devious plans. The farsqueaker, a verminous piece of Skryre engineering, allows some of these would-be masterminds to instantly communicate across vast distances with their networks of agents and spies.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/214b4f4b445b197bd3f636e2f464888b7e325464.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h1">Skaven Chronicles: Part 2</div><br/>I am much pleased with your timely report, Skratch, and heartened by the news of your many successes. The minions I placed in your unworthy paws are clearly moderately capable. Use them well, Skratch. Do not think-think you are my only proxy in the Grey Mountains. Just because I plucked you from your runtish litter as a whelp, it will not displease me too greatly to have to devour you should you fail. I will start at the tail end, yes-yes, and work my way up from there.<br/><br/>The situation in Karak Gnol is more chaotic even than that which you left behind. My predecessor (may he lay forever in the boiling stomach juices of the Great Horned Rat) was too stupid to do away with his more competent and ambitious underlings while he still lived. He thought his cronies in Clan Pestilens would shield him, and they did, but more fool-fool them because now he is dead and a dozen rival chieftains scheme to replace him. None yet recognize my rightful claim, so you see the risk I take sending away so many clanrat warriors, even under the leadership of an expendable deputy like you, and why I demand results. <br/><br/>Not in seven months, Skratch, but now. <br/><br/>I had taken to displaying the heads of my would-be assassins before the entrance to my burrow, but I eventually ran out of spikes. There is a lair-wide shortage of them, I am told. So I have begun adding them to the skavenbrew with the rest of the bodies. The slavemasters inform me that the extra meat is gratefully received in the under-warrens, and perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. The skavenslaves could do with some fattening up. The way things are smelling around here, I may soon need the wretches to fight as well as die-die in the mines. <br/><br/>Given the glowing reports of your progress under Helmgart-place, I have decided that you obviously do not need the reinforcements or the extra funds you requested. My warp tokens are not infinite and I have instead spent your overly generous stipend for this moon-cycle on a Rat Ogre bodyguard for my protection. A far wiser allocation of limited resources, I think-think you will agree.<br/>Now stop chasing after low-hanging tails and give me something I can actually show to my enemies! Bring me a head from the so-called ‘Ubersreik Five’ for starters. Their legend is, I am sure, greatly flattered by the gross incompetence of the skaven they have faced so far, but their deaths by my paw will undoubtedly impress the ignorant masses of Karak Gnol. <br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing, Skratch. <br/><br/>This is important, so listen-hear very closely. <br/><br/>The Pestilent Brotherhood may have done more harm to Clan Fester than the Bloodblight or Rasknitt’s vacuous promises, but I need their warriors and their warpstone if I am to become Warlord. They have their own reasons to loathe the Furless Five, so however you choose to be rid of them – make certain-sure that it is suitably dramatic…]]></description>

<div class="bb_h2">Greetings Space Marines</div><br/>Congratulations, after more than a decade of waiting, you’ve finally pursued Lieutenant Titus’ journey and you’re now honoring your pledge to the Emperor!<br/>We have some news to share in this Community Update, make sure you read it carefully!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">First of all, thank you… 💙</div><br/>On September 9, we released a long-time project - Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, and your feedback has overflown us with pride and joy. We saw you smile, laugh, purge xenos and demonstrate undeniable loyalty to the Imperium.<br/><br/>The amount of players kept increasing over the month, rallying more Space Marines to the cause, which is amazing. We want to let you know that we love the game as much as you do, and we’ll take good care of it, offering new content and listening to the community in the upcoming months.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/a98158606c540cd7d874f94c1c764dfce8617dbc.jpg"/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Upcoming content 💫</div>A hotfix will arrive very soon! It mostly intends to fix crashes and improve stability.<br/>In the future, expect quality of life improvements, additional customization features (such as new colors for the lenses), and more. For PC players: a 4K Texture Pack will be downloadable! It will be entirely free.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">YOUR FUTURE BRIEF</div>The new map for Operations mode, located on Planet Kadaku, will arrive in October. Here’s your brief:<br/><br/><i>The Tyranid invasion of Kadaku is ending. The planet’s organic material is being transformed into biomass, and Tyranid Capillary Towers stretch high into the skies above, where the Hive Ships wait to taste their victory.<br/>The Cadian forces have made a valiant attempt to push back against the Tyranids. A team of Space Marines arrives on Kadaku with a simple mission: help the Cadians destroy the towers. The Tyranids may win the planet, but the Imperium will make it as painful as possible for them.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/ea8e4d47f0ca45ce397a78fe792d6c22b51cb365.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Bug Patches and Questions 👾</div><br/><b>Therefore, our duty is not done here.</b><br/><br/>We’ve seen that many of you were experiencing server issues and other bugs.

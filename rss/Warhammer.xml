<br/><div class="bb_h1">Heroes!</div><br/>The second installment in the Verminous Dreams campaign,<i> ‘Devious Delvings’</i>, is out now, free for all owners of Vermintide 2!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Devious Delvings</div>Having infiltrated the Skaven-infested ruins of the mythical Athel Lithri, our Heroes must now investigate the site to find out what it is that the verminous Pactsworn are scheming. The devastation and machinery suggest a massive project, but what are they after in this temple of all places?<br/><br/>Well, either way, better get to the bottom of it and smash every rat that comes your way. And the ones that don’t, too, for good measure (Saltzpyre agrees).<br/><br/>Just like the previous maps, <i>Devious Delvings</i> comes with its own set of Okri’s Challenges and rewards, such as a portrait frame and paintings!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Versus: Custom Game Settings</div>And for the Pactsworn enthusiasts, we’ve got an exciting new addition! When creating a player-hosted custom game, the host now has a suite of adjustable settings to tweak and modify how the match will play out! You can take the opportunity to make things super crazy, or to make your own competitive changes!<br/><br/>Some examples of the settings you can find in Custom Games:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Early Win toggle<br/></li><li> Hero Bots toggle<br/></li><li> Friendly Fire toggle<br/></li><li> Number of Hero Wounds<br/></li><li> Knocked down Hero health<br/></li><li> Horde Ability charge rate<br/></li><li> Pactsworn respawn timer<br/></li><li> Pactsworn Catch up with Hero distance<br/></li><li> Spawn distance from Heroes<br/></li><li> Pactsworn Health<br/></li><li> …And more!</li></ul>On top of those and every other setting being added with this update, we plan on hopefully expanding that list with more and more settings as time goes on! Feel free to give us your own suggestions for settings you’d like to tinker with in Custom Games!<br/><br/>In the lobby browser, games that are playing with rules different from the default ones we use in Quickplay Servers will be flagged as having a modified ruleset.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Developer Stream today  - 17:00 CEST - twitch.tv/fatsharkgames</div><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/30503110/437f23d90815dd6952f4a2f68426bf71f68b3347.jpg"/><br/>We’ll be hosting a stream on our twitch today at 17:00 CEST! Level Design Lead <b>Rickard </b>and Art Director <b>Joseph </b>will be showing off the new mission as well as answering your questions and chatting with the community.

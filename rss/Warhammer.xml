While we were initially hesitant to have these features interact with each other, we‚Äôve decided to add a new building chain to the Deeps, available at the three unique Deeps locations.<br/><br/>This new building, the Halls of Remembering, allows you to either permanently pause the Age of Reckoning at a significant initial cost or to enhance the feature by increasing Grudge requirements in exchange for various Grudge Settler-related bonuses. However, it‚Äôs important to note that we intend to preserve the unique rewards of the Age of Reckoning, such as access to Grudge Settler units. Therefore, if you choose to bypass the Age of Reckoning, you should not expect to receive its rewards; we believe this is a fair trade-off.<br/><br/>Ultimately, more player choice is always a good thing, and we hope this addition will allow you to better customize your gameplay experience for those who wish to do so.<br/><br/>Now, let‚Äôs dive into the full list of what's been implemented:<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">PERFORMANCE</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed a rare crash that occurred after hitting End Turn following the construction of the Ritual of Cults building.<br/></li><li>Fixed a game freeze or unresponsiveness that occurred when starting The Great Drill of Hashut quest battle.</li></ul><div class="bb_h3">GAMEPLAY &amp; CAMPAIGN</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed an issue where, when multiple caravans or convoys were active, the first one dispatched would receive all the events. Now, the caravan or convoy that receives an event each turn is randomly selected.<br/></li><li>Fixed an issue where the Ritual of Cults could cause Cults to spawn in your own settlements.<br/></li><li>Fixed an issue where a Warpstone Cache building in The Deeps would not be demolished when a Master Engineer was present.<br/></li><li>Fixed an issue where the Old Doomsphere building would not detonate when removed if a Master Engineer was not present.<br/></li><li>Fixed an issue where events associated with previously destroyed Unusual Locations would still trigger after they were removed.</li></ul>We have also addressed several text inconsistencies, description issues, and bugs in tooltips and user interfaces, including:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed incorrect text on the settlement panel that showed income from The Deeps as Foreign Slot Income instead of Deeps Income. <br/></li><li>Updated the Cult of Ranald Unusual Location building description to better reflect its actual function.<br/></li><li>Updated the Beached Black Ark Unusual Location building description to better align with its actual function.<br/></li><li>Redesigned the 'News from the Sewers' event from the Cult of the Yellow Fang Unusual Location to remove any reference to the Cult of Ranald. Instead, the event now provides a Skaven-themed item, and the event text has been updated to match this change. The new item, the 'Under-Empire Map,' allows you to instantly reveal any Under-Cities in the region where this item is equipped.</li></ul>As always, thanks for your bug reports and feedback! If you run into any new issues after updating to 5.2.2 please report them over in our dedicated sub-forum.<br/><br/>See you on the battlefield!<br/><br/>‚ÄîThe <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><hr/><hr/><div class="bb_h1">‚ö† IMPORTANT</div><hr/><hr/><br/>If you experience any issues after downloading the update, please take a moment to <b>Verify the integrity of the game files</b> first to ensure there were no issues when downloading.

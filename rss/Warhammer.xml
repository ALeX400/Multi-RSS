A team of Space Marines arrives on Kadaku with a simple mission: help the Cadians destroy the towers. The Tyranids may win the planet, but the Imperium will make it as painful as possible for them.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/ea8e4d47f0ca45ce397a78fe792d6c22b51cb365.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Bug Patches and Questions üëæ</div><br/><b>Therefore, our duty is not done here.</b><br/><br/>We‚Äôve seen that many of you were experiencing server issues and other bugs.

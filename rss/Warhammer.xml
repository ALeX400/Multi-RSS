      <title>Total War - Thank You For Your Support In 2025</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1142710/view/510726144262144981</link>

We do read the feedback, take it to heart, sometimes beat ourselves up about how dumb we did a thing, and then plan how we make things better.<br/><br/>2025 has been a landmark year for the Total War franchise. We celebrated 25 incredible years of the franchise and marked the occasion by announcing three new projects I’ve been excited about since I came to CA. We also shared a first look at Warcore, the brand-new Total War game engine (to be fair it’s built on top of the last one so a little Ship of Theseus here), and spoke about bringing our new games to console (I'll talk more about that later).<br/><br/>We revealed the worlds’ worst kept secret, we’re making a game in one of my favorite universes, Warhammer 40,000. At the same time, we look to our past, both Total War’s and humanity’s, to set our sights on the Middle Ages with MEDIEVAL III (now? Soon?). I’ll write more on why we made the call to announce it. And finally, we are not finished with Total War Warhammer III as we revealed Lords of the End Times. It’s my hope that we talked about at least one setting that you're excited for.<br/><br/>Our Anniversary Showcase was the first event like this we’ve ever done; and a longstanding ambition for us.<br/><br/>We know we didn’t get everything perfect in this plan, but aligning three projects at very different stages in their development cycle is challenging. There’s plenty of feedback we’ll take on board for next time, and that’s exactly how it should be. In retrospect, I wish we’d also spent time celebrating our players and the mods across all our games – but that’s something we’ll explore in the future.<br/><br/>For a first attempt, I couldn’t be happier for the teams who pulled this off and gave you a genuine glimpse into the projects we’ve eagerly been building. I’m proud of what we did and happy for what we learned. Those in front of the camera are lifelong Total War fans, and while exciting, it’s also incredibly nerve wracking talking publicly about the things you’re working on – I'm hugely proud of them all. It was an enormously complex orchestration of presenting the showcase internationally, launching a DLC, and releasing Immortal Empires to WH1 and 2 players.<br/><br/>Over half a million people tuned in, and seeing that mix of familiar faces, players coming back after years away, and people discovering Total War for the very first time was awesome. It meant a lot to the team, and moments like that remind us why we choose to do this for a living.<br/><br/>In the future, we want to deliver more of these moments. Could a Total War-con work? Would you come? Regardless, future events might not all look the same, but each will show what Total War is up to across its many projects and where it’s going.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">👉 CONTINUE READING 👈</div><br/><br/>— The <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

<div class="bb_h3"><b>🙌 Hi everyone,</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">First of all, we wanted to wish you all a wonderful holiday season. Our teams are taking a well-deserved break during the winter holidays. 😉</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">First, we want to address the connectivity issues some of you have been experiencing since the 11.0 update. We are actively working on it, and we apologize for not addressing these issues earlier, as we were collecting more information to confirm it was not isolated cases. You may find the Patch notes for <u>Hotfix 11.1</u> and <u>11.2</u> here.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>WE WERE GRATEFUL FOR YOU IN 2025</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We wanted to kindly and sincerely thank you for 2025. 💙</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Throughout the whole year, you’ve been showing immense support towards <i>Space Marine 2</i> and the dev team. This year has seen the closing of the first year of live ops content, as well as the beginning of the second year, and we cannot wait to show you what’s in store for 2026. 😊</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/a1affab15cfe99b42412b16121c332297164f788.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>WHAT’S COMING IN 2026? </b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The next Space Marines Chapters to receive cosmetic DLCs are the Raven Guard and the Carcharodons in Patch 12. Tell us, <b>which one are you most excited to see?</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Patch 12 will come with a new class: The Techmarine with the Omnissiah Axe, a new Operation, new Battlefield Conditions for Stratagems, new Heroic Weapons, technical improvements, as usual, and more! 🤫 The Battlebarge Expansion will unfortunately have to be delayed to a later Patch. <b>We prefer releasing a version we're satisfied with rather than just follow a schedule at all costs.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Alongside patch 12 comes new DLC content: a pack of heads &amp; voices based on the Blood Angels, Black Templars and Space Wolves chapters. It will include over 450 voicelines – localized in all existing languages – per Chapter, including unique lines based on the Chapter (for example, the Space Wolf will shout “<i>For the Allfather</i>” instead of the usual “<i>For the Emperor</i>”) and your Space Marine will shout these new lines. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">Here’s how they look:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/9d45fa947e0d7b09ff50e357caeeb8bb75da141b.png"/><i>Please note that this DLC is not included in the Season Pass 2</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Since it’s the end of the year and you all deserve a gift, you shall be given a little hint on the upcoming Operation, “Disruption”:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">It takes place on Avarax.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Your squad will deploy to purge Xenos presence and help besieged Cadians.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">An iconic character from the Campaign will come back 🤫</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph">Stay tuned in January for more info regarding the 12.0 update!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/82b31cc49b30bee25470ba65da0cf936bcd53cc4.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Here are some more hints on what to expect in 2026, from Game Director Dmitry Grigorenko:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">With the announcement of chapter specific heads and voicelines you can strike out “Something we said we are going to do, but nobody noticed” from the list of upcoming customization additions we’ve mentioned in September. We’re really happy to deliver what you have been asking for months now. Nevertheless, the other 2 hints still remain: 🤫</p></li></ul><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>1) Something we should have done a long time ago.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>2) Something we said we are going to do, but nobody noticed.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>3) Something we said we are never going to do.</i></p></div></div></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">We’ve adjusted our plans and decided to throw in a bit more free stuff than what the Y2 roadmap originally listed.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">The progression update item listed in the roadmap is going to be a whole new feature, we will talk about it closer to its release. On top of that we are going to expand the Datavault’s current Ordeal system next year.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">We are working on a lot of QoL things and sandbox improvements. For example, a highly requested feature of perk loadouts is in the works. </p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Contested Health rebalance will happen alongside with Patch 13, but there are going to be a lot of minor QoL improvements before that to build a proper foundation first.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Siege mode will get a big expansion of its sandbox gameplay and we have big plans for its second map.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p></li></ul><div class="bb_h1"><b>DECEMBER COMMUNITY EVENT</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the end of the year, launch the Stratagems mode and complete 2 weekly or daily Stratagems in any difficulty to earn the Death or Glory left greave! 🔥</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Please note that the Weekly Stratagems are now reset each Wednesday.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/58892e0d4b7440e88b0f18193827db3f90aac4ff.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The event starts on December 17 and runs until December 31st!</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Onward, Space Marines. 🫡</p><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>RESULTS OF THE COMMUNITY POLL</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This month, we asked you in <u>a poll</u>, which “big” Tyranid was the most terrifying in Space Marine 2. Among the suggested answers, you’ve picked the <b>Biovore</b>! 🕷️</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Now, we’re curious: what exactly makes it so scary to you? 😁</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/43315296/95794a709ffbc01e2b28981a0ca2182ab6b2abb8.jpg"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">If you want to participate in such polls, we publish them each week and sometimes it’s about Space Marine 2. Keep an eye out on our socials for it! Sometimes we even use the data to refine our games. By casting your vote, you’re doing your part. 😉</p><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><div class="bb_h2"><b>FOCUS TOGETHER’S IDEAS</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">In October, we took some time to address some of the latest and most discussed ideas, while bringing answers from Game Director Dmitry Grigorenko. This month we’d like to do it again, but we also wanted to address THE idea that’s gotten the most votes!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">You may want to <u>read them here</u> and <u>here</u> first.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>💬 Hello there. First off: it's a great idea, and we thank you for it. Such constructed and well-put ideas help us greatly. We're taking notes of the shortcomings in the game's UI. In retrospect, this is how we should have built our customization system for Space Marine 2. </i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>But the reality is that we can't do it (for Space Marine 2 😉), not only is it an insane amount of work, you have to consider that we will need to migrate millions of existing save files to a completely new system without breaking anything and without making anyone unhappy with migration.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>On top of that, we're devoting our resources to other priorities, such as producing maps, DLCs, weapons, enemies, etc.</i></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Dmitry Grigorenko, Game Director</i></p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><div class="bb_table"><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">TITLE / LINK</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">SUMMARY</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">DEV RESPONSE</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>Heroic Weapon Idea - Calibanite Greatsword</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Weapon idea</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Greatswords deserve its own moveset and set of finisher animations rather than being just a heroic skin. Those things take a lot of time to implement. That being said "if" 😉 we are to make another melee weapon archetype the greatswords will be a top priority. Sorry, Lightning Claws fans.</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>Display More Team Info</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Clearer UI in combat</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">We do agree, this is something we consider adding later down the line</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>This BA pauldron</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Make the BA Champion R.Pauldron usable for all classes and available as a L.Pauldron</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Let's clear things up a little on asset production. It's not that easy to make right pauldrons to be usable on left shoulders.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We do not simply ctrl+c / ctrl+v a pauldron, you have to redo the entire asset from scratch, because all of the text and iconography has to be redone and cannot be mirrored. This also means duplicate textures for patterns and everything.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Our focus for customization was and will always be about adding new stuff first. We would rather do a completely new shoulder pad, rather than have our Art team spend about the same amount of time to add a different version of the same item.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Plus, right shoulders are always our top priority because they can be seen the most from the right side camera when you play.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">I'm not saying we are never going to do it, but right now the focus is on adding new items, rather than reworking old ones.</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>Bots should have team perks</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Extend bot customization further by giving them team perks</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Let's clarify a bit how the bots work in PvE: since they are not real players, they do not use the same gameplay rules as players. They are not designed to have team perks because their combat capabilities already kind of include some of the team perks. They are going to be too strong if they have team perks. We would rather have players to play in coop than with bots. Bots are a fall back solution.</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>Assault Ability Resource Rework - Unlock More Fun Dynamic Play</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Various ideas to improve Assault's ability and make it less restrictive</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">We are very hesitant to allow Assault to Jump Pack dash without using his ability, for the same reason why his Jump Pack works differently from Story and PvP. He will be able to skip the entire areas of the map and there is nothing you can do about it.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">It's not like we are never going to do this, but we want to see how our changes to Jump Dash build work first without breaking the entire logic of the class. Because Assault is not a bad class right now, definitely not weak. Just need more build variety and Jump Dashes is the prime candidate for it.</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>Siege Mode Dreadnought Ai</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Make Dreadnought AI prioritize enemy by threat level</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">This is something we might consider eventually, yes.</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>Black Shield/Death Watch cosmetics</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Add Black Shield and/or Deathwatch cosmetics</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">More Deathwatch cosmetics are coming. But keep in mind that Deathwatch from Story are not Primaris marines and we cannot use their armour in PvE.</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>More customisation slots</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Increase the amount of available customization slots, because there are now too much cosmetic options compared to the amount of available custo slots</p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">Indeed, that would be nice to have. We'll see what we can do.</p></div></div><div class="bb_table_tr"><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>Expand the Accolades cap to 1,500</b></u></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph"></p></div><div class="bb_table_td"><p class="bb_paragraph">We think that the current cap and rate of accolades gain is fine. Besides, we will be adding more ways to earn accolades in the game, but the cap is going to stay.</p></div></div></div><p class="bb_paragraph"> </p><div class="bb_h2"><b>THAT’S IT FOR THIS YEAR!</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Again, we wanted to express our gratitude for your unwavering support and your dedication! Collecting, reading and hearing your feedback on the game throughout all 2025 has been a great help to us.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Space Marine 2 </i>wouldn’t be the game it is without you, and we’re far from being done! ⭐</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Thank you, dear Space Marines,</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>The Saber &amp; Focus teams</i></p>]]></description>

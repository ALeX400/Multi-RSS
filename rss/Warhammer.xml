Commissar Darinda Dukane has assumed command of the Moebian 53rd regiment - the famed Steelheads. These stalwart troops have been deployed to Tertium at the behest of the Planetary Governor, Lord Margrave, who is disturbed by the perceived lack of progress made by the Inquisition.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">But what is a Commissar of the Astra Militarum?</div>The Commissars of the Officio Prefectus are fearsome, iron-fisted authoritarians who keep the wheels of the Astra Militarum in motion. To the masses of Humanity, most of whom recognise the black greatcoat, peaked cap and polished boots of a Commissar from hab-block propaganda frescoes or grainy recruitment vids, these inflexible men and women are Imperial authority made manifest. Their amorphous remit is to ensure that all do their duty in the Emperor’s name, and the high rank and wide-ranging powers of these Departmento Munitorum agents give them leeway to enforce discipline at all levels. Should discipline and morale falter, should orders fail to be obeyed in anything less than exemplary and immediate fashion, it is these ruthless men and women in black who take whatever steps necessary to restore order –<br/>no matter the cost.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">A Commanding Presence</div>Commissars rarely assume direct command of a regiment and the circumstances by which Commissar Dukane came to head up the 53rd remain shrouded in mystery - or are at least snarled up in the processes of the Imperium’s infamous bureaucracy. However, it is plain that she enjoys the full confidence of the sectors lord militant, and has swiftly moved to assume immediate control of the Atoman warzone, masterminding aggressive deployments by the 53rd and rallying the winnowed survivors of the Moebian 21st - until now, the only official Astra Militarum presence in Tertium.<br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Uneasy Allies</div>With initial drop zones secured, Dukane has taken station on the Mourningstar and even now casts a suspicious eye over Grendyl’s warband, whose motives and masters she clearly does not trust. Nonetheless, she is too practical not to recognise the necessity of allies and has assigned the finest drill sergeants of the 53rd to tutor the rejects in proper weapons drill. Expendable allies they might be, but every heretic the members of the warband eliminates is one less heretic to stand in her path.<br/><br/>But not everything is going Dukane’s way. Tertium’s insidious cult refuses to let this upstart newcomer foil their long-held plans. Even as the 53rd secures new ground the heretics prepare to strike a humbling blow, presenting Sergeant-Major Morrow with an opportunity to prove the warband’s worth…<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>]]></description>

The rebellion check is now performed earlier, allowing the rest of the code to be skipped if a rebellion occurs. <br/></li><li> <span class="bb_strike">Resolved an issue where technologies requiring active Gifts of Chaos were not consistently providing bonuses for Warriors of Chaos factions, particularly affecting techs like 'Mystical Banner' and 'Temple of Tzeentch' when playing as Vilitch. Bonuses should now correctly apply once the relevant Gifts are active.</span><br/><i>Unfortunately this fix has not made it in to the final release of hotfix 5.2.7, but will be included in our next release. Apologies for the confusion!</i></li></ul><div class="bb_h3">UI/UX </div><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where multiple instances of the same Path to Glory event would trigger upon unlocking one. <br/></li><li> Fixed a missing icon when recruiting an Exalted Hero of Tzeentch. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the Daemonic Progression panel would not open when accessed through the Character Details panel. <br/></li><li> The Dwarf Ancestor Rune no longer incorrectly states that it grants permanent death immunity to all nearby units. (This was purely a UI issue.) <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where the Chaos Dwarfs' settlement type icon on the city label would not update after the settlement type was changed. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where several tooltips for contact effects in the Flesh Laboratory were missing text. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where characters with long starting trait names, such as 'Virtue of the Impetuous Knight,' could clip outside the recruitment box. <br/></li><li> Fixed several Tomb King building icons that were using the wrong colour. <br/></li><li> Fixed a bug where misleading tooltips would pop up after purchasing an upgrade in the Rewards of Dread panel. </li></ul><div class="bb_h2">BATTLE</div> <br/><div class="bb_h3">GENERAL</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed an issue where the Herald of Tzeentch (Metal) was incorrectly treated as a Slaanesh-aligned character when determining the likelihood of army abilities for Daemons of Chaos. <br/></li><li> Fixed the porthole camera angle for the Shadewraith Gunners (Deck Gunners) Regiment of Renown. <br/></li><li> The Blue Scribes can now access the Lore of the Hag in Custom Battle. </li></ul><div class="bb_h3">UI/UX</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a bug where the abilities 'Rot or Die,' 'Necrotic Phylactery,' and 'Isha's Rain' did not display their names when hovered over in certain contexts. <br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where several Legendary Lords were using incorrect unit cards in quest battles.<br/></li><li> Fixed an issue where Emperor Karl Franz's name was duplicated on his unit card in battles fought during a campaign.</li></ul><div class="bb_h2">MULTIPLAYER</div> <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Fixed a multiplayer campaign desync issue that occurred when a player without ownership of a building in the Nurgle chain upgraded a building to complete the cycle and then recruited all available Forsaken of Nurgle units. </li></ul><hr/><br/><br/>Thank you once again for your feedback and bug reports.

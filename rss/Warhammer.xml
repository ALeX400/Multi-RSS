Each activated swing will also increase Heat by a small amount.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">When the weapon is deactivated, the Heat bar will passively cool down.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">If the Heat bar is completely filled, the weapon overheats. On overheating, the weapon deactivates and cannot be activated until the Heat bar is completely emptied.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The weapon will also deactivate from the following actions:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Automatically, when swapping out of the Power Falchion</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Manually, when performing the Special action while the weapon is already activated.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">After performing the Special activate or deactivate action, the attack chain will not be reset.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Additionally, the weapon will receive Block properties while activating or deactivating.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This will provide flexibility to weave in the Special action in between attack combos.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><u><b>Aridin Mk I Power Falchion</b></u></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The default mark of the Power Falchion is simple to approach, with straightforward attack directions and great ease of access to both single and multi target combos.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><u>Attacks</u></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Light 1:</b> Moderately fast, diagonal Vanguard attack with good Cleave.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Light 2:</b> Moderately fast, horizontal Vanguard attack with good Cleave.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Chained into also after a Push.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Light 3:</b> Fast stab Strikedown attack with good damage, Finesse and armour penetration.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Pushfollow attack:</b> Vertical Strikedown attack with good damage and armour penetration. <i>Chains into Light 3 and Heavy 1.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Heavy 1:</b> Slow, vertical Strikedown attack with great damage, Finesse and armour penetration.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Heavy 2:</b> Slow, vertical Strikedown attack with great damage, Finesse and armour penetration.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Chained into also after a Push.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Heavy 3:</b> Slow, horizontal Vanguard attack with great Cleave and good damage also to secondary targets.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Chains into Light 2 and Heavy 2.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><u>Suggested Horde combos</u></p><p class="bb_paragraph">L1 &gt;

While this will make the damage potential less spiky when mag-dumping, it will also allow for an easier control of recoil and spread on continuous fire.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/e700de79b8874e18ab7140f6074ba98f94e5b7ee.png"/></p><div class="bb_h1">Fixes &amp; Tweaks</div><div class="bb_h2">Tree Reworks &amp; Class Balance</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">When we first released Darktide almost 3 years ago, we had clear goals for what each class should be and where they should shine. However, over the years the specialties and niches that we envisioned have slowly spread out across all classes, and it is most noticeable with the Zealot. The Zealot was supposed to be <i>the </i>melee class, but over time and with the Ogryn Rework and release of the Arbites especially, the Zealot has fallen behind. We‚Äôre looking to reinvigorate the Zealots tree with more build diversity, and increase its offensive capabilities in melee, while at the same time adjusting the power of the Ogryn and Arbites.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We‚Äôre taking a closer look at the Veteran and Psyker Trees as well. We have pruned some talents and consolidated others, done adjustments to the layouts to provide more interesting choices and reduced unwanted travel nodes. We‚Äôve also given each of them a couple of new talents and done changes to existing ones.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Class Balance is an ever ongoing challenge, but we intend to take a slightly different approach as we want to increase the cadence of balance adjustments.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Worth noting: this means that Veteran, Zealot and Pskyer characters will see their talent trees reset. </p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Zealot</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Zealot‚Äôs Talent Tree is getting a facelift, with plenty of talents removed, even more talents added, and the entire Layout has been rebuilt from the ground up. As mentioned in the previous section, the main goal is to increase build diversity. We have a secondary goal however, and that is to give the Zealot a strong identity in terms of where it shines.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Base Toughness</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We‚Äôve lowered the amount of Toughness obtainable through Stat Nodes, and have increased Base toughness to make up for it.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">70 -&gt; 100</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><u>Abilities</u></p><p class="bb_paragraph">To more easily balance the Abilities against each other, we‚Äôve decided to reduce the effectiveness of the general Ability Cooldown Talents while adding cooldown mechanics into the Fury of the Faithful ability as well as the Shroudfield ability.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Fury of the Faithful</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New Talent: Unrelenting Fury - Killing an Elite or Specialist within 5s of using Fury of the Faithful restores 20% Ability Cooldown.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Shroudfield</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Backstab Damage 100% -&gt; 150%</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Finesse Damage 100% -&gt; 150%</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New: 100% Melee Rending</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Perfectionist</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Reworked - Stealth Kills restore Ability Cooldown.

behind in the latest big revamp of the Ogryn arsenal, but in this release we are giving it some extra polish.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Special attack of the weapon was somewhat underwhelming, as it needed to create space and time for the activation only for a relatively mild payout.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We significantly increased the damage and impact values of the activated attack, both for the hit and the explosion, but also the explosion's outer radius and the damage inflicted within it.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">To balance the additional power, the weapon will now enter a cooldown period before the Special activation can be performed again.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The cooldown is 12s, and the status of the Special will be conveyed by new visual and sound effects.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We also took a look at the general moveset and attack profiles of the weapon, with the goal of making it more well rounded with both easy to use and more advanced attack chains.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">To strengthen the single target capabilities of the weapon, we added a new Heavy Strikedown attack with good damage and Finesse multiplier, which can be reached from Push, Special activate and Light 2.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">You can use it to deal massive damage after the Special activation, but also to create simple Strikedown combos (e.g. Light 1 &gt; Light 2 &gt; Heavy &gt; Light 1 &gt; ‚Ä¶)</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Additionally, the Light 3 and Light 4 attacks will now gain a 10% attack speed bonus when looped (i.e. when continuing the Light attack chain after the first Light 4), simulating the increasing momentum of the combo.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we improved the Heavy Relentless profile properties and lowered the chain times of the Heavy 1 and Heavy 2 attacks both for the windup and when initiating following attacks, and did some¬† fine tweaking on other chain times and actions.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Ogryn Power Maul detailed changes</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">New Special activate

we are tweaking the behaviour of the Special activated attacks for Chain weapons (Assault Chainswords, Assault Chainaxes, Heavy Eviscerators).</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The damage curve will now be more differentiated depending on the armour type of the enemy:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">On armoured types, the damage will be skewed more towards the final instance, simulating the chain blade finally ripping through the enemy defences (e.g. Flak or Carapace armour)</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Conversely, the damage will be immediately much higher on less-armoured types as the chain teeth immediately bites into the flesh (e.g. Unarmoured, Maniac, Unyielding)</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The overall damage compared to the previous live version should be similar against armoured enemies, but higher against the rest of the opposition.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For the full list of changes, check out the full patch notes on </b>our website<b>.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Assault Chainswords</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We are introducing multiple changes and improvements for the Assault Chainsword family, to raise one the most iconic 40K weapons up a bit.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Several attack profiles have been improved in damage, finesse and/or impact properties.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We have also widened the hitboxes of most attacks, tweaked them to be more aligned with their animations, and allowed all attacks to be performed while sprinting instead of resetting the combo chain.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk IV</b>, we added a new Heavy Strikedown attack, which can be reached after Light 1 to create an easy to access single target chain.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">(Note that this will mean that Heavy 2 will no longer be reachable after Light 1)</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk XIIIg</b>, we changed the combo structure after a Heavy 2 attack to allow for an easier crowd control attack direction: it will now chain into Light 2 / Heavy 3 instead of Light 4 / Heavy 3.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We increased the power level multiplier of the Light 4 attack to reward it being further into the attack chain.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we tweaked several windup and chain timings to make the weapon more responsive.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For the full list of changes, check out the full patch notes on </b>our website<b>.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Assault Chainaxes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the Assault Chainaxes, we performed targeted tweaks to specific profiles to make them more reliable in controlling enemies, both singularly and in groups.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We also did a pass on all attacks to make sure that their hitboxes are correctly aligned to their animations, and allowed all attacks and windups to be performed while sprinting (however, still with a considerable movement speed penalty).</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For the full list of changes, check out the full patch notes on </b>our website<b>.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Duelling Swords</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Duelling Swords are highly effective weapons, offering excellent mobility, a strong staggering Special attack, and decent horde-clearing, while also being able to quickly eliminate key threats. This rebalance aims to rein in the power of the weapon family while enhancing its 'duelling' aspect.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The <b>Mk IV</b> and <b>Mk II</b> marks featured an exceptionally powerful Heavy Strikedown Stab attack. This attack's high Finesse multiplier led to excessive damage scaling, so we have reduced the multiplier to align it with other weapons. We are also adjusting its armour damage modifiers. Despite these changes, it will remain one of the most impactful weapons in the game.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The Special action has been changed from a quick poke to a Parry-Riposte mechanic, similar to the 'Devil's Claw' swords. Activating the Special input now initiates a Parry state, blocking enemy attacks. Successfully blocking a melee attack in Parry state triggers an automatic Riposte attack. This Riposte attack deals significant damage to the first target hit, with good Finesse scaling and armour modifiers against all enemy types. Due to the weapon's low base Stamina, investing in Stamina or Block Cost reduction is recommended for consistent Parry usage. Performing a Perfect Parry (blocking within 0.2 seconds of initiating the Parry) greatly reduces Stamina cost. Psyker players have an extra unique bonus due to them being the original carriers of this weapon: at the cost of 4% Peril, they gain significantly increased Riposte attack strength.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The new Riposte attack is comparable in strength to the previous Heavy Strikedown Stab, preserving the weapon's high burst damage while demanding precise spacing, timing, and Stamina management.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, specific changes were made to the <b>Mk V</b> mark. Since it lacks the Heavy Strikedown Stab, its Heavy Strikedown attack power has been increased, particularly against Unyielding armour. The <b>Mk V</b> also benefits from a stronger Riposte attack compared to its siblings.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For the full list of changes, check out the full patch notes on </b>our website<b>.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Spearhead Boltgun</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Bolter's extreme firepower was paired with a very generous ammo reserve, allowing it to be used too liberally over the course of the mission.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">We are slightly toning down the amount of ammo, while keeping the magazine size and the overall power of the weapon unchanged.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">(Also now the reserves amount will be an actual multiple of the magazine size)</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For the full list of changes, check out the full patch notes on </b>our website<b>.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Crusher</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Crusher will no longer reset its attack chains while sprinting during attacks and attack windups. However the hefty movement speed penalty while charging an Heavy attack will remain present.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Also, we added a small amount of minimum time to the Block action to reinforce the feeling of handling a very much not nimble two handed bludgeon.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>For the full list of changes, check out the full patch notes on </b>our website<b>.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Vigilant Autoguns</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Vigilant Autoguns have received a significant update, primarily focused on improving their handling: Recoil, Spread, Sway, and accuracy have all been adjusted for ease of use.

<p class="bb_paragraph">This free update adds a <b>new arena, new buff families and new Memory Echoes</b> to Mortis Trials, Darktide‚Äôs roguelike and wave-based mode. The update also brings a <b>new weapon family, two new weapon marks, a new enemy, talent tree updates, a time-limited Special Event,</b> and more!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Bound By Duty will be available for free to all Darktide players across all platforms on September 23, 2025.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Mortis Trials arena, Theatre of Rectitude</b>: Re-enter the visions summoned by the ship‚Äôs Psyker, Sefoni, in an all-new arena inspired by the Clandestium Gloriana mission and its frozen Adeptus Mechanicus Foundryplex.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Two new Indulgences archetypes: </b>offering additional buffs expanding the breadth of combat styles within Mortis Trials.</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Emperor Favored:</b> Grants increase to critical chance and critical damage, plus effects that trigger on critical hits. These buffs stack: early gains may seem modest, but they compound to support powerful crit-focused builds later in a run.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Goliath:</b> Centers on mobility and resilience rather than damage reduction: immunity to Suppression and Stagger, stamina boosts, and crowd-control options. One notable buff staggers enemies when you sprint, letting you plow through hordes even when cornered.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Memory Echoes:</b> Several new chapters that expand NPC backstories and reveal more of the Mourningstar‚Äôs past through Sefoni‚Äôs visions between waves.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Enemy, Scab Plasma Gunner</b>: A dangerous new Specialist enemy joins Darktide‚Äôs roster. The Scab Plasma Gunner wields a powerful plasma weapon, forcing players to adapt their tactics and brace for intense, high-damage attacks. Expect to feel the heat in any mission where this adversary appears.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Veteran weapon, the Power Falchion: </b>A single-edged, one‚Äëhanded power weapon that plays as a counterpart to the Power Sword. Its Special action works like the Zealot‚Äôs Relic Blade: activating the Special action empowers the Falchion until its heat bar fills, at which point it overheats and the Special is locked until the bar empties. This weapon family comes with two marks.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Bolt Pistol and Boltgun marks: </b>Bolt Pistol Mk VI Godwyn‚ÄëBranx and Boltgun Mk III Locke. Both marks emphasize explosive effects: larger explosions and significantly more explosive damage on hit or kill compared with other marks in their families.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Talent Reworks and Class balances:</b> increased flexibility and player agency around the Veteran, Zealot and Psyker trees by providing a more open layout. The overarching goal was to bring better balance, more build diversity, and more meaningful choices across all classes. The Ogryn and Arbites talents also got a light touch-up!</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Special Event, Smuggled Munitions:</b> Forces of the Traitorous 6th have raided local plasma weapon caches. Players will have to out these dangerous squads and dispatch them. A flashlight will not go amiss as this event will always be attached to low visibility conditions such as Ventilation Purge, Lights Out or Power Supply Interruption.¬†</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>New Havoc Modifier, Contaminated Stimms:</b> Darktide‚Äôs endgame mode will have a new modifier joining the existing roster. Face challenging tides of enemies using stimms to reinforce themselves. In addition, the previously run Special event Rotten Armor will return once again as a modifier for Havoc.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Quality of Life changes:</b> a few improvements will be coming to Darktide, including a dodge counter, a new on-screen indicator showing remaining dodges. This is to ensure players always know when they can evade and when they‚Äôre out of effective dodges. Players will also be able to replay missions from the Battle for Tertium campaign.¬†</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h1">Twitch Drops</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/ad2e4a9698f2d4e6a772e73bf56f8cfe97e89ea1.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Earn the Protector of Tertium cosmetics by watching eligible Twitch streams!

<div class="bb_h2"><b>‚ÄãHello Space Marines,</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">A new hotfix is now live on every platform. It fixes critical issues such as the Assault‚Äôs Ascension perk dealing friendly-fire damage, Stratagems having more Battlefield Conditions than listed and more. Also, the Sniper‚Äôs Camo Cloak activation cost change (which was initially planned for 11.0) has also been pushed on this update. Read the complete patch notes below:</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h1"><b>PATCH NOTES</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKS</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Heroic Chainsword:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Rebalanced base stats.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Reworked its perk: Light-&gt;Heavy-&gt;Heavy combo now ends with a Stomp attack.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">All Heavy attacks damage increased by 15%.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Stratagems:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an issue where Daily Stratagems could have more Battlefield Conditions than listed.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Camo Cloak's activation cost:</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph">The activation cost of the Sniper ability has been changed. Now it works this way:¬†</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">The first three uses of Camo Cloak in a row do not take away energy by themselves (the ability consumes energy, as before). The fourth activation takes away 5% of energy instantly, each subsequent one takes away a little more. After the last use, there is a 10-second timer, after which the activation cost again becomes zero.</p></li></ul><blockquote class="bb_blockquote"><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>With the right perk set up, you can still do 5-6 cloak cancels in a row. Cloak cancel will still be very rewarding to learn and to do, but you won't be able to abuse it endlessly while staying invisible and invulnerable to enemies.</i></p></blockquote><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Spawn Director:</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">The number of Chaos Spawns in packs is slightly reduced and now matches Tyranid Warriors.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>GENERAL FIXES</b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed damage for the Power Backstep attack when the Power Wave perk is selected for Power Axe.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Improved flame weapons VFX visibility for allies.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed an issue that prevented bots from entering elevators in Exfiltration operation.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed perks dealing friendly fire damage.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Fixed PvP connectivity issues.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Minor localization fixes.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Minor UI fixes.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">ESRB update pop-up: A pop-up will appear on the main menu to inform you of an update of the ESRB rating. This pop-up will only appear once.¬†</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Please note that this update of our rating is just here to properly reflect what was already in-game for several months. There has been no change to our monetization system, and no changes are planned.</i></p></li></ul></li></ul>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h2">Hey Everyone!</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Welcome to a new series of balancing blogs for Darktide! Going forward we will be doing regular balance changes to the game alongside big updates. As part of this journey we want to include you, the community, by sharing our intended changes early on to gather feedback and ensure our intention matches your expectations. Let's begin by discussing our approach to balancing Darktide. We strive to create a balanced game environment, recognizing that perfect balance in a PvE-focused game may be unattainable and perhaps unnecessary. However, a reasonable level of balance among weapons is essential. This ensures players feel empowered to experiment with various setups and choose options that are both enjoyable and engaging for their playstyle.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This initial set of balance adjustments focuses on improving underperforming weapons so they can better compete with top-tier options. Some of these changes also pave the way for new weapons, such as the powerful signature shotgun coming with the Arbites class. Adjustments to existing shotguns were made to ensure the Arbites weapons feel satisfying without completely overshadowing their existing counterparts.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">While we are aware of some currently powerful weapons that need addressing, we chose to first elevate the lower-performing options rather than immediately nerfing the top ones.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Detailed explanations of the specific changes to each weapon are provided below. Going forward, we plan to implement more frequent balance updates to keep the game fresh, address outliers, and introduce new and interesting playstyles. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">List:</p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Coming changes in 1.8.0</i></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>"Devil's Claw" Swords</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Tactical Axes</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Shock Mauls</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Heavy Eviscerators</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Helbore Lasguns</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Combat Shotguns</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Double-barreled Shotgun</i></p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Catachan "Devil's Claw" Swords</div><p class="bb_paragraph">This batch of changes for the Devil’s Claw swords aims at further reinforcing the crowd control and reliability of the family.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We increased the offensive properties of the Light attack profiles, while also significantly increasing the armour damage modifiers of the Heavy Strikedown and Special Riposte profiles against specific armour types.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We improved the base Stamina statistic, reduced the minimum Block time (the amount of time that the Block stance must be maintained after performing the input) and allowed for most attacks and attack starts to be performed while sprinting.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">This will make the weapon snappier and more responsive in different situations.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we took a pass on all attacks to tweak active windows, ranges and hitboxes to be better aligned with their animations.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk I</b>, we added a new Heavy Strikedown attack, only reached from Light 3. In turn, the Light 3 attack is now reachable also from the Push action, and has an increased baseline power multiplier. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">These additions will grant additional options to a mark which was lacking in single target attacks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk IV</b>, we raised the power level multiplier of the Light 4 attack as it was very far into the attack chain and not particularly enticing.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk VII</b>, we increased the power level multiplier of the Pushfollow and Light 3 attacks while also changing the possible combos after a Riposte attack.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">Now after a successful Special Parry, the combo will chain into the Pushfollow attack instead of Light 3; as the Pushfollow attack still chains into Light 3, this will give the mark a new unique chain.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Catachan "Devil's Claw"

improved their Sprint profile, while also allowing for most attacks and attack starts to be performed while sprinting. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">We also significantly raised the damage of the Special attacks and added a new profile for the Heavy Strikedowns with a vertical or uppercut direction, with increased damage and Carapace armour modifier. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, we took a pass on all attacks to tweak active windows, ranges and hitboxes to be better aligned with their animations. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk II</b>, we added a power level boost to the Light 3 attack, as it is further into the attack chain, and to both Special attacks, as they are slower compared to the other two marks. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk IV</b>, we upgraded the damage profile for both Heavy attacks and slightly lowered their chain timings, as they are both performed in a vertical or uppercut direction. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk VII</b>, we added a power level boost to all Light attacks, as they inflict a higher movement speed penalty compared to the Lights of the other marks, and changed the Heavy 2 profile to the new Heavy Strikedown. </p><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Atrox Tactical Axes</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Damage profiles</b></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Light Assassin</p><ul

class="bb_paragraph">The Shock Mauls, while being dependable in inflicting stagger, were also below average in damage output and overall not very exciting. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">We increased the damage against the 1st target on most profiles, with a particularly large bonus to the Heavy Strikedown and Special attacks.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We also enhanced the base Stamina template, and tweaked hitboxes and active windows of some attacks to better align with their animations. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the attacks with an uppercut direction (Light 3 on the <b>Mk Ia</b> / Light 4 on the <b>Mk III</b>) we slightly delayed the start of the attack active window to make it easier to connect with weakspots. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">Finally, for the <b>Mk Ia</b>, we added power level multipliers to the Light 3 and Light 4 attacks, to make them a more enticing combo alternative to just returning to Heavy 1. </p><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes

class="bb_paragraph">The Eviscerators thunder was in part stolen by the Relic Blades, which have overall better cleave properties while also being no slouch in the single target department. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">To give these iconic Zealot weapons a deserved bump, we tweaked most of the attack profiles: we removed the damage caps on secondary targets for the sweeping Vanguard/Relentless attacks, but also increased several armour modifier values, significantly improved the damage on the Heavy profiles and normalised most of the Special active profiles. </p><p class="bb_paragraph">For the <b>Mk III</b>, we changed the chain times to key actions after the Heavy 1 attack to make it more responsive but less spammable with swap cancelling, slightly increased the speed of the Light 2 attack and added a power level multiplier to the Light 3 and Heavy 2 attacks. </p><div class="bb_h3">Detailed Changes - Tigrus Heavy Eviscerators</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Damage

      <title>New Tools of War — Shields</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2186680/view/548989708728800812</link>

With the Adeptus Arbites becoming directly involved in the affairs of the von Valancius protectorate in the upcoming Lex Imperialis expansion, it is only logical to talk about their iconic tool - shields!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/e33a14703f1210f6ca0f03207ca0cf8e7d78fcce.jpg"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Defensive Capabilities Taken to a New Level</div><br/>Shields are a brand new type of equipment introduced with the Lex Imperialis expansion. They will soon become available across the whole game for all players, even those without the DLC, and will come in a variety of shapes and designs:<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/df3e0bf8bd8c3b0a388358a855bf96f30b2721e0.jpg"/><br/><br/>Shields are considered a special kind of one-handed melee weapon and take up a total of two weapon slots, one from each weapon set. You can attack, parry, and make attacks of opportunity with shields in melee, but their main purpose is suppression and negating damage. <br/><br/>And they are quite effective at that. Abelard approves!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/869f6d145437547f72ab2446c3bcb9781cb5e0f9.png"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">Preventing the Damage</div><br/>Shields provide a new stat called <b>Block</b>, which gives the wielder a chance to completely negate the incoming attack, similar to how <b>Parry</b> and <b>Dodge</b> function (and stacking with them!). The chance to <b>block</b> is determined by the shield itself, and is not affected by the wearer’s or the attacker’s stats. It can, however, be modified by various items and talents.<br/><br/><b>Block</b> works against both melee and ranged attacks. It is especially effective against burst attacks - once any hit from a burst attack is blocked, the remaining hits are negated automatically. A blocked attack can also never overpenetrate!<br/><br/>Predictably, shields will not save you against psychic powers.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/b6904c4daf6a36252c86b7cc511d9fff541893dd.gif"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Tactical Advantages</div><br/>All archetypes have access to shields, which offers a rich layer of new tactical opportunities for defensive gameplay with dedicated tank characters. To allow for even more build variety, we’re adding multiple new universally available talents that boost shield effectiveness.<br/><br/>Here are some examples:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <b>Shield Mastery</b> allows the shield to only occupy a slot in a single weapon set.<br/></li><li> <b>Defensive Manoeuvre</b> allows the bearer to regain <b>2 MP</b> after attacking with a shield.<br/></li><li> <b>Strong Hand</b> gives the wielder <b>+5% block</b> and allows them to deal <b>+50% </b>more damage when attacking with a shield.</li></ul><br/><b>Subductor</b>, one of the specialties of the new Arbitrator origin, is specifically designed with a shield in mind. These assault specialists have access to a set of additional talents and abilities that further boost the effectiveness of shields, such as charging forward with a shield, automatically scoring critical hits with shield attacks on immobilized or prone enemies, gaining a bonus to Toughness that scales from Block, or even reflecting enemy attacks back at them!<br/><br/>The only characters in the Lord Captain’s retinue who cannot use shields are the xenos, who rely on agility rather than this crude Imperial method of protection, Pasqal, and the mighty Ulfar, who believes that the best defense is a brutal offense.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/26d784beeecdaeac7ab543c197c08fdc4177f202.jpg"/><br/><br/>Beyond often having special effects, each shield also always provides a wielder, of any archetype, with the special ability <b>Stalwart Defence</b>. It allows them to select a zone and immediately end the turn, significantly increasing <b>block</b> chance against all enemies in that zone and making an attack of opportunity in response to the first successfully <b>blocked</b> melee attack from each of these enemies:<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/f4dfe1927eb360f22898c0d0a8f52a4581abe0e8.gif"/><br/><br/><div class="bb_h2">New Challenges </div><br/>Where there is a tool, there will always be those who make use of it. In Lex Imperialis, allies and enemies will also take advantage of shields, requiring new tactics in order to deal with the additional protection they provide.<br/><br/>Some existing talents such as <b>Take Aim!</b> or <b>Deadeye Shot</b> have been updated with additional effects to reduce block, and multiple new items across the game have been added to interact with these new mechanics. <br/><br/>How do you plan to build your retinue with shields in mind, Lord Captain?<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/43222021/5372f4f249d0955bdf6d7d8c53179df6c5031e90.jpg"/><br/><br/>See you soon in the Lex Imperialis expansion!<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

<div class="bb_h3"><b>BIG NEWZ LADZ!!! </b></div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>Hit registration</b> on enemies has been much improved, meaning your weapons will actually hit your target as intended!</div><p class="bb_paragraph">There are still some edge case issues left though, so we plan to do more work in this area to tighten it up even further. This update makes it so you don't have to compensate for network lag by leading your shots in front of where your target is heading. There are still instances where damage is not registered at all, but these are more rare and due to specific interactions that we will be looking into.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We're very happy with this change and we're sure you will be too. ːsteamthumbsupː</p><p class="bb_paragraph">NOTE: We expect there to be some balance issues for certain vehicles now that hit-reg is improved, so we'll be keeping an eye on feedback and releasing a patch ASAP to address those issues if they arise.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/995ffe8e717de04ab7a9f557c54780e617c1da15.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Another important change to the game with this update is <b>Host Migration</b>. </div><p class="bb_paragraph">Now if a host leaves, the game chooses the person who had the lowest ping to become the new host, and all players in that game join a new match with the same map and settings.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">If a host leaves after 75% of the match has been completed, the new match will use the next map</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This is not a perfect solution, but still a much needed improvement from just being disconnected and taken back to the menu if a host leaves. Either way, it's worthy of a <b>WAAAGH!</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/44159197/129ec630ecc8eb6f0ee41d6e30a790c75eba5ae4.gif"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">On top of these two major things, we've also got a bunch of changes/fixes in the list below.</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3"><b>NETWORKING</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Huge Hit Registration improvements <i>(see above)</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Host Migration <i>(see above)</i></p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Quick match will now try to avoid matching against high ping matches.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Bug fix for potential lock-up when clients join a match.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph">Added server name to scoreboard.

      <title>Dev Blog: Arbites Talent Tree</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361210/view/543360117038383433</link>
      <description><![CDATA[

    </style>
<div class="bb_h1">Hello everyone!</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This is one of several developer blogs centered around different aspects of the recently announced upcoming class, <b>the Arbites</b>! This dev blog will focus on the class’ <b>talent tree!</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We’ve interviewed Design Director Victor and Game Designer Gunnar to get their insight into its design, and the three distinct styles that can be found in it.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“I’m Victor, I’m the Design Director at Darktide. I’ve been at Fatshark for 16 years, working as a designer in different ways.” - Victor</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“My name is Gunnar and I am currently a Game Designer, but I started at Fatshark in 2018 as a Gameplay Coder on Vermintide, and a few years ago I switched to become a Designer instead.” - Gunnar</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">What was the process for making the Arbites’ talent tree?</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The class rework from <i>Patch #13</i> was our first dive into the style of talent tree that we now have, with plenty of choices and flexibility but also a defined design goal behind it. We’ve learned a lot since then, and we hope that reflects on the Arbites’ tree.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">We looked at the existing talent trees and we considered what worked and what was necessary to build the core skeleton of the tree. Once that was done, we built from that foundation into the various talents and choices you’ll have available. We purposely aimed to not overextend with the amount of nodes available and tried to focus on making each node meaningful and impactful.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“As you’re going through the tree you’re not just looking at stat bonuses, you’re looking at ‘what would your Arbites in the Warhammer: 40,000 universe do or be good at.” - Gunnar</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph">A key aspect that guided the design of the tree is enabling different Player Fantasies, the cool thing that each individual player is seeking to do while playing Arbites. This is what resulted in the three distinct gameplay styles mentioned earlier, but it also made us focus on enabling anything in between. The system is meant to be flexible and players are encouraged to come up with their own variation of a build, and that goes for all of the existing talent trees.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“It’s up to the players to figure out and come up with their own sort of playstyle of fantasy of how THEY think their dream Arbites (in this case) functions.” - Victor</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">The Three Paths</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Due to the nature of the talent trees, players are free to mix and match whatever talents they wish, provided they have the points and can path their way down the tree. However, as with our existing classes, there are three distinct gameplay &amp; combat styles that the main branches of the tree embody, and players can focus on these paths to specialize in these styles.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">While they don’t have an official name, for this dev blog we can refer to them as <b>Subjugator</b>, <b>Exterminator</b>, and <b>Investigator</b>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Subjugator</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Following the right side of the talent tree you will find talents that will allow you to dive into the thick of combat to break apart the formations of the criminal scum, tapping into an identity akin to riot police. <b>These talents focus heavily on melee, staggering enemies and tanking.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Sneak peak at some of the talents:</i></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Hammer of Judgement:</b> Increased Attack Speed when hitting multiple enemies with a single Melee Attack.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Suppression Protocols:</b> Hitting multiple enemies with a single Melee Attack grants Toughness Damage reduction.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Target the Weak:</b> Enemies staggered by your Melee Attacks take more damage from Melee.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Exterminator</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“Then we’ve also always been keen on fulfilling the shotgun fantasy of being this unstoppable force… walking down a corridor… just blasting everything that gets within range.” - Gunnar</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Relevant talents for shotgun gunplay can be found all over the talent tree, but it is the middle branch that has the most focus on it. <b>This gameplay style focuses on high firepower at close range</b>, blasting enemies of the Law with unflinching and implacable impunity.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Sneak peak at some of the talents:</i></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Withering Fire:</b> Improved Ranged Damage after Reloading.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Up Close:</b> Replenish toughness on Close Kill.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>March:</b> Increased Movement Speed on Ranged Hit.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Investigator</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Found on the left side of the tree, <b>this playstyle focuses on eliminating high priority targets. Elites, Specials, even Monsters.</b> It’s about being ‘on the chase’, relentlessly hunting down a perp and bringing them the Emperor’s Justice.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">The talents here are quite varied and flexible. There’s a mix of melee and ranged talents, as well as some support nodes. This is also where most (but not all!) of the talents related to the <i>Cyber Mastiff</i> are (although you can easily build into the Investigator branch without picking them!)</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>Sneak peak at some of the talents:</i></p><ul class="bb_ul"><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>No Escape:</b> Improved Damage and Movement Speed after killing a Special or Elite.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Canine Morale:</b> Killing enemies Pounced by your Cyber Mastiff grants Toughness and Toughness Damage Reduction to Allies in Coherency.</p></li><li><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>Serrated Maw:</b> Your Cyber Mastiff applies Brittleness on attack.</p></li></ul><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“That was also an important point \[...] We wanted to make sure that no matter if you went left, right or middle, you could always create a build that interacted with your Mastiff - So that you didn’t lock yourself out of playing with your Mastiff just because you also wanted to be melee focused, or because you wanted to do well with the shotgun.” - Gunnar</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><p class="bb_paragraph">While there’s three distinct identities to be found for the Arbites if you focus on a particular talent tree path, it’s important for us that <b>the tree itself remains flexible</b> and <b>allows players to combine talents</b> as they wish and develop the playstyle that best suits them.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">For that reason, we took great care in making sure that any of the three options for your Combat Ability, your Blitz and your Coherency aura are <b>easily accessible regardless of what path you’re going down, and easily connect to any of the three paths.</b> You can then think of them as independent of those three playstyles, even if there’s a niche that they fit best into.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Coherency Aura</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Base Coherency Aura: Ruthless Efficiency</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Simple, but effective: this is the initial Aura for the Arbites and <b>it gives</b> <b>you and your Allies in Coherency a bonus to reload speed.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Part of the Squad</div><p class="bb_paragraph">For those focusing on the Cyber Mastiff, this option <b>makes your loyal companion count as an Ally for the purposes of Coherency.</b> Additionally, this talent also gives every Ally in Coherency a small bonus to <b>Toughness Damage Reduction</b>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Breaking Dissent</div><p class="bb_paragraph">This Coherency Aura <b>increases the damage dealt</b> by you and Allies in Coherency against <b>enemies that are currently Staggered</b>.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Blitz</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Base Blitz: Arbites Grenade</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The default Blitz that all Arbites players start with is a standard issue <b>Arbites Grenade</b>. Compared to the Veteran’s frag grenades, it packs a <b>stronger punch</b> but has a <b>smaller radius</b> and <b>explodes on impact</b> rather than after a delay.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Remote Detonation</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The Remote Detonation Blitz requires some coordination with your loyal companion! Upon activating it, <b>an electric discharge will burst from your Cyber Mastiff’s position</b>, dealing damage and heavy stagger impact.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“It has quite a powerful stagger as well, so if your Mastiff is in the middle of attacking a Monster, like on the Plague Ogryn’s back, and you use it, the Plague Ogryn will stagger forward, disrupting its attacks. So it’s a lot about timing and keeping track of where your Mastiff is to get the most benefit out of it.” - Gunnar</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><b>This Blitz also recharges on a cooldown</b>, rather than by picking up a Grenade Box.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Voltaic Shock Mine</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Choosing <b>Voltaic Shock Mines</b> as your Blitz will allow you to set up proximity mines on the ground at spots of your choosing. <b>As enemies draw close to it, it will activate and shock anything that comes near it for a sustained duration.</b> Compared to the Zealot’s Shock Grenade, it has a smaller radius but lasts a lot longer.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“It’s one of the first Blitzes that we have that allow you to actually prepare for what’s to come. So if you come into an event area and you know that they’re gonna come from that door, or that direction, you can set up before engaging with the event.” - Victor</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h2">Combat Abilities</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Base Combat Ability: Nuncio-Aquila</div><p class="bb_paragraph">The default Combat Ability for the Arbites is <b>Nuncio-Aquila</b>, which brings forth a booming loudspeaker on a specific point you aim it at. It will blast the word of the Imperial Law at full blast, <b>empowering nearby allies and debilitating nearby enemies.</b></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“It’s like that scene in a movie, where the bad guys are hiding in a house and the police turn on the speakers and start telling them ‘You better give up, you’re surrounded.’, so they start freaking out.” ~ Victor</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Castigator’s Stance</div><p class="bb_paragraph">This Ability turns you into an unstoppable juggernaut, unleashing the Emperor’s Judgement on the enemy as you walk menacingly forward, unflinching and unphased. <b>Entering the stance removes your ability to sprint, but increases your base movement speed and massively reduces your damage taken</b> for a time.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Break the Line</div><p class="bb_paragraph">This Ability makes your Arbites perform a <b>short lunge forwards and then bash</b> every enemy in front of you with your equipped Melee weapon, <b>staggering enemies in a wide area in front of you</b> but without dealing any damage.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">This Ability is on a <b>very short cooldown</b> (the shortest in the game!) so make sure to use it often to clear the way and subjugate the criminal mob!</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/></p><div class="bb_h2">Design and Development</div><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Were there any noteworthy changes in design that happened during development?</div><p class="bb_paragraph">Originally, the base Combat Ability was going to be the <i>Castigator’s Stance</i>! However, during playtesting we found that it was very unintuitive for players just starting out, as visually it doesn’t really convey all of the effects that it has and it’s hard to tell how it’s meant to be used or what it’s doing for you. <i>Nuncio-Aquila</i> is far more straightforward and easier to understand without having to read its description, while still being sufficiently iconic for the Arbites, so we ended up changing the default Ability to that one.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph">Another thing is that at one point, a chunk of the tree was dedicated to talents about picking your Arbites’ armour, based on various options from the lore or tabletop. So you’d pick things like what kind of visor your Arbites wore, or from what areas was the gear made, and so on. In the end we weren’t happy with how that was turning out in practice, but it was an interesting aspect that we explored.</p><p class="bb_paragraph">At the time of writing, the talent tree was on version #16, so it’s definitely been through its fair share of iteration and polishing! Granted, as we approach the end development, the later versions involved less drastic changes and more fine-tuning and adjustments.</p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">What was the most fun part of designing the talent tree for you?</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“It’s just very fun to path down a talent tree. \[...] I think it’s even more fun to build it yourself; it’s a creative process of mixing and matching nodes or creating these crazy structures \[…] I just think it’s a lot of fun to create a tree, in itself.” - Gunnar</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“This goes for pretty much all of them: the first time most of the nodes are working and you can for the first time actually start theory-crafting in the game. Like actually making your first build, not just in theory. \[...] That’s the most fun I think, ‘cause that’s very exciting.” - Victor.</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><div class="bb_h3">Of all the talents, what’s your personal favorite?</div><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“I really like the shock mine. It allows you to sort of pre-emptively strike, which I think is really cool. I also really like the Nuncio-Aquila; it allows you to ‘place’ a buff and then you can move in and out of it and you can be tactical about where you place it. - Victor</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><i>“One that is quite interesting is the Coherency - the aura - that is related to the Cyber Mastiff \[...]. As one of its effects it will make your Mastiff count as one in the coherency pool, so it more easily chains and you get the increased regeneration… and, if you have four Arbites with that aura, you can up to a total eight in your Coherency pool.” - Gunnar</i></p><p class="bb_paragraph"></p><p class="bb_paragraph"><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png"/>That’s all we have for today!

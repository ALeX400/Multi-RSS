      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III Improving AI in Campaign</title>

<img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/39760201/95db5255812ead709f6be65de9e49fd156acc043.png"/><br/><br/>Hey Folks,<br/><br/>At the tail end of last year, you saw us run a few of our Hotfixes out for Total War: WARHAMMER III via the Beta function on Steam. This was invaluable for our teams as we readied some necessary game updates during the rollout of Omens of Destruction, and helped us catch some last minute feedback from you and ensure our updates were on point. Whilst we haven‚Äôt needed to pull on that lever quite so much since we got back into the swing of things in 2025, it has encouraged us to think about even more ways that we can involve you in some of our more complex game changes, and work closer with you all to bring more improvements to the game.<br/><br/>To that end, tomorrow (February 13th) we will launch a new public Beta Branch for Total War: WARHAMMER III via Steam. This Beta will allow you to experience and provide feedback on the latest improvements to our Campaign AI, where your insights and experiences will help us refine and enhance the game. To understand what changes we‚Äôre making, you‚Äôll read about all of the science from Principal Technical Designer Radoslav Borisov down below, and if you check back on this post tomorrow, you‚Äôll find detailed instructions on how to access the Beta at the foot of this post. <br/><br/>We‚Äôll run this Beta for around two weeks initially, bringing it to a close around February the 26th. It‚Äôll be running on a modified version of the live game that you‚Äôre already playing today, so this Beta won‚Äôt be used to test any additional upcoming changes to the wider game, and we‚Äôll be encouraging folks to start fresh Campaigns for this test in order to check best on how our changes are performing.<br/><br/>Tomorrow, we‚Äôll be opening a new sub-forum over on the Total War Forums to gather your feedback on the Campaign AI fixes and improvements that we‚Äôre looking to make, alongside a survey that will run throughout the Beta that will invite players to share their feedback directly with us. We‚Äôll post that survey link in the news feed of the Beta version of the game itself, but if you check back tomorrow, we‚Äôll have updated our posts so that you‚Äôll have direct access to it on your other devices, in case you‚Äôre looking to complete it after spending more time with your thoughts.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of this first Beta at the end of February, we‚Äôll comb through all of your feedback, pour over the data our side, and come back to you to talk more about where we‚Äôll be looking to make improvements and to bring further changes. If all goes well, we‚Äôre planning a second round of testing with an updated Beta sometime later in the Spring. Please keep in mind that this is our goal, and to expect direct comms from us if this timeframe has to shift. Campaign AI improvement is a big, and complex topic, and our goal is to break it down into smaller pieces and address them with player feedback front of mind so we can deliver improvements that you want in a sustainable way.<br/><br/>To those who do look to get involved, thank you in advance for your participation in this Beta!<br/><br/><div class="bb_h3">üëâ READ THE FULL BLOG HERE üëà</div><br/><br/>‚Äî The <i>Total War</i> Team<br/><br/><div class="bb_code">For the latest news and announcements, don't forget to visit our official social channels.

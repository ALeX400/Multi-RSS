   is a new weapon of the Dagger weapon type
  </strong>
  . The Dagger weighs 2.0 and can be infused with Ashes of War, as the weapon does not have a unique skill of its own. The weapon's description states its power increases when flame imbuement is applied. This means Flame Art and Fire Ashes of War work better for this Dagger.

  <strong>
   in
   <em>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  , you must reach the
  <strong>
   Shadow Keep
  </strong>
  in Scadu Altus. This weapon has no fixed location and it can only be obtained as a drop from the Fire Knights. There are a lot of Fire Knights throughout the Realm of Shadow; however, you will need to defeat the ones who carry the Shortsword in both of their hands. The easiest location to farm these enemies is northeast of the
  <strong>
   Storehouse, Seventh Floor
  </strong>
  Site of Grace. This is the Grace you access right before activating the lever that lowers the statues and leads to the boss room of
  <strong>
   Messmer the Impaler
  </strong>

  The drop rate of the weapon is relatively low because the Fire Knight can also drop other items like part of their Armor Set. To increase the drop rate of an item, you can equip the

  Players in

  While water can easily be taken care of for the most part, getting good food to eat can require a lot of time and luck. Plants can be picked and will respawn over time, but overall, food will be the harder resource to get more of; luckily, that's where farming comes in.

 <p>
  First, players must
  <strong>
   purchase the Planting Upgrade in the Logistics Memetic tree
  </strong>
  . With this upgrade, players will be able to build and place Loamy Soil anywhere in the dirt. Players can grow plants in their house but this will require a later upgrade that unlocks Planter Boxes, and another later upgrade to get lights for the indoor plants. After setting up some soil in your territory, players will need to get seeds, which are found by foraging that specific plant out in the wild.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1001} -->

 <p>
  When planting a seed into Loamy Soil, players can also choose to add a fertilizer to speed up how fast the plant grows. After planting the seeds, players will need to worry about the light and water of the seedlings.
  <strong>
   Outdoors, plants will get no light at night, and 100% natural light during the day
  </strong>
  . This setup will have plants growing faster during the day and slower at night but is overall a good setup in terms of lighting.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  By interacting with the seed, you'll be able to water it. Watering a seed often is key to making sure it continues to grow, and it is possible to overwater a seed. You'll be able to use various forms of water and can choose how many units to use to make sure the bar stays in the green to keep the plant as healthy as possible. Using dirty or salt water on the plant will increase its irrigation, but also
  <strong>
   lower its overall vitality as the water isn't clean
  </strong>
  . Luckily, even dirty water can be boiled to make it safer for players and plants.
 </p>

 <p>
  The overall goal of planting is to
  <strong>
   keep the plant's vitality high to help the germination process go by faster
  </strong>
  . Even if irrigation or lighting are in the red, a plant can still continue to grow, just very slowly. Once fully germinated, the plant can be harvested to get the resulting plant along with additional seeds to replant another of the same plant should the player want. If the plant is destroyed or undone for any reason before being fully germinated, the seeds used will be lost.

 <p>
  Fertilizer is great for speeding up the growing process and helping get rid of old and rotten food. First, get the Compost Bins upgrade in the Logistics Memetic tree and build one in your territory. This bin acts as a great place to
  <strong>
   throw away excess and rotten food supplies as they will over time become fertilizer
  </strong>
  that can be used to grow new food. Fertilizers can also be found when looting abandoned structures with Rift Anchors throughout the world, but this is not a reliable method to obtain them. More effective forms of Fertilizer can be obtained through the same methods, but first require later upgrades in the Logistics Memetic tree.

  Oolong tea leaves are a unique Chinese spice available at Mulanâ€™s Tea Stall, which you help her set up during her second friendship quest, A Daily Regime. During the quest, you can place the stall anywhere in the valley; we chose Peaceful Meadow for easy access. Once set up, you can go to the stall and get your tea leaves for free.

  You can only start The Daily Regime and other Mulan's friendship quests after you convince her to move into Dreamlight Valley by completing the Protecting the Camp quest. Initially, Oolong tea crates are found in her training camp, so players will need to go to her realm and bring them to the valley. You can get three Oolong Tea Leaves at a time from her stall, and they can be sold for 25 Star Coins at Goofy's Stall.

  Raspberries are a versatile fruit found in two biomes: Plaza and Peaceful Meadow. Unlike crops, raspberries are not planted but harvested from their bushes. Once you enter the biome, look for Raspberry bushes with red, ripe raspberries growing on them. Each harvest will give you three raspberries.

  Checking mail is as simple as approaching a mailbox and interacting with it. The only catch is that
  <strong>
   mailboxes are only found in safe zones
  </strong>
  , which can often be far away from a player's territory where they spend most of their time. Safe Zones are small settlements of NPCs that will offer tasks to complete and often be tied to the main story of the region they are in.

 <p>
  Safe Zones are indicated by blue water droplet icons over a part of a gear. Once in a safe zone, the
  <strong>
   mail icon will appear over the mailbox if the player has unread mail
  </strong>
  . Approach the box to open it and see all the available mail. Along the bottom of the screen will be the, "Claim All" and, "Delete All" options for those who just want to get their free stuff and leave. The mailbox does have a max capacity of 99 items, so be sure to delete old messages and make room for new ones should you ever get close to the max.

  Traveling to a safe zone to check your mail may seem like a tedious task depending on where you decide to set up your territory, but that is where fast travel comes in. After visiting a safe zone, players can
  <strong>
   fast travel back there any time by spending some Energy Links
  </strong>
  by hovering over the icon on the map and selecting the fast travel button. The cost is determined by the location you are fast traveling to, with very early game travels costing only one link, but quickly jumping to 200.

 <p>
  Players are able to
  <strong>
   fast travel back to their own territory without a cost
  </strong>
  , making a return trip always easy. After fast traveling anywhere, there will also be a cooldown before fast traveling anywhere else. For those looking to save their Energy Links, players can craft a Motorcycle early on to make further travel much easier.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak revealed the alleged gameplay mechanics for one of Natlan's upcoming characters. Over the past weeks, various
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  leaks have claimed that there will be a new 5-star Claymore named Kinich, and he's expected to release with the game's 5.0 update in late August.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  prepares to say goodbye to Fontaine before stepping into Natlan in Version 5.0, fans have been given two official teasers of the Nation of War. In its most recent trailer,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  revealed three Natlan characters along with some of the region's landscapes. As per previous leaks, these characters are alleged to be Kinich, a 5-star Dendro Claymore, Mualani, a 5-star Hydro Catalyst, and Kachina, a 4-star Geo Polearm.

  Prominent

  leaker Full Stop Chan has shared some details about Kinich's combat mechanics. According to the leak, the character's Elemental Skill will allow him to shoot a grappling hook-like device at an enemy. When locked on his target, Kinich will circle the enemy while firing at it.

  The leak also notes that Kinich can also lock onto objects or terrain around him, which would make him very useful for exploration. A prior leak reported that Kinich would be

   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's next Dendro DPS and that his kit would revolve around the elemental reactions Bloom and Burning. If this turns out to be the case, it will be interesting to see how Kinich's mechanics work with these Dendro reactions.

  Several Natlan rumors have been shared within the community since the region's first teaser. Recently,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  leaked a new Natlan Artifact Set, revealing that a new combat mechanic, called Night Spirit, would be introduced in Version 5.0. However, because leaks are not official information, they don't always make it to the final product, so players should take these rumors with a grain of salt.

 <p>
  Fans are very excited about the Traveler's next adventure and the Pyro Nation can not arrive soon enough. As mentioned above, the Nation of War is not expected until late August, so players should make the most out of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's upcoming summer event in Version 4.8. The update will introduce a limited-time area to explore with many Primogems to save for Natlan's future playable roster. The game is also adding two new skins for Nilou and Kirara, the latter being given for free for participating in the event. Players should also look out for the release of Emilie,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  's first 5-star Dendro Polearm, dropping on August 6.

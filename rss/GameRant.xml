  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  was a surprise hit as an age of sail fantasy RPG that confronted the dark truths of colonialism back in 2019.
  <strong>
   <em>
    GreedFall 2: The Dying World
   </em>
  </strong>
  follows the action away from the original’s setting on the island of Teer Fradee and back to the continent from which the colonial powers hail.
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  entered Early Access in September 2024, and it has seemingly adopted a slow but steady approach to the ongoing development.

 <p>
  While it’s out in Early Access now, surprisingly little is known about where Spiders’ unique fantasy setting is going in 2025. However, based on the past few months and what's to come for the game, it is possible to have a few key, managed expectations.

  GreedFall 2’s Approach to Early Access
 </h2>
 <p>
  Spiders rang in 2025 with a tweet promising to share next steps and the future of the
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  Early Access, but fans are still lacking perspective. In its year-end retrospective, Spiders acknowledged the shaky beginnings of the Early Access, but its dedication to move forward according to a path that has been very successful for other recent titles. Spiders’ Early Access on PC is a familiar strategy employed by many games, including Larian and
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  : share a slowly developing Early Access with the players in order to hone the game with the feedback of players.

 <h3 id="greedfall-2-new-locations">
  GreedFall 2 New Locations
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  will be adding regions and locations across its Early Access, with the 0.2 update introducing the Olima, the City of Stars managed by the nation of scientists and alchemists known as the Bridge Alliance. Olima is the hometown of Aphra, the Bridge Alliance companion for the original
  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Olima was originally supposed to debut in late 2024, but the update got delayed into 2025 as part of the slow-and-steady approach Spiders has been taking with
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  . This is partially because where the original
  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  featured a heavy focus on active combat and open world/open region exploration,
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  takes a different tack. The new title is being designed with the gameplay of early
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  in mind, with tactical combat being heavily blended into the action and focusing more heavily on tabletop-inspired team engagement. Early Access can be essential to maneuvering around massive gameplay shifts between generations of a franchise, which is being illustrated by the recent
  <em>
   Hyper Light Breaker's
  </em>
  gameplay shifting focus from its initial entry
  <em>
   Hyper Light Drifter
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The length and slow pace of the
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  Early Access has other advantages as well, letting Spiders take plenty of time throughout the whole Early Access period. More time means a better game, although some more communication would likely be welcomed by players. As it stands, these location plans are the only real concrete details for 2025.

 <h2 id="greedfall-is-the-best-guide-for-its-prequel">
  GreedFall is the Best Guide for its Prequel
 </h2>
 <p>
  With such little clarity around what is coming next from
  <em>
   GreedFall 2,
  </em>
  it's worth looking at what is on offer in Spiders’ prequel. Set before the events of
  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  , the new title takes players into the eyes of a native of Teer Fradee brought back to the continent. This makes it a story approachable to those who didn’t experience the first game.
 </p>
 <p>
  And for any reniagse that is a big fan of the proto-Celtic styled conlang featured in the original game–Yecht Fradi–that means a big expansion of
  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  's language. It also means that where the first game’s protagonist offers a fish-out-of-water look at the cultures of Teer Fradee, the protagonist of
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  will have that same perspective on the cultures of the Continent. The more notable cultures of the Continent include the Congregation of Merchants, whose capital was briefly explored in the initial game; the religious, theocratic nation of Theleme that sought to convert the natives of Teer Fradee; and the alchemists and scientists of the Bridge Alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can be expected that the foibles of these continental powers will be on clear display to a native to the island, as each nation in turn had their conflicts and poor decisions associated with their colonialism. From the Merchant Congregation’s focus on exploiting the islander’s resources to the human experimentation from the Bridge Alliance or the brutal religious conversions of Theleme, no power from the Continent was without sin. And as the first game explored, the crimes of the continental powers ran even deeper than that. Fans can expect more in each of these departments throughout 2025, although the degree of which is unpredictable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond that, though the first game gave some attention to the origins of Malichor, the continental setting of
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  will be able to show the disease up close and personal, potentially incorporating some of the real-world experiences with pandemic disease the world experienced since the release of the first
  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  . Players can explore roughly 30% of
  <em>
   GreedFall 2: The Dying World
  </em>
  now by exploring the Early Access on Steam.

  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  is losing six games later today, January 15. This wave of departures will potentially be a blow to subscribers who use Xbox Game Pass for multiplayer titles.
 </p>
 <p>
  The XGP content catalog typically shrinks every 15 days, in the middle and at the tail end of each month. The latest such wave of outgoings happened on December 31, when Xbox Game Pass lost
  <em>
   LEGO 2K Drive
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   McPixel 3
  </em>
  , and four other titles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another half a dozen games are set to follow suit in the next 24 hours. The list of January 15 Xbox Game Pass departures includes
  <em>
   Escape Academy
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Those Who Remain
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Exoprimal
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Insurgency: Sandstorm

  ,
  <em>

  Multiplayer titles account for half of the first 2025 wave of Xbox Game Pass departures.
  <em>
   Exoprimal
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Insurgency: Sandstorm
  </em>
  are both multiplayer-only shooters, whereas
  <em>
   Escape Academy
  </em>
  offers a co-op mode that's been widely praised by critics and fans alike.
  <em>
   Escape Academy
  </em>
  also boasts the longest Xbox Game Pass stint out of these six departures, as it was added to Microsoft's on-demand content catalog in July 2022, debuting as a day-one release.
 </p>
 <h3 id="escape-academy-may-be-leaving-xbox-game-pass-but-it-will-be-free-tomorrow">
  Escape Academy May Be Leaving Xbox Game Pass, But It Will Be Free Tomorrow
 </h3>
 <p>
  Game removal times on Microsoft's subscription service vary, but most titles are pulled from its content catalog near the end of the day of their scheduled departure. Xbox Game Pass subscribers in the U.S. thus have roughly 18 more hours to try these soon-to-be-removed titles as of this writing. That's enough time to comfortably beat
  <em>
   Figment: Journey Into the Mind
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Those Who Remain
  </em>
  . Ditto for
  <em>
   Escape Academy
  </em>
  , although the escape-the-room-style puzzler only requires urgency from console gamers. Namely, the PC version of
  <em>
   Escape Academy
  </em>
  will be free to claim on the Epic Games Store starting tomorrow, January 16.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next series of Xbox Game Pass removals is expected to take place on January 31. The titles that will leave the service at the end of the month should be revealed alongside the Wave 2 lineup for January 2025. This roster is already known to include
  <em>
   Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Eternal Strands
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sniper Elite: Resistance
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector
  </em>
  , four day-one releases that are scheduled to reach Microsoft's subscription service over the final 11 days of the month. More Xbox Game Pass news is expected to emerge on January 23, which is when the 2025 iteration of the Xbox Developer Direct is taking place.

  In order to unlock new characters, players will need
  <strong>
   Abyss Stones
  </strong>
  , items that drop only from the Crowns (bosses). Before you can challenge the Crowns, you'll first need to get
  <strong>
   Prisms
  </strong>
  , items that basically act as keys leading to boss arenas. Prisms can be found on the map by
  <strong>
   following the golden diamond icon
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you defeat a boss, head to the teleporter back at the Cursed Outpost, and select the Breaker you want to unlock. Spend your Abyss Stones, and the selected character will be available to play. There are nine different characters in the game, but so far, there are only two unlockable characters, and all players need to do to get them is to get Abyss Stones. It's currently unknown if the method stays the same for the rest of the cast.

  Every character in the game starts with what's called a SyCom, key items in
  <em>
   Hyper Light Breaker's
  </em>
  progression model that determines a character's base stats and core perk. These define a Breaker's playstyle, and they'll be the main reason for choosing one character over the other. Here's an overview of each character and their playstyles.

 <p>
  Vermillion is the first character players get to use, and he comes with the
  <strong>
   Gunslinger SyCom
  </strong>
  by default. Gunslinger gives Vermillion a modest stat package that favors ranged combat. Whenever his Rail shots crit, the subsequent shot is
  <strong>
   guaranteed to crit again
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who prefer fighting in melee can instead use his unlockable
  <strong>
   Tank SyCom
  </strong>
  , which
  <strong>
   rewards perfect parries with increased armor
  </strong>
  . Tank also has better defensive and melee base stats than Gunslinger, making it a safer option in general.

 <p>
  Much like Vermillion, Lapis starts as a Rail-oriented Breaker with
  <strong>
   Lightweaver
  </strong>
  , a SyCom that increases the damage of Rail shots after picking up a Battery (ammo). What makes her stand out from Vermillion, however, is the
  <strong>
   Warrior SyCom
  </strong>
  — this one increases Lapis' core stats every time she gets an upgrade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lapis is deadly with either of her SyComs, but Warrior makes her incredibly lethal in the long run. If you get enough upgrades for her, she'll outshine other Breakers in terms of raw stats, making her an absolute powerhouse.

 <p>
  Goro is yet another range-oriented character. His default SyCom,
  <strong>
   Astrologer
  </strong>
  , lets him charge his Blade skills faster while shooting targets, while the unlockable
  <strong>
   Sniper
  </strong>
  SyCom increases his critical hit rate outright.
 </p>
 <p>
  This Breaker sort of falls under the ranged glass cannon category. His damage potential is notably higher compared to Vermillion and Lapis, and since he lacks a defensive SyCom, players may have trouble using him. However, fortune favors the bold, and if you can play Goro right, he'll be a very effective fighter in his own right.

  </strong>
  ’s Natlan Archon Quest is slowly coming to a close, and as the lore reveals secrets that many players have speculated about since the start of the game, so does the combat evolve with it. If players have yet to notice, every nation in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has two weekly bosses that are included, and the
  <strong>
   Lord of Eroded Primal Fire
  </strong>
  is just as dangerous (maybe even more so than the others).

  As its name suggests, this massive dual-sworded Dragon is a representation of the original Dragon that once ruled over Natlan, and Gosoythoth’s appearance has made it more fearsome than ever. The evil of the Abyss is clearly represented in this boss, and if players recall the Riftwolves from Inazuma, the Lord of Eroded Primal Fire comes with similar mechanics in terms of the Corrosion effect. The fight is by no means easy, but that does not mean that it’s impossible to do. Here’s an in depth rundown on
  <strong>
   how to beat Lord of Eroded Primal Fire in

  The
  <strong>
   Lord of Eroded Primal Fire can be found at Stone Stele Records
  </strong>
  , a domain just
  <strong>
   south
  </strong>
  of the Statue of Seven near the Masters of the Night-Wind tribe. It’s basically inside the shrine that was built in remembrance of the lives lost during the Natlan battle, and if players enter the domain, they can claim the usual awards using 30 Original Resin for the first three Bosses in that week.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players will
  <strong>
   need to complete the final chapter of the Archon Quest: When All Becomes A Monument
  </strong>
  to unlock this Boss and freely enter the domain. If not, players can also choose to opt out of completing the story and enter it through the
  <strong>
   Quick Challenge
  </strong>
  option found in the Adventurer’s Handbook.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, successfully completing the fight against the Lord of Eroded Primal Fire is heavily locked behind regional characters, specifically Natlan ones like Mavuika, Kinich, Citlali, Mualani, and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the Lord of Eroded Primal Fire is relatively still most of the time, at some point during the fight, it will summon
  <strong>
   three Pillars and three Tenebrous Mimiflora
  </strong>
  , which can be more easily defeated if you have characters that use
  <strong>
   Nightsoul Blessings
  </strong>
  .

  Theoretically, you can use other characters when destroying the Pillars that have been summoned, but it will take a much longer time to do so. If you take characters like Mavuika, Citlali, Kinich, or Kachina, the amount of time taken to break the shields will be shortened, and you’ll be able to quickly cancel out the Eroded Meteor strike that the Dragon will unleash. Breaking the pillars will immobilize the Dragon for around 10 seconds, so you'll need to act fast and deal some kind of damage before it wakes up.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, despite moving as fast as possible, there may be instances where the Pillars won’t break fast enough (as it depends on the Natlan character you are using). Once the meteor animation starts,
  <strong>
   remember to equip your shield and make sure to switch to your healer
  </strong>
  . Your healer will need to constantly
  <strong>
   heal you through this attack in order for you to survive; despite being shielded, the corrosion status will penetrate through and deal a substantial amount of DMG
  </strong>
  . If you are not shielded, you could even be one-shot at full HP.
  <strong>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Bringing consistent healers like Furina and Kokomi works wonders here, but if you don’t have them, Kuki, Barbara, and Bennett work just as well.

 <p>
  Quite frankly, there’s no easy way around this fight, as dodging is sometimes a struggle due to the dragon’s unpredictable attacks. There is a moment during the fight where it continuously turns into smoke and moves around the arena, making it quite difficult to keep track of what it’s going to do next. Its attacks also come in frantic waves, with its main ones being sword slashes and sword smashes that
  <strong>
   chop off a significant amount of the battlefield
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  When the Dragon chops off the battlefield, it definitely makes it harder to navigate and dodge, since you will have less ground to move on. And since the boss has way more HP than the others, it will take some time to complete this fight if you reach this stage. If this does happen, one thing you can do is
  <strong>
   stay close to it and deal as much DMG as you can from underneath
  </strong>
  . You should still proceed with caution, however, as you need to have characters who will constantly heal you
  <strong>
  </strong>
  from the corrosion of his Eroded Dragon Breath attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the attack where the Dragon will impale both swords onto the battlefield, dealing Pyro and Erosion DMG.
  <strong>
   You will need to be heavily shielded and healed at the same time
  </strong>
  . If it gets too much to handle, you can always run out of the area and wait for the attack to end by sticking close to its hands, since the Dragon Breath doesn’t reach that area. The Lord of Eroded Primal Fire also includes a couple of sword slashes in its combat mechanics, so if you do get hit, just make sure to immediately heal yourself so that the Erosion effect is canceled.

  Whether you own Natlan characters or not, you can always try the fight out in Co-Op Mode; having extra hands with Nightsoul Blessing characters helps alot during the Pillar phase of the fight. Just click on the 'Match' button when you enter the Domain and wait to enter a person's world to fight the Boss more easily.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thankfully, this fight does not have multiple phases, unlike previous Weekly Bosses, but it does require a good amount of time for players to get through it.

      <title>One Xbox Developer Direct 2025 Mystery Game Rumor Opens the Door to Some Big Possibilities</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Since 2023,
  <strong>
   Xbox
  </strong>
  has been hosting a video game livestream event called the Developer Direct, which has been held once a year every January. While the PlayStation State of Play and Nintendo Direct tend to showcase dozens of trailers, the Xbox Developer Direct has only focused on a small selection of upcoming games, giving each of them their own extensive deep dive. This year's Developer Direct, which is set to air on January 23, is going to continue that trend. The event will give players an in-depth look at
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   South of Midnight
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
  </em>
  , in addition to one other mystery game.

 <p>
  Microsoft revealed in an official Xbox blog post that the 2025 Xbox Developer Direct would take viewers to a "surprise location to see another studio's brand-new game." Although the company didn't share more information about what this mystery title exactly was, the reputable insider Jez Corden alleged in a recent article of his that it was "a new entry in a legendary Japanese franchise with decades of history." It's hard to narrow down the identity of the game just from this vague description alone, but there are certain noteworthy titles that could fall under this category.

  Ninja Gaiden 4
 </h3>
 <p>
  One potential candidate for the mysterious fourth game at the Xbox Developer Direct is
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 4
  </em>
  . Now, to those out of the loop, this prediction may sound kind of ridiculous. After all, a new mainline
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  game hasn't been released in more than a decade, and even though the franchise technically isn't dead (a 2D spin-off called
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden Ragebound
  </em>
  was just announced at The Game Awards), there is no official indication that a fourth numbered entry in the series is being planned. The franchise's lead developer, the Koei Tecmo-owned Team Ninja, has been busy with other projects lately, and has seemingly not had the time in its schedule to develop a new
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  game
  <em>
   .
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The thing is, just because Team Ninja isn't making
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 4
  </em>
  doesn't necessarily mean no one else is. There's a decent possibility that another subsidiary at Koei Tecmo is developing it instead. Recently, Koei Tecmo announced that it was establishing a new AAA studio to increase its game release output. While it isn't clear what game this studio is working on, a developer at the company recently shared in an interview with 4Gamer.net that it's supposed to be released sometime in 2025. Since Developer Directs tend to show games that are launching within the next 12 months, it would make a lot of sense for this new Koei Tecmo project to be revealed here, even if it isn't
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 4
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <h3 id="persona-6">
  Persona 6

 <p>
  Instead of being a Koei Tecmo title, perhaps the Developer Direct's mystery game is actually
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  . The developer of the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  series, Atlus, has partnered up with Microsoft to reveal some of its major releases on multiple occasions, so it wouldn't be too surprising if the company were to show up at the Developer Direct to discuss its next big game. Even if
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  isn't unveiled here, Atlus will have to make some announcements about it sooner or later, considering its current release schedule is quite empty.

  Last but certainly not least, it's possible that the long-rumored
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  remake will finally be announced at Xbox's upcoming event. While it's hard to say how close this potential game is to being released, a reveal of it would make a lot of sense here, since it would show Square Enix's newfound commitment to the Xbox ecosystem, which it has previously ignored. And who knows, given the rumors going around, maybe
  <em>
   FF16
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   FF7 Remake
  </em>
  <strong>
   Xbox
  </strong>
  ports will be announced alongside the
  <em>
   FF9
  </em>
  remake, if it does show up at the Developer Direct.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Remnant 2's The Dark Horizon
   </strong>
   DLC
  </em>
  brought lots of equipment, including a new Heavy Armor set called
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pethyr Armor
   </em>
  </strong>
  . However, since
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  has some procedural generation features, finding the correct spot to look for this armor can be a little tricky.

  If players already familiarized themselves with the

   N'erud Agronomy Sector
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Withered Necropolis

  maps. They'll also notice there's a lot of Gliding, since that's the new transversal mechanic included in the DLC. Players looking for the Pethyr Armor set need to enter the
  <strong>
   Logistics Bridge dungeon
  </strong>
  , which is located in the Withered Necropolis area.

  From the Withered Necropolis Area,

     For players who cannot locate the dungeons they're looking for, there's no choice but to re-start the DLC run, since these are One-Shot adventures that need to be fully reset to look for specific drops, events, and dungeons. But, try to explore every part of the Withered Necropolis before resetting it, since there might be a hidden dungeon door somewhere tucked in a corner of the map, and that might be the one players are looking for.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Players need to reach the half section of the map where they will face a
   <strong>
    jumping puzzle
   </strong>
   divided into
   <strong>
    three sections
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   To reach the jumping puzzle, they will need to clear out a mini-boss called
   <strong>
    Void Amalgamate
   </strong>
   , grab a key item, and open a door.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once players reach the
   <strong>
    train rail section
   </strong>
   : they should take note of the first section, as they will be returning there once they finish the dungeon.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Cross the first two rails
   </strong>
   by jumping after the wagons pass by. If players aren't careful, they'll be
   <strong>
    hit by the trains and die
   </strong>
   . Wait for a train to pass, then jump.
  </li>
  <li>
   After the first two rails, they'll reach a
   <strong>
    circular section
   </strong>
   with lots of enemies that need to be cleared out. Kill them and jump between the platforms until reaching the middle section with a staircase leading to an
   <strong>
    observation room
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Enter the observation room, kill the Minion standing guard, and
   <strong>
    activate the platform lever
   </strong>
   (this will also clear one of the locks that needs to be activated before reaching the Pethyr armor).
  </li>
  <li>
   Next, players should leave the observation post and turn in the direction where the
   <strong>
    jumping puzzle
   </strong>
   started. Track back using the same system, but through the platforms below. Keep a close look for the train patterns before jumping and reaching the next and last part of the dungeon.
  </li>
  <li>
   Players will notice a
   <strong>
    new control room
   </strong>
   they can reach by accessing an
   <strong>
    elevator
   </strong>
   . At the top, there's a door that will automatically open, unlocking the second part needed to access the armor. Don't forget to grab the
   <strong>
    Burden of the Excavator
   </strong>
   before proceeding.
  </li>

  Once players get the
  <strong>
   Quest Clear
  </strong>
  prompt and return to the starting part of the Jumping Puzzle section, right to the checkpoint, they will need to cross again into the first subsection between the two rails.

 <p>
  Once there, stick to the right and
  <strong>
   look for a chest
  </strong>
  . Near that chest, players will notice there are breakable objects. Smash them and proceed to
  <strong>
   climb the boxes
  </strong>
  , then jump onto a small platform with
  <strong>
   a second chest
  </strong>
  . This subsection was obstructed by the first activation switch, and now players can climb another platform to keep going.

 <p>
  There's
  <strong>
   one more small section
  </strong>
  with a platform they need to jump onto, and one of the platforms with crates is now available for reach. Don't get confused and try not to jump down; it is all
  <strong>
   a straightforward path

  until reaching the
  <strong>
   Pethyr Armor

  that is hanging

  As players might have noticed, The Pethyr Armor is a
  <strong>
   Heavy Armor
  </strong>
  set with some serious resistance, and in some cases, even better than the Leto Mark II set. Its heaviness might not be such a problem if players use it alongside certain accessories that reduce overall weight or increase the weight burden threshold.

  It’s that time of year again! October is when Amazon’s biggest Prime Day deals are up for grabs, and players can look forward to a wide variety of gaming essentials, from high-end headsets to AAA games. Even before the actual Prime Day sale, which is slated for October 7th-10th, there are dozens of great games available at a discount. Some of these deals are exclusive to Prime members, but don't fret! New members can try Prime for 30 days, free.

  Although there weren’t as many big hits as in 2023, the fact that we’re a year on from a seriously great year in gaming means the chance of seeing a big game with an even bigger discount is pretty high. These are the best video game deals currently available, but Game Rant will continue to update this list as the sale approaches and, inevitably, more games get discounted.

  Some of the best games of 2023 and 2024 are on sale for Prime Day, even ahead of the big sale on October 8th-9th.
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance
  </em>
  was just released this past June, yet for a limited time, players can grab this new game for 33% off list price! Similarly, gamers can save 30% on
  <em>
   Final Fantasy VII Rebirth
  </em>
  , which was released in February of this year.

  Both of these games offer dozens of hours of playtime, plus each has an impressive legacy that always leaves fans itching for more. Plus, the version of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy VII Rebirth
  </em>
  that’s on sale is the exclusive Amazon edition, which comes with a bonus controller skin for free! Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance
  </em>
  represents a rare 28% discount on a Switch title, despite its recent release.

 <p>
  Gamers who prefer titles they can play on their choice of console are in luck too.
  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord
  </em>
  , a sprawling RPG with hours of tactical gameplay and dozens of characters to choose from, is on sale for every platform, cutting the price down by a third regardless of the version. One of the best deals is the 2024
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  game, which is available with big discounts for both PS5 and Xbox Series X players. This game promises a
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  -style criminal plot, paired with
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  -esque humor throughout. There are no plans to release the game on Game Pass, making it even better that the Xbox version of
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  is half-off.

With amazing deals on top titles, this is the ideal time to expand game collections and experience some of the most acclaimed games available.

  But those aren’t the only Sony-exclusive titles on sale. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is another top pick, offering a thrilling superhero adventure for just $31.

  As for Microsoft’s console, most gamers are already subscribed to the Xbox Game Pass, which gives them access to a massive library of games. However, there are plenty of Xbox games for both the Series X and S for non-subscribers to snag. For instance, Prime Day throws a knockout punch with an almost 40% discount on Tekken 8. Keep in mind that this is a game that launched just this year, making it a solid deal for any fans of the fighting genre. And for just $18, the Standard Edition of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy can be bought during the Prime Day sale. That's a great discount for an AAA game that was launched for $60 a couple of years ago.

 <p>
  Starfield, at nearly half the price, is Bethesda’s epic space RPG that transports players to a vast and immersive universe. Alternatively, there’s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, which offers a completely different universe of Pandora for players to explore. At 23% off of its original price tag, the game offers an immersive open-world experience that most gamers would enjoy. Prime Day also sees Assassin's Creed Mirage drop down to just $40, which is the latest game in the franchise's history. Keep in mind this is the Launch Edition we're talking about, which includes added bonuses.

  At almost a 40% discount is Diablo 4, which is a must-play for RPG fans. One can battle hordes of demons, uncover dark secrets, and build powerful characters in a game that will only cost them half the price thanks to Prime Day. On the other hand, for players craving bone-chilling thrills, the terrifying remake of Dead Space is available for a frighteningly good price of just $42. And for fans of wrestling, WWE 2K24 is available for just $46.

  So far, most gamers should probably not be buying a new video game until Prime Day actually starts. If one of these games is specifically one that you’ve been waiting for, definitely grab it quickly, as there is almost a guarantee that these deals will soon be replaced with more lucrative discounts on other AAA titles.

  Rockstar Games is one of the most prolific and well-known developers in the video game space, mostly due to their creation of the Grand Theft Auto series. Yet, despite their success, and the occasional port of their games over to PC after it's been on consoles for a while, Rockstar Games still has yet to bring over official ports and remasters for some truly iconic games.

      <title>18 RTS Games That Are Perfect For Newcomers To The Genre</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/rts-games-perfect-newcomers/</link>

  The launch of RTS giants like
  <em>
   Age of Empires 4
  </em>
  brought a wave of excitement for fans of the genre. And the best games to get the first Real-time Strategy experience are numerous.
  <strong>
   RTS games
  </strong>
  (or real-time strategy Games) are a very fast-paced version of their progenitors, strategy games. RTS games force the players to adjust and respond in a real-time scenario, unlike normal strategy games. This makes each game very fast-paced and dynamic.

  With the genre producing a few mainstream releases, newcomers might be interested in taking the plunge, but the difficulty of learning in a competitive culture can deter many. Thankfully, there are plenty of
  <strong>
   RTS games for beginners
  </strong>
  to jump into.

   The ability to lead a group of soldiers or people toward victory gives anyone a joyful sense of power, and Real-Time Strategy games are pretty good at implying that feeling to their players. Making the right decision at critical moments when the player doesn't have much time to think is one of the major challenges in any RTS game.

  Based on the complexity of the game, there are multiple factors to consider when playing an RTS game, which could be quite overwhelming, especially for newcomers to the genre. However, there are indeed some classic RTS experiences where the developers keep mechanics simple and let the players enjoy the flow without putting a lot of pressure on them.

  Rise of Nations is one of the greatest RTS games that unfortunately never received a sequel or a remake. The game allows players to choose from a span of 18 nations at the beginning of the game, then start progressing from the ancient ages to the modern times.

 <p>
  Players start an empire barebones with all the ancient tools, but as time passes, they expand their knowledge and invest in science, allowing them to enter new ages and feel the true sense of progression. From the Ancient Age to the Copper Age, and from the Copper Age to the Internet Age, players start to build an army with blades and swords, but in the end, they unlock missiles and ships when enough time has passed.

  For those who value combat in RTS games more than anything else, Wargame titles could bring a lot of joy. While the Total War series nails it in simulating gigantic wars with old weaponry like swords and arrows, Wargame almost does the same with modern wars where tanks, missiles, and long-range guns dictate the fate of the battles.

 <p>
  While Wargame might seem a little bit complicated in the beginning, it is a good starting point for players who want an all-out warfare simulation without the need to care about people's happiness or any similar side factors. The depth of combat in Wargame titles is magnificent and it will reward players who pay attention to the details.

  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth 2
  </em>
  is a particularly great choice for RTS newcomers if they're already fans of the
  <em>

  franchise, as the familiarity that they'll have with units, maps, and movesets will come in handy.

  However,
  <em>
   Battle for Middle-Earth
  </em>
  is also a good pick for those not previously interested in Tolkien's universe, as the game is accommodating to beginners with tutorials that impressively manage to be detailed without being overwhelming for those who have never even tried a real-time strategy game before.

  <em>
   Sins of a Solar Empire
  </em>
  is one of the best-named sci-fi games of the last decade, and despite its hard-sounding title, it's actually one of the
  <strong>
   best RTS for beginner s
  </strong>
  . Its gameplay is straightforward and reminiscent of
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  . It's well-balanced and built with easy-to-grasp progression systems, though it might take some getting used to all the technobabble.

  The
  <em>
   Warhammer

  franchise is one of the biggest expanded game verses that spans many genres and forms of media. Thus, it is only fair for newer players to be wary of this title. But players can rest assured that Creative Assembly and Sega's brainchild,
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer 2,
  </em>
  is one of the easiest titles for the first RTS experience.

  Not to forget the easy entry it gives players into the extensive

  fans. The third installment, however, adds a bit more complexity to the gameplay by introducing hero-style leaders that can be upgraded throughout the campaign. So, it might be best to begin with the first iteration.

  This title not only holds credit for being one of the pioneers of this genre but also the sole reason for the existence of yet another. Launched originally in 2002, Blizzard's
  <em>
   Warcraft 3
  </em>
  is the original fantasy RTS. It is also the first to introduce heroes and hero abilities to the genre. Its easy-to-understand nature has made sure that its player base is growing to this day. In fact, a custom map called Defense of the Ancients gained so much of a fan following that Valve took upon the idea years later and created
  <em>
   DOTA 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   Warcraft 3: Reforged

  Not all the
  <strong>
   best RTS for beginners
  </strong>
  are set in make-believe settings. In fact, Relic Entertainment's
  <em>
   Company of Heroes
  </em>
  series prides itself on quite the opposite. With both parts of the series set in World War 2, players are given control of both sides of the war depending on the mission as they get in various iconic operations like Operation Barbarossa and the liberation of France.

 <p>
  Bringing a more realistic and gruesome take on RTS games,
  <em>
   Company of Heroes
  </em>
  is sure to be the game for those who enjoy learning about the history of the Second Great War. The third entry released in 2023 garnered a mixed reception for the most part, although its predecessors are still highly regarded.

  Newer players might be afraid of jumping into
  <strong>
   RTS games
  </strong>
  because they do not know any IPs. And the solution to that problem is 343 Industries and Creative Assembly's
  <em>
   Halo Wars
  </em>
  series, especially
  <em>
   Halo Wars 2
  </em>
  that comes with improvements over the original game as it focuses on the core features of the RTS genre instead of shiny mechanics.

  The title is packed with vehicular action and iconic Elite units and is bound to get players' blood rushing. Moreover, the title's storyline canonically precedes that of

  <em>

  This game serves as the portal for any

  If any RTS franchise could be said to have it all, it is the
  <em>
   Command and Conquer
  </em>
  franchise. With games set in environments ranging from the setting of the famous IP of
  <em>
   Dune 2
  </em>
  to a hyper-futuristic Sci-Fi setting, and with availability from Mobile Phones to the most expensive consoles, this series has not once failed to satisfy RTS fans over the 25 years of entertainment it has provided. And with the recent launch of
  <em>
   Command &amp; Conquer: Remastered Collection
  </em>
  , entry into the IP could never be easier.

 <p>
  So, regardless of whether one is a fan of vintage games or the latest media, and regardless of whether they play on their mobile phones or their highest-end Desktop,
  <em>
   Command and Conquer

  Not all players aim to defeat their enemies in RTS using aggressive unit micro-ing and hyper-managed troop deployment. Some players wish to out-value opponents with superior resource management and structural advantage. And for such kinds of players, Firefly Studio's
  <em>
   Stronghold: Warlords

  is the game.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Stronghold
  </em>
  series has been famous ever since the first iteration for its gritty approach to war. More often than not, war is not fought by battles but by attrition; the title is lauded for how close it has come to stimulating this reality. The

  </em>
  series even provides access to such an RTS experience on both PC and mobile.

  <em>
   Total War: Three Kingdoms
  </em>
  is an RTS set in the 3-kingdom period of China. Players can choose a faction out of 12 to push to the top and unify China. The title offers unit-group-based gameplay, meaning that any player can have only specific units on the battlefield at a time. This slower approach to RTS allows newer players to get a hold of the game a bit more easily.

  The game features two game modes. One of them is a bit more story-like, while the other focuses on historical authenticity. Players can choose famous generals from history to command and exploit, and each general, in turn, comes with specific units unique to them.

  <em>
   Spore
  </em>
  is an RTS life simulation game developed by Maxis in 2008 and published by EA. As the architects of their own universe, players are able to evolve creatures within a world of their own making. Starting from a single cell and progressing all the way up to space, players have a variety of ways to control how their creatures evolve within the world of
  <em>
   Spore.
  </em>
  While the game has been widely criticized for its lackluster gameplay,
  <em>
   Spore
  </em>
  is still loved by many fans and has a relatively active community surrounding it. Despite the radio silence from the team behind
  <em>
   Spore
  </em>
  since 2019, a new update has started the road to reviving the game's audience.

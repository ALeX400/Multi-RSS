  Hawkeye is a sniper, capable of causing tremendous damage and pinning down opponents thanks to his rapid fire. Since he is most vulnerable on the melee range, he is also equipped with several abilities like Crescent Slash and Skyward Leap, to get out of tricky situations.

 <p>
  His ultimate ability,
  <strong>
   Hunter's Sight,
  </strong>
  is tremendously broken. Most enemies won't even know what happens or why their Health depletes even if they're moving rapidly. Using this ability is the best way to counter fast rivals like Star-Lord, Spider-Man, Iron Fist, and Black Panther.

 <p>
  Hawkeye's passive, Archer's Focus, is especially designed for players who prefer a stealthier type of gameplay. Players can take the high ground and slowly track foes, to then unleash a powerful charged shot that can OHKO most heroes (or villains) in the game.

     Hawkeye's primary ability, Piercing Shot, can be spammed. It will cause less damage, but offer a rapid-fire mode that will be useful to pin down opponents and cover allies retreating. It can also overwhelm Strategists easily, since these heroes are often squishier than Vanguards or Duelists.

  Playing Hawkeye is not easy. His low health bar (250) makes him a glass-cannon of sorts, and his poor mobility compared to other Duelists makes him a favorite target of heroes like Wolverine, Iron Fist, and Venom, who prefer to overwhelm their opponents at close range. The ideal way to play this hero is by keeping distance at all times, and searching for high-ground areas where Hawkeye can roost and do his magic.

 <p>
  Hawkeye can be a true menace for heroes like Iron Man and Storm, who trust their aerial privileges to sow terror among the other grounded heroes. A well-placed Hypersonic Arrow will send them back to spawn, and secure important objectives for the team.

    I haven't had a chance to try them all out just yet. I mean, there are 33 from launch after all, but which ones are feeling OP'd? So far, I'd say Punisher is pretty, well, punishing, but that might have just been me in a bit of good form. I have been getting properly beaten up by Iron Fist though. What's his beef with me?!

  Having a Hawkeye on the team means two things:
  <strong>
   damage output,
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   coverage
  </strong>
  . When playing to secure objectives, keep Hawkeye at mid-range with rapid fire and using
  <strong>
   Blast Arrows
  </strong>
  to separate Vanguards from Strategists. This is the best strategy to secure objectives. When other active rangers like Black Widow, Loki, or Psylocke are pursuing the team's Strategists, Hawkeye can step into Sniping mode and, using his passive, can quickly overwhelm them to facilitate their escape.

 <p>
  <strong>
   During Defense, establish a privileged position with a clear view of the objective.
  </strong>
  Getting to high ground is way more important than in other game modes, since there's a reduced combat area where players using Hawkeye can focus their attacks. Always pinpoint high-value targets like Strategists (Healers) and Ranged Duelists (Snipers) and take them down first. Scurry to the backline of the team when threatened by Melee Duelists. Don't try to fight them alone.

 <p>
  <strong>
   During Offense, try to outflank the rival team a
  </strong>
  nd use rapid shot mode to destroy Strategists and cause chaos among the enemies. If there's a chance, get into a sniping roost, but ideally, players should stay away from enemy fire and look for cover instead. Then gain the upper hand by accompanying the ally frontliners with Blast Arrow and Hypersonic Arrow to disrupt the enemy team's Vanguards.

 <h3 id="domination-mode">
  Domination Mode
 </h3>
 <p>
  This game mode puts Hawkeye at a great disadvantage, since it forces him to play in close-range situations where he underperforms. In this game mode, the team needs to capture a position and hold it until it reaches 100%.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Hawkeye players can do either one of two things here. They can either get to high ground and snipe, or remain close to the target and prevent the enemy team from flooding the target area, creating a choking point alongside the Vanguards. In both cases, Hawkeye is vulnerable, so keeping an eye out for flanker Duelists is a must.

 <h3 id="convergence-mode">
  Convergence Mode
 </h3>
 <p>
  During Defense, Hawkeye will have plenty of time to
  <strong>
   secure a privileged position,
  </strong>
  since Defenders can move first. Try to reach the high ground and carefully select an escape route in case the enemy team sends a Duelist to counter him.

 <p>
  During Offense, remain in the backline and support the team with suppression fire. Target Duelists, Strategist, then Vanguards in that order. High-priority targets such as
  <strong>
   Jeff
  </strong>
  (the Land Shark),
  <strong>
   Magick
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Iron Fist,
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Psylocke
  </strong>
  need to go down first, so keep an eye out for them.

     Hawkeye's skills work best when Roosted in a high-ground position. Take advantage of the terrain during fights, but remember that most terrains (including balconies, platforms, and such) can be destroyed. Keep an eye out for heroes like Spider-Man, Venom, Moon Knight, and Iron Fist. They will likely target Hawkeye as a priority, and they have lots of mobility skills that allow them to climb.

  As most players might have guessed by reading this guide, Hawkeye is quite hard to control. His effectiveness depends mostly on two factors:
  <strong>
   team composition
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   positioning.
  </strong>
  The best way to counter a good Hawkeye player is to send another Duelist with high mobility to harass him and prevent him from taking advantage of high ground and sniping positions.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Iron Fist

  works like a charm with his high resilience and flurry of blows, but
  <strong>
   Wolverine
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Venom
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Spider-Man
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Moon Knight
  </strong>
  are also primary Hawkeye counters. At the beginning of each round, Hawkeye will try to outflank the allies, especially Strategists and other ranger Duelists. The best courses of action in each game mode are as follows:

 <p>
  During Offense, Hawyeke will be either in an elevated position or behind the enemy lines. Don't chase him down yet, but try to use one of the Duelists to flank and harass him to prevent him from gaining the upper hand. Psylocke's infiltration skills and Spider-Man's high mobility can be a total menace.

 <p>
  During Defense, Hawkeye will try to outflank the team, so spread out in groups of three and look for the pathway he will take to try this strategy, then jump on him and send him to respawn. Rinse and repeat.

  Use overwhelm tactics. Hawkeye will be at a great disadvantage in this game mode, and will have to position himself close to the objective area. Wolverine with his fast lunges and Iron Fist with his overwhelming attack speed will be his worst nightmare, but Captain America and Psylocke can do the trick as well.

  During Offense, Hawyeke will become a living turret and harass Strategists as much as possible

  During Defense,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Hawkeye will try to suppress the frontline with rapid fire and its AoE skills. Avoid bringing flying heroes into the fight, as they will be shot down in no time.

  Hawkeye greatly benefits from having
  <strong>
   Black Widow

  on his team. He can share his Ultimate Ability with Natasha, turning her into an even more lethal Sniper than she already is. On the other hand, he also needs quite a lot of protection during certain game modes.

      <title>Back 4 Blood 2 Needs One Huge Feature at Launch That the First Game Skipped</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/back-4-blood-2-rumors-improvement-sequel-offline-mode-good-why/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The co-op shooter
  <strong>
   <em>
    Back 4 Blood
   </em>
  </strong>
  was touted as a spiritual successor to the
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  series, but it sadly wasn't able to meet the high-quality bar of its predecessors. Although it was developed by the same studio behind
  <em>
   L4D
  </em>
  , Turtle Rock Games,
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  was met with somewhat mixed reviews upon its release. The game did have its highlights, but it was criticized by many for its map design, difficulty scaling, limited content, and perceived lack of innovation.
  <em>
  </em>
  Despite its divisive critical reception,
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  was still able to attract a sizable audience. Only two weeks after its October 2021 launch, it garnered a total of 6 million players across all platforms, which was quite impressive.

  <em>

  </em>
  's success, however, was ultimately short-lived. In early 2023, Turtle Rock Games announced that it would no longer be releasing new content for
  <em>
   B4B
  </em>
  , since it didn't have enough employees to support the game post-launch for an extended period of time. Most of the developers at the studio, it said, had moved on to a new project. While Turtle Rock hasn't revealed what its next game will be, recent rumors seem to suggest that the company is working on a follow-up to
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  . That may come as a surprise to some, since many gamers viewed the 2021 co-op shooter as a disappointment, but Turtle Rock may have the opportunity to improve on certain aspects of the original
  <em>
   B4B
  </em>
  in a hypothetical follow-up.

  A Follow-Up to Back 4 Blood is Apparently in the Works, According to New Rumors
 </h3>
 <p>
  The rumors about a potential
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  sequel first began popping up last year. In July 2023, Turtle Rock Games started to recruit employees for its next AAA project. In many of the job listings posted on its website, the company stated that it was searching for developers who were fans of co-op, FPS, and multiplayer games, and had experience with first-person games that featured shooting or melee combat. While they didn't explicitly allude to anything, the requirements mentioned for these jobs led many to speculate that Turtle Rock was working on
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood 2
  </em>
  or, at least, another
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  -style co-op game.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":582} -->
 <p>
  This speculation was further compounded by a leak from earlier this year. The news outlet MP1ST recently reported that the resume of a stuntman by the name of Jesse Hutch seemingly confirmed that a
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  sequel was in development. Hutch, who was involved with the original
  <em>
   B4B
  </em>
  , was apparently a lead performer in an upcoming Turtle Rock game that's tentatively titled
  <em>
   Gobi 2
  </em>
  . For those who don't know,
  <em>
   Gobi
  </em>
  was the codename that Turtle Rock used for the first
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  . Putting two and two together, it seems reasonable to conclude that
  <em>
   Gobi 2
  </em>
  is the codename for a
  <em>
   B4B
  </em>
  sequel.

  Unlike The Original B4B, Back 4 Blood 2 Needs to Have Solo Offline Support on Day-One
 </h3>
 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood 2
  </em>
  really does exist, then Turtle Rock should take it upon itself to ensure that the game launches in a feature-complete state, unlike its predecessor. When the original
  <em>
   Back 4
  </em>
  Blood was released, it lacked an offline mode, which was a staple of the
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  games. For many players who tried it out on day one, it was a big disappointment that the game couldn’t be played solo without a persistent internet connection. To Turtle Rock's credit, an offline mode was added to
  <em>
   B4B
  </em>
  in a post-launch update, but in some gamers' eyes, it was too little, too late.

 <p>
  Multiplayer shooters are all the rage these days, but many gamers still prefer to play games by themselves. That's why, if
  <em>
   B4B 2
  </em>
  is ever released, it needs to give players the option to play with A.I. teammates instead of other people. A solo mode in a hypothetical
  <strong>
   <em>
    Back 4 Blood
   </em>
  </strong>
  sequel should also have proper progression systems on day one so that gamers can still have an offline experience that's at least somewhat comparable to playing with friends.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Unite
   </em>
  </strong>
  is reportedly getting a new game mode in the form of an auto-battler, but only players in China can play it.
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  is the Pokemon Company’s MOBA title for Nintendo Switch and mobile devices. The game is a simplified take on the genre, with many ways to customize the player’s gaming experience.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  came out on July 21, 2021, and was received well among most
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans.
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  features many fan-favorite Pokemon, both legendary and more common ones. Players can customize their Pokemon’s looks with "Holowear," unique outfits for each monster. In addition, each Pokemon has its own role, from Defender to Attacker, All-Rounders, and more.

  Centro LEAKS on Twitter has revealed promo artwork provided by Chico Eevee that portrays an “Auto Chess” mode. Auto Chess is similar to
  <em>
   Team Fight Tactics
  </em>
  in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  . Auto Chess has been a popular genre that sprouted from MOBA-like games. Also known as an “Auto Battler,” players summon characters to fight one another in a tiny arena. Each “Auto Battler” has its own unique take on the genre, with specific heroes included, or in this case, Pokemon. Even though this game mode seems to be coming soon, there’s a catch, with it only being available in China for the time being.

  <em>
   Pokemon Unite

  recently released three new Pokemon, with Armarouge, Darkrai, and Psyduck being the most recent additions to the game. Armarouge is an Attacker with ranged attacks; Darkrai is a Speedster with melee attacks; and Psyduck is a Supporter type with a ranged move set that's easy to use for new players. Unlike most Pokemon in
  <em>
   Unite
  </em>
  , Psyduck does not evolve into its evolution: Golduck.

  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  continues to have exciting releases after three years of being live. This year, during the third anniversary,
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  revealed a popular legendary Pokemon coming to the game. Ho-oh, the box art legendary Pokemon for
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold Version
  </em>
  from 1999 for the original Game Boy, is now playable in the MOBA. Sporting the Defender role, Ho-oh is a ranged fighter with an easy-to-master playstyle. He is best in the bottom lane, with the top lane also a good option to play in. As of August 11, 2024, players can buy Ho-Oh for 15,000 Aeos Coins or 840 Aeos Gems. Previously, it was only accessible through the Divine Forest Challenge event that lasted from July 19 to August 12. Players can enjoy
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  for free, and it will be interesting to see if the leaked new auto-battler mode comes to more regions in the future.

      <title>Roblox: Marble Run Tycoon 2 Codes (December 2024)</title>

 <p>
  <em>
   Marble Run Tycoon 2
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game that will fulfill the childhood dream of many players to become the owner of a sweets factory. In addition, the factory is not boring at all because all the sweets here roll down large pipes like in a water park, and it is very interesting to watch. Over time, you will open new conveyors and earn more money, and the factory will gradually turn into a huge castle. However, progress is very slow in the beginning, and it would be good to speed it up. Of course, you can spend some Robux, but it is not necessary. You can redeem
  <em>
   Marble Run Tycoon 2
  </em>
  codes and get cash for free.

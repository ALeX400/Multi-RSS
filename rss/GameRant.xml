      Black Ops 6 players are finding flanking routes like the one on Stakeout, enhancing gameplay tactics.

     <li>
      One player in particular briefly steps outside the map zone to reenter from a much more favorable position.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  players are already discovering flanking routes on multiplayer maps, with one such shortcut being spotted on Stakeout. This discovery isn’t that shocking, considering that
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  has always taught gamers to use the environment in their favor. Unsurprisingly,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  follows that design pattern.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  was released on October 24, gamers have been greatly enjoying multiplayer that launched with a dozen different modes and a total of 16 maps. While the current lineup is reasonably strong, there are already plans to bring back the fan-favorite Nuketown map in November. Until then, there’s plenty to learn on the currently available maps, as demonstrated by one of the recent discoveries. On
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ’s Vault map, there’s a functional diving board that gives players a handy jumping boost. Another discovery, however, may have a bigger impact on gameplay, as it emphasizes tactics over fun.

 <p>
  A Reddit user has accidentally discovered a flanking route on Stakeout, one of the multiplayer maps in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . In a short video clip, the player steps out of the combat zone, rushes up the stairs, and jumps out the door back into action before the timer runs out. This shortcut puts the gamer in a much more favorable position, allowing them to perform a couple of eliminations on unsuspecting opponents. It may seem frustrating, especially for those already annoyed by
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ’s inconsistent multiplayer respawns, but the demonstration still looks impressive. The entire video is 12 seconds long, but during that time, the pace and fighting conditions have changed considerably.

  While most of the commenters on the Reddit thread have found the discovery quite useful, some appear to be annoyed by the map design in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , particularly by the fact that there are often unexpected places for enemies to appear. Interestingly, this isn’t the only concern with the game’s multiplayer. Even though the reception has been mostly positive so far, some players argue that the HUD design from
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ’s campaign should have been used in multiplayer too. However, while the campaign’s HUD does look more artistic, a much clearer and more readable multiplayer version makes more sense.

 <p>
  While the discovery of a flanking route in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ’s Stakeout may seem game-changing, it’s quite plausible that this particular feature was intended by the development team. After all, it felt natural to witness the said route in action, meaning there could be more secrets on other
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  maps. Considering that multiplayer in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  has always forced players to outsmart their opponents, adding such borderline legal shortcuts in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  seems like a reasonable evolution. Besides, it’s highly unlikely that such a convenient route outside the combat zone has been left accidentally.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Windblown
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a fast-paced action roguelike game that lets you team up with two other players to take on the dangers of the Vortex. Golem Gardens is the first biome that players will go through when they start an Expedition. Eventually, players will be able to unlock an alternate starting biome called Fungal Swamp, with its own unique enemies and loot drops.

  But like most roguelikes, the steps to unlocking this alternate starting zone aren't really handed out to you on a silver platter. But that's where we come in. In this guide, we'll give you the exact steps to unlocking the Fungal Swamp in
  <em>
   Windblown

  so that you don't have to keep going through Golem Gardens over and over again.

 <p>
  Players must first defeat the Headbanger boss in the Factory to unlock the Fungal Swamp in
  <em>
   Windblown
  </em>
  . This will allow them to enter the next biome called Rat Village. Rat Village is a much harder region than the Factory biome you just came through, so be prepared for a fight. Keep progressing through the level, clearing the rooms as you go.

  Eventually, one of the Elites you encounter will drop a Wind Map after defeating it. Fungal Swamp gets unlocked automatically the next time you start an Expedition from the Vortex after p[picking up the Wind Map. If you die during the run, return to the Vortex Cannon and select Start Expedition. Now, instead of starting at Golem Gardens automatically, you'll have three destinations to choose from: Golem Gardens, Fungal Swamp, or Random.

  In terms of difficulty, Fungal Swamp is a lot harder to get through compared to Golem Garden. Similar to Golem Garden, this alternate biome doesn't have a main boss. However, the enemies you'll face here are much beefier and can deal much more damage than those found in Golem Gardens. You'll also encounter a lot more Elites and Mini-Bosses in this biome compared to Golem Garden. So, it's recommended to have a good grasp of the basics in
  <em>
   Windblown
  </em>
  before you go with this biome.

 <p>
  On the bright side, the loot drops in Fungal Swamp are different from what you'll get in Golem Gardens. So, if you want to collect all the Weapons, Gifts, and Trinkets in
  <em>
   Windblown
  </em>
  , you'll eventually have to make your way through this biome.

 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Windblown
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers a unique co-op roguelike experience for those who want to play with friends. Fungal Swamp, as an alternate starting biome, offers a fresh experience if you're tired of running through Golem Gardens and want to challenge yourself with something new.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio

  </strong>
  is a game built on classes, which are referred to in this example as Archetypes. Like most RPGs with class-based systems, archetypes can only equip certain types of armour. Knights can equip heavier armour, while Mages need to equip cloaks and similar items.

  Those are examples of body armour, but players can also equip gear, which includes helmets, gloves, and footwear. Most of these pieces of armour are universal. That said, let's go through the late-game armour and gear that players should look for in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . Let's rank them by their stats, bonus effects, and universal appeal.

  To get the Inferno Rock Cuirass, players have to go through a small side quest of sorts in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . First, they have to travel to Mt. Vulkano which will open up toward the latter part of the game.

 <p>
  Here players can fight a chimera-like enemy called the Lava Manjula. Players can steal the Red Lion Cuirass from the monster and then purify it in Grand Trad at the St. Fermis Church to create the Inferno Rock Cuirass. This is a great piece of body armour that all characters can equip, so be sure to steal at least seven Red Lion Cuirasses from the Lava Manjula.

 <p>
  Getting the Surgeon Greaves also requires the process of purification in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . First, players can steal the Medic Greaves from the Kokamordos enemy within the Manor of the Ascendant dungeon. Then players can purify that item to get the Surgeon Greaves which is a decent pair of boots for the gear slot.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":983} -->

 <p>
  They have a decent defense stat for a pair of boots and the addition of Endurance and Agility is a nice bonus. These would be great for any character that is slower in the turn roster.

  If players know about this item and trick, then they can get the Reverent Crown relatively fast. All players have to do is get the hero, Will, as he canonically named in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , to unlock the Trickster Archetype which is the second and final form of the Faker Archetype.

 <p>
  After unlocking it, this piece of head gear will be given to players and it’s only meant for Will. With it, he can gain an extra turn during battle which is a great boon but so is the defense stat for it.

 <p>
  The Kaiser's Pickelhaube is another piece of head gear but the stats are much larger and that’s the basic appeal of it. The defense stat is incredibly high for a piece of gear and it boosts three other stats to a mighty degree too including Endurance, Magic, and Strength.

 <p>
  It’s a good hat to give a character who excels at physical and magical combat, like someone cross-classing between Brawler and Mage Archetypes, for example. It can be found while exploring the very last dungeon of
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , the Tyrant’s Star.

  When players unlock the final month of the game, they can go after a four-part side quest that begins with fighting three dragons at three towers within the world. The hardest dragon of the bunch, Devourer of Stars, is also one of the toughest bosses in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . After defeating it, players will get the Cardinal Dragon Raiment which is a great piece of body armour that repels fire.

 <p>
  The other two dragons offer similar armor that repels fire including the Cardinal Dragon Robe and Cardinal Dragon Armour. All three pieces of body armour will offer some value to players in the game but the Cardinal Dragon Raiment rules the roost because of the balance between stats and versatility.

 <p>
  The Great Sage's Thwab can be found within the Disgraced Ruins, a side area toward the end of the game. This little number has two great things about it. First, it boosts all major stats by 5. Second and most important, it can raise MP by 30%.

 <p>
  That’s a huge boost and magic is the most important method of attack in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio

  as spells can gain players extra turns if they exploit enemy weaknesses. Give this to the strongest mage of the group.

 <p>
  The Yggdrasil Crown is the final reward for getting into the tournament arc within Port Brilehaven. Here, players can enter an arena and fight their way through Bronze, Silver, and Gold matches. There are a lot of great prizes, especially if players are looking for accessories in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio

 <p>
  However, the best prize is this piece of head gear. The Yggdrasil Crown can raise the Magic stat but most importantly it can prevent some status ailments including Charm, Daze, Forget, Sleep, and Rage. The defense is weaker than most hats, but that’s okay because status ailment prevention is an important thing to consider in RPGs.

 <p>
  The Divine Light Gloves are kind of tied for the best armour in the game with the Yggdrasil Crown. That’s because they can prevent the other remaining status ailments in the game including Burn, Hex, Frostbite, Malady, Paralysis, and Poison. The defense is the same but it does boost Strength along with Magic, giving it a slight edge even though the amounts are smaller.

 <p>
  It can be found while exploring the Skybound Avatar, which is the first part of the game’s final dungeon. However, players fall on the matter, both pieces of gear are essential for crafting a solid party in the final hours of the game.

      <title>A Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy Remake Has to Make Things Right With One Character</title>

 <p>
  Right now, the fate of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dissidia Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  series is up in the air. Including several fighting games, rhythm games, and mobile RPGs, these crossover
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  titles have stuck around due to both the strength of their core premise and how popular the original
  <em>
   Dissidia
  </em>
  games on the PlayStation Portable were. It shouldn't be that surprising, then, that fans and developers have continued discussing
  <em>
   Dissidia Final Fantasy
  </em>
  as recently as 2024. With potential new story threads hidden deep in
  <em>
   Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin
  </em>
  ’s DLC, the series could return once more, but it might need a push to reach its destination.

  A

  's story, the heroes and villains of numbered
  <em>

  titles are led by Cosmos, the goddess of harmony, and Chaos, the god of discord. Cosmos is strictly a story NPC, but Chaos is the final boss of both
  <em>

  and
  <em>
   Dissidia 012
  </em>
  . Players were surprised to find out that
  <em>
   Dissidia 012

  also included a playable version of Chaos, rendered as a distinct character called Feral Chaos. Fans loved the idea and got to see it early as a joke fight in the tutorial, but the hype didn't last.

 <p>
  Feral Chaos must be unlocked by completing the postgame, which is a long, endgame-oriented scenario that is itself unlocked after beating

  ’s new prequel campaign. This is a grueling process, and while it arguably isn't the hardest thing in
  <em>

  , needing to defeat two Feral Chaos with increasingly impossible stats along the way will test any player. All of this effort almost guarantees disappointment once Feral Chaos is bought from

  's in-game shop at level 1, with restrictions on its use of basic mechanics. For what was designed as an exciting bonus, Feral Chaos is a major letdown.

 <p>
  A refreshed release of
  <em>
   Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy
  </em>
  will have to take several steps to fix Feral Chaos. First, there should be a small microtransaction that immediately places Feral Chaos' in
  <em>
   Dissidia 012
  </em>
  ’s in-game store. It's been done before in fighting games with long story modes like
  <em>
   BlazBlue
  </em>
  , though adding a prohibitively expensive Feral Chaos to the store after the initial campaign is another option. Second, Feral Chaos’ restrictions of having no Assists, no EX build-up, and constantly draining Bravery should be removed. Gaining skills to lift them requires excessive grinding, and unnecessarily limits what else Feral Chaos can equip.

  Dissidia 012’s Balance Changes Should Hit Feral Chaos Hard
 </h3>
 <p>
  Offsetting that major buff will be a host of balance changes, which Feral Chaos needs anyway. When
  <em>
   Dissidia
  </em>
  is played as a competitive
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  fighting game, a ban on Feral Chaos is typically upheld due to an unblockable projectile HP Attack that can be made impossible to dodge. Even if that move is banned, Feral Chaos suffers from inconsistent performance due to having large, hard-hitting attacks, but also a massive hitbox that certain stages and characters exploit. After fixing the offending HP Attack, a hypothetical
  <strong>
   <em>

  remake would need to take special care in rebalancing its playable secret boss.

      <title>8 Best JRPGs Where You Play As An Assassin</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  If there is one thing that defines the best JRPGs from the early years to now, it's the core mechanics of classes and parties. While some games in this genre, especially those that focus on strong, specific characters, don't mention classes and instead simply give each character their unique skill, many JRPGs both narratively and mechanically have characters take on roles and professions that benefit the party.

 <p>
  Assassins, across older titles and newer ones alike, often have a similar set of skills that help define their vital role in the party. Assassin characters, whether they have a mechanical and specific 'assassin' class or embody the principles of one, are often fast, lethal and adept with critical hits. These games in particular have great assassin classes that help out their party with swift, hard-hitting attacks from the shadows.

  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord
  </em>
  is a continent-spanning strategy title that hits all the classic JPRG plot beats - a liberation group, an evil knight-tyrant, a bunch of marriage candidates, but does all of these tropes so well, that the game comes together to create a fresh, novel, and highly engrossing experience that will last players for hours. Every unit in this game has a set role that can be augmented with passive and active skills from equipment and level-ups.

 <p>
  Many thieves, and their promotion class of rogue, fit the assassin archetype perfectly, dealing high critical hit damage and utilizing fast dagger attacks.Travis in particular, in his utility as a mercenary turned spy, is an excellent assassin archetype (and also best boy for marriage in this game, hands down).

  Assassins have been present in
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  games as far back as
  <em>
   Blazing Blade
  </em>
  on the Gameboy Advance, combining archetypal skills from the fighter and thief classes into something frighteningly potent.

 <p>
  They're not the most common class within really any of the fire emblem games, but Petra is an exceptional assassin candidate in
  <em>
   Three Houses
  </em>
  and is able to put her incredibly high speed and dexterity skills to good use.

  Istina is one of the first companion characters the player meets in
  <em>
   Harvestella
  </em>
  , and her use of fast, poison-imbued attacks makes her a valuable ally in any fight.Learning her assassin skills makes going through many of the dungeons in this game much easier.

 <p>
  The assassin class gives players a poison imbued attack as well as various means of striking hard and swiftly, it has surprising utility for hitting the elemental weak spots of many enemies, and is a great class for those prioritizing speed and mobility over defensiveness.

  The merchant class in this title brings with it an invaluable ability - Hired Help. Like the original title,
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  is a game about synergizing jobs among a cohort of characters. It's a novel gameplay system that rewards players who use the cast of characters creatively.

  The strongest boon from Hired Help is the foreign assassin, whose incredibly damage and sapping attacks are essential for those wanting to make the endgame of

  a breeze.

  Much like its sequel,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
  </em>
  is a game that gives players a breadth of options for their vocation. Player characters can choose a series of hybrid vocations, and as the only hybrid class with no magic elements, the Assassin vocation relies on pure offensive weaponry.

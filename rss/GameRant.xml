  Shoot Off 12 Dressed Mannequin Heads
 </h3>
 <p>
  To complete the Area 99 Easter Egg in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  , players must
  <strong>
   shoot the heads of 12 dressed mannequins as quickly as possible at the Mannequin Assembly POI
  </strong>
  . The easiest way to accomplish this is by teaming up with friends to spread out across the POI and count out loud how many mannequins each player has taken down. If done correctly, a sound will confirm completion. While this Easter Egg can be completed solo, it requires luck with mannequin placement and minimal competition when landing at the POI.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mannequin Assembly area contains 24 mannequins, but only 12 will spawn in random locations each match. To maximize efficiency, use a map with all possible spawn points to minimize time spent searching.

     If you fail to destroy the mannequins within the required time – signaled by the absence of the confirmation sound – you’ll need to start a new match and try again.

  After successfully removing all 12 mannequins,
  <strong>
   head to the Reactor POI and locate two highlighted bodies
  </strong>
  to collect the
  <strong>
   key cards

  . This step, along with the next,
  <strong>
   requires

  <strong>
   two players
  </strong>
  — each must collect a key card and activate the final step simultaneously. To avoid getting stuck, make sure you have at least one teammate, as it’s not possible to pick up both key cards alone.

  Once you have both key cards,

   head to the Test Site POI

  and enter the terminal building located next to the UAV Tower. In the

  Warzone's Area 99 Nuke Easter Egg was discovered by players Dawg130, PassivePuppet, WATTS52621013, Marty, and JoeyCleaves, who shared the full process and steps to complete it on Twitter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, this Easter Egg only triggers the animated in-game sequence of nukes detonating in Area 99 and does not provide any usable in-game rewards or cosmetic items. It’s unclear whether any hidden rewards exist, but upon completion, nothing is automatically granted, unlike other Easter Eggs in the game.

  Bandai Namco announced that the controversial throw break and chip damage changes for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tekken 8
   </em>
  </strong>
  Season 2 will not be permanent after the development team gauged community feedback. Another new change to throw breaks was announced for Season 2 of
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  , and Bandai Namco outlined the adjustments that will be made soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Tekken Talk Live livestream on March 23 outlined
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  DLC character Anna Williams and the gameplay adjustments that will be made with the Season 2 update on March 31. During the stream,
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  director Katsuhiro Harada revealed one of the most controversial gameplay changes in
  <em>
   Tekken 8's
  </em>
  history thus far. Harada revealed that throw breaks will deal chip damage to the player who successfully negates the throw in
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  Season 2, and fans of the game were frustrated about the ramifications of that change on competitive play. The divisive change means players will be punished for being defensive, since damage is still incurred when breaking out of throws.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bandai Namco released its balance overview with a list of changes for
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  Season 2 patch 2.0, revealing that
  <em>
   Tekken 8's
  </em>
  controversial throw breaks change will be scrapped in a future update. In a subsequent update, throw breaks will no longer deal chip damage to the player, and the thrower will receive one point of recoverable health for initiating the throw. According to the developers, they received feedback from players and reconsidered the inclusion of chip damage, concluding that the change imposed an excessive disadvantage on the defending player breaking out of the throw. The developers reiterate that throw breaking is a high-skill mechanic that reflects the player's skill in
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  .

  Tekken 8 Will Remove Controversial Chip Damage for Breaking Throws in a Future Update During Season 2
 </h2>
 <p>
  Moreover, the input window for throw breaking will be loosened, allowing players to more easily break throws in
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  Season 2. This helpful change will be applied directly when the Season 2 update launches on March 31, but the chip damage will be removed at a later date in an upcoming update. The
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  developers note that the update and its adjustments are scheduled to be completed before the opening of Tekken World Tour 2025 on May 9.

  45th anniversary stage, free

  <em>

  Season 2 is expected to last through the entirety of 2025, and the season's final DLC character and stage are planned to release in winter 2025. During Season 2,
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  is one of the main titles for EVO 2025, and the game's meta will likely change in the coming months as more character balance updates are introduced and more DLC characters are released.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been a long-running franchise that has evolved over the years, giving players new stories in new areas of history. However, even with the games progressing to places like Japan with
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , some players are still enjoying the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games from the classic era of the franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  From experiencing the Creed as Ezio Auditore in Italy, to becoming a Pirate like Edward Kenway, these classic titles don't only have great stories, but have also aged the best to allow players to still enjoy them many years after their release. These are by far the classic
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games that have aged the best, ranked.

  The classic games of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  wouldn't be classics if it didn't include the fans of the franchise's favorite assassin, Ezio Auditore. With this Italian Assassin having multiple games involving him, every single one has been a great experience to replay for players, especially as they still hold their ground, even today.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Revelations

  </strong>
  may be the weakest of these, but it's still a great game to play by Ubisoft, as well as being a brilliant conclusion to the story of Ezio and finally allowing the franchise to move on to another character.

  Out of the multiple previous games in the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  franchise, some of the spin-off games that have been created alongside the main franchise have been just as great to play again, aging well with their fellow
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  titles.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Rogue
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an interesting addition to the franchise, as it's the only game where players are on the opposite side of the conflict between the Assassins and the Templars.
 </p>
 <p>
  Playing as Shay Cormac, an assassin that has swapped sides, combines the gameplay of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Black Flag
  </em>
  – which will be mentioned later – with this entirely new story to create a classic experience that many players have enjoyed replaying when hoping for another Templar title.

  Alternatively, players have also been replaying
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Although there had been more than three games before it,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  took players to an entirely different period of history as they got to explore Colonial America as a Native American man.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  did have some issues, such as players finding this open-world and parts of the story to be quite weak, the game played brilliantly back in the day, with players still enjoying the gameplay of this title when exploring as Connor.

  The unfortunate problem with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Unity
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the technical issues it faced on its release. This aside,
  <em>
   Unity
  </em>
  is by far one of the greatest classic era
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games that players have enjoyed returning to due to its incredible parkour mechanics that many players claim the modern titles have not been able to recreate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to multiple post-release patches,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Unity
  </em>
  was transformed into one of the best classic era games of the franchise, with players adoring both the missions and the world of the French Revolution they could freely explore.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

  . While

  is adored for introducing many players to the franchise, Brotherhood is adored for bringing plenty of new features to the game that many players can't live without.
 </p>
 <p>
  A staple of the game was the recruitment mechanic that allowed players to acquire more assassins and then use them in combat. With the game following directly the events of the second
  <em>

  <em>

  As previously discussed, besides Ezio being a staple of the franchise that many players miss, besides the adventures in Italy, players also adored the classic title of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Black Flag,
   </em>
  </strong>
  where players weren't a regular assassin but instead an infamous pirate in the Caribbean.
 </p>
 <p>
  The open-world of this game was so much better than the others, with the game also introducing players to ship combat. To captain their own vessel, the player would have to fight off other pirates, Templars, or even start their own battles with merchant vessels. While
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  may have ship combat, the story can't rival Edward Kenway.

      <title>How Dark Mass’ Underwater Experience Brings Horror to a New Level</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/dark-mass-underwater-horror-game/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Looking to join the list of unique immersive survival horror games,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Mass
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an upcoming title developed by the Spanish-based studio Path Games.
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  invites players to a fully underwater first-person eerie adventure. Fans will play from the perspective of Alice, a deep-sea explorer who finds a sunken manor where a stalking dark presence lurks.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  , players will have to solve disturbing puzzles based on historical torture methods while struggling to deal with enemies, darkness, and moral decisions that will affect Alice’s fate. Because the story of
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  is almost entirely sub-aquatic, the development team at Path Studio had to carefully approach fears like thalassophobia, which is the fear of drowning in deep waters, and claustrophobia. Game Rant recently spoke with Path Games co-founders and
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  developers Virginia Calvo and Gonzalo G. Luna about what it meant for the team to create a sinister underwater world.

 <p>
  According to Calvo and Luna, most immersive horror games work in a horizontal plane with X and Z axes. But the team behind
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  opted for a different route to enhance feelings of claustrophobia and used vertical exploration. As the developers explained,
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “By introducing verticality, we pushed claustrophobia to a new level. The world isn’t just wide — it’s deep, filled with narrow passages and vertical spaces that heighten the tension.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Another important theme in
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  is thalassophobia. Calvo and Luna share that “90% of the game takes place underwater,” so they admit that players may have to step into the game with their fear of drowning somewhat tamed. However, the developers detail that
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  seeks to balance eeriness without giving a frustrating experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, one of
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  ’ major gameplay elements is the walkie-talkie system. While exploring, Alice will communicate with her brother Reed, who can advise Alice with puzzles and decision-making. However, Calvo and Luna add that the walkie-talkie not only enhances immersion but also works as a tension-breaker that can alleviate the feeling of being isolated underwater.

 <p>
  To take the submerged experience further, the development team had to address underwater physics, and Calvo and Luna reveal that this was quite a time-consuming challenge. Still, the team paid close attention to how each object would behave so that players would feel that
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  ’ world had “consistent, believable rules.” As the developers explain, horror hits harder with realism present to a certain degree. Handling realistic underwater lighting posed its own difficulties as well, since light behaves very differently under the sea:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “The deeper you go, the less light penetrates, and colors begin to fade into shades of blue and green. This creates a unique challenge when it comes to guiding the player, especially since we can’t rely on vibrant visual cues. But we’ve found workarounds using tools like the walkie-talkie and other techniques to ensure players never feel completely lost.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Like in most horror games, sound will play a crucial role in
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  ’ surrounding gameplay. Calvo and Luna share that they designed different audio layers for each environment to accompany both intense scenes and moments of calm.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to other immersive gameplay features,
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  ’ decision system will lead to multiple endings. However, unlike other decision-based horror games, the developers reveal that “not all decisions are text-based” in
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  . Instead, some decisions will relate to how much players have explored the manor or whether they have discovered certain items or not. On the other hand, Calvo and Luna add that replayability isn’t really a main goal for the team as much as it is that players can fully relate to their first playthrough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dark Mass
  </em>
  ’ first trailer showed a particular corpse-like enemy inside the eerie manor. Calvo and Luna reveal that players can look forward to even more creatures in future trailers, as well as more interactive gameplay elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Mass
   </em>
  </strong>
  is in development for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, with a release window planned for fall 2026.

  is working on a fix for the issue of high RAM consumption.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is available for PC and consoles, but despite its wide success across various platforms, players have been running into a few problems. To keep the experience fair and optimized for all players, NetEase has consistently released updates aimed at fixing bugs and game balance shortcomings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Addressing a recurring complaint from the community,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  March 6 update fixed a series of terrain issues that caused players to get stuck in strange areas of the maps. A few days later, the release of the March 13 patch made further fixes to various problems, like character-related bugs and the high sensitivity caused by the high frame rate, which led to strange behavior. Despite the constant fixes, one recurring problem continues to affect PC players. However, one

  developer offers some good news.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lead Technical Designer Weikang Ruan confirmed that the

  crew is working to reduce the memory leak on the PC version. Speaking to PC Gamer at GDC 2025, Ruan revealed that Season 2 may introduce a new checkbox in the launcher, so players can use it to “significantly reduce memory consumption.”

  Season 2 of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is expected to drop on April 11, and optimization of the high RAM consumption is one of the new features that players can expect. The devs promise changes to
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' team-ups, adding new special abilities and adjusting existing ones, although details are currently unknown. Additionally, a new theme will replace the current one, possibly the famous Hellfire Gala from the
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  comics. Another change will be in the roster of playable characters, which is believed to welcome Blade and Emma Frost.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until the second season arrives, players can enjoy other content introduced by the most recent updates. One of them is the reveal of the Venom twerk emote, which
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  players can get for a limited time. The symbiote is also featured in the new Pick-Up bundle, with items including a skin reminiscent of his alternate look in
  <em>
   Marvel vs Capcom
  </em>
  . Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event continues, and players still have time to pick up other rewards, such as the new Black Widow skin.

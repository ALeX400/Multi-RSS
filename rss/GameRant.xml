      <title>How Ghost of Yotei's 1603 Setting Could Pave the Way for One Overarching Theme</title>

 <p>
  The reveal of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Yotei
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been one of the biggest announcements of the year so far, with Sucker Punch taking its beloved
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  franchise in an unexpected direction.
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  brings a fresh story to life with protagonist Atsu. Although much of the story still remains a secret, the first trailer for the game teases a ruthless journey filled with revenge-fueled bloodshed.

 <p>
  The mystery of
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  makes it a compelling game to speculate on, but one of the most intriguing differences from its predecessor is its significant time jump.
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  takes place in 1603, which is more than 300 years after the events of
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  . This time jump is one of the biggest questions surrounding
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  and its story. Although many were surprised about the focus on a different time period, the year of 1603 marks a huge cultural change for Japan that could set the stage for one of
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  's main themes.

  A Time Defined By Rigid Social Standards
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Edo period lasted over 200 years, but it officially began in 1603, according to historians. This is one of the most significant times in Japan's long history, as it brought the country into a much stricter hierarchy that greatly valued an emphasis on social classes. Despite its mysterious nature, there is a lot to be analyzed from early looks at
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  . With this setting in particular, Atsu's journey technically takes place outside of Japan, so her journey and methods may clash with the changing world around her.

 <h3 id="mount-yotei-and-hokkaido">
  Mount Yotei and Hokkaido
 </h3>
 <p>
  As the title implies,
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  uses Mount Yotei as a backdrop for its setting. Located on the island of Hokkaido, this is an intriguing choice for a setting, as the island wasn't officially made part of Japan until 1869. This means that either Atsu could be running away to the area, or she could have been raised on the island. If the former is true, then it could be possible that Atsu is seeking solace in Hokkaido, as she is fleeing Japan's transformation into a stricter society. In the trailer, Atsu is portrayed as a renegade, and this directly clashes with both the samurai bushido code and the country of Japan as a whole.

 <p>
  During the Edo period, a nomadic lifestyle was not in line with the samurai way, especially if it was fueled by bloodlust. By this time, the samurai were beginning to formalize bushido, giving samurai a far more rigid set of rules to follow in order to serve as an example to those who were considered to be in the lower classes. Atsu's embrace of a more free lifestyle in
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  could be the start of one of the game's main conflicts.

 <p>
  On the surface, these seven virtues are great rules to live by, but taking them too close to the heart can create a suffocating environment. During this period, the samurai lifestyle seemed to have a far more black and white perspective on issues of the time, while Atsu could potentially see everything as far more gray. If
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  aims to bring the franchise into a new era, then shining a spotlight on this conflict in morality could be a fascinating starting point for the game's story.

 <p>
  Based on early looks, it seems like
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  will be a fascinating dive into a specific period of Japan's history. There is an important meaning behind this time jump, and the start of the Edo period could easily be the reason why.

  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and Disney have ambitious plans for the game, as the two are hoping to build an in-game Disney universe. Much of this remains a mystery, but after the company invested $1.5 billion in Epic Games at the beginning of the year, the partnership is clearly serious. Characters from
  <em>
   The Incredibles
  </em>
  to notable Disney villains have been slated for the game since then, but if
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and Disney really want to spark a frenzy among players, then proving this year's
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  rumors to be true would be a huge moment for the battle royale.

  These rumors began back in May when leaker Midori stated that
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  would be branching out for crossovers with other games, specifically mentioning
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . With Disney's large investment, many were quick to assume that this crossover would happen quickly. However, these claims came and went without any proof coming to light. More rumors entered the spotlight, though, when several notable leakers suggested that
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and Disney would announce a
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  crossover at this year's D23 event. Since the event happened back in August, these leaks never came to fruition, but this doesn't mean that they were entirely untrue.

  Despite both sets of leaks and rumors having yet to be confirmed, it is still completely possible that these individuals are on a trail that leads toward the eventual announcement of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  coming to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . There have now been two instances of rumors revolving around
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  being added to the popular battle royale. The combination of reports suggesting that
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  is aiming for more crossovers and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  getting close with Disney points to this collaboration as being inevitable.

     In addition to upcoming Disney collaborations,

 <p>
  Now, the big question revolves around when an announcement will finally happen, if these leaks point to something accurate. The release of
  <em>
   The Incredibles
  </em>
  and Disney villains were scheduled relatively close together. With Disney's ambitious goals for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , it's not out of the realm of possibility for the game to add iconic characters from the company quite regularly. In fact, Disney has played a significant role in this year's Fortnitemares.
  <em>
   The Nightmare Before Christmas
  </em>
  has introduced some great skins as well.

  Although the inclusion of major Disney characters has been exciting for some players, finally bringing
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  into the picture would be an exciting moment for longtime gamers. As a blend of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  and major Disney franchises,
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  has grown into one of the 21-century's most beloved series of games. There are some downsides to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's Disney crossover, but featuring
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  would be one of the game's biggest collaborations yet.

 <p>
  If this rumored crossover doesn't come to light soon, then there is still at least another perfect moment for
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  to come to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . With the wait for
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  continuing, Disney and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  could have the perfect marketing opportunity by releasing a crossover ahead of the game's release. Despite no official confirmation from Disney or Epic Games, it would be surprising if
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  never made its way into the world of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  .

  </em>
  players are able to download a big new update that preloads
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  and improves Call of Duty HQ's problematic UI.
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is the next entry in Activision's storied FPS franchise. Bringing the return of round-based Zombies, a single-player campaign set in the early 90s, and 16 original multiplayer maps,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is one of the biggest releases of the Fall season and has fans eager to check out its enticing new omnimovement system that lets players sprint, slide, and dive in any direction.

  Back in August, Activision proposed a roadmap of updates aiming to reduce
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's exorbitant file sizes and address the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  HQ's heavily criticized UI. This effort began with Season 5's Reloaded update, which quietly laid the groundwork to reorganize the game's files.
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's open beta went live on August 30, with the user interface update planned for mid-October. The roadmap includes the launch of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  on the 25th, as well as Season 1, which is expected to begin in early December.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  has rolled out its promised UI update. While it doesn't bring any gameplay changes to
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  , the update isn't entirely empty calories, as it prepares the Call of Duty
  <em>
  </em>
  HQ for
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's imminent launch and introduces its new UI. On PlayStation 5 the update eats up 52 GB of storage space, while, puzzlingly, the same update weighs in at 112 GB on Xbox Series X and S. It's been reported that this difference in size is due to a bug on Xbox, and that the actual size of the update on Xbox is smaller.

 <p>
  While 52 GB is still considered by many to be way too bloated for an update, fans should expect these file sizes to become smaller over time. When Activision first laid out its roadmap in August, it expressed that some of these prep updates would be larger, but these will pave the way for
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  update sizes to be smaller in the future. With that said, this pre-
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  update should be one of the last updates that causes
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  players to start sweating. Hopefully, the updated COD HQ UI is up to snuff for fans as well, as it's been the source of many headaches ever since it was introduced alongside
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  two years ago.

  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

  is getting ready for its release on October 25. Unlike in recent years,
  <em>
   Call of Duty

  isn't offering early access to

  's campaign as it did with

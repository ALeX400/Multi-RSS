  From the Hinterland Site of Grace, go east up the slope and keep going in the same direction. Eventually, you will arrive at the Shaman Village where a small tree surrounded by gold light can be seen near the entrance. Just next to it is the

  When it comes to video game enemies, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise has always been synonymous with the fearsome beings made of darkness known as the Heartless. Yet these games have also featured many other interesting and dangerous enemy types, like the Heartless’ hollow counterparts, the
  <strong>
   Nobodies
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The Nobodies are significantly different to other beings in the
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  universe. While
  <strong>
   Sora
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Donald
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Goofy
  </strong>
  and their allies have fought a lot of regular enemies, Nobodies with human-like appearances, impressive powers, and high intelligence also exist, most of whom are part of Organization XIII. The question is: who are the most powerful members of this bizarre species?

  <strong>
   Naminé
  </strong>
  doesn’t actually have any battle prowess, but her impressive power comes from her ability to alter, erase, and control other people’s memories, which is something that most likely came from her unconventional existence as the Nobody of a Princess of Heart, in this case
  <strong>
   Kairi
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  When Organization XIII manipulated Naminé during the events of
  <em>
   Chain of Memories
  </em>
  , she managed to completely break Sora’s psyche and even made him distance himself from his own friends. This is a really useful power that has proven to be even more dangerous than any real combat ability. Even after she returned to Kairi’s heart, Naminé's mind-controlling abilities were put to good use when she called to Lingering Will’s side during the final battle of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  .

  Most of the high-ranking Nobody enemies in the franchise are nowhere near as powerful as the members of Organization XIII, but there’s one clear exception: the
  <strong>
   Sorcerer.
  </strong>
  This makes sense considering that these bizarre creatures are Xemnas’ very own minions.

  In battle, the Sorcerers can manipulate a bunch of magic cubes in order to protect themselves and deal massive damage to even the strongest of opponents, even Sora himself. They’re incredibly tricky to deal with, as they only appeared in the late stages of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts 2

  While every member of Organization XIII can put up a fight, some focus their efforts on other ventures, like scientific research or complex mini-games. There are still a good number of prominent Nobodies who give Sora and company a tough time, and
  <strong>
   Larxene
  </strong>
  is definitely one of the most dangerous ones.

  She can move at blindingly-fest speeds, wield a set of eight sharp knives, clone herself, and both generate &amp; control electricity, something that has even let her create huge structures, as was seen with The Labyrinth of Ice in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The most dangerous part about Larxene, though, is her sadistic personality. She truly enjoys tormenting those who she sees as beneath her, which makes her a ruthless combatant.

  Back when he was part of Organization XIII,
  <strong>
   Axel
  </strong>
  was tasked with the important mission of finding out who were traitors within the Organization, and eliminating them. Thus, he became a deadly assassin who managed to defeat, overpower, and eliminate other strong nobodies, like Vexen or Zexion. He even fought Marluxia one-on-one, which is yet another impressive feat.

 <p>
  Blessed with the power of pyrokinesis, Axel can summon huge walls of fire, create destructive explosions, and even cover his signature chakrams in flames. When he’s in a pinch, he can generate a gigantic fiery explosion that can eliminate thousands of enemies at once, although this final trump card will cost him his own life. Luckily, Axel’s human counterpart,
  <strong>
   Lea
  </strong>
  , is still quite a powerful warrior.

  <strong>
   Xigbar
  </strong>
  not only used to be Master Xehanort’s second-in-command (back when he was
  <strong>
   Braig
  </strong>
  ), but he’s also one of the many incarnations of the Lost Master,
  <strong>
   Luxu
  </strong>
  . So it makes a lot of sense that he would be a powerful Nobody during his time in Organization XIII, which was mostly due to his unconventional weapons and special powers.

 <p>
  With his special Arrowguns and his ability to control space, Xigbar really knows how to mess around with his opponents in various ways. He can create huge projectiles, or make it rain deadly lasers, only to increase his range by using portals, teleporting around, or even changing the architecture of the battlefield. Xigbar definitely has one of the most creative fighting styles in all of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  , which makes him a really tough opponent in battle.

  <strong>
   Xaldin
  </strong>
  is yet another member of Organization XIII who specializes in combat, and this is perfectly reflected in his design and weapons. He wields six lances at the same time, and his physical prowess is boosted by his ability to control air, which he can use to conjure deadly tornadoes or create reflective shields.

 <p>
  Most players will remember Xaldin from his infamous boss battle set in Beast's Castle in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 2
  </em>
  , in which he fights relentlessly, and is surprisingly hard to beat for a game that is otherwise pretty easy. During this encounter, Xaldin fights by jumping and striking his opponent with his lance in a way that is reminiscent of the Dragoons
  <strong>
  </strong>
  from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  , which is one of the most powerful job classes in that franchise.

  <strong>
   Saix
  </strong>
  is a true wild card because, despite his usual calm and calculated demeanor, he can become a chaotic beast in battle. For starters, he fights by wielding a gigantic sword known as Claymore, and he can even boost this weapon’s strength by harnessing the power of the moon. Yet Saix’s most dangerous tool is his Berserk Form, in which he becomes even stronger, faster, and more unpredictable.

 <p>
  He was already powerful in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 2
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  took him to a whole new level, since he gained the ability to summon up to five different Claymores at the same time. With this power, Saix could easily fight Sora, Kairi, and Lea at the same time without any real issue. Not to mention that his Data Battle is infamous among seasoned fans because of how challenging it is.

 <p>
  There are only two Nobodies who have been the main antagonists of a
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  game, and one of them was
  <strong>
   Marluxia
  </strong>
  . This is quite admirable, considering that, at that point in the story, he was one of the few villains in the series who had nothing to do with Xehanort. During the events of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Chain of Memories
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Marluxia gracefully leads his own crew in order to manipulate Sora and eventually betray the rest of Organization XIII.

 <p>
  He would never have been able to do any of that if he didn’t have enough power to back up his position, and Marluxia certainly delivered on that promise. He wields his sharp scythe in a variety of deadly ways, and can even harness the power of cherry blossoms in order to create some truly powerful attacks, like his infamous Doom technique. When he was in a pinch, Marluxia summoned a gigantic Nobody named
  <strong>
   Specter
  </strong>
  who could aid him in battle, which is something that not many Organization XIII members are able to do.

  As the main protagonist, it’s only inevitable that Sora would be one of the strongest characters in the entire
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  franchise. As a result, it also makes sense that his Nobody,
  <strong>
   Roxas
  </strong>
  , is also incredibly powerful. However, due to some strange heart &amp; memory shenanigans, he has been shown to have some unexpected extra abilities that make him even more powerful than initially expected.

 <p>
  Roxas was already a proficient Keyblade Wielder who could cast magic, summon Samurai Nobodies, and use Light in a vast array of different attacks. But, after a specific set of circumstances was achieved, Roxas gained the ability to wield two Keyblades at the same time, which made him even more powerful. At one point, he became so incredibly strong that
  <strong>
   Riku
  </strong>
  was forced to use Ansem’s darkness to subdue him, not to mention that he also gave Sora a tough time during their encounter in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 2
  </em>
  . When he finally came back in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  , Roxas was able to defeat Saix’s Berserk Form in just a few minutes.

 <p>
  As the Nobody of Terra-Xehanort and the top member of Organization XIII,
  <strong>
   Xemnas
  </strong>
  is pretty much the indirect leader of all the Nobodies in the
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  universe. He’s a being who appreciates both light and darkness, and takes advantage of his seamlessly-hollow body to wield both of them at the same time.

 <p>
  Xemnas is not only an intelligent manipulator and leader; he’s also one of the most powerful combatants in the series, with a lot of tricky abilities and techniques at his disposal. He can wield his deadly Ethereal Blades, use darkness, create reflective barriers, and shoot balls of lightning, not to mention that he can turn other Nobodies into Dusks, and even empower them in the midst of battle.

 <p>
  If that wasn’t enough, Xemnas became a true force to be reckoned with at the very end of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 2
  </em>
  , where he boosted his own power thanks to his artificial Kingdom Hearts. On that occasion, he summoned a gigantic Nobody Dragon, threw giant buildings around with no problem, and even created a dome of explosive projectiles. Even though Sora &amp; Riku eventually managed to defeat him, they almost died in the process, which shows how deadly Xemnas truly was.

  <strong>
   Role-playing games
  </strong>
  of every flavor are most well known for their often dense worlds, colorful stories, and lore that serves to pull players in for hours with no intention of letting them go. Plus, in the time between major story beats, there are often some deep combat mechanics, and a fair bit of level grinding, to keep players engaged.

 <p>
  Sometimes, though, the balancing of a story's tone does the heavy lifting, playing a huge role in garnering fans and giving a franchise legs far into the future. In these instances, it's not uncommon for players to ignore a game's critical path to explore side quests that have them either busting a gut or shedding tears. What follows are some of the best
  <strong>
   RPGs that do an excellent job of balancing humor with their dramatic story elements

  .

  It all starts with Vault Boy, who accompanies the player from within their Pip-Boy, and appears in all of VAULT-TEC's marketing throughout the game, essentially becoming the cute mascot for the apocalypse. Mix in a megaton of tragically hilarious NPCs, and a huge amount of pulpy hyper-violence, and players have a recipe for one of the funniest worlds in an RPG, both intentionally and unintentionally.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Like A Dragon

  </strong>
  games, the re-hashed title for the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series, continue the franchise's penchant for taking harrowing stories as well as ridiculous, unrelated side quests, and throwing them together in a blender. As unceremoniously as this is done, it never takes anything away from the game's entertainment factor. In fact, it adds to it tremendously.

 <p>
  Players will be tasked with uncovering dramatic conspiracies within their Yakuza clan in one moment, and then can go off to race go-carts, fight diaper-clad adult men, or even build an island home the next. These games truly figured out the formula for what makes a game both goofy and serious in equal measure.

  There aren't many game series that are as over-the-top as the
  <em>

  games. The first entry's humor, for example, went as far as extending out to its ad campaign, touting the inclusion of "a bazillion guns" to play around with. When

  Instead of a simple treasure hunt, the game's ignoble villain, Handsome Jack, is out for blood and glory, and he's willing to do some messed-up things to get it. Things like murdering countess innocents, or even enslaving his own daughter. Yet, after all of his wicked behaviors, his hilarious diatribes on the player's intercom during gameplay are hard not to laugh at.

  One of the most popular features in many RPGs is the ability to choose what moral path to go down, good or evil. This, along with its hilarious meta nature and unmistakable eccentricities, are core to the
  <strong>

  experience.

 <p>
  While just about every opponent in the game has their quirks, they also have a great deal of humanity that shines through when push comes to shove. In certain moments, like when a character is going to meet their maker, their silly persona melts away, as they tell the player how they really feel.

  often distracts players by handing them a ridiculous amount of meaningful side quests.

  Take the quest "A Frying Pan, Spick and Span" for instance, which tasks players with retrieving a pan from the person who borrowed it. Upon breaking into their house, it's revealed that the borrower has fled, leaving someone dead in their den. The player has nothing else to do besides walk through the scene, retrieve the cooking appliance, and glean what they can about the situation, before just walking away. The quest is hilarious in its simplicity, while also being a reminder of the realities of the world Geralt inhabits.

  An
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  clip shows why playing Tank is so painful right now as Mauga charges into the fray and quickly gets destroyed. As
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is updated over time, the meta is adjusted, and the current meta doesn't seem to favor Tank heroes.

  When
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  was released, it replaced its predecessor and maintained many of its mechanics. There are Damage, Support, and Tank heroes in the game, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. The sequel also includes cosmetics for each character like skins, emotes, and weapon charms. These cosmetics are often included in a seasonal Battle Pass which also used to be the primary method of obtaining new heroes. One of the main attractions of playing a Tank is the ability to withstand damage while fighting the enemy team. One gamer has spotted a key problem with the current version of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  as a Tank hero is quickly defeated.

  A Reddit user recently shared an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  clip showing the perspective of two Tank heroes, Mauga and Orisa. The clip begins with Orisa holding an Energy Javelin which she throws at an ice column on
  <em>
   Overwatch 2

  's Arctic Peninsula map. After missing this attack, the character shoots at a group of enemies and quickly Fortifies as an enemy Mauga charges at them. From the Mauga's perspective, it's clear that multiple characters are hiding behind the ice columns as he runs at Orisa. His Overrun slam misses Orisa, and he's hacked by the enemy Sombra just as the other enemies unleash a barrage of attacks to eliminate him in less than two seconds.

 <p>
  The clear problem illustrated by this video is that Tank heroes get defeated too easily. Whether it's due to a lack of health in the current version of the game, or if they need a unique health bar, Mauga is eliminated too easily. While Mauga has 750 health, this clip shows that it can quickly be reduced to zero, even as rapidly as two seconds. With the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  character stunned for most of that time, they could not defend themselves, take one enemy with them, or retreat. As Tanks are so pivotal to winning a game, this team may not have recovered from this failed push. Although the team could've approached the capture point from a different angle, Orisa's team seems to be better coordinated.

  As Blizzard continues to update
  <em>

  , Tank heroes may have better luck in future seasons. Because the armor portion of Mauga's health takes longer to deplete than the remainder, the fix may be as simple as making the full bar armor for Tanks. In contrast, fixing the issue with Tanks could cause more balancing problems in the future.

  From Software's series of
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  games are iconic for their interconnected worlds and challenging combat. This combat often includes an expressive parry system, well-telegraphed enemy attacks, a dodge roll, and stamina management. While not all Soulslikes feature extreme challenges to overcome, many of them feature a variety of challenging bosses to defeat.

 <p>
  There have been an abundance of Soulslikes released over the years that take inspiration from From Software's now-classic franchise, with many of them also leaning on its RPG elements to provide players with plenty of potential character builds. However, some Soulslike games - including From Software's own
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  - streamline the experience by
  <strong>
   reducing the player's potential arsenal to a single weapon.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Nine Sols
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a Metroidvania with Soulslike combat, featuring a parry system and a variety of challenging bosses that many fans of both
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  and games like
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  will enjoy. Despite having multiple ways to attack in-game,
  <em>
   Nine Sols
  </em>
  themes the different available attacks around a single weapon: the player's fists or, more specifically, the energy that comes from them.

 <p>
  <em>
   Nine Sols
  </em>
  may be more Metroidvania than Soulslike, but the influences from games such as
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  are clear as day. Furthermore, the interconnected world will likely appeal to many fans of From Software's classic
  <em>
   Dark Souls

  games.

  This colorful underwater adventure puts players in the shell(s) of a hermit crab, exploring a watery kingdom and taking out powerful bosses in
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  fashion. Similarly to Soulslikes such as
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Another Crab's Treasure
   </em>
  </strong>
  only gives players access to a single weapon.

 <p>
  The fork that
  <em>
   Another Crab's Treasure
  </em>
  gives players is their only means of attacking enemies at melee range, but thankfully, it can be upgraded throughout the game. Combined with its limited stats that make leveling up much simpler,
  <em>
   Another Crab's Treasure
  </em>
  is a remarkably accessible Soulslike experience.

   <em>
    Titan Souls
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a Soulslike boss-rush game that gives players access to only one weapon: a bow and arrow. With this weapon, players are thrust into the game's world and tasked with taking down a variety of challenging, mesmerizing bosses, each designed in beautiful pixel-art.

 <p>
  Each boss provides its own unique challenge, offering an almost puzzle-like experience to each encounter. While there's not much to do in between boss fights, the world of
  <em>
   Titan Souls
  </em>
  is extremely atmospheric, reminiscent of games like
  <em>
   Shadow Of The Colossus
  </em>
  .

  This bright and colorful indie game takes players on a swashbuckling adventure, fencing their way through a variety of challenging encounters across a brisk campaign. While
  <strong>
   <em>
    En Garde!
   </em>
  </strong>
  may be a short and sweet linear game, its challenging combat will likely appeal to Soulslike fans.

  <em>

  gives players access to a single weapon, but they can also use the environment to their advantage, kicking a variety of objects at enemies to take them out.
  <em>

  is a far cry from the original
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , but its engaging combat (complete with a parry and stamina system) makes it a worthwhile adventure.

  Part Metroidvania, part Soulslike,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hollow Knight
   </em>
  </strong>
  features a deep, interconnected world that's a consistent joy to explore, with new surprises around every corner. However, this interconnected world isn't too far from the looping paths of
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , and there's an equal focus on providing players with memorable interactions with NPCs.

 <p>
  However, it's not just the overall atmosphere and focus on exploration that

  shares with

  Developed by From Software, the developers of the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a particularly unique Soulslike game. This is due to the fact that players are only given one weapon: the iconic katana. Thankfully, a well-crafted skill tree helps players scale with the game's rising difficulty curve, ensuring they feel a sense of progression throughout.

  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  is arguably one of the hardest Soulslikes available, with some truly challenging bosses. While its gameplay may be more restrictive (and somewhat more linear) than the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  focuses on mastery, tasking players with learning the ins and outs of their move set in order to succeed.

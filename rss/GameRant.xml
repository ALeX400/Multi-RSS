  Recent information from the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  beta has given players their first look at Xiuhcoatl, the Pyro Sovereign corroded by the Abyss, and the upcoming weekly boss in Version 5.3. Each region of Teyvat has two weekly bosses for
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players to conquer, usually tied to the Archon Quest or a major character's Story Quest. What started off with Dvalin and Boreas has since come to encompass ten weekly bosses, and the spectacle of these boss fights has certainly not diminished.

  Fontaine saw players square off against the All-Devouring Narwhal at the end of its storyline, before having them confront Arlecchino at the foothills of Mont Esus. While some boss fights are restricted to just the main quest, these Trounce Domains in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  allow players to relive the experience while farming important talent materials to upgrade their favorite characters. The first Trounce Domain for Natlan is expected to debut in Version 5.3, and will serve as the conclusion of the region's Archon Quest.

  According to HomDGCat, the Traveler will confront Xiuhcoatl himself, the Corroded Lord of the Primal Flame, who was once the Pyro Sovereign of Natlan. Thanks to footage obtained by Jokerverse, players can also view the boss area, the entrance to the Domain, and the in-game model of Xiuhcoatl. While it was initially assumed that Gosoythoth was mimicking the form of Xiuhcoatl, it seems that players will instead face off against the reanimated corpse of the Pyro Sovereign. From a gameplay perspective, Xiuhcoatl is expected to be on a higher tier of difficulty when compared to the other weekly bosses in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  .

  With hit points that rival that of The Knave in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , Xiuhcoatl is expected to be a tough fight at Level 90. While not much is known about his phases and mechanics, Xiuhcoatl will wield two colossal swords against the player, and the boss fight is implied to be quite intense. The story version of the fight will likely have the Pyro Traveler and Mavuika as playable characters, with the former receiving special bonuses to their ability kit for the duration of the fight. It remains to be seen if these combat bonuses will also translate into the Trounce Domain version as well.

 <p>
  It should be noted that only Lan Yan and Mavuika in

  benefit from Xiuhcoatl's talent materials in Version 5.3, as Citlali will instead use materials from The Knave. With the Spiral Abyss in January shaping up to be especially favorable to Mavuika,

  players will likely want to try their luck with Xiuhcoatl for the first three weeks of the month. Version 5.3 is set to launch on January 1, 2025.

      <title>How The Elder Scrolls 6 Can Benefit From ESO's Class Design</title>

  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  introduced a robust and flexible class system that departed from the open-ended but somewhat amorphous skill progression of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . The predefined classes such as Dragonknight, Sorcerer, Nightblade, and Templar, and their unique skill lines, each helped create distinct playstyles while allowing for customization through weapon skills, guild perks, and crafting.
  <strong>
   <em>
    TES6
   </em>
  </strong>
  could borrow heavily from this structured yet flexible approach and it would help the game deliver a more immersive role-playing experience.

 <p>
  By integrating hybrid archetypes, dynamic progression, and role-specific mechanics in class design principles,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  could evolve the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  formula without losing its core identity. The inclusion of lore-driven abilities, class-specific quests, and adaptable systems would not only enhance gameplay itself but will also have players coming back for more.

  One of
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  's greatest strengths is its emphasis on hybrid builds that enable players to mix and match class abilities with weapon and armor skills.
  <em>
   TES6
  </em>
  could adopt this by integrating skill lines that complement multiple playstyles. For instance, a Battle Mage archetype could combine destructive spells with heavy armor and a Shadow Archer archetype could mix stealth abilities with ranged attacks, much like
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  ’s Nightblade with a bow.

 <p>
  There’s also
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  's progression system that evolves with player choice, where unlocking new abilities in a skill tree also unlocks morphs or upgrades. So a Dragonknight-like class could start with generic flame-based abilities but evolve into distinct paths — perhaps one that specializes in tanking or a Pyromancer, focusing on high-damage spells.

 <p>
  The Psijic Order granting time-manipulation abilities or Vampire and Werewolf lines offering supernatural powers is a good example of this.
  <em>
   TES6
  </em>
  could also introduce classes that deeply tingle with the lore. This could be as simple as introducing some mechanical minions and traps through ancient ruins or spells that give a bow to dark allegiance.

 <p>
  <em>
   TES6

  could also pull from
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  's concept of active and passive abilities to make combat more engaging. Summoning shields, area-of-effect damage, or healing spells, for instance, could require strategic timing, similar to
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  's resource-based combat. On the passive ability end, there could be increased damage from sneak attacks or health regeneration under another condition. Similarly, group synergy and solo viability could come into play — a healer-type class could have self-healing when playing solo but offer party buffs in group settings.

 <p>
  However, all this wouldn’t be without its challenges, especially since
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  's class design is innovative and
  <em>
   TES6
  </em>
  must adapt it to fit the single-player RPG experience.
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  has to be really careful with balancing complexity as well because its online counterpart thrives on MMO mechanics. Therefore, all of this must be done while preserving the hallmark freedom of
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  games.

  Dynamic Ability Scaling and Specialization in TES6

 <p>
  A key innovation
  <em>

  could adopt from
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  is dynamic ability scaling, where skills adjust based on a player’s gear, stats, or play style. Here are two examples of this:

 <ul>
  <li>
   A fireball spell could deal higher damage when wielded by a mage with high Magicka, but a warrior could modify it to cause area stuns instead, aligning it with their tank role.
  </li>
  <li>
   Specialization trees within classes could allow
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls 6
   </em>
   players to morph their abilities over time. For example, a rogue-like character might initially gain a generic stealth bonus but later branch into assassin-style one-hit kills or scout-like utility skills like laying traps.

   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  reveal is just around the corner, and it seems as though the 2024 Game Awards is likely to be the stage for that reveal.

  Assuming
  <em>

  </em>
  will get another reveal at the 2024 Game Awards ceremony, it might benefit the game for the reveal to be more than just another cryptic and cinematic teaser. Instead, a substantial gameplay showcase could go a long way in addressing the diverse expectations surrounding

  , as it would offer fans a clearer picture of how the game would play and therefore build anticipation for it while also keeping Kojima's unique brand of showmanship intact.

  Death Stranding 2 Will More Than Likely Get Another Reveal at the 2024 Game Awards
 </h3>
 <p>
  More than likely,
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  fans can expect the game to get yet another reveal at the 2024 Game Awards, largely due to Hideo Kojima's strong connection with the event and its host, Geoff Keighley. Historically, Kojima has used the Game Awards as a platform to unveil major updates for his projects, including the announcement of the original
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  and the reveal of
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  at the 2022 ceremony. Kojima Productions has also always shown a pattern of revealing new details about its games in high-profile settings in order to generate hype. As a result, the 2024 Game Awards is likely already on the agenda for
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  .

  Hideo Kojima Has a Knack for Cryptic Marketing
 </h3>
 <p>
  While the prospect of more of
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  being revealed at the 2024 Game Awards ceremony is indeed exciting, there is a bit of an issue there that might make the reveal a bit less exciting than it could be. Specifically, Hideo Kojima’s reveals at the Game Awards are often a mix of cryptic storytelling and cinematic flair, as opposed to an exposition of his games' gameplay mechanics. These reveals generally lean heavily on cinematic storytelling, often using beautifully rendered cutscenes to set the tone for the game, with symbolic imagery and intentionally mysterious elements, leaving fans speculating about their meaning.

 <p>
  In other words, Kojima has proven he has a knack for cryptic marketing. His trailers often feature fragmented narratives, enigmatic dialogue, and unexplained phenomena, leaving fans to piece together the puzzle. Of course, this all eventually leads to frantic fan theories being posted online, which Kojima has noted in the past he enjoys being indirectly involved with on social media. Kojima also loves to emphasize the Hollywood-caliber actors (like Norman Reedus) and actresses involved in his games, and his preference for big "wow" moments in his reveals is ultimately reinforced by such talent. However,
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  should arguably reach further at the next Game Awards ceremony than what Kojima has been known to do in the past and showcase something different for a change.

  Death Stranding 2's Presumed 2024 Game Awards Reveal Needs to Show Gameplay
 </h3>
 <p>
  Something that Kojima has generally avoided in the past is showcasing gameplay for his games, but it makes sense considering his goal is to fuel hype rather than give fans an opportunity to preemptively criticize his games. Nevertheless, it could be a smart move for Hideo Kojima to showcase more of
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  's gameplay at the 2024 Game Awards for a number of reasons. Firstly, the
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  franchise has a unique gameplay loop that could benefit from a clearer understanding by the audience. Providing more gameplay could help fans grasp what has changed in the sequel, whether it’s the traversal mechanics, new abilities, or the evolution of the social strand system.

 <p>
  Secondly, the first
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  was a divisive experience. Some players adored its unconventional mechanics, while others were put off by the slow-paced, delivery-based gameplay. More gameplay footage could help demonstrate how
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  refines or transforms these mechanics, offering insight into how it might appeal to a broader audience while still retaining the distinctive features of the original. Finally, a deeper dive into gameplay at the next Game Awards ceremony would establish that
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  is not just a continuation but an expansion of the original concept. All of that said,
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  's presumed reveal at the 2024 Game Awards is bound to be an exciting one.

  The details of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
  </strong>
  Premium and SteelBook editions have left fans of physical games feeling left out. Despite referring to the game's most expensive version as a "physical" edition, the Premium SteelBook does not come with a disc but a digital download code inside the case. Some fans waiting for the February 18 release of
  <em>
   Avowed

  have taken to social media to express their disappointment with the lack of an actual physical copy.

  Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming fantasy RPG has stirred a lot of excitement among Xbox fans, but not all the news has gotten the reception the studio likely wanted. Comments from the game's developers suggest
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  could launch without a 60 FPS mode, and before that, Microsoft delayed its release from Fall 2024 to February 2025. Now, Xbox may be in hot water again as players cry out against the Premium SteelBook's missing disc.

  Microsoft revealed
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's three launch versions — Digital Standard, Digital Premium, and Premium Edition SteelBook — on November 14. It didn't take long for fans to notice that this third version, which costs $94.99, contains a digital game code instead of a disc, despite the announcement calling it a "physical" edition. It does have some physical elements, like the book itself and a map, but the use of a code means Xbox is not giving players the option to own a hard copy of the game. Some fans still say
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  is one of the most-anticipated games of 2025, but gamers who prefer physical media may be less excited about it now.

  The Premium Edition SteelBook costs just $5 more than the Premium package, and some players may find the SteelBook and its contents are enough to justify that. Others, however, are less pleased with there being no physical game in the physical edition. Fans took to Twitter to call Xbox out for overlooking gamers who like to play physical games. Others said there's little point to a booklet if it doesn't contain a disc. While
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  may avoid some common problems in modern gaming, it seems an over-reliance on virtual media is not one of them.

  <em>

  is not the first game to have a digital-only release, but that may worsen the issue, not excuse it. Notably, the PlayStation 5 Pro does not have a disc drive, which has been a source of much frustration for Sony fans. The release of the Xbox Series X Digital suggests Microsoft could be leaning in the same direction. With so many games and consoles forgoing support for physical versions, some players worry that this is part of a larger trend marking the end of physical gaming as a whole.

  It's unclear if

  will receive a disc version after launch or whether Xbox will stop making disc-supporting consoles altogether. However, any move in that direction is not a welcome change for all fans.

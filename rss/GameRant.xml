  A creative
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  player has created a mod that adds chalk, giving Mojang's sandbox an interesting artistic twist. The mod also allows
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players to customize decorations, find new items and blocks, and explore new creative possibilities.

  <em>

  has an impressive diversity of blocks that players can use for construction and decoration purposes. While cobblestone and wood are the most basic options, there are other choices as well, such as the dyed terracotta variations that
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  has.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  also has blocks such as Prismarine, Blackstone, and Diorite, which in addition to having a differentiated texture, can be crafted into different block variations that players use to bring their constructions to life. Showing how
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  could take things even further, one player has made a mod that draws attention to its variety of customization features.

 <p>
  Reddit user BIT-root has created a mod that adds chalk to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . By installing the mod named Arts and Crafts,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players find chalk blocks high up in mountain biomes. They can also craft white chalk using two blocks of Calcite and two of Gypsum, a new block added by the mod. Players can make chalk sticks by placing a block in a Stonecutter. With the chalk sticks,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players can color the blocks in 16 colors. Using the chalk sticks leaves Chalk Dust on the blocks, with
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players able to choose from the 33 available patterns.

  Other

  players have praised BIT-root's work, with some pointing out how chalk would be a nice way of implementing more pastel tones into the game. After all, although

   Minecraft
  </em>
  has a significant number of wood colors and dyes, it is still limited. With this mod, the player expands

   Open-world gaming
  </strong>
  has become all the rage in modern times. With gaming hardware getting better and better day by day, open worlds have slowly become the norm in mainstream gaming due to how accessible the sandbox style of games really is. Players absolutely adore the freedom that comes from traversing a vast and dense open world that is full to the brim with content.

  <em>
   Open-world gaming has become all the rage in modern times, and it's easy to see why so many players love how this genre explores numerous settings that strike their fancy. Fantasy, sci-fi, and modern-day settings are all great backdrops for open-world games to thrive in, but there are times when players would like a touch of history
  </em>
  <em>
   to spice up these games. Not only does it make these sandboxes feel authentic, but some would argue that it serves as an educational glimpse into the past that becomes all the more memorable because of how interactive things are. The historical open-world games continue to jump into the gaming world, and a few more of them have made their way onto this list as well.

 <p>
  The fact that Ubisoft heard the public demands of fans and decided to bring
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  back to its roots is something that players absolutely loved, and the conversation around
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Mirage
   </em>
  </strong>
  made it clear that fans just wanted the simple assassination gameplay of the series back instead of having to deal with intensive RPG elements and less-involved parkour. This game brings players back in time to the city of Baghdad, letting them enjoy some classic
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  gameplay with a fresh coat of paint.

 <p>
  Despite the game's unfocused narrative making the story hard to follow or be invested in at times, that shouldn't stop players from enjoying the core gameplay of this title, coupled with a fresh look at a setting that has been recreated with painstaking detail. The city of Baghdad is a joy to explore, with the game making it a point to educate players about the culture and landmarks of the time in optional lore that they can access to broaden their understanding of this city during the 9th century.

  Vice City is clearly based on Miami, with the game taking place in the mid-1980s. Exploring the city and all its retro goodness makes for a great time and is one of the biggest reasons why players love
  <em>
   GTA: Vice City,
  </em>
  and rank it as one of the best games in the series. While exploring this beloved city with a fresh coat of paint in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  will be a blast, players should keep in mind that the new game takes place in the modern era, meaning that a lot of changes will have taken place in the nearly 40 years that will have passed. For that reason alone, it's worth going back to
  <em>
   Vice City
  </em>
  for a glimpse of how this setting looked many decades ago.

  When it comes to playing video games set in historical time periods, pretty much every
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game makes the cut.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Odyssey
   </strong>
  </em>
  is no exception to this golden rule, with this title encompassing the oldest time period any game in the series has taken place in by around 400 years. This sets the stage for what is easily one of the most unique
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games to date, even if the lack of the series' staples and the bloated open world didn't sit right with some die-hard fans.

  Still, that should take nothing away from the amazing detail in the world and how it lets players explore Ancient Greece to their hearts' content. As players progress through the ambitious story and engage in numerous combat encounters, they can slowly learn about the state of Greece during this time period, and the Peloponnesian War that shaped the future of this region.

  Most people unfamiliar with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mafia

  </strong>
  wrote it off as a historical

  It helps that this game recently received a remake that serves as the best way to experience it.
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  is a simple open-world game with a riveting tale centered around the elusive mafia. It's been a fantasy for everyone to roleplay as a member of the mafia after watching
  <em>
   The Godfather
  </em>
  , after all, and the
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  series does the best job of simulating that experience.

  The game offers a sprawling open-world map of London, with a wealth of historical landmarks to explore and important figures to meet. The game's intricate storyline and attention to historical detail make it a standout title in the series, and it's a shame that this game didn't sell that well.

  The open world is pretty diverse, featuring a mix of urban and rural environments such as swamps, bayous, and city streets.
  <em>
   Mafia 3
  </em>
  's depiction of the Civil Rights Movement and its exploration of themes such as racism and police brutality make it a unique and thought-provoking entry in the genre, even if the repetitive open-world activities do get somewhat grating after a point.

  The
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors

  However, Musou games can be engaging if players approach these titles with proper expectations, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dynasty Warriors 9
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a great example of the same. It's the first open-world game in the series that has attracted a mixed reception, but there's no denying that the gameplay of
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors 9
  </em>
  can be pretty fun when everything clicks.

   <em>
    The Saboteur
   </em>
  </strong>
  was developed by Pandemic Studios and is easily one of the most underrated games around. The way in which players can literally inject color into the world by liberating areas makes for an immersive and thoroughly enjoyable gameplay loop.

    Mount &amp; Blade

  was developed by TaleWorlds Entertainment and is one of the most comprehensive and accurate historical open worlds around, which is amazing given that its world isn't really specified outright. However, the medieval setting rings true in every way, making this game quite incredible indeed, despite the fairly lackluster visuals.

  After a year-long hiatus,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  decided to shake things up and turn into a proper open-world RPG that went all the way back in the timeline. This led to the creation of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Origins
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which detailed the rise of the Assassins.

  Roaming through Ancient Egypt is a blast, and it's easy to see why many people considered this game to be a return to form for the series.
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Origins
  </em>
  has set a new template for the series, which has consistently proven why its historical settings are so riveting.

  made huge waves when it was released on the Dreamcast. As one of the most expensive games ever made, expectations were high for this ambitious title. Unfortunately, the game's enormous budget proved to be over-ambitious, as

  and its sequel didn't disappoint. It told a great story in a fleshed-out world, and it's a shame that the third game was such a disappointment.

  It would be impossible to talk about games with historical settings without mentioning the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series. Ubisoft's trademark franchise has explored various eras in history, but most games have yet to reach the heights of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The game felt downright revolutionary when it was launched in 2009. Taking place during the Renaissance in Italy, the setting of this game elevates
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 2
  </em>
  to a whole new level.

  Rockstar Games has created several amazing open-world games that have defined and re-defined the genre with each successive entry. However, none of these titles have the stellar narrative that's present in

  Ubisoft has a poor reputation for copy-pasting mechanics across a host of games. As a result, most people wrote off
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry Primal
   </em>
  </strong>
  as nothing more than another rehash of the established
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  formula.

 <p>
  It's a shame since
  <em>
   Far Cry Primal
  </em>
  definitely had a ton of things going for it. Its prehistoric setting was especially notable, with the innovative gameplay changes arising, as a result, being quite entertaining to play around with.

  Starry Studios'
  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  is soon joining the competitive survival game scene, hoping to stand out with its unique world design, exploration features, and crunchy combat mechanics, among other things. Certainly,
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is chock-full of interesting ideas, which may help it carve out a space in such a crowded market.

  For everything that
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is doing to set itself apart, it also seems to wear its influences on its sleeve. Naturally, it has quite a bit in common with many of the best survival and crafting games on the market, taking cues from titles like
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   ARK: Survival Evolved
  </em>
  , with a gameplay loop centered on staples like base-building, resource management, and a gradual power creep, but it also seems to be drawing from popular games in other genres. Over its three-year-plus development cycle, it's clear that
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  has looked to the AAA scene for some inspiration, which contributes to the game's unique, melting-pot style.

 <p>
  Perhaps the most obvious point of comparison for
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  would be the
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  series.
  <em>
  </em>
  Both
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  games have often been called "
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  with guns," and while this is a somewhat reductive description, there's some truth to it:
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  is a third-person shooter with a strong emphasis on movement and evasion, folded into a co-op RPG framework with a focus on crafting and steady progression.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":652} -->
 <p>
  Spending some time with
  <em>
   Once
  </em>
  <em>
   Human
  </em>
  , the similarities to
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  are plain to see, as Starry Studios clearly focused on developing third-person combat mechanics that incorporate movement and stamina management, more than pinpoint accuracy or cover utilization.
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  's co-op gameplay, gear system, and even enemy design are also reminiscent of the
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  series.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1025} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  On the subject of visuals and atmosphere,
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  also looks to have a bit in common with
  <em>
   Ghostwire Tokyo
  </em>
  :
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  's aesthetic, blending mystical concepts like a surreal spiritual world with more urban design elements, feels highly reminiscent of Tango Gameworks' 2022 FPS.
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  's tendency toward weird horror may also remind some players of Remedy's projects, especially during the game's intro, which feels eerily similar to
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  's unsettling contrast of austere corporate science and otherworldly phenomena.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Then there are the many miscellaneous parallels between
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  and other AAA games. The post-apocalyptic setting feels inspired by something like
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  (especially given
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  's motorcycle mechanics); the MMO elements will surely be familiar to fans of titles like
  <em>
   The Division
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ; even the Deviant capturing system bears a resemblance to
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  or similar monster-catching games.
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  has been in development for a little over three years, so drawing upon relatively contemporary games for inspiration is certainly not out of the question. Whether this will help or harm the game is another subject, though.

 <p>
  As previously mentioned, survival games are a dime a dozen these days, so
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  will need to be more than just a hodgepodge of the industry's hottest games to be properly competitive. As evidenced by 2023's biggest disaster
  <em>
   The Day Before
  </em>
  , there's a fine line between inspiration and imitation, at least in the eyes of audiences. The last thing that
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  needs to be thought of as 'yet another co-op survival RPG,' pulling excessively from other popular titles.
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  's combat mechanics, world design, and side activities are all fun so far—hopefully, Starry Studios can keep the game feeling fresh when it launches in earnest this July.

      <title>5 Survival Games With The Best Gunplay, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/survival-games-best-gunplay/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Survival games have become quite popular, with the rise of indie gaming coupled with a pressing need for players to seek out a rewarding gameplay loop that keeps things fresh yet engaging leading to the mechanics of this genre becoming as engaging as they come. While the usual loop of scrounging around for supplies and struggling to live in a harsh and hostile world can be pretty engaging, players would want something else to accompany this gameplay loop after a point.

 <p>
  Thankfully, many great survival games pair this engaging gameplay with shooting mechanics that feel right at home and make for some tense scenarios that players survive by the skin of their teeth. The gunplay in these games is pretty engaging to deal with and does a great job of adding some much-needed action to a genre where the slow pace can be rather grating to deal with, after a point.

 <p>
  The rudimentary graphics of
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  don't really get in the way of this title's gameplay, showing just how solid the core survival loop is. The community for this title may not be massive by any stretch of the imagination, but the players who are invested in this game love pumping in some hours as they try to survive for as long as possible while finding ways to protect themselves from zombies and other hostile players.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1068} -->

 <p>
  So, given how simplistic this game can feel at times, players will be more than surprised to find out that the gunplay in this title is solid and a huge part of what makes the game so enjoyable. Players should make it a priority to seek out a good ranged weapon to keep them safe when the going gets tough, which is something that gets easier the more they become adept at playing the game and accomplishing its many challenges.

  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  is a nerve-wracking indie survival game that has been through its fair share of ups and downs. Its systems and story content have been reworked over and over again, with the shooting mechanics in this game also seeing some tweaks in the form of skills that players can invest in to make things easier for themselves in this department. Players who get their hands on guns may find them perfect for hunting and self-defense purposes, but there are some things to keep in mind if people don't want to be obliterated by the hostile wildlife that they can encounter.

 <p>
  Players who want to make the most of the gunplay in this title should increase their Rifle, Revolver, and Gunsmithing skills at all costs. Both firearms are pretty useful, with the revolver letting players repel predators while the rife is great for hunting purposes and taking out hostile creatures from afar. Aiming can be tricky, but players who understand how these weapons work in the game can take out enemies from a safe distance and increase their chances of surviving in such a harsh landscape.

  <em>
   Rust
  </em>
  is a game that most people know for its organic multiplayer moments as players either band their resources together to survive or fight against each other to get the best spoils. There was a time when gunplay in this game was pretty rudimentary and nowhere near the best part of the game, but all of this changed with an update that changed how shooting works in this game.

 <p>
  Recoil has been reworked considerably to make shooting more fair instead of favoring people who've identified the patterns present in past versions of the game. This, coupled with various additions one would expect in any modern FPS (such as hit indicators and crosshairs), ensures that players can have a great time using weapons in the game as they engage with more modern FPS mechanics instead of the dated ones that encouraged players to find makeshift solutions instead of playing the game as intended.

  No one expected
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  to become such a huge phenomenon at launch, with many players assuming that this game was just infringing on
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  's brand name. Instead, the mechanics of this game were pretty sound, and it's clear that the Early Access status of this title means that its gameplay is bound to undergo some major changes, with the shooting mechanics of this title being pretty solid as is despite there being plenty of room for improvement.

  There are many weapons that players can choose from with varying degrees of rarity, ranging from handguns to rocket launchers and everything in between. These weapons come in varying rarity modes, with the shooting action trying to capture more of an arcade-y feel instead of trying to promote realism, which is what most people would expect in a title where players pump a ton of bullets into cute critters that they can capture to strengthen their base.

  There's no denying that Bethesda games have wowed players with their amazing open-world design and environmental storytelling. However, there's one aspect that these games have faltered time and time again, and that's the combat mechanics. While
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  took a positive step in this regard, the lack of feedback in combat coupled with some broken builds meant that players could game the system in no time.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":917} -->

 <p>
  So, players were pleasantly surprised to see that the gunplay in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  was pretty engaging and did a great job of making enemies feel threatening and less robotic. With Survival Mode, players can have a great time managing their well-being while engaging in tense shootouts where they only have a limited selection of weaponry and ammunition to rely on if they wish to take out these foes efficiently at range.

  Mixing elements of survival, open-world, and monster-capturing gameplay,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  has established itself as a unique title even among its numerous competitors. Many game-changing ideas for
  <em>
   Palworld

  , like the upcoming Sakurajima update, aim to ensure that it retains its distinctive identity while giving players more engaging content. However, one mechanic that is likely to come in the future may be met with divisive reactions, depending on its implementation.

  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  has many creatures called Pals with unique abilities and varying power levels that players can defeat or capture. Although they can be useful in many ways, players who repeatedly encounter those they don't need often kill them. While the developers have stated that exterminating Pals is illegal, the only time players are punished for the act is when butchering them in front of NPCs. But that may change in the future as there is a plan for an update that makes NPCs attack the player upon witnessing the killing of any in-game creature.

  has many materials to farm, and one of the easiest ways of doing so is by killing wild Pals or butcher the ones they own. Having NPCs act aggressively toward such actions could lead to difficulties such as:

 <p>
  Although such a change has its downsides, it also has some benefits. Having the players be more careful means they must be more aware of their surroundings, giving extra depth to battles. Being hounded by hostile NPCs can also be an advantage, as players can use their best powerful combat Pals to engage and farm materials that normally drop from human enemies. Although it will still mean that materials that come from the creatures themselves will be slightly more difficult to obtain, there is at least a proper trade-off.

  How the NPC Aggression Mechanic Can Change Palworld
 </h3>
 <p>
  Major
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  updates such as the Sakurajima patch for June 27 show that the developers intend to keep the game interesting by introducing new mechanics and features. Should the future ever include one where NPCs are hostile towards players for killing Pals, it may change certain gameplay aspects. For example, it could lead to more human characters roaming around the overworld instead of being stationed at certain spots. While there are faction enemies that players encounter, they are already established as hostile from the start.

  Having seemingly peaceful NPCs traversing the islands can make the world feel more immersive but also more dangerous. Their possible aggression towards the player can make combat more difficult but also engaging. This type of change would require Pocket Pair to balance where and how these NPCs might spawn to avoid overbearing combat, making it hard to implement until all possible issues are noticed and fixed.

  Such an update to the aggression mechanic could also lead to the introduction of new equipment.
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  has many outfits and weapons that help give players the edge they need during battle. With NPCs becoming hostile to witnessing the killing of Pals, Pocket Pair can create new items that prevent the players from being detected during the act. This can effectively introduce things like silencer attachments or bombs that confuse or blind targets to avoid a criminal status.

 <p>
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  has a lot of mechanics that separate it from its monster-capturing competitors, but an update to its NPC behavior could help further cement its unique identity. Pocket Pair has already considered implementing such a change in the future, but it will llikely require a lot of time and testing to ensure that it does not disrupt the game's overall balance.

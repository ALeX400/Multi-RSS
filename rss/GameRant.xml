  A developer working on the upcoming PlayStation 5 console exclusive
  <em>
   <strong>
    Phantom Blade Zero
   </strong>
  </em>
  has made some harsh comments about the Xbox platform, stating that "nobody" needs it. First announced at the 2023 PlayStation Showcase,
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  is the first console title by Beijing-based development studio S-GAME, targeting PS5 and PC.

 <p>
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  is also S-GAME's biggest, most ambitious project yet, with the studio only having released two smaller games before it - one for mobile and the other for PC. Despite S-GAME's presumptive inexperience, though, the fast-paced samurai action in
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  's gameplay trailers has piqued the curiosity of many players, and it even closed out the 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase.
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  has undoubtedly put S-GAME on the map, but a lot of players on the Xbox side have questioned why their platform will be excluded at launch.

 <p>
  This question was reportedly answered at the recent ChinaJoy 2024 games conference during an interview with an anonymous S-GAME developer. According to Brazilian gaming website GamePlaysCassi, the developer in question allegedly said "nobody needs this platform" when asked about the lack of an Xbox port for
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  . They further noted that Xbox consoles aren't popular in Asia, and building games for them is difficult due to Microsoft's overloaded ecosystem. After the recent Xbox Series X/S price hikes in Japan, a turnaround in regional popularity seems even more improbable for the platform.

 <p>
  The remarks are quite scathing, but it's worth mentioning that the developer's quote could be a mistranslation. However, it doesn't change the fact that there is a worrying trend of Asian games consistently skipping the Xbox platform in favor of PlayStation, Nintendo, and PC. Another recent example of the same is
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's Xbox version being delayed, inadvertently making the highly-anticipated Chinese action game a PS5 console exclusive at launch. While
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  never confirmed an Xbox release, S-GAME might not be considering the prospect at all if the developer's comments are to be believed.
 </p>

 <p>
  Given the Microsoft platform's dwindling market share in the East, many Asian studios likely don't find Xbox ports economically feasible for their business. This avoidance can also be noticed at bigger companies like Square Enix, which has yet to bring blockbuster games like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   FF16
  </em>
  to Xbox.
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  doesn't have a release window yet, but Xbox fans can only hope that the platform accrues enough popularity to warrant a port by the time it launches.

  Exploration Versus Missions
 </h3>
 <p>
  For those playing on a PC, it is possible to cheat a little bit and use console commands to find traders. However, not all players want to use console commands while playing. There are two ways that players can find all the traders. The first way is by
  <strong>
   traveling along main roads.
  </strong>
  Eventually, you'll come across a trader. However, this method isn't particularly efficient.

 <p>
  <strong>
   The best way of finding traders is by completing missions.
  </strong>
  On day one, work toward completing the Trader Quest challenge. Open up your challenges menu and toggle the quest so it's active. For this quest, you will need to do a few basic things like crafting, harvesting, and using certain items. Completing each of these challenges will award you with some XP.
  <strong>
   Once you've completed all the challenges, you'll be given the location of a trader to visit
  </strong>
  . If you are new and don't know the map's layout, this is the most efficient way of finding the first trader.

  Trader Missions

 <p>
  When you speak to the trader, you'll be able to activate
  <strong>
   missions
  </strong>
  . You can choose a mission that best suits your playstyle. There are fetch missions, clear missions, buried treasure missions, and some other more difficult missions. Once you've earned enough mission points, you'll be able to do a special mission with the trader that will involve you making your way over to the next trader. You can see how many tier points you have by looking in the quest menu.

     The points you earn will depend on the missions you do, and each tier gives the same number of points. So, a one-tier mission will award you with one point, a two-tier mission will award you with two points, and so on.

  To unlock the mission to find the second trader, you'll need

  This angry trader is hostile, unwelcoming, and overall an unpleasant person. However, there's something strangely compelling about this man. Things may be different in random gen or custom gen worlds, but in pre-built worlds, trader
  <strong>
   Rekt can be found in the forest region.
  </strong>

  Like with all traders, he will have a nice selection of random goods. But
  <strong>
   his specialty is Food and Seeds.
  </strong>
  Since vending machines can be found throughout the map and inside each trader's settlement, his food selection is somewhat obsolete. However, for those who enjoy farming, this trader can be very handy.

  Trader Jen is normally located in the
  <strong>
   burnt forest.
  </strong>
  She's a friendly and welcoming person who is eager to engage with you.
  <strong>
   Her specialty is medicine,
  </strong>
  and she will sell most types of meds and pain relief items.

 <p>
  This is incredibly useful during the early days, when things like bandages and antibiotics are scarce. She is also more likely to have medical magazines than the other traders. She's the best trader for players who are looking to stock up on meds before horde night.

  <strong>
   Bob resides in the desert
  </strong>
  , and is the go-to trader for
  <strong>
   vehicles and tools.
  </strong>
  He may not be all that useful in the early game, since most tools and vehicle components are too costly for low-level players. However, for those who make it through the first few weeks, Bob becomes a very useful trader.

  Crafting vehicles makes traveling around the map much easier. Each vehicle also has additional storage space which allows players to loot more while exploring various POIs.

  Trader Hugh is the
  <strong>
   snow biome trader, and specializes in all things weaponry.
  </strong>
  From magazines to guns, if it's weapons you want, then Hugh's the one to visit. Like Bob, Hugh's stock isn't cheap. Weapons and ammo are very valuable, and therefore sell for quite a lot of Dukes.

 <p>
  While there's no harm in browsing his inventory, players who want to buy guns should start saving their Dukes early on. That said, by the time most players reach Hugh, they will already have come across a handful of decent firearms.

  <strong>
   Daring Adventurer

  is a perk that will increase the overall quality of the items being sold by the traders. Not only that, but this perk will also increase the quality of rewards you get for completing trader missions. This is a great perk to invest in early on, as it will enable you to obtain higher level items early on in your play through.

      The rumors may not be entirely true; based on the source, it's possible that only the PS5 version of Project Rene was cancelled.

 <p>
  The world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been busy with the recent release of the Lovestruck DLC. Maxis isn’t ready to rest just yet, as Project Rene is also in the works. The upcoming game won’t replace
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , and instead, the two will co-exist. Gamers have gotten a sneak preview of Project Rene which is planned for release on PC and mobile.

 <p>
  However, players who are anticipating Project Rene may be in for a world of disappointment. Rumors suggest that Project Rene has been canceled. These rumors are based on job listings online, which have led to lots of speculation among fans. Although the rumor is concerning, it would be wise for players to wait for official information before jumping to any conclusions.

 <p>
  The rumors began when Twitter user @SimmerBerkay shared a screenshot of a Maxis worker's LinkedIn profile stating that they had been working on Project Rene until its cancelation on PS5. This could mean that the game has been canceled wholesale, or just the PS5 port was canned.

 <p>
  The LinkedIn profile opens up many questions. One of the biggest questions is whether Project Rene is supposed to be the next numbered entry in The Sims series. A cancelation of Project Rene could mean the end of
  <em>
   The Sims 5
  </em>
  , which would be a pity.

 <p>
  It should be noted that there are still other LinkedIn profiles that state they are still working on Project Rene, so nothing is certain yet. Furthermore, EA has announced multiple layoffs in 2023 and 2024, so this may be another attempt at streamlining the workforce. Players will have to wait for more official information from Maxis before they draw any conclusions.

 <h3 id="the-future-of-the-sims-franchise">
  The Future of The Sims Franchise
 </h3>
 <p>
  Project Rene’s cancelation would leave the future of the franchise up in the air, should it turn out to be true. One possibility is that Maxis may continue supporting
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  as a live service project indefinitely. This could be done by continually providing it with new expansions and content. As seen with the recent Lovestruck DLC, there are still plenty of ideas left for the game.

 <p>
  Even without new content from Maxis, the game could be kept alive by the host of mods that have been released by the very active
  <em>
   Sims 4
  </em>
  modding community. Some of the game's best content has been created by hardworking fans dedicated to improving the game, and it’s unlikely they’ll stop any time soon.

  If Project Rene is canceled, it wouldn’t be the first game in the genre to get the boot in 2024. Earlier this year, the highly anticipated title
  <em>
   Life by You
  </em>
  got canceled. According to developers, even with more time, they would not be able to craft the game they envisioned.

 <p>
  Fortunately, even if Project Rene is canceled, life simulation fans can still look forward to
  <em>
   Paralives,
  </em>
  which is slated for early release in 2025. The game is heavily inspired by
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  , which could make it a valuable release regardless of Project Rene's fate. As of November 2023, the game earns over $35,000 per month on Patreon.

 <p>
  Project Rene hasn’t been without its controversies. In response to leaks from the game, some fans have complained that the art style looks far too cartoonish. Others are upset that there might be a mobile port, which leads some to believe the game will be less ambitious than expected.

  It’s been a while since players have gotten official information regarding Project Rene which is concerning. For more information on the world of
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  and possibly Project Rene, players should keep an eye on
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  official YouTube channel, which offers updates on
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  and occasionally gives sneak previews of Project Rene.

  A recent leak from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  is teasing the return of one of the game's most popular characters as part of a new event in Version 2.5. The sci-fi RPG from HoYoverse features a wide variety of characters for players to meet throughout its three fully playable worlds.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  currently features more than fifty playable characters within its roster, with another three new characters set to join the game with the launch of Version 2.5. However, one particular group of characters stands out as one of the RPG's most beloved.

 <p>
  The Stellaron Hunters were an instant hit with many fans following the initial debut of
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . Players are first introduced to Kafka and Silver Wolf through the game's opening sequence, showing off the duo of Stellaron Hunters infiltrating the Herta Space Station.
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  would later add Blade during the story of the Xianzhou Luofu, and Firefly would become an instant hit among fans following her debut with the game's newest world, Penacony. Now, one member of the Stellaron Hunters is planned to make an appearance in
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  's next update.

  Honkai: Star Rail Leak Teases Silver Wolf's Return in Version 2.5
 </h2>
 <p>
  A new leak shared by prominent HoYoverse leaker HomDGCat is teasing the return of a fan-favorite Stellaron Hunter during Version 2.5. According to the leak, Silver Wolf will make an appearance during an event featured as a part of the upcoming Version 2.5. The leak shows off several pieces of dialogue with Silver Wolf, suggesting she may be involved with
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's previously leaked "Luminary Wardance" event. The leak does not confirm whether Silver Wolf will appear in-person or through the mini-game featured in the event.

 <p>
  Silver Wolf's return in Version 2.5 was not the only thing leaked by HomDGCat about the events for
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  's next update. The leaker suggested that Version 2.5 may be a light update for
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  fans, currently only expected to feature one "major event" and one "minor event" during the patch. Previous leaks have also hinted that Version 2.5 will bring a pair of new Planar Ornament sets to
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , potentially teasing an update to the Simulated Universe. Version 2.5 has been confirmed to be launching on September 10.

 <p>
  While fans can already look ahead to Version 2.5, the recent launch of
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's Version 2.4 brought plenty of new content. The return to the Xianzhou Luofu saw the introduction of two brand-new characters, with five-star character Yunli's debut and the new form for starter character March 7th. Version 2.4 will also feature multiple re-runs throughout its duration, with Huohuo appearing with Yunli and Sparkle during the second half alongside the release of Jiaoqiu.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  players will likely get to see a familiar face soon enough with Silver Wolf's return in Version 2.5.

 <p>
  Get To Work is the earliest expansion and it shows. The main focus of this pack is interactive careers. It introduces a doctor, detective, and scientist career. While they are fun to play, and the concept of following one's sims to work was unique at this point, they have struggled to remain enjoyable. The detective career, in particular, was incredibly glitchy, which meant many players struggled to progress. While some of these bugs have been patched, others still remain in the game.

 <p>
  The pack also included the first occult Sims in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , aliens, as well as the ability to run a retail store. Later attempts at occult sims have revealed flaws in the way aliens were implemented, which takes a little shine off them. Retail stores have improved over time, with extra things to make and sell, but they have also been superseded in many ways by the introduction of yard tables. The key difference is that the yard sale tables allow sims to sell their items easily without the hassle of owning a separate lot and store.

  Released in July of 2022,
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  High School Years does exactly what it says on the tin. It focuses heavily on fleshing out the teen Sim experience, allowing players to control their Sims while they're at high school in much the same way that the Get to Work and Get Famous do with adult Sims while they are at work. Given that those two rank among the very worst
  <em>
   Sims 4
  </em>
  expansion packs, it should come as little surprise to learn that
  <em>
   High School Years
  </em>
  doesn't really provide players with too much to write home about either.

 <p>
  To its credit, Copperdale is far from a bad world, and some of the Build/Buy items included with the expansion do an excellent job of capturing the teen vibe. Likewise, some of the new Create-a-Sim options in High School Years are also pretty decent, though aren't quite enough to fully justify the price of admission. That said, for hardcore fans of the series, younger players, or those interested in reliving their own high school vicariously through their Sim, it may be worth a look.

 <p>
  Many players had high hopes for Get Famous but it can be a polarizing pack. The world of Del Sol Valley is beautiful but is also very small and feels limiting. The game also introduced interactive acting and content creation careers as well as a fame system. The fame system is slightly erratic at times and can be annoying. While the interactive career is fun at first, it can quickly lose its shine as players repeat the same jobs over and over again.

 <p>
  There are also numerous high-end expensive items with this pack. While it's fun to build an opulent mansion, their use in most normal builds is limited. It does have some quirky features though, including the money vault, but for day-to-day gameplay, unless players are very much into the fame system, this pack is unlikely to see much use.

  The strongest features of Get Together are the club system and the beautiful world of Windenburg. The club system is one of the most versatile and underused systems in the game. It allows players to form groups of sims and set club goals. This means they can gather up to 8 sims in one place by calling a meeting. It's also possible to set the dress code and decide which activities and behavior will be encouraged or discouraged.

 <p>
  There are so many uses for clubs, including boosting social needs, building skills and even calling sims to a secret underground basement, where they will spend eternity painting masterpieces. Get Together is a great pack and often underrated but earns its place here due to the fact that many of its features are often not used for regular gameplay unless players utilize the clubs. Windenburg, however, remains one of the very best worlds in the game, as well as the largest.

  The Snowy Escape expansion was released in late 2020 and is built around winter snowsports including snowboarding, skiing, and sledding. It also includes Mt. Komorebi, a Japanese mountain inspired by Mount Fuji as well as several new types of wintery weather. For those wondering, players don't need to have Seasons installed to experience the latter.

 <p>
  As well as winter sports, the pack also provides players with the Salaryperson career as well as several other Japan-inspired elements including items, lot assignments, and music. For those who love the holiday season or simply enjoy learning more about Japanese culture, Snowy Escape is a solid pick.

  The Cats &amp; Dogs expansion introduces four-legged fur friends into the game. Its biggest addition is the cats and dogs themselves, though players can also join the new interactive Veterinary career, which sees them run a veterinary clinic and live in Brindleton Bay; one of many players' favorite worlds.

  The cats and dogs themselves are really quite adorable and have great customization options to boot; something that will no doubt be appealing to animal-loving players. While this is certainly a solid expansion though, anyone who doesn’t really want a pet may want to take give it a miss. The world is beautiful and the catalog items are versatile, but the furry friends are definitely the main attraction here.

  Even though many fans had been hoping for a horse-related pack for a while before it was announced, it was actually one of the expansions that took the longest to be released. The Horse Ranch expansion only went live in the summer of 2023, nearly nine years after
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  base game.

  This pack added horses, mini sheep, and mini goats to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Unfortunately, the small animals are more of an extra, but the horses are quite complex creatures. The Horse Ranch Create-a-Sim menu is quite extensive, and it has nearly limitless customization options. There are a lot of gameplay features that players can explore; there are four horse skills, two human skills, and a whole bunch of ranch-related activities to indulge in. And, in a way, taking care of foals and horses in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  feels much more in-depth compared to pets from the
  <em>
   Cats &amp; Dogs
  </em>
  expansion pack.

  The For Rent expansion pack received mixed feedback from the community when it was first release due to a series of glitches, but the developers have been working hard to fix it and improve it with each patch. Besides this hiccup in the road, it's a great pack that adds fundamental features to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Like the Seasons pack, it brings mechanics to the table that will be hard to live without once players have had the opportunity to experience them.

 <p>
  Players who enjoy management games can roleplay a landlord, taking care of their rental units. Whereas fans who prefer to play legacy challenges can incorporate residential rental lot types to their gameplay to keep family closeby. On top of this, it adds tons of Create-a-Sim and Build Mode content to the table as well.

  The Lovestruck expansion pack incentivizes players to explore love in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . This pack adds Ciudad Enamorada to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , which is the perfect place for Sims to find love, rekindle a connection, or even repair a fading attraction.

  It introduces a complex attraction system that players can customize with turn-ons and turn-offs, and it allows Sims to deepen their romantic connections by putting on flirty costumes, WooHoo'ing in all sorts of locations with the romantic blanket, and going on more intricate dates. On top of this, it includes the Romance Skill, which makes it much easier to seduce others. Unfortunately, even though this pack adds interesting gameplay possibilities, it would've worked better as a game pack rather than an expansion.

  The City Living expansion brought the additions of apartments, work-from-home careers, festivals, and the city of San Myshuno. Each of these can have a drastic effect on a player's gameplay. The apartment system allows players to pay rent to live in an apartment, paying upfront only for the furniture. This adds a new element to the game, especially for those who only use the lot traits to live in a fixer-upper home. It can also make a Sim's starter capital go much further.

 <p>
  City Living’s work-from-home careers, Critic and Social Media Influencer, have also stayed relevant for longer than other careers. While all interactive careers can be repetitive, these offer a few nice perks and fit in well with life in the city. Even if players choose to venture away from the city, the food stalls, festivals, and community lots make it a great place to visit for a change of pace.

  The "Living" packs may not be to everybody's tastes, but they do provide players with plenty of bang for their buck when compared to some of the other expansions. 2021's Cottage Living is certainly no exception, bringing with it a new world that was inspired by the UK countryside as well as numerous animals, objects, and traits.

 <p>
  Those looking for a quiet life with no alarms and no surprises will love what Henford-on-Bagley has to offer, as too will nature and animal lovers. Players can indulge all of their naturistic desires if they wish, while also getting to know some of the many new NPCs like Agatha and Agnes Crumplebottom and the Chopra family.

  Discover University is arguably one of the strongest packs we've seen in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . The pack is tailored toward the entire experience of University life and as such includes a huge amount of detail. Players can take out loans, live on or off campus, join clubs, and participate in college events. While classes aren't interactive, players do have a lot of control over their Sims' timetables and there are extra work-based activities to balance too.

 <p>
  The gameplay is expansive in this pack, with many new activities to engage in on campus. Build and Buy is limited but solid and the Create-a-Sim items are very versatile. Overall, the pack offers an amazing experience for anyone who loves student-life gameplay.

  Despite releasing almost a full decade on from the base version of the game Growing Together remains a lot of fun and stays true to the core values of the series. It focuses on the enjoyment that can be derived from raising a Sim from childhood to old age, introducing plenty of great new Create a Sim and Build Mode items to help further enrich the experience. It also brings with it the bustling town of San Sequoia and the influential Robles family.

  The expansion places much more of an emphasis on choices, with certain milestones and decisions helping to change a Sim's personality and shape who they really are as a person and how they react to events. The way that Sims interact with one another has also been completely revamped, with each Sim given preferences that can determine how socially compatible they are with those they meet.

  As with other
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
  </em>
  Seasons is the game-defining expansion. While it doesn’t come with a new world, it does add so much to gameplay across the board that it deserves the top spot. Alongside seasons and weather, players also see the introduction of the in-game calendar, which allows them to schedule a wide range of events and celebrate seasonal holidays. The addition of holiday traditions, decorations, and other pop-up events rounds out this pack.

 <p>
  Adding Seasons is the biggest change across the game that players will ever see in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  and adds a new depth to every home in every neighborhood. It also allows more realistic gameplay in terms of being able to add and plan regular events, including birthday parties. This is also the expansion which is the most general, adding new features that have a wide range of uses and implications.

  Eco Lifestyle was an unexpected theme that had many players skeptical at first. However, as it's been explored simmers have discovered that it's far more versatile than expected. It offers several different ways to affect worlds, including eco footprints and action plans.

  Eco footprints allow players to change the world into a green area full of beauty or plunge it into industrial smog. The pack also adds green energy, a new career, fabrication, candle-making skills, evolving community, and so much more. It was a surprise that was well-received, pulling numerous small features together into a well-rounded expansion.

  Island Living is another polarizing pack and offers an entirely new way of living on the island of Sulani. There are new part-time careers, new events, and a new vibe, which includes friendlier neighbors and some stunning views. There are also a lot of small additions in the pack, including swimming, diving, odd jobs, sailing, sunbathing, and sandcastle building.

  The island itself evolves over time, linking with the new Conservationist career and allowing players to change their surroundings. Overall, the pack offers new ways to play and unique ways to build, something which is rare in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . For those who want a new way to play and a new cultural experience, the Island Living pack is, therefore, an excellent choice and arguably the best
  <em>
   Sims 4
  </em>
  expansion.

  Season 1 of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  has arrived, bringing with it a whole host of exciting content for fans to enjoy. At launch, players can battle it out on additional 6v6 maps like Extraction, get their hands on powerful weapons like the Krig C, and dive right into the Area 99 Resurgence map for
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  Battle Royale. However, that's not all that players can experience with this massive update.

  While Zombies has not seen many major updates yet — with most content drops reserved for Season 1 Reloaded — fans of the popular mode can still get a taste of it inside Multiplayer. For players diving into Nuketown for the first time, there is a neat Easter Egg that allows them to battle waves of hostile mannequins. Here's
  <strong>

  To complete the Nuketown Easter Egg in

   shoot the heads off every mannequin

  on the map

   within the first 1 minute and 30 seconds
  </strong>
  of the game starting. The best method to complete this Easter Egg is to load into a private match, head into Nuketown, and progress from one side of the map to the other, shooting every mannequin head in sight.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  Zombies can be a real challenge due to the fast pace of zombies, spawns, and those pesky Manglers. However, players can make it even more challenging by trying out certain weapons to aid the fight against the hordes in Terminus and Liberty Falls.

  With so many weapons to choose from, the ones provided below will add a unique challenge in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6

  Zombies to further test the skills of the player, and they might even end up finding a powerful build that they enjoy – or a ridiculous one that shouldn’t work as well as it does.

 <p>
  If there’s any build that more frenzied players would enjoy, it’s a straight-up melee one. While it’s a tough battle between the Combat Knife and the Baseball Bat, this build works better with the Knife purely because it’s a tad slower and has a tighter reach that forces players to get up close and personal.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":933} -->

 <p>
  With the Knife, players will want to Pack-a-Punch it ASAP and get Melee Macchiato to further increase their melee power. What makes this build challenging is how dangerous it is to melee zombies, especially in the higher rounds, since one hit can cause quite the damage, and handling Elite Zombies like Amalgams and Abominations isn’t going to be easy.

 <p>
  A dangerous and explosive build for both zombies and players, this loadout will focus purely on the controversial Cigma 2B. This rocket launcher doesn’t exactly boast a high damage output, and its lacking amount of ammo in the chamber makes for a hard time that might struggle to kill a horde, unless players know how to use their explosives.

 <p>
  PhD Flopper is essential for this build, as the explosive power of the rocket launcher is enough to knock the hordes down like pins in bowling, but also enough to break the armor and health of those who are dangerous enough to risk something like this.

 <p>
  Anyone who has played the classic Zombies map of Call of the Dead, may be familiar with the Scavenger, a Wonder Weapon exclusive to that map which will make the most satisfying explosive sound upon detonation, and can easily eradicate George A. Romero with just a few shots. Players can recreate this weapon with the Pack-a-Punched LR 7.62.

 <p>
  The Pack-a-Punch version of the LR 7.62 provides a bolt-action sniper with explosive capabilities, allowing it to bite hordes of undead and use precision shots against Manglers and Abominations for varying effects. Paired with the Aether Shroud Field Upgrade, players have a sneaky way out of combat, and a stealth attack from within the Dark Aether.

 <p>
  The Model L might not seem like the most impressive weapon players can grab, but it is one that can see a further cool factor once players reach Prestige 2 – Level 50. At this level, players will be able to convert the Model L into the STG-44 Blueprint, which is a beloved weapon from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: World at War
  </em>
  .

  The STG-44 has been gone for quite some time, and the complexity of its design may see it never come back, but forever immortalized in the gaming scene. Those who remember the catwalk in Der Riese and the STG-44 wall-buy might want to grab this beauty.

 <p>
  Light Machine Guns always suffer from the fact that they are pretty slow-firing, hard to reload, and slow players down with their sprint speeds. However, unlock the inner “Tank” Dempsey by committing to a spray and pray by utilizing the XMG, which has a high ammo capacity to allow players to absolutely unload infinite lead into enemies.

 <p>
  The XMG may not be the best nor the fastest LMG, but it’s still one worth using thanks to its high ammo capacity. It’s a real challenge to see the XMG thrive on higher rounds, but activating Healing Aura to stay alive for a duration while unloading death to zombie hordes will prove a new strategy not for everyone.

  There’s an absurd joke within the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  community that refers to the iconic “goes hard” picture of the sitting Black Ops menu character as John Black Ops. Players can not only recreate the pose with a specific emote in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , but they can bring forth the dual wield pistols of John Black Ops into Zombies with the GS45.
 </p>

  While players need to fully level up the GS45 to unlock dual wield, it’s most definitely worth it, because a Pack-a-Punch of the two will provide the Mustang &amp; Sally variant named Sally &amp; Forth. It’s explosive, fast-firing, and a true iconic beast.

  Everyone loves a Wonder Weapon, and without Mule Kick, players can’t exactly have them all and then bring in a spare weapon. That’s why the Wonder Weapon hoarder can steal every Wonder Weapon they can get their Operator mitts on, and try their luck at the Mystery Box and the free WW quests to get the Ray Gun and the map-exclusive Wonder Weapon.

  The Ray Gun is absurdly powerful again, which

  desperately needed. Players can also try their luck with the Jet Gun and the DRI-11 Beamsmasher to make for the ultimate rare arsenal of weapons that will make any friend or fellow Operator jealous.

  Every
  <em>

  minigame requires a special token, and for Amazing Partners, it's the Gauntlet tokens. Fans will need these to spin the wheel and progress in the event. But if you have collected tons of Gauntlets and managed to complete all the milestones, you might be wondering what happens to the extra ones when the event ends. Read on to find out.

  Your board level decides your

  There are different ways to earn money in

  . You can complete your quick wins tasks, participate in banner events and tournaments, Open Community Chests, and play Bank Heists and Shutdowns. Currently, the Operation Tycon event and Stealthy Soar tournament are available in the 2023 board game. Once you have enough money, you can upgrade your properties and level up your board.

  If you are looking to grab more Gauntlet tokens in
  <em>

  , there are a few easy ways to do it. First, make sure you’re playing active banner events and tournaments because they come with many Gauntlet tokens as rewards. For example, the Operation Tycoon event gives out
  <strong>
   3,490 Gauntlets
  </strong>
  if you complete all its milestones.

 <p>
  Apart from that, you should also collect your free gifts and complete your daily quick wins tasks to earn these tokens. As mentioned above, you will need these tokens to spin the Amazing Partners wheel and get points for Amazing Partners.

  Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer has responded to console gamers' criticism of the company's latest ad campaign that calls nearly any gaming device an
  <strong>
   Xbox
  </strong>
  . Fans of Xbox have a lot to be excited about through the rest of 2024, with
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  coming in November, along with MachineGames'
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  in December.

 <p>
  Microsoft's recent "This Is an Xbox" ad campaign has sparked some controversy among fans. The ads point to laptops, smartphones, tablets, VR headsets, and other devices and label them as Xboxes due to the fact that Xbox and Game Pass are accessible on them. This has earned heavy criticism from hardcore Xbox console fans, who feel that Xbox is increasingly moving away from the console business and becoming more of a third-party entity. This sentiment has only grown more prominent since Xbox brought games like
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  to Switch and PS5 earlier this year. More recently, Xbox confirmed that
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,
  </em>
  a triple-A first-party title from Bethesda's MachineGames, will arrive on Sony's PlayStation 5 next year.

  Speaking with Rolling Stone, CEO of Microsoft Gaming Phil Spencer attempted to ease the worried minds of console gamers by responding to their concerns about the future of Xbox consoles in the wake of the "This Is An Xbox" campaign. Spencer assured fans that Xbox will "definitely do more consoles in the future," pointing out that, compared to Xbox's growing PC and cloud numbers, the brand's console business has stagnated, leading to the shift away from consoles as Xbox's bread and butter. Spencer also mentioned how such a shift will ultimately benefit console gamers. "The console space all up isn’t growing, across all of them. We love those customers, but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it’s about PC, it’s about cloud, and it’s about making our games more available in more places," he said.

  It can be said that Xbox's newfound focus on PC and cloud was born out of the success of Game Pass and the stagnation of its console sales, but such a shift in priority may very well ensure that Xbox's console business never grows again. Nintendo's Switch and Sony's PlayStation 5 have also encountered sales struggles recently, but both brands' reliance on their high-quality first-party games has usually been enough to keep profits high. While it's true that PC and cloud revenue streams will help fund more games for all Xbox gamers, console fans' concerns about the future are well-founded.

  Despite the controversial ad campaign, Phil Spencer has recently announced that Xbox is working on a handheld device that's set to arrive in a few years. On top of that, Xbox leadership has, on several occasions, mentioned future console hardware that's in the works. While Xbox isn't offering a PS5 Pro-like mid-gen refresh, it certainly has new hardware on the way.

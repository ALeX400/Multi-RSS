  An avid
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon TCG
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan recently discovered an apparent "scalper stash" of
  <em>
   Journey Together
  </em>
  card packs at Target. The Journey Together set is among one of the most sought-after
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  sets in 2025, thanks to the inclusion of fan-favorite cards from the
  <em>
   Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after the resounding success of the
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  mobile game, many
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans still turn to the real-life
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  tabletop game to collect cards, prepare a very competitive deck, and battle their friends. The hobby of collecting and trading
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  cards continues to be popular in 2025, with many new expansions and sets on the way. GameStop discontinued pre-orders for
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  products this year, but the company is one of various retailers that continues to offer
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  expansions, sets, and card packs on release day, making it a popular location for collectors and newcomers alike. However,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  fans are still weary and vigilant of efforts by scalpers, since heavy demand is still a factor that could affect fans' chances of getting card packs on launch day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reddit user TheRisingPhoenix2112 shared an image of a supposed scalper stash of
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Journey Together
  </em>
  card packs at Target, along with an account of what occurred after bringing it to the attention of the store's manager. According to TheRisingPhoenix2112, many
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  fans swarmed the stash while an employee was placing card packs back on shelves, and some parents were able to buy packs for their kids. Many fans in the
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  community on Reddit appear to be happy that the card packs were sold to fans and parents instead of being resold by scalpers, while others are skeptical that the stash was being kept away for malicious purposes.

 <p>
  Some Reddit users, including bellowingdragoncrest, note that they were able to find Journey Together packs for MSRP somewhat easily, and other fans believe the stash was just left in the aisle for a Target employee to restock the
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  shelves. Many others in the Reddit thread speculate that a Target employee could have been hiding the packs for a scalper, causing some debates about paranoia regarding retailers potentially scalping
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  cards.

  At the very least, The Pokemon Company is aware that fans are having problems purchasing
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  products online and at retail due to high demand and scalpers. The company plans to increase overall production of brand-new
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  sets and expansions over time, along with more reprints of existing packs and boxes.

  There are quite a few different mushrooms for players to find in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stardew Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  as the seasons go by. While some can be used in helpful cooking recipes, others can reduce players' energy just by eating it.

  <em>
   : Red mushrooms are one of many forageable items in
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
   , and with the 1.6 update, there are new ways of obtaining them. While not as rare as their purple counterpart, red mushrooms aren't as common as the brown common mushroom, and you may have better luck finding them in the fall than you would in other seasons. There are some exceptions to this rule, and if you have Ginger Island unlocked, then you can potentially have two mushroom caves on one file, increasing your chances of farming red mushrooms and more. The following guide has been updated and revamped to include all methods of getting red mushrooms and what they can be used for in
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley

  As forage items, Red Mushrooms can be found on the
  <strong>
   Forest Farm
  </strong>
  during fall. If you didn't choose the Forest Farm, then you can find them in the
  <strong>
   Secret Woods
  </strong>
  during both summer and fall. You'll need to upgrade to a Steel Axe in order to gain access to the Secret Woods, which is in the northwest corner of Cindersap Forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you're exploring the
  <strong>
   Mines
  </strong>
  , then you may stumble upon a
  <strong>
   Mushroom Floor
  </strong>
  (from floor 81 onward). As the name indicates, this is a special floor that has a 3.5% chance of appearing upon entering the Mines. Here, you'll find Red Mushrooms and the rarer Purple Mushrooms.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you're someone who wants a more reliable way of collecting the mushroom foreagables, then you'll want to look at these other methods:

  Once you make
  <strong>
   25000g total earnings
  </strong>
  , you'll be visited by Demetrius the following morning. He wants to use the empty cave on your land for research and will give you the choice between fruit bats or mushrooms. Select the
  <strong>
   mushrooms
  </strong>
  , and your Farm Cave will be set up appropriately.

   <div class="custom_block-content warning">
    <p>
     Once you make your decision regarding the Cave,
     <strong>
      you won't be able to
     </strong>
     <strong>
      change it for that file
     </strong>
     . Meaning if you chose the fruit bats, you're stuck with those and will not be able to get the Mushroom Cave on your farm.
    </p>

 <p>
  There are
  <strong>
   six boxes in the Mushroom Cave
  </strong>
  as well as a
  <strong>
   Dehydrator
  </strong>
  (1.6 version). Every other day, mushrooms will be automatically collected in the boxes. You can get the following mushrooms from your farm's Mushroom Cave:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Red Mushroom (Common)
  </li>
  <li>
   Purple Mushroom (Rare)
  </li>
  <li>
   Chanterelle (Uncommon)
  </li>
  <li>
   Morel (Uncommon)
  </li>
  <li>
   Common Mushroom (Very Common)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Red Mushrooms have a 12.3% chance of spawning in the cave. You're likely to get more Common Mushrooms than anything else, but you'll occasionally get a Red Mushroom or something rarer. If you're really lucky, the Red Mushroom may be high quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Red Mushrooms have a chance to appear as a foraged item in the Secret Woods in both the summer and fall seasons. It has a much higher chance to spawn in the summer among the Fiddlehead Ferns compared to fall.

  In the 1.5 update, a new region was added to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  called
  <strong>
   Ginger Island
  </strong>
  . You will unlock this area upon completing the Community Center or JojaMart's development projects. Ginger Island is split up into several sections, but to reach them, you'll need to collect
  <strong>
   Golden Walnuts
  </strong>
  to feed the island parrots.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the northern section of Ginger Island, there's the Volcano and the Dig Site. The Dig Site is located west of the tent/Professor Snail's office. In order to access it, you'll need
  <strong>
   10 Golden Walnuts
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you've repaired the bridge to the Dig Site, you'll notice a large boulder blocking a cave entrance. Use a bomb or explosive ammo to free Professor Snail and unlock the
  <strong>
   Ginger Island Mushroom Cave
  </strong>
  . Every day, mushrooms will spawn in this cave, so be sure to check now and then.

  During the fall, you may get a rare event in which a regular tree (not fruit tree) will be turned into a Mushroom Tree overnight. Cutting these down will drop Red Mushrooms, but if you place a
  <strong>
   tapper
  </strong>
  on them, you can get Common, Red, or Purple Mushrooms during every season except winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1.5,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  added the Mushroom Tree Seed. As you'd expect, planting these on your farm is how you get Mushroom Trees. To get a Mushroom Tree Seed, you'll need to unlock
  <strong>
   Qi's Walnut Room
  </strong>
  on Ginger Island. One Mushroom Tree Seed costs 5 Qi Gems.

  1.6 added a new crafting item called the
  <strong>
   Mushroom Log
  </strong>
  . You will unlock the crafting recipe when you reach
  <strong>
   Foraging Level 4
  </strong>
  . Every four in-game days, the Mushroom Log will produce x1 Mushroom. If it rains or if you use a Rain Totem, then the wait-period will be shortened by one day.
 </p>
 <p>
  To get better-quality mushrooms, you'll want to place it near trees (not fruit trees). These trees need to be within the 7x7 square surrounding the log. You can refer to an example in the above image.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mushroom Log crafting recipe:

 <ul>
  <li>
   x10 Moss

   x10 Hardwood

  Although they can be eaten, you'll want to refrain from snacking on a Red Mushroom during your cave expeditions. Doing so will lower your Energy, and the higher quality the Red Mushroom, the more Energy you'll lose.

  You should use Red Mushrooms for the following instead:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you haven't completed the
   <strong>
    Bulletin Board in the Community Center
   </strong>
   , then you'll want to save x1 Red Mushroom for the

    Dye Bundle

   . You can also use a Red Mushroom in the
   <strong>
    Exotic Foraging Bundle
   </strong>
   (Crafts Room).
  </li>
  <li>
   You can tailor a Red Mushroom using the sewing machine (Emily's house, or your own) to get a
   <strong>
    Spotted Headscarf
   </strong>
   .

   Sometimes, a Red Mushroom will be requested in the

  <li>
   Red Mushrooms are used in the
   <strong>
    Life Elixir

   crafting recipe (unlocks at
   <strong>
    Combat Level 2

     x1 Purple Mushroom

  </strong>
  is officially launching on PS5, welcoming PlayStation players to the series for the first time. With years of content updates and one of the biggest car rosters ever,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  could feel overwhelming, but it's nothing more than a first impression. Getting and upgrading new cars in

  is generally easy and enjoyable, so every new player can expand their garage in no time to be ready for every racing discipline.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, there are some definitive vehicle picks that are easy to get and more than worth adding to one's collection as soon as possible. From affordable, well-rounded cars with great potential for upgrades, to powerful off-road monsters and roaring buggies, these are some of the best cars that new

  The iconic, aggressive Ford Mustang GT should be on any
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  newcomer's wishlist. For its price, the car's stats and upgrading potential are unmatched. For just 40,000 CR, the Ford Mustang GT offers the best raw stats that players can get in the sub-50,000 CR range, ensuring that players will be covered for A and even S1 racing classes with this powerful modern muscle car.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of performance and style, the Ford Mustang GT cannot disappoint. With a top speed of over 190 mph, impressive acceleration, responsive and strong braking, as well as its drifting capabilities, the Mustang GT is a blank canvas with unlimited potential.

  The enormous, powerful Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 ranks among the best off-road cars in
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  , period. This massive all-wheel-drive pickup received huge tires and a new suspension with an increased ride height, resulting in an impressive and reliable appearance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Created as a rival to the massive Ford F-150 Raptor, the in-game Colorado ZR2 is better in every regard, including raw performance, speed, and acceleration, as well as cross-country capabilities and handling responsiveness due to being notably lighter than F-150. Whatever the season of Mexico's harsh weather, or the type of surface under the wheels, it makes no difference for this unstoppable monster.

  The seemingly unassuming Ford Focus RS isn't to be underestimated. This Super Hot Hatch already cemented its name as the staple of the arcade racing genre and got several aces up its sleeve. First, the Focus RS is perfectly suitable for transforming into a rally car, superior on tarmac, gravel, dirt, and anything in between.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, the Focus RS is among the best and highest-performing front-wheel-drive (FWD) rides in
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  , so unless players want to change that, they'll get new experiences from driving, with unmatched stability on the road. Finally, for this price, the Ford Focus RS is a no-brainer, standing among the cheapest cars worth getting in the game without a second thought.

  For more extreme off-roading events with plenty of turns, players want to get something other than a hulking pickup, so that's where the Sierra Cars RX3 comes in. The highest-performing Utility Terrain Vehicle in its price segment, the Sierra Cars RX3 will provide an adrenaline-pumping experience when exploring Mexico in
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  , different from anything that newcomers can find.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to its lightweight body of just 420 kg, this single-seater off-roader provides driving sensations akin to a dirt bike with its punchy engine, and shines during mixed-surface rallycross. On top of that, the Sierra Cars RX3 is a perfect choice for conquering jump stunts, or simply toying around with skill chains on many dirt playgrounds in
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  .

  The BMW M3 is among the most respectable and multipurpose rides for newcomers to the game, with a standout power-price ratio. The car is slightly below the Ford Mustang GT when comparing raw stats while being slightly more expensive. However, it's a fourth-generation BMW we're talking about. Its driving dynamics and overall balance are something else entirely, building upon the rich legacy of Bavarian motors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another substantial bonus of the BMW M3 is a full wide-body conversion kit available in
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5.
  </em>
  This allows players to instantly boost the car's appearance, aerodynamics, and handling capabilities with an endlessly stylish, track-ready look.

  If Sierra Cars RX3 proves a bit too much and unpredictable due to its extreme weight, the Can-Am Maverick X RS Turbo R is a great UTV alternative, with a laughable price tag for its performance and sheer fun that it provides. With few to no competitors in its segment, the Can-Am Maverick is a vehicle that blends the best of UTVs and buggies together, and capable of tackling challenging, rocky terrain with ease.
 </p>
 <p>
  While players shouldn't expect groundbreaking speed characteristics from Maverick, this little fella just might become one of their favorites for exploring the wilderness of sand dunes and wet rainforests of Mexico in the initial hours.

  The Hoonigan Chevrolet Napalm Nova is a unique and affordable car in
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  , standing as a heavily pre-tuned variant of the classic muscle car with rich heritage. The custom design of Napalm Nova is both traditional and modern, but it's all about function first, packing some ridiculous performance by Hoonigan and chewing through tires like a maniac.
 </p>
 <p>
  This setup isn't built for multi-purpose, but the car shines in all the right places when put on a drag strip. This beast is a bit rough around the edges, but players simply won't find another build quite like Napalm Nova. Given its price, it's a must-have for any driver looking for something untamed.

  The final off-roading choice among the UTVs listed above, the Exomotive Exocet Off-Road is listed as a buggy. While it's up for debate, with its oversize tires and steel tube chassis, it's just as capable.
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  players would struggle to find an off-road discipline for Exocet not to shine in, as this package is an ultimate choice for no-compromise, high-speed off-roading while remaining responsive and steerable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Purpose-built for taking on whatever surface players throw at it, the Exocet is a charged and uniquely fun way to explore the vastness of
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5's
  </em>
  diverse open-world, from sand to snow, and everything in between.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles
  </em>
  franchise has always danced on the edge of genre and narrative, stretching the limits of what a JRPG can be. From the sweeping fantasy of the original trilogy to the sci-fi isolation of
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  , Monolith Soft has never been afraid to evolve. With the release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
   </em>
  </strong>
  finally tying its standalone world to the broader series through the metaphysical Rift Between Worlds, the studio now has an unprecedented opportunity to branch the series in two distinct directions.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Instead of forcing all future entries to juggle the differing expectations of fans of the mainline trilogy and
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  , Monolith Soft could mirror Atlus’ successful structure with
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  . By creating two parallel yet philosophically linked games—
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  <em>
   -2
  </em>
  —Monolith Soft could embrace both narrative density and exploratory freedom, satisfying the full breadth of its passionate fan base.

 <p>
  Like
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  , which evolved from
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  into its own identity with strong themes, deep character arcs, and social metaphors,
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 5
  </em>
  can build directly on the foundations of its predecessors. The original trilogy’s slow build from grounded conflict into cosmic revelations has become a signature of the series. By continuing this approach, Monolith Soft can give players another emotionally layered tale where fantasy and sci-fi collide.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 3
  </em>
  , death isn’t just a mechanic—it’s the central question. Characters are literally born to die, cycling through endless war and reincarnation. The series consistently frames death not as an ending, but as a lens through which the meaning of life is understood.
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 5
  </em>
  could return to these themes, pushing them even further now that
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  ’s world is part of the greater continuity. It could explore humanity’s original beginnings—possibly on Earth—tying threads back to
  <em>
   Xenosaga
  </em>
  and even
  <em>
   Xenogears
  </em>
  .

     The Rift Between Worlds introduced in
     <em>
      Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
     </em>
     doesn't just unify timelines—it also reintroduces theological and metaphysical concepts from earlier Monolith Soft games. This area could be a critical narrative tool in
     <em>
      Xenoblade Chronicles 5
     </em>
     , allowing cross-world memory echoes or reincarnation as a core gameplay system.

 <p>
  Where Atlus uses
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  to comment on societal repression and identity, Monolith Soft can continue using
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles
  </em>
  to dive into philosophical questions about memory, continuity, and the self. A new entry could inherit
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 3
  </em>
  ’s character-driven structure while innovating through dual-world travel or soul-link systems—possibly even letting players embody reincarnated versions of past characters, echoing decisions across timelines.

 <p>
  Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X-2
  </em>
  could fully double down on what made the original
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  so distinct. That game was never just about survival on an alien world, it was about adaptation. It gave players mechs, massive continents, modular weapon systems, and a sense of scale unseen in most JRPGs. The
  <em>
   Definitive Edition
  </em>
  confirmed that Mira is part of the larger cosmology, giving
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  's world a chance to continue as its own living, breathing branch of the
  <em>
   Xenoblade
  </em>
  narrative tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  Much like
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  has a colder, more mechanical approach to its themes compared to
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X-2
  </em>
  could lean into minimalism, moral ambiguity, and environmental storytelling. Instead of long-winded cutscenes or complex party politics, it could emphasize exploration, player choice, and deciphering the world through ruins, AI remnants, and alien lifeforms. The story could center on the diaspora of humanity after Mira’s collapse: where do they go, and who do they become without a planet to bind them?
 </p>
 <p>
  A scaled-back script, supported by heavy atmosphere and optional lore pickups, would make the game feel like a natural evolution. With
  <em>
   Xenosaga
  </em>
  ’s Higher Domain and
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 3
  </em>
  ’s Origin now “canonically” in play,
  <em>
   X-2
  </em>
  could place the player in the role of a mythic wanderer—a sci-fi pilgrim whose goal is to find meaning in the remains of a civilization that never belonged to them in the first place.

    <p>
     Monolith Soft’s Kyoto studio has provided support for open-world design on
     <em>
      The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
     </em>
     . A team with this pedigree could bring even greater verticality and interactivity to
     <em>
      Xenoblade Chronicles X-2
     </em>
     , especially if the next game takes advantage of the hardware improvements in the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>

 <p>
  The game wouldn’t need to feature traditional party systems. Instead,
  <em>
   Xenoblade X-2
  </em>
  could offer modular solo builds, co-op play, or AI companions shaped by the player’s moral choices—reminiscent of the affinity-based AI system in
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  . This kind of title would allow Monolith Soft to keep a faster production cycle without sacrificing thematic ambition.

 <p>
  A split-path strategy would let Monolith Soft deepen both branches of its universe without forcing compromise. Rather than cramming complex metaphysics and open-world traversal into a single game, it could embrace duality. Fans who love narrative depth, ensemble casts, and tightly plotted themes get
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 5
  </em>
  . Fans who want mechs, freedom, and exploration get
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X-2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This wouldn’t just be a quality-of-life decision; it would serve the lore. The
  <em>
   Xenoblade
  </em>
  series is inherently about division and convergence: of worlds, of ideologies, of selves. By developing two titles, the studio can turn this motif into a game structure. The concept of duality—present in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 2
  </em>
  ’s Blades,
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 3
  </em>
  ’s Ouroboros forms, and the Rift Between Worlds—becomes literal. Two roads. Two games. One mythos.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would also future-proof the series. Monolith Soft could stagger releases, using different teams for different games—just as Atlus does with
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  . The studio already has four Tokyo branches and one in Kyoto. With smart project management, it could keep
  <em>
   Xenoblade
  </em>
  games coming at a steady pace without burnout or compromise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nintendo’s continued investment in Monolith Soft speaks volumes. From
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , the studio has become integral to Nintendo’s ecosystem. Giving it room to lead its flagship JRPG series in two directions could be a defining move for the Nintendo Switch 2’s early life cycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, it’s not about choosing between past and future.
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles
  </em>
  has always been about bringing disparate worlds together. Just as
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  coexist to serve different facets of the same core theme, so too can
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X-2
  </em>
  : two sides of a philosophical coin, spinning endlessly across time and space.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Jujutsu Infinite
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a Roblox game based on Jujutsu Kaisen where you can step into the manga world and live out the life of a sorcerer. You can take on quests from NPCs, battle bosses like the Finger Bearer or Heian Imaginary Demon, and take down curses as you move through the main storyline.

 <p>
  One of the biggest things to focus on in the game is building your skills. Luckily, you can unlock and upgrade them through the Skill Tree. Players can boost their HP, focus gain, cursed energy moves, and even master the innate abilities (your main moveset). This guide breaks down all the skills you can get in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  and how to level up each one.

  The Skill Tree in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  is basically your main hub for gaining and ranking up abilities. You can
  <strong>
   power up your current skills or grab new ones
  </strong>
  to make your character stronger. To open it, just hit the ‘Stats’ icon on the bottom-left of your screen, and once you’re in, you’ll see five main sections:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Health
  </li>
  <li>
   Focus
  </li>
  <li>
   Technique
  </li>
  <li>
   Strength
  </li>
  <li>
   Innates
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Each section has its own path filled with nodes you can unlock. Most of the time, you’ll need
  <strong>
   Stat Points
  </strong>
  to level them up — these are earned by completing story quests. Some nodes can be upgraded up to three times, so since Stat Points are limited, it’s smart to spend them wisely. You’ll also sometimes need in-game currency or special items to progress further. If you’re unsure where to start, investing in Innates, Health, and Focus (especially for Black Flash) is always a solid choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s a quick breakdown of what each section does to help you plan your build:

 <p>
  The Innates Skill Tree has nodes based on your selected innate techniques, so this section will look different for every player depending on which ones they’ve selected for combat. There are
  <strong>
   more than 20 Innate techniques in
   <em>
    Jujutsu Infinite
   </em>
  </strong>
  , each with unique abilities and powers. You can pick your techniques by spinning for them in the Customize section.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike other trees, you won’t use Stat Points here. Instead, you’ll need in-game money to level up each skill. To fully max out a node, you’ll have to use a
  <strong>
   Maximum Scroll
  </strong>
  . If you’re not sure how to farm more Maximum Scrolls, this guide can help you. Choosing the right technique really matters when it comes to boss fights, so before spending anything in the Skill Tree, make sure you’ve got a technique that’s worth it. If not, just head back to the Customize section and spin for a new one. On top of that, you can unlock extra moves (like the popular Fuga Chant) by completing special quests.

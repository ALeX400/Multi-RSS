      Final Fantasy 8 needs a remake to address its issues and showcase its strengths like music and gameplay.
     </li>
     <li>
      A potential Final Fantasy 9 remake is exciting, but remaking FF8 first is a more constructive move.
     </li>
     <li>
      Omitting a FF8 remake could create uncertainty for the future of Final Fantasy remakes since Square Enix would be skipping a classic title.

 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  is a franchise that has been ruling the JRPG roost for decades. For most, it's the yardstick upon which all other games in the genre are compared, and the way it has changed and evolved over time has made it a trailblazer since the very beginning. From the near-universally beloved
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  to the somewhat polarizing
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 8
   </em>
  </strong>
  , its history is storied, and its influence is massive. Final Fantasy 8 may be controversial, but its lasting impact on the franchise is undeniable.

 <p>
  The recent remake of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  has reminded fans of their love of tales and characters of the past. A remake of the ninth mainline outing is not confirmed, but has been rumored for years, and recently an Epic Games Store leak has alluded to its existence. However, while this would be an exciting proposition, there's one title that Square Enix should give the treatment first, as
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  needs it a lot more.

 <p>
  One of the big talking points of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  was its willingness to change the story and bring something new. It wasn't an exact replica of the story presented in 1997, rather it sat alongside the PlayStation classic, adding to its greatness rather than mimicking it. This meant that both new players and seasoned fans could get something new from the experience as it had vital story beats that were all-new, and thus it wasn't completely predictable. This is a philosophy that doesn't have to be unique to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  , especially if Square Enix decides to give the same treatment to its immediate follow-up.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  has more than its fair share of issues, be it the awkward setting and tone, some of the clunky dialogue, and the 'Junction' system that dampened the feeling of actual progression. It's a game that valiantly tries new things, but with most new additions, it missed the mark, enough to ensure that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  returned to a more conventional overall product. A remake could be the perfect means to bring forward the things that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  does well, like music and the beloved game Triple Triad, while restructuring or replacing the areas in which it falters.
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  reminded players of that game's wonder,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8 Remake
  </em>
  could rehabilitate a game that was far more polarizing.

  A Potential Final Fantasy 9 Remake is Exciting, But Not Necessary
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  may have been overshadowed somewhat on release thanks to it launching so late in the original PlayStation's life, but over the last 24 years, it has enjoyed renewed adoration and is widely believed to be one of the best
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games there is. Its legacy is large, even being ported to PlayStation 4 in 2017 and Switch and Xbox One in 2019, with new people discovering Zidane's story almost a quarter of a century after it first hit shelves. In truth, a remake of it would be welcome news, but it would have the same reason for existing as
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  , which is simply to recreate a masterpiece, whereas
  <em>
   8
  </em>
  receiving the treatment feels like a more constructive move.

  The public consensus on
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  may be mixed, but if Square Enix decides not to pursue a remake of it and instead cover
  <em>
   9
  </em>
  , it makes the topic of future remakes feel uncertain. If
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 8
  </em>
  is not deserving, then it calls into question which games will be remade moving forward. There are obvious candidates, like the aforementioned
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  as well as SNES classics such as
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   6
  </em>
  (
  <em>

  and

  The Two-Headed Turtle is a new Talisman in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  that
  <strong>
   greatly raises stamina recover speed.
  </strong>
  The Two-Headed Turtle Talisman weight is 1.0.

 <p>
  The Two-Headed Turtle Talisman cannot be equipped together with the normal Green Turtle Talisman as it is a direct upgrade to the old Talisman. There are no real drawbacks to equipping this Talisman over the normal one. It is only heavier by 0.3. Since the Green Turtle Talisman enhances stamina recovery by 17.7%, it is safe to assume that the upgrade does it at a much faster rate. The great thing about a stamina recovery enhancement is that it is a boon to all players, no matter their specific build.

  You will come across a waterfall at the end of the path, with a small entrance to its left to the Rivermouth Cave site of grace.

  The countless
  <strong>
   Pokemon
  </strong>
  available for catching and training at the moment all are unique in their own ways, even when it comes to their sets of stats — some are weaker, others stronger; some are speedier while others emphasize special moves. HP, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, and Attack are all important factors to weigh when choosing monsters to battle and explore with.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Attack
  </strong>
  refers to how much raw damage a Pokemon does to another when using a physical move. Whereas Special Attack means attacking from a distance typically, not quite making physical contact with the other Pokemon, Attack refers to the physical attacks. These are the moves that see Pokemon punching and kicking or slicing and dicing each other.

    Updated June 24, 2024 by Stephen LaGioia:
   </strong>
   The lineup of Pokemon continues to expand with countless colorful monsters — much like the franchise at large. With this comes more elaborate battle systems, and a slew of players becoming more skilled at competitive combat. As such, zeroing in on the most powerful Pokemon to use in battle is more crucial than ever.

 <p>
  Added to this is the growing lineup of monsters, which now stands at a whopping
  <strong>
   1025 Pokemon
  </strong>
  to pick from, scattered among the various releases — and more of them taking on different forms. With such an overwhelming roster, we thought we should revisit this list and highlight more of the
  <strong>
   highest attack Pokemon
  </strong>
  guaranteed to put up a fight even in this increasingly vast, complex battlefield.

     This list will primarily rank and focus on
     <strong>
      default or normal
     </strong>
     forms of each Pokemon rather than Mega, Ultra, or other super-charged forms. However, their increase in power via these stronger forms
     <strong>
      will be factored into the rankings
     </strong>
     and mentioned when significant. For instance, Mega Mewtwo X/Y is placed higher because of the high power in its Mega form.

     Special Attack will

  This little guy actually packs quite a punch, at least in terms of raw attack power. Unfortunately, the spiked
  <strong>
   Rock-type
  </strong>
  is a bit of a one-trick Pokemon, as its stats and abilities are a bit tepid elsewhere. However, Cranidos
  <strong>
   is
  </strong>
  a dinosaur, despite being small in stature, so not surprisingly, it can deal ample damage.

 <p>
  To put it into perspective, this monster boasts a higher Attack than Mewtwo (when not in its Mega X form, at least). That in and of itself is pretty impressive. However, it's also capable of learning the devastating move,
  <strong>
   Head Smash
  </strong>
  , which yields 150 power.

  For those lucky Pokemon masters that secure a
  <strong>
   Claw Fossil
  </strong>
  and can evolve their Anorith at level 40, Armaldo will surely make an impact, being one of the strongest
  <strong>
   Bug-types
  </strong>
  on the roster. Given its tough, scaly body and
  <strong>
   Rock-type
  </strong>
  hybrid nature, it's no surprise that Armaldo boasts a stout defense that hits triple digits.

  However, the tough, overgrown insect thrives when it comes to raw attack power. The Pokemon can shatter stones with its strong claws, and punch through steel slabs with little sweat.

  This large
  <strong>
   Dark-type
  </strong>
  bird isn't given the tag "Big Boss" for nothing. The ominous avian's fur has an appearance that resembles a well-dressed mob boss. Though it also has the dangerous, ruthless behaviors to further support this caricature. The bird is a natural leader, being able to summon a murder of companions that can do its dirty work with a mere cry into the skies.

 <p>
  This bird excels at just about all areas of offense, with a respectable Special Attack power that complements its raw power. Moves like
  <strong>
   Foul Play and Dark Pulse
  </strong>
  can quickly cause Honchkrow's opponents to "sleep with the fishes".

  This
  <strong>
   Psychic-Fighting-type
  </strong>
  powerhouse emerges from the already potent Kirlia when exposed to a
  <strong>
   Dawn Stone
  </strong>
  . It shares "final form" status from Ralt with the similarly dangerous Gardevoir. This fighter can also
  <strong>
   Mega Evolve into Mega Gallade by way of the Galladite.
  </strong>
  This variant boasts a whopping
  <strong>
   165
  </strong>
  attack.

 <p>
  Still, the normal version and its 125 attack — along with total stats that clock in over 500 — are impressive in their own right. The Pokemon wields sharp extendable elbows, and fittingly has a head shaped like a Gladiator's helmet. This monster is fairly quick and can anticipate the moves of its opponents, favoring striking foes from behind like a deadly assassin. Just don't get near it when it uses the potent
  <strong>
   Close Combat or Future Sight.
  </strong>

  This mysterious
  <strong>
   Psychic-type
  </strong>
  is among the Legendary trio discovered in the Sinnoh region known as the "Lake Guardians". As one might expect given its hovering abilities, glowing aura, and red jeweled tail, Azelf excels when it comes to magic, and thus, Special Attack. Though it also packs a punch for its size.

 <p>
  Legend has it that Azelf holds the power to sap the very will and mobility of humans that harm it. Even if this is untrue, a target of Azelf will surely be doomed when unprepared to fight it. It can learn moves that range from 120 to a whopping 250 power.

 <p>
  This large insectoid Pokemon is one of the largest and most potent of its kind; that kind being a
  <strong>
   Bug-type
  </strong>
  , which also grows the
  <strong>
   Flying-type
  </strong>
  when evolving to Mega Pinsir form. Of course, this big-winged variant has ample attack power, specifically
  <strong>
   155.
  </strong>
  But its basic form is still not to be trifled with. It boasts great offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a difficult out during a heated battle.

 <p>
  As one might guess from its distinct design, the most dangerous part of Pinsir is its sharp, tough, and flexible pincers, which can easily slice up and toss opponents around like rag dolls. In essence, any who find themselves unlucky enough to be trapped in a death pinch by Pinsir will not escape until the Pokemon tires of its attack.

  One of the original Pokemon amongst the vast lineup remains one of the toughest. It's no surprise, given the massive form and razor-sharp teeth of this slithering sea creature. Gyarados resembles an ocean-dwelling dragon, despite being of the
  <strong>
   Water and Flying-types
  </strong>
  — though it's perhaps even more intimidating than the likes of, say, Dragonite.

 <p>
  As described in the early Dex, this creature can demolish entire cities in a rage. Its impressive moveset supports this legend, with moves like Hydro Pump and Hyper Beam blasting foes into oblivion.

 <p>
  It's quite ironic that one of the least intimidating Pokemon in the game — Magikarp — transforms into one of the most powerful. One could look at Gyarados as a suitable reward for trainers with patience to train it in its pre-evolved fish form.

  With solid defense and an even stronger attack stat, Scizor is a hard opponent to defeat when it comes to basic moves. Its metallic exoskeleton allows it to fend off various attacks from others. Yet it's the creature's massive pincers that are really what elevates this
  <strong>
   Bug/Steel-type.
  </strong>

 <p>
  Beyond just its sharp claws, its muscles are made of solid metal, allowing it to crush those in its grasp with little effort. Scizor boasts a nice lineup of strong Normal and Steel-type moves, giving trainers many offensive options when battling it.

 <p>
  Easily one of the most unique Pokemon ever designed, Necrozma is a
  <strong>
   Psychic-type
  </strong>
  with the ability to transform into something rather powerful via its different forms. Those looking for a physical attacker can opt for the
  <strong>
   Dusk Mane form,
  </strong>
  which gives it a whopping
  <strong>
   157 Attack
  </strong>
  , while still maintaining a solid defense.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Although Necrozma is a bit sluggish, those who can manage to take a few hits from speedier Pokemon can really dish out the damage with an array of punishing moves.
  <strong>
   Ultra Burst Necrozma
  </strong>
  amps things up even further, adding a lot of Speed and a bit more Attack to bring the total base to
  <strong>
   167.
  </strong>

  According to
  <em>
   Pokemon Emerald
  </em>
  , "Groudon has appeared in mythology as the creator of the land. It sleeps in magma underground and is said to make volcanoes erupt on awakening."

 <p>
  When Groudon awakens, it is no wonder volcanoes just straight-up erupt because it has a base
  <strong>
   Attack stat of 150
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Groudon is the core of all
  <strong>
   Ground-type
  </strong>
  Pokemon, with the highest amount in this regard. (It is also the heaviest!) The origin of Groudon is a Behemoth except mixed with a dinosaur. Its name is a combination of "ground" and perhaps "don" (Spanish for "lord).

  According to
  <em>
   Pokemon Shield
  </em>
  , "Mythology tells us that if people lose the righteousness in their hearts, their kingdoms will be razed by Zekrom's lightning." While lightning is deadly enough on its own, Zekrom's lightning in particular is even worse since it holds a base
  <strong>
   Attack stat of 150.
  </strong>

 <p>
  It is the god of all Electric-type Pokemon when it comes to Attack. (And, Zekrom is the heaviest
  <strong>
   Electric-type
  </strong>
  Pokemon!) Reshiram is based on the "yang" of yin and yang so Zekrom is the "yang." The name itself is derived from "kuro," which means "black" in Japanese.

  Rayquaza boasts a
  <strong>
   base Attack of 150
  </strong>
  so this is one powerful beast and a great choice in battle. Of all the
  <strong>
   Dragon-type
  </strong>
  and Flying-type Pokemon, it is the best here. Rayquaza resembles the traditional Chinese Dragon, as well as the Lindworm (ancient Swedish dragon snake). Its name probably is a combination of "ray" and "quasar" (a celestial object).

  Besides the power to create Pokemon, Regigigas has a base

  It is one of the greats in this area of all the

  According to
  <em>
   Pokemon Omega Ruby
  </em>
  , "Slaking spends all day lying down and lolling about. It eats grass growing within its reach. If it eats all the grass it can reach, this Pokemon reluctantly moves to another spot."

 <p>
  Somehow, Slaking can convert the food and laziness into muscle because it has a base
  <strong>
   Attack stat of 160.
  </strong>
  Among all
  <strong>
   Normal-type
  </strong>
  Pokemon, Slaking has the highest amount for Attack. Origin-wise, it is based on a sloth, of course. The name relates too, as it is a combination of "slack" and "king."

 <p>
  Garchomp is easily one of the most iconic Pokemon ever released, thanks to the punishing battle that players had to go through with Champion Cynthia in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. The
  <strong>
   Ground and Dragon-type
  </strong>
  already had an immense amount of power with a base
  <strong>
   Attack of 130
  </strong>
  but Game Freak supercharged the beast by giving it a powerful
  <strong>
   Mega Evolution.
  </strong>

 <p>
  This new-and-improved Garchomp was capable of outputting some serious physical attack damage thanks to its
  <strong>
   170 base attack
  </strong>
  . Depending on nature and other variables, players could increase that number to a downright scary
  <strong>
   482 when it's maxed out.
  </strong>

  While rather dimwitted, Rampardos relies on its brawn which allows it a base
  <strong>
   Attack stat of 165.
  </strong>
  Rampardos is the king of all Rock-type Pokemon when it comes to this stat. Of course, it is a dinosaur, but more specifically a Stegoceras. Rampardos's name is derived from "ram" or possibly "rampage."

 <p>
  Evolving at level 37 from the far less intimidating Shuppet, Banette manages to be both creepy and a bit silly. Yet, the ghostly doll Pokemon definitely errs on the side of eerie when taking on its spookier
  <strong>
   Mega Evolution
  </strong>
  form, which has a much higher attack stat of
  <strong>
   165.
  </strong>

 <p>
  Cursing its victims by piercing its voodoo doll-like body, Banette can already be threatening with its base
  <strong>
   Attack stat of 115.
  </strong>
  But in Mega form, this skyrockets to a
  <strong>
   solid 165.
  </strong>
  Given its raw power, and the fact that it's weak to very few Elemental types, Banette can be truly tough to vanquish.

  While it may appear elegant and graceful, this
  <strong>
   Psychic/Fighting-type
  </strong>
  is anything but. The creature boasts a solid
  <strong>
   125 base Attack
  </strong>
  stat from the get-go (after evolving from a male Kirlia when given a Dawn Stone). This Pokemon can strike swiftly and emphatically, with its tonfa-like arms and blade elbows.

 <p>
  Fittingly, its head resembles a gladiator's helmet, further driving home its fighting nature. At least when it comes to default forms, Gallade is one of the strongest creatures in the game and is capable of learning several potent moves.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  This gets amped up quite a bit when
  <strong>
   Mega-evolved
  </strong>
  , specifically to a solid
  <strong>
   165.

  This Legendary Gen-five monster is distinct, and not just with its alluring
  <strong>
   Dragon/Ice-type
  </strong>
  combination. While it doesn't evolve, Kyurem can take on two alternate forms, which are even more potent than the already strong default version. With the process of Absofusion, it can morph into either
  <strong>
   White or Black Kyurem,
  </strong>
  fittingly acting as the symbol for
  <em>
   Pokemon Black and White (2).
  </em>

 <p>
  While it's more than capable in its original form in terms of Attack and Special Attack, the Black variant is particularly powerful, clocking in at
  <strong>
   130 Attack.
  </strong>
  The White Variant boasts a far more capable
  <strong>
   Special Attack
  </strong>
  stat, white its base Attack is a bit more average. In any case, with moves like
  <strong>
   Blizzard, Outrage, and Freeze Shock,
  </strong>
  opponents will be hard-pressed to overcome this icy behemoth.

  As mentioned in the

  Dex, "According to lore, this Pokémon showed no mercy to those who got in its way, yet it would heal its opponents' wounds after battle." No mercy indeed as Ice Rider Calyrex beholds a base

 <p>
  To get
  <strong>
   Ash of War: Rolling Sparks
  </strong>
  in the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  DLC, you must first reach
  <strong>
   Scadu Altus
  </strong>
  . Going northeast of the Scorched Ruins, you will come across
  <strong>
   Castle Ensis
  </strong>
  , where Rellana, Twin Moon Knight, resides, and after you defeat her, you can proceed to the next area. Upon reaching the
  <strong>
   Highroad Cross
  </strong>
  Site of Grace, summon your Torrent and make your way north, following the main road. Go through the encampments filled with Messmer Soldiers and start heading northeast as you come across the Furnace Golem. Hug the right wall and keep going straight; soon, you will see the Shadow Keep in front of you.

  Ignore the Keep and turn around to climb the hill with the multiple wooden spike barricades. Go past the Perfumers and head on up the hill. Here, you can spot a scarab flying up in the sky. You will have to make use of any long-range Sorcery or Incantation to make the Scarab fall down. A bow should also do the job, and once the Scarab is down, head towards it and kill it to acquire the Ash of War: Rolling Sparks.

  Since the first game came out in 2001,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Animal Crossing
   </em>
  </strong>
  has succeeded in creating immersive villages that players can customize and also interact with adorable animal villagers while utilizing real-time gameplay. The franchise has evolved over time as it elevated the customization features and the social aspect of the games, allowing players to visit and interact with other players' islands. As
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  continues to evolve, there's one feature that players have yet to see, and that is to play as animals.

 <p>
  This is the highlight of 5 Lives Studios'
  <em>
   Cozy Caravan
  </em>
  , a single-player adventure game that lets players explore a picturesque woodland world in their trusty caravan, while also crafting items through mini-games. It also has a farming aspect, as they need to stock up their caravan with goods to trade with the townsfolk. The character design and gameplay are similar to
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  and other cozy games, but
  <em>
   Cozy Caravan
  </em>
  's adventures while controlling an adorable critter definitely set it apart.

  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  's main protagonist has always been a human villager living among animal-like villagers, but the latter didn't seem to mind. Many fans have also speculated that humans probably lived in different communities from the animal
  <em>
  </em>
  characters and that the main villager just chose to live among them. Regardless, fans have enjoyed customizing their in-game avatars, even getting inspiration from different franchises like
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  .

  Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Cozy Caravan
  </em>
  has shown that it's possible to choose from different animal personas and customize them to players' liking. At the start of the game, players are given the option to play various animal protagonists, such as a raccoon, red panda, axolotl, and more. Together with their best friend Bubba, they travel to several villages on weekdays to gather materials and goods to stock up their caravan. On weekends, the caravan parks in a town, where players can sell and trade their goods with local townsfolk. Players can interact with various NPCs to accomplish chores for them and build friendships with them.

  Although
  <em>
   Cozy Caravan
  </em>
  is still in early access, it already offers such an immersive experience with its world. Developer 5 Lives Studios confirmed that it's consistently working on upgrading the game, with additional features like a quest tracker and new areas with associated quests and characters. There is also a possibility that
  <em>
   Cozy Caravan
  </em>
  will add more customization features for the protagonist, their home, and their caravan.

  Adorable animal protagonists in cozy games aren't new, as they add a layer of cuteness to the relaxing genre. Even the roguelike game
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  , which has a cozy farming and resource management portion when the Lamb is back at its base, allows players to customize animal followers, from their appearance to their traits. This is why bringing this customization option to
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  seems to be the logical next step, along with adding more villager types.

  With the next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  game rumored to release in 2026, many fans are anticipating something new from what they've already seen from previous games. There are opportunities to introduce new villagers that match new settings, like dinosaur villagers living in a jungle environment, or giving all villagers more depth by giving them personalities and new actions. These updates, along with the possibility of playing as an animal villager, could elevate
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  further as a life simulation game.

  For now, though,
  <em>

  fans can experience the wonders of playing an adorable critter in

  will grow in the coming months and years, and how it will ultimately stack up to well-known cozy games out there.

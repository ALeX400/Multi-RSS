  fan has shared a concept for what a Mega Krookodile could look like. The impressive art seems to combine the Pokemon with a particular type of dinosaur, and
  <em>

  fans are quite enthusiastic about it.

  Pokemon Mega Evolutions are getting a comeback in

  , putting the unique form back in the forefront of many players' minds. As fans continue to wait for news about the next
  <em>

  game, those who are artistically inclined are already hard at work dreaming up Mega Evolutions that could fit into the future title.

  fan lefrancocolombien shared a unique Mega Evolution for Krookodile that their wife created. The evolutionary form puts Krookodile on four legs, rather than standing up on two like its normal form. The Pokemon looks much stronger and more frightening, with more pronounced claws, teeth, and a fiercer face. The Pokemon also has quite pronounced back spikes. All of these features give the Pokemon a more primal appearance, which is what lefrancocolombien's wife wants to see more of in the series.

  Mega Krookodile Design Inspiration and Details
 </h2>
 <p>
  While the artist or their spouse didn't specifically state that the Pokemon is partially based off of a Spinosaurus, numerous fans have made comparisons between the two. The Spinosaurus was a dinosaur with distinct back neural spines that's believed to have lived about 100 million years ago. The design does seem to take inspiration from it, though Mega Krookodile's back spines are more spiky, and its front legs are larger.

  Fans were curious about the specifications of the Mega Krookodile, and lefrancocolombien shared their concepts. The Mega Krookodile would have Strong Jaw as its ability, Fissure Fang as its Signature Move, and would be a high-crit ratio Prehistoric Crocodile Pokemon. The design intends for Mega Krookodoile to be fast and hard-hitting, with suggested stats of HP: 95 (+0), Attack: 142 (+25), Defense: 100 (+20), Special Atack: 70 (+5), Special Defense: 80 (+5) and Speed: 137 (+45).

  </em>
  fans have shared their admiration for the Mega Krookodile design, with several stating that the games need an official Spinosaur-influenced Pokemon. It remains to be seen if
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will introduce Mega Evolution Pokemon influenced by dinosaurs, but fans are excited to see what's revealed either way. While the developers have remain tight-lipped about the game thus far, fan designs like these are helping to keep expectant players involved and interested in the potential of the upcoming game.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan recently discovered a location in
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  zone of Azj-Kahet that forcibly teleports players away if they try to fly past a certain point. This curious barrier could be a relic from development, but it could also be a teaser for a new zone in the
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  expansion.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Azj-Kahet is the fourth zone in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft: The War Within
  </em>
  . The vast majority of the region is dominated by a Nerubian kingdom, but the parts bordering Hallowfall contain a massive network of roots where the Haranir dwell.

 <p>
  While exploring this region of the new zone,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  fan and dataminer Marlamin flew directly upwards, past a Skyriding glyph in
  <em>
   WoW: The War Within
  </em>
  's Azj-Kahet zone and into the roots above. However, upon doing so, they were afflicted by the Drowsy debuff, which then filled the screen with green, teleporting them back to the ground near the Ruptured Lake. This impassable barrier is similar to the one used in places like the Dreamgrove in
  <em>
   Legion
  </em>
  , suggesting it, and the nearby roots, could have a connection to the Emerald Dream.

  ‘The Rootlands’ – Future Zone in WoW: The War Within?

 <p>
  A leaked map of Khaz Algar suggested a zone called “The Rootlands” was originally planned for
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  . The Haranir who guard the roots likely originate from this mysterious zone, which is almost certainly connected to Elune’Ahir – a great World Tree destroyed by the Titan Aman’thul and connected to the Emerald Dream, teased during
  <em>
   Dragonflight
  </em>
  . Given the evidence, and the fact that the Haranir were given a spotlight in the cinematic trailer for
  <em>
   WoW: The War Within
  </em>
  despite their small role in the main story so far, a zone about these storied roots would fit perfectly in the story – and this off-limits barrier may be where players eventually enter it.

 <p>
  On the other hand, this in-game barrier could just as easily be a relic from early development. Fans have also discovered evidence of raids inspired by Goblins and Ethereals, which would not exactly fit in The Rootlands.
  <em>
   World of Warcraft: Dragonflight
  </em>
  Patch 10.2 also took players to the Emerald Dream, so another nature-themed zone so soon after would need something to differentiate it. That said, it would also be the perfect time to add the Haranir as an Allied Race in
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  , given the huge number of customization options they have.

  Either way, fans won’t have to wait too long to find out. Patch 11.0.5 is expected to arrive around

  <em>

 <p>
  A recent
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  leak may have just confirmed the return of two extremely rare skins, Bravo Leader and Trench Raider, that players have not had the chance to add to their collections for over three years. The leak claimed to confirm the return of a variety of new items coming to the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  shop in the coming months; Bravo Leader and Trench Raider have been away the longest and are set to return on August 27 and 30.

 <p>
  Items in the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  shop do not provide any in-game advantages, but given how rare some of them can be, they often become huge commodities within the community, with many players waiting eagerly for old items to return. Many of them, however, go a long time without ever showing up, such as the Reflex skin that has been absent from
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  for over 2,000 days and counting.

 <p>
  According to known Twitter leaker HYPEX, avid collectors of in-game cosmetics will get another shot at grabbing a couple of the rarer skins as early as tonight, August 27, when the item shop updates and the Bravo Leader skin appears. Those looking to purchase the Trench Raider set will have to wait until the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  item shop goes through its usual cycle on Friday evening, as it will be available starting on August 30.

 <p>
  Several rare skins have been making their return to the item shop in recent months, with sets like the highly sought-after Mogul Masters cosmetics showing up in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  for the first time in a while. There are still plenty of other skins that have yet to make comebacks, but with developer Epic Games' recent focus on returning content from previous seasons, it may only be a matter of time before fans see them once more.

  Luckily, however, the leak also seemingly confirmed the upcoming return of a variety of rare and highly desirable skins and other cosmetic items, many of which are part of major collaborations from previous seasons. Specifically, the player skins from the
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
  </em>
  collaboration event are allegedly set to return on August 29, including related cosmetic items alongside them.

  In any case, players have plenty of options coming up for new skins to deck themselves out with as they go against the various Marvel comic icons that currently reside on the

  Over the weekend,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  experienced DDos attacks yet again. Starting on Friday, the Europe, North America, and Oceania servers were hit by DDoS attacks that lasted for about two hours. During this time, players experienced difficulties logging in and may have experienced lag or disconnects once they got into the game. After a brief reprieve, more attacks transpired on August 25, which this time targeted all data centers. Square Enix says the second attack only lasted half an hour, perhaps indicating that the company is finding better ways to cut down on the impact of the attacks.

 <h2 id="how-ddos-attacks-impact-the-final-fantasy-14-playerbase">
  How DDoS Attacks Impact the Final Fantasy 14 Playerbase
 </h2>
 <p>
  In an online game like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  , DDoS attacks can be a serious problem. All online games have problems they can potentially face from simple DDoS attacks, which can potentially interrupt and change the flow of a game. However,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  has its own problems with DDoS attacks, especially with longer-form content. Lag can make the difference between life or death for player characters when it prevents healers and tanks from acting. However, it's also a massive headache for longer-form content, like raids or deep dungeons. Whether a player is completely disconnected or simply can't act for a moment, it could mean losing plenty of progress and letting down a team.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1265} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Sadly, DDoS attacks have become a fact of life for plenty of online games. While private user data is generally not in any danger, DDoS attacks can ruin a player's day, especially when they're targeting the weekend when more players login. The motives behind the DDoS attacks aren't known, though it may just be a matter of trying to ruin players' fun. For the moment, the servers are back to normal, but players should keep an eye on the game's official Lodestone updates if they notice lag issues, as it could be happening yet again.

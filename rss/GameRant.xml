  Epic Games wants to bring the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  community together for a Community Goal event that will only be available for less than five days. When patch 31.20 dropped, fans were bombarded by a fleet of content. From a brand-new Marvel-themed LTM to a massive
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  update, gamers had plenty to explore after updating their games, and the best part is that they can be rewarded for simply playing
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  .

  Epic Games needs players to log in so they can keep track of their progress and add it to the community objective.
  <strong>
   To contribute to the
   <em>
    Fortnite

   Community Goal, players have to survive storm circles in Battle Royale, Zero Build, or Ranked
  </strong>
  . There are individual objectives and community milestones, so gamers will be able to unlock rewards based on their performance as well as the rest of the fandom.

      <title>Funko Fusion Franchises That Could Headline Their Own Games</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/funko-fusion-franchises-potential-solo-games-invincible-childs-play/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Funko Fusion
   </em>
  </strong>
  has finally arrived, and thanks to its multiversal crossover adventure, so many different franchises are finally getting their time to shine. While players have seen the likes of
  <em>
   Jurassic Park
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Back to the Future
  </em>
  in other games, they are also finally able to explore IPs such as
  <em>
   Invincible, Child's Play, Nope
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Masters of the Universe
  </em>
  , and even
  <em>
   The Umbrella Academy
  </em>
  . Although not all of them may have loads of content, the fact they are present within
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  helps make it a pop culture enthusiast's dream.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's concept is great to see, some of these franchises could actually headline their own video game if given the chance. Much like Traveller's Tales' LEGO games before it, the
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  brand could spin off and deliver all sorts of unique experiences across its many IPs. And the fun would not even have to stop there, as there are countless franchises just waiting to be tapped by the industry.

  10:10 Games Could Follow in the Footsteps of Traveller's Tales With These Franchises
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  is filled to the brim with all of these exciting franchises, with some of them begging to take the spotlight in their own game. As of now, the only one that has really had a similar standalone experience is the
  <em>
   Jurassic Park
  </em>
  IP, thanks to
  <em>
   LEGO Jurassic World
  </em>
  . That game explored four of the six mainline movies in glorious LEGO fashion, and although it might be fun to see the whole franchise from a Funko lens, there are many other series that deserve their time to shine first.

 <p>
  All of these franchises have hours’ worth of content waiting to be explored in a
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  -like game. It would be great to see a game following Rick Grimes' journey through the zombie apocalypse, the Umbrella Academy's fight against the end of the world, or a sci-fi adventure starring their favorite characters from
  <em>
   Battlestar Galactica
  </em>
  . With dozens of characters, locales, and stories waiting to be told, there is no shortage of content in any of these iconic IPs.

  Additionally, Traveller's Tales has yet to tap the majority of these franchises for games of its own. Besides
  <em>
   Jurassic Park
  </em>
  , the only other one is
  <em>
   Back to the Future
  </em>
  . However, unlike
  <em>
   Jurassic Park
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Back to the Future
  </em>
  only appeared as an adventure world within
  <em>
   LEGO Dimensions
  </em>
  . So, it is still waiting for its own fully-fledged adventure, and Funko could give players exactly that. And if it is good, it would not only fill a void left by LEGO, but also be a fantastic treat for fans.

  The Future of Funko Fusion Looks Extremely Bright
 </h3>
 <p>
  While it remains to be seen what the future of
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  entails, there is a ton of potential for an exciting franchise here. 10:10 Games may just forge ahead with adding DLC to
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  or exploring the concept again in a sequel, but it should also try its hand at crafting more standalone projects as well. The approach has worked extremely well for Traveller's Tales over the years, with only
  <em>
   LEGO Dimensions
  </em>
  being a massive multiversal crossover. If it worked for LEGO, then it should work for Funko as well.

  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  has built some strong foundations that 10:10 Games could build upon to make something truly special. With the amount of IPs it already has to play with, there is so much potential for exciting spin-off games. And if that library is not enough, then there are likely dozens more just waiting to have video games of their own.

  After years of dominating the collectible market, Funko has finally entered the AAA gaming space with the newly released
  <strong>
   <em>
    Funko Fusion
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Developed by 10:10 Games,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  has taken dozens of iconic franchises and given them a Funko facelift for a whole new type of adventure. Although many fans may notice that this concept plays pretty much exactly like Traveller's Tales' LEGO games of the past, the way the studio has gone about it seems very different.

  Traveller's Tales' LEGO games have been taking players on wild adventures across some of the biggest franchises imaginable, which has been fantastic to see. However, there are many franchises that it has never touched, as it has mostly stayed within the realm of family-friendly or less niche IPs. And while
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  has also included some heavy hitters, 10:10 Games has also delivered further into pop culture and delivered an experience that feels more catered to adults, which is a welcome change of pace, and may be exactly what collect-a-thon fans have been looking for.

  The Franchises Funko Fusion Includes Cater to a Different Audience
 </h3>
 <p>
  Traveller's Tales' LEGO games first kicked off with
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game
  </em>
  back in 2005. Since then, the franchise has LEGO-fied the likes of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  , Marvel, DC,
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Incredibles
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The LEGO Movie
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Jurassic World
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  . Every single one of these has been injected with the tried-and-true LEGO humor, filled to the brim with exciting things to discover, and has been built as a family co-op experience. And for the most part, they are exploring some of the biggest family-friendly franchises around.

 <p>
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  also takes numerous franchises and delivers a similar type of experience, yet the franchises it has delved into feel a bit more niche and adult-skewing.
  <em>
   Jurassic Park
  </em>
  makes its appearance here as well, however, this version feels a little darker. Along with that, players can explore the likes of
  <em>
   Hot Fuzz
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Jaws
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   M3GAN
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Masters of the Universe
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Nope
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Mummy
  </em>
  , among so many others. While families may watch these films together, they are definitely aimed at an older crowd, with some of them even having an R-rating.

  Funko Fusion's Rating Gives it a New Feel
 </h3>
 <p>
  Exploring more mature franchises is one thing,
  <em>
  </em>
  but
  <em>
   Funko Fusion's
  </em>
  ESRB rating also shows a game that is aimed at an older audience than LEGO. Since its inception, the LEGO games franchise has tried to maintain an E or E 10+ rating, with the entire experience being built around making these IPs even more family-friendly.
  <em>
   Funko Fusion,
  </em>
  on the other hand, is rated T for Teen, due to its violence, blood, and language.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":417} -->
 <p>
  All of this means that
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  looks and feels like it was built for a different type of audience than the LEGO games have been. As Traveller's Tales tries to cater to families, 10:10 Games is seemingly going after an older market, which may be exactly what the game needs. Because although there will likely be some competition, those looking for a more mature experience will know exactly where to look. Plus, the franchises
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  has chosen to adapt are unlike anything LEGO may ever touch, which helps it forge its own path.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":957} -->

 <p>
  It remains to be seen if this approach will pay off for
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  . If anything, fans of these IPs will probably love seeing some of their favorite characters headline a video game, with many of them likely never getting a chance to do so on their own or through LEGO. But, if
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  does succeed, then there may be plenty more adventures like it in store. And if Traveller's Tales is not careful, this more mature co-op experience may come for its crown.

  The original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Guild Wars
   </em>
  </strong>
  impressed gamers with its wide variety of playstyles, in part thanks to its multiclass mechanic. However, while mixing and matching professions yields interesting results, player characters are very much tied to their primary professions.

 <p>
  While these professions have changed over the years with balance updates,
  <em>
   Guild Wars
  </em>
  has not seen any big changes in recent years beyond the 15th-anniversary update. As such, the professions will be ranked according to their viability in today's build across each of Guild Wars' campaigns (not just the endgame), their thematic appeal, and how much fun they are to play moment-to-moment.

  Monks only have one job in any
  <em>
   Guild Wars

  , and that is keeping other players or party members alive. While smiting magic, which bypasses enemy armor and deals double damage to the undead, is part of their skill set, it is only really useful in niche situations. HP upkeep can be fun, but only for those who really enjoy filling that role.

  Generally, a monk player will spend most of their time looking at their party's health bars in a game of reverse whack-a-mole. A more proactive, preemptive health-maintaining playstyle exists, which involves their protection prayer skills, but it is only viable with another monk doing the work of reactive wound-mending.

  Warriors have the most restricted access to energy, and they do not combine well with most caster secondary professions, but taking along a spell or two won't hurt. While the warrior doesn't rank high, it is a perfectly robust class, and besides its mechanics, it has access to some of the coolest armor sets in the game.

  The assassin is a combination of a plucky fighter and a spellcaster best suited to players who enjoy a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. While not as defensible as a warrior, they are capable of delivering a high amount of damage in short bursts, and in an area of effect.

 <p>
  Although they are not as well armored as other melee classes, a well-placed assassin enchantment or shadowstep spell (effectively teleporting) will keep a skilled assassin player alive. They are well-suited to using just about any weapon, including projectile weapons, as the assassin's primary attribute, critical strike, works well with a ranger's bow.

  Although the elementalist is ranked slightly lower for its end-game damage numbers, it is still a fine profession for new players and veterans alike. They gain access to ranged high-damage spells early on, and new players won't have to struggle to learn the game's mechanics for their effectiveness to pay off.

  Their four elements generally perform the same function (fire for area-of-effect damage, earth for damage reduction, air for concentrated damage, and water for movement slowing and healing). Elementalists have an impressive amount of build potential, as their primary attribute, energy storage, allows them to comfortably chain-cast some of the most expensive skills in the game.

 <p>
  Of all the primary professions to choose from, the ranger is probably the most versatile and well-matched with other classes. As well as pairing well with martial or caster professions, the ranger has a lot to look forward to with beast mastery, and collecting and training pets is a serious motivator for many players. Rangers can specialize against certain foes by way of elemental resistance in their armor.

  Rangers are fast and the best "runners" in the game and have many defensive movement skills that can help escort the party from map to map. Their "expertise" primary attribute reduces the cost of marksmanship, trap, pet, and ritual skills, making them fluid and hard-hitting.

  This heavily armored, party-centric class is one of the most powerful player-versus-environment professions in

 <p>
  This profession has an obvious appeal for anyone who has ever dabbled (or has been mildly interested in) the goth aesthetic. Necromancers revel in attrition, creating and spreading debilitating conditions, stealing health through blood magic, and garnering an army of walking corpses made from the flesh of their enemies.

 <p>
  Necromancers thrive on death not only as a source of energy but also through the accumulation of corpses, both of their enemies and allies. They are reliably great members to have in a party, player or hero, especially when they come loaded with a "minion-mancer" build. However, since corpses can be a scarce resource, they tend not to play well with other deathly summoners.

  The dervish is the sublime combination of an aggressive melee fighter and an area-of-effect caster. Their scythes allow them to hit three enemies at once, and their (instantly cast) flash enchantments have an effect when applied and stripped away.

 <p>
  Some attack skills land harder when they remove enchantments, but dervishes enjoy several benefits for being under them, so there is a constant balancing act at play. They hit groups the hardest with their melee attacks but are renowned for their ability to spread conditions. Thematically, it's hard to argue with a hooded, scythe-wielding holy warrior.

 <p>
  For those who prefer set-and-forget play, the ritualist is an excellent choice. The ritualist's core strength is being able to spawn spirits (or the undead) with more vitality and hitting power. Since those spirits have their own AI, the ritualist is able to take care of other things, such as party buffing, offensive casting, or healing.

 <p>
  The ritualist is a great all-rounder, but with a build dedicated to spawning offensive spirits, it can put out some of the highest damage-per-second numbers in the game. In some situations, it can even handle itself out on the battlefield without a party.

  The mesmer offers some of the most interesting mechanical designs in
  <em>
   Guild Wars
  </em>
  and in multiplayer RPGs in general. They are easily one of the most powerful classes in the game, but only in the right hands. Mesmers are not recommended for completely new players, as their power depends on the player's broad knowledge of
  <em>
   Guild Wars
  </em>
  ' skills and mechanics.

  This class can use their enemies' attacks against them, systematically shutting down their energy (by adding it to their own pool) and blocking their skill recharges. This advanced profession (perhaps marked by their elite dress code) can mitigate damage from enemies and quickly strip their foes' health by bypassing their armor entirely.

  Halloween season is now in full swing! Costumes are exiting retirement, candy corn is flying off the shelves, and carved pumpkins are sprouting up in peoples' porches. All things wonderful and wicked are arriving in the world of gaming, with both AAA and indie developers ready to frighten and delight their fans with
  <strong>
   horror
  </strong>
  .

  But not everyone is built to brave these horror games alone, and they might want to rope a friend or several friends into the shenanigans. Fear not, as there are plenty of games designed to be played with friends, and there are even rare single-player experiences that can be enhanced with good company.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a rather divisive game at the time of its release, as it took things a step further than its predecessor,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  , fully leaning into a more action-oriented direction. Then
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  came out, and most fans could shrug and agree that
  <em>
   RE5
  </em>
  might not have been as bad as they first thought, and time has been even kinder to this title.

  Chris Redfield returns with new partner Sheva Alomar as they are sent to apprehend a man in possession of a BOW he plans to sell on the black market. With two characters present at all times, this game was designed with cooperative play in mind, making it a perfect fun horror romp with plenty of lead-fuelled action to share with a best friend or a partner. While it may not seem overly scary at times, players should just wait until they have a shambling monstrosity chasing them through an incinerator.

  Find the odd one out games have become popular in the world of gaming, and have even broken into the horror genre. This is the main aim of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deceit
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as six people wake up in mysterious surroundings, with 2 people infected with the Game Master's virus, tasked with taking down the uninfected who must fight and flee for their lives, and choose who they trust carefully, as they never know if they are the deceitful one.

 <p>
  It is a fun game of cat and mouse players can enjoy together, and it can be delightful to reveal that they are the ones infected before killing their friends in brutal fashion. But playing one of the innocents can also be fun in a totally different way, as every interaction with another player will be fraught with gut-churning tension as they will remain constantly vigilant in case they turn out to be infected.

  Normally, playing horror games with friends disperses the tension of most horror games, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Phasmophobia
   </em>
  </strong>
  might be the one exception to the rule. Even with backup, entering the haunted premises is a test of bravery, and the temptation to generously offer to be the man in the van is always present. This aptly named game will certainly awaken this phobia in its players as they navigate the dark armed with ghost-hunting equipment to determine the nature of the haunting.

 <p>
  But this matter isn't as simple as it is made out to be on paper. Not all devices will generate the evidence needed, as each entity is unique and manifests in different ways. This means players will likely have to leave, swap out equipment, and return, increasing the odds that they will meet their end at the hands of the ghost. And every ghost is hostile, their hunting mode activating under different circumstances which could easily be accidentally triggered by an unwitting player, leading to very scream-inducing situations as they are locked in the building with a vengeful spirit.

  By far,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead by Daylight
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the asymmetrical multiplayer horror game with the most endurance, surviving when all others have died. Four Survivors team up against a single Killer from a veritable cornucopia of options, both original creations and ones licensed from popular horror or horror-adjacent IPs. Killers like Michael Myers, the Demogorgon, and Dracula can all be found stalking the fog for their prey, against survivors such as Leon S Kennedy, Ellen Ripley, and Nicolas Cage.

  With a vast collection of characters on offer, everyone is bound to find the perfect character for them as they flee in terror from the Killer hunting them down. Or, they can bring a fifth friend into the mix and play custom matches, where one will control the Killer to try and hunt down their friends. Whatever way gamers decide to play, they are in for a real scream with the fun and chaotic multiplayer game. What's more, there are always special events around this time of year, with scarily good prizes up for grabs.

  Dressed in orange space suits and armed with silly dances, they must explore the bases on these planets which could be inhabited by all manners of strange beasts, and head back to the ship before automatic take-off at midnight. Trying to avoid painful deaths can be horrifying, but watching a friend's body ragdoll across the corridor as they meet their end at the hands of a turret or thumper can provide some great comic relief, and create memories with friends that will still bring out a chuckle when mentioned weeks later.

  Supermassive Games have become the masters of creating games that feel like interactive movies, leaving the decision of who lives and dies in the players' hands, with a little sprinkling of luck and foresight.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Until Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the game that started the craze, leading to other titles such as
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  . In this game, a group of friends meet up at a lodge the year after two sisters fall to their deaths after a prank gone wrong. Strange occurrences begin taking place in and around the lodge, leading to them believing they are being stalked by a killer, with one shocking twist no one could have seen coming.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  receiving a new lease on life, now is the time to revisit the game with higher graphics and new content, and it can be even better with friends. Everyone can allocate themselves a character within the roster so that a group of friends can see just how they would fare in a horror scenario, and just how many of them could survive the horrors of the night. This would undoubtedly be a fun and new way to experience this game. Ditch watching B-horror movies at the Halloween slumber party, and pick up
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  instead.

  After months of waiting,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stellar Blade
   </em>
  </strong>
  has officially announced a substantial DLC pack coming to the game that may actually include more than just new cosmetics.
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  has teamed up with
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  for a crossover that was arguably destined to happen, and players may be in for a big treat once it releases.

  Concrete details on the

  </em>
  crossover DLC are lacking at the moment, but there are things revealed in its announcement trailer that can serve as trustworthy takeaways. Alongside the DLC,
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  will also finally be receiving a photo mode.

  Stellar Blade Will Finally Be Adding an In-Game Photo Mode
 </h3>
 <p>
  When
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  first launched, it felt strange that it didn't include a photo mode, as a significant emphasis of the game's marketing was on its visuals and character models. However, Shift Up was sure to let players know that if they begged for a photo mode, they would probably get one. Months later, the developer announced that a photo mode would be coming to
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  with its summer update, but it was delayed. Now, better late than never,
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's upcoming
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  crossover will see the long-awaited addition of a photo mode, so players can take pictures of Eve in her new
  <em>
   NieR
  </em>
  -inspired outfits.

 <p>
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's upcoming photo mode looks extensive, to say the least. It appears players will be given plenty of customization options when editing a photo in the game, including the ability to customize the lighting, character poses and facial expressions, depth of field, frames, and more. The character poses and facial expressions, in particular, look highly detailed, more than many games that include similar customization features. Needless to say, enthusiasts and creatives are bound to have fun with
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's photo mode when it arrives.

  Stellar Blade's NieR: Automata DLC May Add Relevant Cosmetics, Quests, and Characters

 <p>
  Shift Up hasn't been forthright about the full extent of
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  crossover DLC, but some assumptions can be drawn based on what was revealed in the announcement trailer for the DLC and content that
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  has received in the past. First and foremost, the trailer for the crossover DLC outright confirms two things: at least one new outfit and location. In the trailer, Eve is shown walking with the Drone, when she all of a sudden transforms into
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  's 2B, suggesting at least a 2B costume for Eve in the DLC.

 <p>
  As the trailer continues, Eve steps out onto the edge of a building and overlooks the city ruins from
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  while the music track from the game begins playing in the background. As such,
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  DLC will likely see Eve transported to an iteration of
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  's city ruins, and it's likely there will even be a
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  -esque version of the city ruins theme song playing in the background as players explore the region. It can only be assumed that with such a major addition coming to the game, there will also be more story content for players to complete, as it might feel rather anticlimactic to introduce a new location with no narrative to give it context.

 <p>
  Shift Up has confirmed that there is more concrete info on the DLC to come, including a release date. It's possible the
  <em>
   Stellar Blade NieR: Automata
  </em>
  crossover DLC could be coming in October, but it feels like the developer would have already disclosed a release date if that were the case. However, no matter what,
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  fans are likely to finally get a DLC pack that is far more substantial than what the game has been putting out since April, although those updates were nothing to complain about.

  The choices you make in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Until Dawn
   </strong>
  </em>
  are essential in ensuring the survival of all eight friends who spend the night on Blackwood Mountain, and the Remake has added a new ending for Josh that's called the "best ending."

  In the original, you could make sure Josh didn't get killed by the enemies hunting down the group of friends, but his other fate was not something fans were particularly happy with either. In essence, it was not possible to give him any kind of happy ending, but Ballistic Moon decided to change that possibility in the Remake if you make the right choices along the way.

  In the original
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  , you had two choices. First, leave Josh to his fate to get his head crushed in by Hannah, or second, leave him in the mines. He would give in to the hunger of being stuck down there and eat the body of the Stranger (Flame-Thrower Guy), and he would turn into a Wendigo like his sister. The two options were quite grim, and fans have long since been asking for a different option to try and save him.

 <p>
  Now, with the Remake, this has finally been made possible. The original two endings are still available, of course, but it all depends on the choices you make. If you want to ensure that Josh doesn't die or turn into a Wendigo, then you're going to need to show some remorse for his actions.

  When Josh is revealed as the Psycho who's been tormenting his friends, his face will also be revealed as the person who's been hallucinating and talking with Dr. Hill. In this scene, when the doctor asks "Why did you hurt them?", you need to
  <strong>
   respond with "They hurt me."
  </strong>
  Then, when the therapist berates him for the fact that this was not the way to go, you need to
  <strong>
   select "I'm so sorry"
  </strong>
  when you get the next dialogue prompt.

 <p>
  The second thing you need to do is find Hannah's diary when you're down in the mines with Mike and Sam. When you reach the section where you need to climb in the water and wade your way out to find Josh, turn left before heading forward and continuing the story. Look for the large water wheel as your point of reference here, as the ledge is climbable before you pass it. There's a small ledge here that you can climb up, and Hannah's diary that she kept is just ahead of you on this small ledge.

  Once Sam has read the diary, she will relay the information she found to Josh when she and Mike find him. This means that when you try and escape the mine with Mike and Josh gets grabbed by Hannah, she will recognize him, and she won't kill him.

  Previously, these were the steps you needed to follow if you wanted to give Josh a chance, but then he would turn into a Wendigo. Now, though, it's heavily implied that Josh is able to escape the mines at the end of the game. The scene now starts with a flashlight - who we can assume to be the police interviewing the group - shining on a door in the mines. You see the hanging body of the stranger, and the scene ends with Josh sitting and waiting for his rescue and redemption.

  Because he shows remorse for what he did to his friends during his therapist session, and because Hannah recognized and did not kill him, he does not eat the body of the stranger and turn into a Wendigo, which is how this ended in the original

  A surprised player of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy
   </em>
  </strong>
  has uncovered an interesting feature that allows them to give beasts names, something they didn't realize they could in the game until they reached level 36. Developed by Avalanche Software and released in 2023,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  delves into the wizardry world of Harry Potter, where players roam the iconic Hogwarts School with an array of magical abilities on a journey to unveil an ancient secret hidden within its fantasy world.

 <p>
  Since the game's release,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  has reached incredible sales milestones where it snagged the title of the best-selling game on the UK's weekly sales charts, beating other 2023 games like
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  and "Game of the Year" winner
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  . While there are tons of places to explore and puzzles to solve in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , one player was left amazed at a feature they found much later in the game.

 <p>
  In a post on Reddit,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  player Haunted_Souls came across an exciting feature in the game that allowed them to give beasts they found their own personal names. The stunned player said that they only realized they could name their captured creatures once they reached level 36. Using a fantasy name generator, Haunted_Souls give their beastly pets unique and cute nicknames by going to the Vivarium, opening the beast inventory, and then selecting a beast at the bottom they wanted to rename.
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  has 13 magical beasts that players can catch in different locations with their Nab-Sacks after completing the quest: The Elf, The Nab-Sack, and the Loom.

  Seemingly, Haunted_Souls wasn't the only
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  player who didn't know they could rename captured creatures. One Redditor said that they had no idea beasts could have their own nicknames until they were on their fourth playthrough, while another comment said they had already completed the game without knowing this interesting nugget of knowledge. Although rescuing normal beasts will always be a fun way to capture various magical creatures and care for them,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  's shiny beasts can also add a flair of rarity to the player's collection.

  Just like many other games,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  has many secrets and hidden features that sometimes aren't easy to find. Recently, a player found out that the Hogsmeade poltergeist in the game
  <em>
  </em>
  will have different dialogue depending on the player's house, while a fan uncovered a
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  Easter egg that provides a throwback to Dumbledore in previous
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  games.

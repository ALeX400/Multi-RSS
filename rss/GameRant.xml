      <title>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Can't Cut Corners with One Section of the Original Game</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's
   </em>
  </strong>
  final moments set the stage for players’ trek toward the final confrontation with Sephiroth. However, the title still has many memorable events and locations to adapt from the 1997 original.
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  concluded with a whirlwind of events, doubling down on its original elements, such as alternate timelines, altered fates, and unique team-ups. With so many threads left dangling in
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   FF7 Remake
  </em>
  Project's final installment may have to alter or skip some segments from the original
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  . While some of these segments may no longer prove essential to the
  <em>
   Remake Project
  </em>
  ’s story,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3
  </em>
  can't cut corners with one section of the original game.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  saw some of the original
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  ’s most iconic and emotional set pieces adapted uniquely, setting the course for a thrilling final installment in
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  . Particularly, the title utilized flashbacks, alternate timelines, and new characters to embolden and extend its character arcs and mysterious new elements. The best of these segments occur when a major character is telling a story, unconscious, or otherwise detained, transforming slower parts of the original title into major events for the
  <em>
   Remake
  </em>
  Project
  <em>
   ’
  </em>
  s narrative. In the portion of the original that will be covered in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3
  </em>
  , one segment stands out as a perfect opportunity to continue the trend.

  The original
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  sees Cloud fall into the lifestream following "That Which Waits in the Northernmost Reaches," before being found and hospitalized in the village of Mideel. Tifa and the party find Cloud there, in a vegetative state due to Mako poisoning. Cloud’s hospitalization opens the door to a significant portion of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  , where other party members take the spotlight for a while. Tifa stays with Cloud, but the others head to North Corel and Fort Condor, battling Shinra for the Huge Materia. A series of earthquakes soon occur, leading Tifa, Cloud, and Mideel to be swallowed up in a portion of the lifestream. While there, Tifa explores Cloud’s subconscious, allowing her to piece together his memories and remember his true past.

  While Mideel offers Tifa, Cid, and the party a greater focus,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3
  </em>
  could see some of the spotlight returned to Cloud, as it offers the perfect opportunity to deviate from the original title. During Cloud’s time in a vegetative state,
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  could see another
  <em>
   FF7
  </em>
  flashback chapter explored, giving players an even deeper insight into the character’s true history and identity. Given
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  ’s storyline, Cloud could even explore alternate histories, where past iterations took branching paths while trying to make sense of which events are true. This set piece could be extended with Tifa’s exploration of the same, turning the segment into a cooperative piecing-together of Cloud’s memories, before he is restored in the present.

  Another option could see

  ’s Cloud cross over into another timeline entirely, as he did with Aerith in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  . Cloud could awaken in another universe, following his first fall into the lifestream, potentially crossing paths with Zack again. Mideel stands as one of the most critical sections in the original
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  , as its importance to the overall narrative and growth of the main party sets the course for the title’s final act. Together, these elements and the potential for unique expansion make a compelling case for Mideel’s full exploration in

  is a lengthy title, with a playtime of approximately 30-40 hours, depending on how much side content you choose to explore. This is a substantial amount of gameplay for what is primarily a linear game. However, many players are looking for even more value, and the game delivers.

  also features a secret ending that you can unlock, but you’ll need to complete several challenges to experience it.

  Throughout your journey in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , there will be several bosses you must have missed. While these encounters might be optional, they're still worth pursuing, as some of these fights are even better than the main boss battles. Some of these bosses are well-hidden, while others you may have ignored intentionally after multiple defeats.

  Revisiting these bosses after completing the game is a great idea, as your character and skills will be at their peak, making these fights less punishing than they might have been earlier.

  The world of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  might not be as expansive as
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , but it’s still packed with secrets. You likely missed a lot of content in your initial playthrough, whether it’s transformations, spells, weapons, armor sets, or hard-to-acquire armor upgrades. So, revisit your previous save file and gather everything you missed. Also, unlock all Journal Entries (Portraits) to receive a reward later on.

  One of the greatest satisfactions of replaying a challenging game is easily defeating enemies that once gave you a tough time. Plus, you can finally focus on the bosses without worrying about upgrading your gear. Fortunately, you can do just that in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  . After reaching the game’s ending, you can start a New Game Plus and replay the entire game with all your previously unlocked gear, including weapons, armor, skills, and more. Everything except Key Items will carry over.

  Additionally, NG+ introduces a new spell called Life-Saving Strand, which grants you a second life. Chests that previously contained pills will now reward you with more Will. That’s just a taste of what awaits you in your NG+ playthrough, so be sure to check it out and get your $60 worth. However, don’t expect NG+ to be a walk in the park just because you have your gear. Enemies scale with your level, so they can still send you back to the Keeper’s Shrine if you’re not careful.

      <title>13 Open-World Games With Purposefully Empty Maps</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/open-world-games-purposefully-empty-maps/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Open-world games come in a wide variety of shapes and forms, and every developer has their own ideologies about what makes games fun and engaging. One way in which open-world games differ is not only in the size of their map, but how densely populated the map is with locations, characters, and most importantly, things to do.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":328} -->

 <p>
  While many games aim for a perfect balance where a map is engaging but strays away from over-saturation, other open-world games purposefully have relatively sparse or even empty maps for a myriad of reasons. For example, games that emphasize survival and natural exploration often lean towards more empty maps, and similarly historical games that are all about immersion can often feel more realistic with sparse rural maps.

  <em>
   There are many ways in which an open-world game can be considered empty. For example, with the right atmosphere and a lack of NPCs, a game can give off the impression of feeling alone in a vast world, while still giving players plenty to do.
  </em>

 <p>
  A game can also purposefully choose to have less content with the aim of making moments of action or intrigue hit harder. As more and more developers step away from cluttered maps, fans can expect to see more purposefully empty worlds in upcoming open-world titles.

  While both
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption
   </em>
  </strong>
  games make good use of empty open space, it is more present in the first game, where solitude and isolation from the world are key to the story and overall atmosphere. It is incredibly relaxing to traverse the vast plains or the southern desert with no one for company but a trusty steed, and yet there is still so much to be found.

  From random encounters and wildlife to thriving towns and ranches, the world of

  is far from empty in actuality, but the heart and soul of the game certainly lies out in the open.

  Based on the popular film franchise of the same name, the 2015 open-world game
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mad Max
   </strong>
  </em>
  , was always going to take place in an unforgiving barren landscape full of sand. While this might not seem like the ideal setting for a game, the developers made intelligent use of the empty space, in a way that makes every discovery or sign of life more significant.

 <p>
  If players had to walk through these lands, the game would quickly become boring, but behind the wheel of customized vehicles and with no speed limits to worry about, The Wasteland quickly becomes a playground. With survival through sheer grit being a key motif of the franchise, stumbling on an abandoned town only to realize it is overrun with bandits before narrowly escaping, feels incredibly satisfying.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Kenshi
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a true sandbox game where players can do whatever they like with their time and the world they inhabit. As such, emptiness is intended in parts of the map, especially as this provides land for players to build their own settlements. There is also plenty of space for random encounters to spawn, making every playthrough feel unique.

 <p>
  The relative emptiness of
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  also plays into its post-apocalyptic world where only the tough survive, and the overall atmosphere is thus one of death. However, while this may sound like a game played in isolation, the opposite can in fact be true thanks to the game's squad system. Players can design their own companions who will start out just as weak as they are, or they can recruit others from around the world.

  <em>
   <strong>
    No Man's Sky
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an open-world survival game that is somewhat empty even though it boasts a mind-boggling 18 quintillion planets. Nevertheless, this emptiness plays into the game's hands, as nothing is more rewarding than finding life in a vast solar system or galaxy.

 <p>
  Planets themselves feel mostly empty even though they are often full of flora, fauna, and minerals, and this is likely due to the lack of sentient life in most places. When players come across outposts or enter space stations, the feeling of returning to civilization after time alone in the abyss hits hard.

 <p>
  In some ways,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  is not empty at all, as it is full of bosses and bands of lesser enemies to kill. However, with a lack of NPCs, civilizations, or even signs of life such as farms,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  feels empty and this is entirely on purpose. As players traverse the Lands Between, it feels as though they are one of the remnants of a dying world that is beyond repair.

 <p>
  Signs of long-lost life in the architecture tell stories that words alone cannot, and yet, despite this eerie setting, the world is far from empty. With how the map is designed, enemies and secret locations are often hidden in such ways that make them missable from certain angles, but when players travel back in the opposite direction or actively explore, they will find untold horrors and beauty in abundance.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Death Stranding
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a game that is all about emptiness, and it is up to the protagonist to try to reconnect the fragments of a shattered modern world. Players are supposed to feel isolated, and like negative space in art, the mostly empty world is terrifyingly beautiful.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The game excels at environmental storytelling, with one of the most haunting aspects being hearing distant sounds that hint at life or danger while trekking through the mountains.
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  is certainly not for everyone, but for those who enjoy a slow-paced immersive experience with heartfelt moments, it is a must-play.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft

  </strong>
  is an open-world sandbox game and its emptiness is the exact reason why people love it so much, and end up sinking endless hours of time into it. The whole point of the game is for players to create their own worlds and games which they can then share with friends or even the world.

 <p>
  The blank slate nature of the game opens up a world of creativity, and players will soon discover that they can never get bored as there are so many things to do in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . Of course, players can eventually turn their originally empty world into a sprawling fantasy metropolis, as almost anything is possible.

   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most immersive historical games of all time. Set in a small region of war-torn Bohemia as seen in 1403, it is a gritty, down-to-earth medieval masterpiece. Given the game's rural setting, it is only natural that KCD's map is fairly sparsely populated outside of the small towns.

 <p>
  This is by no means a detriment to the game, as players are better able to enjoy the rolling hills and vibrant fields of springtime Bohemia. Furthermore, when characters or events are waiting in store, they feel more like a pleasant surprise rather than simply ticking off markers on a map.

  Vast expanses of emptiness can most certainly be terrifying in certain contexts, and this is most definitely true for the first-person horror survival game
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Forest

  . Either alone or with their friends, players are the lone survivors of a plane crash and must find food, shelter, and weapons for themselves on an island infested with cannibals.

  Other than a massive sinkhole in the middle of the island and various cannibal settlements scattered around, most of the map is empty, giving players a choice for where they build their base. Despite the map being mostly empty, every step players take in
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  is terrifying as it is undoubtedly one of the best horror games of recent years.

  As the game allows and encourages players to make settlements of their own, it is only fitting that the map is fairly empty with plenty of great locations to build villages. There are other settlements, with NPCs who sell important goods or who can be recruited, but otherwise, the map can be seen as a rural playground.

  Sometimes in both life and gaming, it is about the journey, not the destination, and that is exactly the case with
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Crew 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This open-world Motorsport game lets players compete online in races all across the USA, and as such, has an incredibly large but fairly empty map that allows the focus to remain on racing.

  One open-world game that undoubtedly has a purposefully empty map is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Valheim
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a charming survival and exploration game inspired by Norse Mythology. The map is procedurally generated and is made up of different biomes that get progressively harder.

 <p>
  Outside of randomly spawned dungeons, and a small selection of bosses which players summon, the world is pretty much empty with only the remnants of abandoned villages scattered throughout. Instead, the expansive map is there for players to make into their own, with a fantastic building system.

    Persona 3 Reload

  will soon release its long awaited epilogue with Episode Aigis: The Answer. The Answer will provide closure to players and SEES alike, and is most definitely the game's most ambitious DLC yet. In fact, it's quite possible that
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  may be using its take on The Answer as a trial run for the future of the series and its release strategy.

  The
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  series has long been known for putting out enhanced versions of its games years after their initial release.
  <em>
   Persona 5 Royal
  </em>
  is just the most recent example, but others such as
  <em>
   Persona 4 Golden
  </em>
  have been similarly successful. This has become a core part of Atlus' brand strategy, even extending to other series with titles like
  <em>
   Catherine: Full Body
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  doesn't fit into this category, and Episode Aigis: The Answer may signal that Atlus' priorities have shifted.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Persona 5 Royal
  </em>
  and its peers are upgraded re-releases,
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  is a full scale remake. The series has experimented with a similar approach in the past with the original remakes of
  <em>
   Persona 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Persona 2
  </em>
  . However, the series has come a long way since, and this advancement helped quite a lot with
  <em>

  's ambition.

 <p>
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload

  will soon release its own take on The Answer, an epilogue which was first introduced in

  .
  <em>
   FES
  </em>
  was itself an expanded re-release of the original
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  , with many considering its version of The Answer to be the definitive version of the story.
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  has already excelled as a remake of the original, and Episode Aigis may turn out to be the cherry on top.

  The Answer Outclasses Persona 3 Reload's Other DLC

 <p>
  Episode Aigis is set to release September 10, and already looks to be one of the series' most ambitious DLC yet. Many modern
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games simply use their DLC to stack additional bells and whistles onto the game, such as costumes or extra Personas to fuse. There's nothing wrong with this approach, but the change of pace shown by
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  may have bigger implications for
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  and beyond.

  If Episode Aigis is anything like the original version of The Answer, it may take more than thirty hours to complete. In fact, recent trailers have shown enough information to suggest that
  <em>
   R eload
  </em>
  's take on The Answer may have additional content. Whether or not Episode Aigis is longer than its predecessor or not, it's still a massive edition to the base game. This makes it much more ambitious than other recent
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  DLC, and hopefully marks a bright future for the next
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  game.

  There's already been plenty of speculation that Atlus will pursue more

  <em>
   Persona 2
  </em>
  or even
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  could be waiting in the wings, for example. However, it's possible that
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  was hiding another path forward for the series this whole time.
  <em>
   Persona 6
  </em>
  could ditch the re-release tradition, and follow in the footsteps of
  <em>
   Reload
  </em>
  's DLC.

  The Answer will seemingly add a significant amount of content, enough that it could easily be compared to the content added by enhanced re-releases in the past. Rather than adding something through a re-release, as seen in
  <em>
   Persona 5 Royal
  </em>
  's third semester, future titles could instead add these final chapters through DLC. Of course, there are downsides to this perspective.

 <p>
  Although it wasn't a part of the original game's narrative, The Answer is now seen as essential, so much so that the decision to not include it in
  <em>
   Reload
  </em>
  at launch was cause for controversy. It would be a shame if future
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games took a similar approach, and made players pay for a conclusion to the game's story. In fairness, it wouldn't be too dissimilar from the current re-release format, but DLC comes at a lower price point regardless. Furthermore, ambitious DLC would overall provide a more sustainable future for the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  series.

  An
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has physically tested how many steps it takes to walk across the game's notoriously massive open world. The developer of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
  </em>
  , Bethesda Game Studios, is currently busy cooking up
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6.
  </em>
  With
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  having released a year ago, the sixth
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  game has become Bethesda Game Studios' top priority, but the wait remains long.

 <p>
  One of the things that made
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
  </em>
  stand out when it was released in 2011 was the sheer size and variety of its open world. While
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is slightly smaller than its predecessor,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  , it houses Tamriel's tallest mountain, the Throat of the World, and a number of different types of biomes, from snowy forests to dangerous swamplands.
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's world also features many major cites, with some of the biggest being Riften, Markarth, and Solitude.

  The number of steps it takes to walk across
  <em>
   Skyrim'
  </em>
  s huge open world has been discovered by one determined
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  fan. ShakeMistake posted a one-minute fast-forwarded clip on Reddit showing themself using peripheral controls to physically walk from
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's Riften in the southeast all the way up to Solitude in the northwest corner of the map. The epic journey took a grand total of 14,000 steps, and while ShakeMistake didn't mention how long it took, it can be assumed such a trip takes at least a couple of hours.

  ShakeMistake noted that they had AI detection turned off for the duration of the trip, as such a task would've been nigh impossible otherwise. The challenge came to an end at the gates of Solitude, but there's still another small stretch of land northwest of the city toward the coast that may have added even more steps. Though, it's possible ShakeMistake may have just wanted to go the distance between two of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's farthest cities. Some commenters brought up the 7,000 steps to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's High Hrothgar monastery near the top of the Throat of the World, which ShakeMistake also tested and found that it only takes 2,500 to reach the monastery, 3,500 to get to the top of the mountain, but 7,000 steps total upon coming back down.

  Gamers who are interested in similar video game open world challenges should keep an eye on ShakeMistake's page, as they've posted videos accomplishing similar feats in games like
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball
  </em>
  , and even Ubisoft's recently released
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  . It's cool to see all the creative ways the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  community is keeping busy in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  during the long, ongoing wait for
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  .

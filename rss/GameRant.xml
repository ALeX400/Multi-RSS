  The Reef has fallen to lawlessness, and now the most-wanted criminals in the galaxy – the Barons &amp; Uldren Sov – have organized a jailbreak at the Prison of Elders. You and Cayde-6 have been sent in to bring law and order back to the embattled facility, but things do not go to plan. Facing insurmountable odds, Cayde-6 ends up paying the ultimate price. Beyond the Vanguard’s authority, you’ll venture into the Reef alone and take justice into your own hands. Explore new regions, awaken new powers, earn a wealth of new weapons, and uncover lost Awoken secrets. The hunt is on.

  There's nothing quite like the feeling of having free rein to pilot a giant robot as far as the eye can see. While there's currently no system in place for average folks to live out their wildest
  <em>
   Pacific Rim
  </em>
  fantasies in the real world, video games have provided the opportunity. Yet, the limitations of these games can be somewhat frustrating for some fans.

 <p>
  Still, there are video games where piloting a giant mecha isn't just fun, but players also get to use it to explore a vast, open world. These six games are exactly what gamers might be looking for in a free-spirited sci-fi adventure, although getting to the part where fans get to pilot a mech may be a challenge on its own in some.

   <em>
    Phantom Galaxies
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been in early access since November 2023, meaning that there are still a lot of kinks to be worked out for the final version. It makes sense, given how ambitious this Steam release is, allowing players to freely explore a sci-fi universe piloting giant mechs and battling others they come across on their journeys.

  The game features four distinct classes of mech fighters: Assault, Lancer, Buster, and Breacher, each offering different specs. While it may not be as polished as some of the other games here, keep an eye out for its full release!

  <strong>
   <em>
    Sand Land
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a video game adaptation of the iconic manga and anime series created by Akira Toriyama. Released earlier in 2024, the game is an action RPG allowing players to explore the open desert world. However, much like the anime, most of the game revolves around players building tanks and machinery to battle fearsome enemies.

 <p>
  What makes this an especially strong mecha game is the customization involved in creating players' vehicles, from
  <em>
   Gundam
  </em>
  -esque robot suits to fully loaded race cars. Particularly for fans of the anime, there's a lot to love about this action-packed RPG, but even for those unfamiliar with the source material, it's still fun to play around in giant machines.

  For fans of mecha games,
  <em>
   Steambot Chronicles
  </em>
  is a certified classic. The PlayStation 2 game was released back in 2005 and was incredibly ahead of its time in terms of offering a sandbox adventure featuring giant robots. Players inhabit "Trotmobiles" for a variety of purposes, from transportation to battling.

 <p>
  Like
  <em>

  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Steambot Chronicles
   </em>
  </strong>
  even featured a wide array of customization options that can change aspects of a player's Trotmobile, making them slower and stronger or faster and frail. It's a shame the series never took off, as fans could only imagine how expansive the series would be on current-gen consoles.

  Among the more notable mecha games is 2013's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warframe
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which has had a steady life on current-gen consoles over the years, and even made its way to iOS earlier in 2024. The MMO shooter places a heavy emphasis on the titular giant mechs, offering a variety of game modes, including PvP shooter, RPG, and parkour levels.

 <p>
  What's especially fascinating about
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  is how updates included new open-world areas, like the Plains of Eidolon, allowing players to explore in their mech suits. Despite being over a decade old,
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  continues to age extremely well for an open-world mech game that's free-to-play, aside from pesky microtransactions.

  There was a lot of hype around
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon Zero Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  when it was first released in 2017 for PS4. While the series has since been updated with sequels for PlayStation 5 (as well as ports for PC), the original game is the most straightforward and flawless experience the franchise has yet to offer, though it has one major difference to other games mentioned already.

 <p>
  Namely,
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  centers on a hunter named Aloy who ventures through an open world filled with mechanical creatures known as Machines. Rather than an adventure in a giant mech suit, players spend most of the game taking on quests where they must fight these giant robots, though some creatures can be rewired into mounts to ride around on.

  The
  <em>
   Xenoblade
  </em>
  franchise has always been massive in scale, even from its first installment on the Nintendo Wii.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Xenoblade Chronicles X
   </em>
  </strong>
  , however, blows all the others out of the water, as players can operate giant mechs known as Skells to explore the vast and diverse open world of Mira. However, Skells can't be unlocked until close to halfway through the main story.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":961} -->

 <p>
  While the first half of the game is exciting enough as an open-world action RPG, getting to battle and explore in Skells completely changes how players interact with the environment. Overall,
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  is the perfect game for those wanting an open-world mecha experience, though sadly for now it's exclusive to the Wii U.

      <title>Should You Give the Gambler Money in Star Wars Outlaws?</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Most of the big decisions in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Outlaws
   </em>
  </strong>
  force players to choose one criminal syndicate over another. This isn't always the case though, as players will occasionally find themselves running into NPCs who ask them for a favor, one of whom is a down-on-his-luck gambler who can be found in Mirogana.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":309} -->

 <p>
  If players interact with the NPC in question, Kay will instantly recognize him as a gambler, and after confirming as much, he'll ask her to lend him some cash.
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  players can either give the gambler 100 Credits, 500 Credits, or leave, although those who like free money will probably want to avoid that last option.

  If players do decide to give the gambler money, he'll go on to hit the jackpot and will give Kay her money back plus an extra 50%. With this in mind,
  <strong>
   players should give the gambler 500 Credits
  </strong>
  , as this will result in them getting 750 Credits back a little further down the line. To get their money, they'll simply need to complete a main story quest, a side quest, or a contract and then return and speak to the gambler in Mirogana.

  The gambler can be found sitting at a table outside
  <strong>
   the Canto Fathier Racing betting station
  </strong>
  , which is opposite the entrance to Makal's Gambling Parlor (the place where players have to find a way into Gorak's suite). He's fairly easy to spot, as he'll have a white dot above his head, indicating that players can speak with him by pressing the right analog stick. After he wins the jackpot and gives players their money, he'll leave this area for good, so this is very much a one-time thing.

      <title>7 Consoles With The Best Open-World Games Library</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Video games seemingly work best when they find a creative blend of emulating real life and forging dynamic game systems. As such, most recent titles don't force players down endless rows of industrial corridors. Instead, vast open worlds have taken precedence as one of the gaming landscape's most prolific genres.
 </p>

  As such, the open-world genre has an immense amount of variety; as the world itself can be shaped and molded to the whim of the developer — from gritty depictions of real-life locales and mystical fantasy realms to multi-platform (and console exclusive) genre-defining experiences. This list will delve into the vast gaming catalogs of the most popular consoles to determine which consoles are home to the best open-world game libararies.

  Gaining ports of the open-world genre-defining
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3
  </em>
  , alongside its many sixth-generation sequels, Microsoft also had access to some chart-topping open-world exclusives. Bethesda's
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series first came to console with the console-exclusive release of
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  on the Xbox in 2002. Beyond that, with its dynamic karma system, Xbox's first-party franchise
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  also revolutionized the open-world landscape.

  Bethesda seemingly hit its open-world RPG stride as they enjoyed the groundbreaking successes of both
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  while producing the most stable console experience available on Xbox. Beyond this, the record-shattering sales of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  began on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2015, with a whole host of other Western and Japanese RPGs and other open-world titles elaborating on a blockbuster Xbox 360 library lineup.

  and

  and
  <em>

  . Bolstering this lineup were more experimental exclusive titles such as Hideo Kojima's open-world courier-esque title,

  The open-world genre found its magnum opus in October 2001, when Rockstar North's
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3
  </em>
  launched on Sony's console. Beyond
  <em>
   GTA 3
  </em>
  's success, the PlayStation 2 was also home to its multiple sixth-generation sequels and multiple first-party open-world exclusives. From artistic statements like
  <em>
   Shadow of the Colossus
  </em>
  to best-rated movie tie-ins like
  <em>
   Spider-man 2
  </em>
  , the PS2 was home to many genre-defining experiences.

  While the Nintendo Switch hybrid console is home to multiple genre-defining open-world experiences, the acclaim bestowed on the console's launch title,

  Redefining not only the
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  series but the open-world genre,
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  was bolstered by its much-loved sequel,
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , six years later. Beyond these releases, Nintendo's first-party open-world support extended to include the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series' first mainline console titles and the
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicle
  </em>
  s series' continued expansion with
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
  </em>
  In addition to these first-party titles, many open-world classics — such as
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Minecraft

  A talented bunch of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Halo
   </em>
  </strong>
  enthusiasts united to bring to life the entire Noble Team from the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  series through a remarkably accurate cosplay. The Noble Team is a unit under UNSC's Special Warfare Command Group Three in
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  's lore and has been featured in mainline games like 2010's
  <em>
   Halo: Reach
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  For more than two decades,
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  has captivated players and established itself as a top FPS series. Its immense success and rich legacy have also made the IP synonymous with Xbox consoles. As a matter of fact, the franchise is also a popular subject for various kinds of fan art, ranging from a
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  helmet replica to entire costumes put together by dedicated fans.

  In a Reddit post, user MHCreativeGrain shared that they got together with their friends to create an impeccable cosplay of the Noble Team from the long-running
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  series. The pictures, taken "a few weeks back," depicted team members, including Carter-A259, Catherine-B320, Emile-A239, Jorge-052, Jun-A266, and Spartan-B312. The
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  cosplayer, who was dressed up as Jun, revealed that the team cosplay involved "a years [sic] worth of work, collaboration and some R&amp;D." They added that successfully pulling off the team cosplay allowed them to "make a dream of mine come true." Further, they announced that the group would have "more gatherings" suited up as the Noble Team in the future.

  The images show the Noble Team members from different angles, fully equipped with their gear and weapons, which suggests the cosplay was meticulously planned down to the last detail. In the comments, several
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  fans showered praise on the cosplayers, noting the top-notch quality of the costumes. A user wrote, "Yall [sic] look so awesome. Straight from the game." Another fan commended them and pointed out seeing the group cosplay at a local event. One of the users joked, "... Thought these were some of those insane 1/6 figures."

  It has been nearly three years since the last
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  game,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  , came out and fans have been eagerly waiting for an announcement regarding the series' next destination. With other popular Xbox-owned IPs like
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  set to get their respective sequels in the near future, there is growing anticipation for the next
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  title to be revealed sooner than later.

   Halo
  </em>
  's 25th anniversary approaching in 2026, there are new rumors circulating that hint at Xbox planning something big for fans of the franchise for the milestone day. While there is little clarity about what the rumored plans entail, many fans hope that it is related to the next chapter in the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  saga.

  <em>
   Jujutsu Rumble New Era
  </em>
  codes.

  In addition to being able to play as your favorite character in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Rumble New Era
  </em>
  , you can also follow the storyline of the original series. So, with each new battle, players face stronger enemies, including special-grade curses. To survive, you need to level up your characters and upgrade their equipment. This requires investing a lot of resources, which, fortunately, can be obtained with the help of
  <em>
   Jujutsu Rumble New Era
  </em>
  codes.

  They are a great source of free goodies, as they are available almost from the very beginning of the game. In other words, if you are lucky enough to summon the desired 5-star character, you can immediately upgrade them to a high level.

      <title>How Frostpunk 2 Embraces its Dystopian Themes</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  According to most definitions, a dystopia refers to a society in which there's great suffering and injustice. Dystopian themes and settings have been popular for well over 100 years, with some of the first novels credited with pioneering the genre having been published in the early 1900s. Naturally, these dystopian themes have appeared across all kinds of entertainment mediums, and that includes video games like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Frostpunk 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  .

  2018's
  <em>
   Frostpunk
  </em>
  showed how quickly players could sacrifice their humanity and morals for the sake of the greater good, but
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  speeds that process up even faster.
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  is a piece of dystopian fiction through and through, and that's evident pretty much from the moment the game's intro cinematic plays.

  Frostpunk 2 Is a Post-Apocalyptic Survival City-Builder
 </h3>
 <p>
  Without getting too into the weeds with its lore,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  is set during a post-apocalypse, with its world having just suffered a catastrophic event known as the Great Frost. This Great Frost has covered the world in a thick layer of ice and snow, and it's believed that the vast majority of humanity has succumbed to the cold.
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  sees players assume the role of the leader of one of humanity's last known cities, and their primary task is ensuring the survival of its people, whatever the cost.

  Frostpunk 2 Puts Players In Charge of Their Own Dystopia
 </h3>
 <p>
  Naturally,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  's post-apocalyptic setting lays the perfect groundwork for some dystopian fiction, and it doesn't take long for that to rear its head. When beginning
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  's campaign or its Utopia Builder, players will likely set out to create an ideal society where every citizen is equal, food and resources are abundant, and everyone is free to pursue their own goals and dreams. But
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  has other ideas.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":428} -->
 <p>
  Every few minutes or so,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  will present players with a dilemma, and ask them to make a decision then and there on the matter.
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  's twist is that the vast majority of these dilemmas only have morbid solutions. For instance, some of
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  's very first moral dilemmas occur in its prologue, when the player needs to stockpile enough food for an oncoming whiteout. It's made repeatedly clear to the player that failing to stockpile food within the time limit will result in a game over.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":935} -->

 <p>
  With that at the forefront of players' minds,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  delivers a handful of ghoulish prompts. Players are asked if they want to hunt a pack of seals that have just appeared on the settlement's shores, and if they want to allow the group's elders to walk off into the Frostlands to lower the amount of food they need to stockpile.

 <p>
  Once players finish the prologue and take charge of New London, they're given these moral dilemmas at an even more frequent rate, and solutions are often just as macabre.
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  requires the player to use the sequel's Law system and Idea Tree to try and make life better for New London's citizens, but there's only so much the player can achieve at once, essentially requiring the player to prioritize certain groups of people. It doesn't take long before players can find themselves in control of their very own Orwellian state, complete with government-issued soldiers patrolling the streets in search of citizens they can brutally push back in line.

  One of the largest scale toys-to-life games, and another brilliant addition to the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   <strong>
    LEGO Dimensions
   </strong>
  </em>
  gave fans of the brick-breaking series access to a massive number of characters from across a whole slew of unexpected titles. The classic adventure features simple combat, countless collectibles, and levels that present the best moments from the stories they tell. Featuring levels and playable characters like the DC superheroes, the wizards of the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  series, and even Beetlejuice and The Goonies, fans of any property will find something for them here.

 <p>
  The characters each have playgrounds to be let loose in, vehicles and contraptions to play with, and will all band together to save the block-built universe. While this game followed the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  game formula for the most part, the inclusion of physical play with a toys-to-life aspect made the whole game a unique mashup that is mostly for fans of LEGO rather than the properties that star in it.

  Perhaps the most iconic mashup game of all time, one that raised the bar for fighting games and crossover titles alike,
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  is a series that pits hugely popular video game characters against each other in recognizable locations. While each
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  title is a perfect example of how to effectively cross over games,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
   </em>
  </strong>
  sets itself apart by following through on its promise: "Everyone is here."

  Players can choose between Nintendo
  <em>
  </em>
  mascots like Mario, Pikachu, and Link, but guest characters allow for fighters from all across gaming history to make appearances and represent the best that video games have to offer. Whether it be modern classics like
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  or pioneers of genre like Snake of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  fame,
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  manages to ride the line between being an exciting party game, a competitive fighter, and a showcase for the best of gaming history.

  Following in the footsteps of the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Funko Fusion
   </em>
  </strong>
  uses the visuals of the collectible figures styled after countless movies and TV shows and lets players loose in a variety of stories. A collectathon adventure that sets itself apart from the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  games, fans can jump into the worlds of
  <em>
   He-Man, The Umbrella Academy, Hot Fuzz, Battlestar Galactica,
  </em>
  and even
  <em>
   Five Nights At Freddy's
  </em>
  .

  The sheer range of missions on offer makes this a contender for the crossover game with the widest scope. The game clearly tries to strike a balance;
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  wants to endear itself to fans of the original properties and give a faithful experience while wrapping the whole thing in a cartoony, approachable package that can appeal to new or unfamiliar fans as well.

  Another fighting game that pits unexpected characters against each other,
  <strong>
   <em>
    MultiVersus
   </em>
  </strong>
  lets fan-favorite
  <em>
   Warner Bros.
  </em>
  characters fight alongside each other in a clearly
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  inspired clash. The cast of characters seemed, at first, to be eclectic and strange, but as
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  has developed, players have been won over.

  Characters like Arya Stark, The Iron Giant, Batman, Beetlejuice, and Adventure Time's Finn the Human are thrown into fast and explosive matches that earn players points and experience. Unlockable perks, costumes, and characters make for a real sense of progression, and the developers' commitment to continue expanding the game means that this could blossom into an even larger crossover as time passes.

  While a MOBA may not be everyone's cup of tea,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Heroes Of The Storm
   </em>
  </strong>
  goes out of its way to capture the best of Blizzard's library, and throws everything together into a crowd-pleasing game with shorter matches and a huge roster. Iconic characters from
  <em>
   Starcraft
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  meet with more rogue choices to bring heaps of possibilities to the 5v5 matchups.

 <p>
  Players have a slew of abilities that can be upgraded using group experience that is shared between the team in each match. Mounts and Hearthstones ensure that fans of Blizzard's massive catalog of distinct characters will find something familiar.
  <em>
   Heroes Of The Storm
  </em>
  might not have become as popular as some of the other massive online games under Blizzard's belt, but it is still a hugely successful mashup game in its own right.

  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  is no stranger to strange crossovers, bringing in characters like the Terminator or Robocop to engage in the messy fatalities and gory fights that make this series infamous. However, perhaps its most ambitious crossover title is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Letting Raiden and Scorpion test their fighting skills against Superman and Batman while still preserving the weighty combat and bloody brutalities meant that fans of both properties could get invested.

  The story mode lets players take on both Shao Khan and Darkseid to defeat the epic villains from both worlds in a narrative that sees the universes collide with catastrophic results. This opportunity to see unlikely allies and bickering rivals makes for a captivating mashup.

  One of the least expected crossover titles,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Puyo Puyo Tetris 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a mashup of two of gaming's biggest arcade puzzlers, combining the neat block stacking gameplay of
  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  with the pattern matching loop of
  <em>
   Puyo Puyo
  </em>
  . Local PvP gameplay sees players collect powerups to make their opponents' board more chaotic and difficult, and the Fusion Mode slides both games into each other with chaotic results.

 <p>
  Tetrominoes are heavy enough to fall to the bottom of the board, while the Puyos sit at the top. The addictive and rhythmic gameplay loop of one of the bestselling series of all time finds a worthy match and succeeds in providing a surprisingly effective party battler.

  An unfortunate player of the space-themed title,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  , has ended up accidentally creating a horrific combination of the Chair of Constellation, Sarah Morgan, and the game's Terrormorph, an alien species found throughout the Settled Systems. Bethesda’s
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  was released in 2023, and the story follows a team of space miners and explorers hired by the Constellation group to hunt down mysterious artifacts across the galaxy.

  The open-world title has been out for a little over a year now, and despite the game's initial rocky start, Bethesda has endeavored to make improvements, which include adding the REV-8 to
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , the game's long-awaited first land vehicle. In a game as vast as
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , a few quirks here and there are a given, and many players have caught more than a few hilarious glitches involving the game's NPC companions.

  In a post on Reddit, user B0sstrich has managed to capture a terrifying glitch that involves
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's NPC companion, Sarah Morgan. In the horrific clip, Sarah, who is the Chair of Constellation, can be seen violently twitching as the player moves the NPC across an area in the game, even scaring another character due to her bizarre behavior as she slides into a room. B0sstrich said that this alarming glitch happened whenever they were messing around with the console commands, promoting them to nickname Sarah as the "Sarahmorph." This name is in reference to
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Terrormorph creatures, an alien species found throughout the game.

  Some of the comments in the Reddit thread have expressed shock and horror at the player's scary recreation of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Sarah Morgan, who can sometimes be seen by some players as rather dull and uninteresting. One commenter alarmingly asked the poster, "dear god, what have you done?," as another user said that the horrifying Sarah Morgan glitch reminded them of one of the Hiss from Remedy Entertainment's,
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  . Another Redditor hilariously pointed out that the glitch reminded them of Edgar, the cockroach alien in a human suit, from
  <em>
   Men in Black
  </em>
  .

  Recently, another player showcased a hilarious clip of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Sarah Morgan using a
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  -style combo as she jumped on top of a NPC, sending them flying out of the game. Apparently, other characters in the sci-fi title can have violent tendencies, too.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's Vasco knocked out a quest-critical NPC character during a dialogue scene in another comedic glitch from the game. Even though
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's NPCs are a hit-or-miss for some players, there's no denying that the Bethesda title has some of the funniest, and weirdest, bugs in gaming.

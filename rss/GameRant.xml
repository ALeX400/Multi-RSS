  One of the best features in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is the character creator, allowing players to craft a wide variety of unique Rooks with extensive options to customize even the smallest details. Inspired by
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  , this tool stands out as one of the game’s greatest strengths, offering something entirely fresh compared to BioWare’s previous titles.

 <p>
  Another highlight is that once a character is created, Rooks seamlessly blend into scenes, fitting naturally into environments and interacting smoothly with other NPCs during dialogue. The character creator encourages creativity, enabling players to personalize their appearance with intricate details. It's an incredible tool for those who love to craft distinct protagonists.

 <p>
  The first
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  introduced a more tactical style of combat where players could pause battles and control the entire party, directing each companion individually, much like other beloved CRPGs. However,
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  shifts the combat in a more action-oriented direction, with Rook as the only controllable character.

 <p>
  Although it departs from traditional CRPG mechanics, the action combat in this fourth installment feels satisfying and, if refined further in future BioWare titles, could become even more engaging. While this style may not be a perfect match for every medieval setting, franchises like
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  could greatly benefit from these new gameplay mechanics.

  Great maps and open-world games can be amazing when filled with content for players to explore. But sometimes, these vast environments can lack engagement if there’s little to do.
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  avoids this by not relying on a giant map, instead opting for smaller, mission-based areas to explore.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":264} -->
 <p>
  Fortunately, this approach works in the game’s favor, as smaller maps give developers more opportunities to make every corner unique, filled with items, enemies, or other content to discover. Additionally, dungeon exploration feels less tiresome, creating a more enjoyable gameplay loop throughout the game’s length.

 <p>
  One of the best aspects of BioWare’s games is how certain decisions made throughout the story can drastically impact events, sometimes even altering the ending.
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  takes this to a new level. Rook faces pivotal choices during key moments in the plot, intensifying the player's influence on the story.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Most of the time, these decisions don’t offer a perfect solution with a favorable outcome for everyone. Players are often forced to prioritize one aspect at the expense of another, leading to consequences. This narrative approach perfectly aligns with the game’s setting, where the world is on the brink of ruin, and the best anyone can do is to minimize losses rather than save everything.

  , with more stylized graphics, also served to create some incredible character designs. The companions and other NPCs returning from past games received some alterations that made them even more appealing, such as Isabela, Morrigan, and Varric.

 <p>
  The new characters introduced into the story, especially those who join as Rook's companions during his journey against the elven gods, also have unique visuals aligned with each one's concept. Although this has always been a strong point for BioWare, in this fourth game of the franchise, the developer has further enhanced this aspect.

  BioWare has some strong points that it tries to develop and evolve in all its games, such as well-crafted characters and settings. However, in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , these concepts are even greater than in any other game released by the developer so far, delivering an incredible result for players.

 <p>
  Here, all characters have a moment to shine and develop in the story, whether through side missions or even in dialogue. BioWare managed to capture the importance of each one to the plot. Not that this was neglected in other games by the developer, but here they give equal importance to everyone.

  Direct game sequels have the problem of engaging much more with long-time players, who have a connection with the world and characters, than with newcomers to the franchise. However,
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  manages to do this in different ways, offering methods for both types of players to become interested in the plot.

 <p>
  The script is interesting and, despite having connections with previous games, it is not as complex as in other titles. This is good for those who do not have in-depth knowledge of the franchise. However, for veterans, BioWare included many old characters, which works to give greater emotional weight in different scenes of the narrative, enhancing the experience.

   <em>

  You can use simple emotes like Chic and Pose 23 to dramatic ones like Cowboy, Magica, and 360 Swing. And for fans teaming up with partners, there are cool duo options, too, like the Heart Pose Duo and Kawaii Pose Duo.

  While it’s easy to use poses in the game, stopping them can get confusing for some. Fans may need to unequip the emote multiple times during the round to keep playing smoothly. Check out this guide to learn how to stop posing in

  There are two simple ways to stop posing in
  <em>
   DTI
  </em>
  . One method is to
  <strong>
   re-select your currently equipped pose
  </strong>
  from the pose section. To do this, tap on the ‘
  <strong>
   Dancing Mannequin’ icon
  </strong>
  located on the right side of the screen,
  <strong>
   scroll down
  </strong>
  to the pose you’re using, and
  <strong>
   re-click once
  </strong>
  . This will instantly stop the emote.

 <p>
  If your selected pose is far down the list, or you can’t remember where it is, there’s another method you can try. Just
  <strong>
   tap on any random pose
  </strong>
  in the pose section and
  <strong>
   re-click on it to remove it
  </strong>
  . After that, your avatar will return to its normal posture.
  <em>
   DTI
  </em>
  fans can even add some poses to a favorite list by hitting the star icon next to them, so they won’t have to navigate down to unselect the best emotes.

      <title>Marvel Rivals Could Finally Be the Game for One X-Men Character to Shine</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  may essentially be
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  with a thick coat of Marvel paint, but it’s tough to deny how special and considered each character’s implementation is thus far.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  might’ve been able to skim each character for whatever superficial and sensational ability they most predominantly wield, and yet it has proven to assess minute details and embed them in each respective character’s playstyle regardless of how suboptimal it would seem in the realm of a 6v6 hero shooter (such as Spider-Man’s spider-sense or wall-crawling).

 <p>
  This would suggest that all future Marvel characters added to
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ’ roster will receive the same treatment and be thorough in their representation, which may be harder to actually execute for some characters more than others. For example, Cyclops is fairly static as a character on paper and, despite not being officially announced as of yet, could be tricky to adapt to
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ’ landscape. That said, the same could’ve been said about roster characters such as Hulk, Groot, or Rocket Raccoon, and
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ’ attention to detail continues to prove that Cyclops could be a welcome addition in the future.

     Cyclops’ psionic optic blasts are tremendously powerful, to be clear, but in general these red visor beams arguably aren’t as entertaining to behold as Spider-Man’s web-slinging, Iron Man’s repulsor-blasting, or even Captain America’s shield-ricocheting.

 <p>
  However, in a 6v6 hero shooter like
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  that revolves largely around ability-based action and long-ranging projectiles, Cyclops could actually be a key figure. Cyclops could presumably keep opponents at a distance with sweeping optic blasts, perhaps with several modulations such as quick bursts fired as his primary attack or a massive beam ability with a lot of recovery frames.

 <p>
  Mobility is also a pillar of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ’ gameplay, and it’d be interesting to see if Cyclops’ optic blasts could be utilized to enable midair maneuverability.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ’ hero shooter encompasses a lot for each character but their move sets aren’t as varied or expansive as a regular action game, which is why Cyclops might be superb with only a handful of attacks and abilities that he’d need in his arsenal.

 <p>
  Furthermore, this is a big reason why Cyclops is fantastic in simpler beat-’em-up games such as the
  <em>
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  series or
  <em>
   X-Men Legends
  </em>
  as he doesn’t need to stretch thinly to meet the demands of a larger suite of mechanics that wouldn’t adequately represent the character.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ’ current choices for default roster X-Men characters are surprisingly diverse, though, and therefore it might be a while before it eventually reaches Cyclops on a laundry list of possible additions.

  Cyclops’ Adaptation Wouldn’t Need to Look Much Further Than Marvel Rivals’ Captain America
 </h3>
 <p>
  Captain America’s Freedom Charge Ultimate could be something of an inspiration for Cyclops’ own as Scott Summers is his own team’s leader and would be expected to have some sort of support ability as well. Freedom Charge grants Captain America and teammates “continuous Bonus Health and Movement Boosts” in the path he carves forward, and it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility for Cyclops to imbue himself and allies with a similar buff somehow.

 <p>
  By tapping into support tactics, Cyclops could easily charge forth like Captain America and rally his teammates while possibly having more projectile-oriented versatility than Steve Rogers, whose shield-throwing is intrinsically tied to a specific ability as well as consecutive melee hits. Either way, while Cyclops may not be a singularly phenomenal character when placed next to someone like Magik, Storm, or Scarlet Witch, it seems like it’ll only be a matter of time before Scott—who only recently earned praise and popularity via
  <em>
   X-Men ’97
  </em>
  —receives a worthy adaptation.

  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak teases the addition of new events and content. Players have reacted to the launch of
  <em>

  with a lot of positivity, which has helped the deNA-developed game reach impressive milestones quickly.

  For those who don't know,
  <em>

  </em>
  reproduces the experience of physical
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  cards in digital format. To obtain the cards, players open boosters, take part in the Wonder Pick, craft them, or join in events. But although the community has been excited by the game's proposal, some feel that the experience of playing
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  is a bit “barebones” at the moment. Now, new information recently shared brings good news for players in this regard.

  Two leaks suggest that four new
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  cards and events are coming to the game. Revealed by Twitter user PokeGirlLauren, a mini set known as “A1a” will be released on December 16, although it is unknown how many cards it will have. The second set will arrive on January 29, 2025, and according to her, will have around 230 new cards that promise to "change the meta completely.” She added that four sets and four mini-sets are expected to be released each year, but did not give any further details such as dates or their contents.

  In another Tweet, she also shared the dates of the next

  events. According to her, there will be a Black Friday event from November 22 to December 2, potentially selling gold at more affordable prices. Two new events, one featuring Magikarp and Gyarados cards, and the other featuring Arcanine, will run from November 22 to 28. The Venusaur promotional card event will run from November 29 to December 13. She also notes that the Arcanine event will be a Wonder Pick in which the EX variant will be available along with holographic cards such as Ninetails, Moltres, and Charizard.

 <p>
  Leaks always have a chance of changing, but if they are confirmed,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket

  players will have lots to look forward to, especially Arcanine's Wonder Pick. But while the community waits for an official announcement or new information, there are a variety of events going on in the game currently. The Wonder Pick with Chansey and Meowth promo cards ends on November 15, while the Lapras EX PvE event will end on November 18. For more competitive players, there is also the Genetic Apex PvP event, which will end on November 28.

  At first glance,

   <em>
    [REDACTED]
   </em>
  </strong>
  doesn’t necessarily do anything out of the ordinary or outlandish when it comes to how its isometric roguelike gameplay is structured. There are different combinations of weapons, gear, and stats to consider in
  <em>

  , for instance, as well as different resources and currencies players can spend toward permanent upgrades and buffs for subsequent runs.

  Perishing is less of a punishment and more of a means of natural progression, and new interactions and opportunities become available as players respawn and carry on into a new attempt to flee from Black Iron Prison in the last escape pod. That said, it’s in this attempt to flee that
  <em>

  becomes remarkably interesting.

  Once rivals are introduced, a bar as long as players’ screens will appear at the bottom of the HUD where they can monitor how far along rivals are in relation to them, not to mention how close they are to a biome boss. This alone makes clearing rooms faster a massive incentive as players doggedly making their way through rooms will notice rivals taking swift leads and far out-pacing them, which can be devastating early on.

Inputting these combinations brings a menu up on the side of the screen but does not pause the game, meaning that players must wait for an opportune moment where they won’t be interrupted by a biophage’s attacks nor lose focus anyhow and input a combination incorrectly.

  Actually catching up to a rival and going toe-to-toe with them before exit doors activate is less intimidating than the ordinary moment-to-moment pursuit as a result, and with three random rivals racing players in each run there is quite a lot to consider regarding whom players might want to catch up to first and potentially tackle, much less which rivals they’d be fine with securing an early lead to be able to surpass or circumvent in later biomes. There are a ton of mind games

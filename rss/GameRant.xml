  Since
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  launched, the Metal archetype has been the least favored of all the types. While many players have tried to build competitive decks around it, most have failed, and the metagame has yet to see a truly successful Metal-type deck.

 <p>
  That said, there’s still room for creativity. Recent Metal decks, particularly those refined with Mythical Island cards, have shown potential. In this guide, I’ll walk you through building two of these decks, which use
  <em>
   Pokemon Pocket
  </em>
  ’s new cards to offset the archetype’s below-average stats.

  To build a consistent Metal deck, limit your Pokemon to three: Meltan, Melmetal, and Druddigon. Use Meltan to accelerate Energy, stall with Druddigon, and deal damage with Melmetal. Fill the rest of the deck with Trainer Cards to improve draw rates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's how to build the Melmetal-Druddigon deck:

  Recent tournaments saw the rise of a new Metal deck that caught many meta decks off guard:
  <strong>
   the Melmetal-Greninja deck
  </strong>
  , supported by Druddigon. And it’s one of the most promising setups for the Metal archetype.
 </p>
 <p>
  The deck’s concept is simple: Place Druddigon in the frontline to stall. Build up Meltan, which evolves into Melmetal. Once Melmetal is ready to attack, start dealing damage. Meanwhile, keep Greninja on the Bench to provide additional chip damage, helping to make up for Melmetal’s below-average output.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_13">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     You won’t need to add Water-type Energy to the Melmetal &amp; Greninja deck, as Greninja stays on the Bench and only applies chip damage with its Energy-free ability.
    </p>

  I analyzed ten recent
  <em>
   Pokemon Pocket
  </em>
  tournaments focusing on the number of players using a Metal deck. My research shows that Metal-type setups appeared in 40% of the matches, with an average ranking of 66.2. In other words, Metal decks didn’t make it into the top 50.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only tournament where a Melmetal deck performed well was one that landed in 12th place. In all other cases, the Metal decks I reviewed either conceded or ranked below 40.

 <p>
  There are two major issues with the Metal archetype in
  <em>
   Pokemon Pocket
  </em>
  ’s current meta: 1) There aren’t many Metal-type Pokemon, and 2) Only a few Pokemon are weak to Metal, and none of them are meta cards. This leaves you with a small pool to build from and a loss of type advantage, which is why Metal decks often fail.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Metal-type decks could gain popularity with upcoming expansions. New cards could address both issues: introducing more meta-friendly Metal Pokemon and adding more meta-affecting Pokemon that are weak to Metal.

 <p>
  In the current metagame, all Metal Pokemon in
  <em>
   Pocket
  </em>
  are weak to Fire-type decks. As a result, basic Charizard ex or Arcanine ex decks could be highly effective against them. Generally, though, fast-build lineups, like Pikachu ex decks, perform well against the slow-paced Metal setups.

  If you're not too concerned about high frame rates or graphics settings, you'll be pleased to know that even decade-old hardware is supported. The minimum CPU requirements are an Intel Core i3-6300 or an AMD Ryzen 3 1200, paired with a GeForce GTX 970 or Radeon RX 580. For those with Intel GPUs, an Arc A580 or better is required.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game also requires 12 GB of RAM and 70 GB of free storage, the latter of which should be an SSD. With this setup, you can expect to run the game at 1080p resolution, 30 FPS, with Low Graphics Settings.

   Like most modern games,
   <em>
    The First Berserker: Khazan
   </em>
   requires Windows 10 64-bit at a minimum. However, for the best performance, the developer recommends using Windows 11.

  If 30 FPS isn’t sufficient and you need at least 60 FPS with High Graphics Settings, you'll need more powerful hardware. While the storage requirement remains at 70 GB (preferably on an SSD), the RAM requirement increases to 16 GB.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the CPU, you'll need an Intel Core i7-6700K or an AMD Ryzen 5 3600. The GPU requirements also jump to an RTX 2070 or a Radeon RX 5700 XT. If you’re using an Intel GPU, an Arc A750 or better will be necessary.

  ’s second patch welcomed Build 117 and welcomed a handful of new features, including adding the player level to the multiplayer HUD element, adding missing combo descriptions to the library menu, and added confirm prompts when exiting a game. Several bugs were also fixed, including issues where clients could take a trinket meant for the host and the Thunderbird giving damage when players spawned. It’s relatively simple to unlock all the characters in
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  , and another bug fixes an issue where a multiplier client could create a character based on what classes were unlocked by the host.

  2024 hosted a sea of impressive rougelike and roguelite games, including
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  has gotten off to an impressive start in 2025 with “Very Positive” reviews on Steam. In terms of the game’s roadmap, the developer touched on further updates within the second patch, saying there isn’t a proper roadmap in place, but the team is prioritizing player feedback, multiplayer connectivity issues, and modding support starting with translations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joining a sea of randomly generated levels and impeccable customization, the players' main objective is to battle through the Dark Citadel, to obtain powerful equipment and items that open up new upgrades and abilities. Despite being the main location of the game, the Dark Citadel can only be unlocked later in
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  ’s gameplay, but once open, no two runs progress the same to keep gameplay fresh, and each completed expedition aids the upgrade of players’ towns, gear, and characters.

  Players have been looking for something to fill the hole left behind as a longstanding
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Simpson's
  </em>
  game bows out. As sad as it is to lose an iconic mobile game like
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Simpson's Tapped Out
   </em>
  </strong>
  , there is a long list of similar games to distract and delight. While one of the best features of a city builder is the satisfaction of a well-designed layout, something else drew players to
  <em>
   The Simpson's Tapped Out.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The sense of comfort and familiarity players get from rebuilding such an iconic fictional town was a real draw for
  <em>
   Tapped Out
  </em>
  players. With that in mind, the following recommendations bring similar mobile games featuring childhood favorites, iconic characters, and some seriously addictive gameplay!
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated on January 19, 2025, by Mehrdad Khayyat:
   </strong>
   City-builder still remains one of the most beloved genres on mobile, as the gameplay mechanics just fit this platform perfectly. All players do in these games is to collect resources and then spend them on expanding the city.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   There is always a desire in players to see what's next for the city. What will the next upgrade to a building look like? What else can be built to make the city look more awesome? How about changing the layout? All these questions just make players come back and follow their progression every day.

  For mobile gamers who want what
  <em>
   The Simpson's Tapped Out
  </em>
  has to offer but prefer some realism, there is
  <strong>
   <em>
    SimCity BuildIt.
   </em>
  </strong>
  Based on the popular city-building game
  <em>
   SimCity
  </em>
  , this is a simplified (but not easy!) version of the original title. Creating a city from scratch is a tough job but, luckily, players have everything to hand that a decent mayor could wish for. The choice of layout and landmarks is entirely up to the individual player but just don't neglect the welfare of the citizens!
 </p>
 <p>
  At first, players are guided by Simlish-speaking helpers but eventually, the world-building is all their own. Once the city is growing, the real excitement starts. Players can visit other mayors in their cities and team up to help each other create amazing cities. There is the chance to compete too, and defend against incoming dangers! Some players like to create amazing fantasy cities, while others love to recreate existing skylines like Tokyo or London. It is easy to spend hours perfecting a dream city in
  <em>

  While most builder games focus on cities, this game lets players to a luxury cruise ship with hundreds of travelers. It didn't take
  <em>
   My Cruise: Idle Ship Tycoon
  </em>
  to become immensely popular on mobile platforms, thanks to its creative approach. It's quite important to impress the guests in this game and increase the ship's reputation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sky is the limit for how many upgrades can be applied to a cruise ship, but the downside is the heavy grind. Similar to most games in this list, there is a progression accelerator in
  <em>
   My Cruise: Idle Ship Tycoon
  </em>
  too, and those who decide to ignore it will have a long way to go to the higher levels. However, for patient players, that shouldn't be a problem.

  brings the perilous fun of

  to mobile so players can build their very own post-apocalyptic bunker. The game starts simply: players must build rooms and provide power, water, and food to the vault dwellers. Soon, however, it becomes a careful balance between saving more wastelanders and saving resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  After leveling up, players can explore the Wasteland in
  <em>
   Fallout Shelter
  </em>
  in the hope of discovering junk and caps. The real excitement comes when the Overseer sends players on quests to win exclusive gear and weapons, blueprints, and Nuka Cola.
  <em>
   Fallout Shelter
  </em>
  has all the addictive qualities of
  <em>
   The Simpsons Tapped Out
  </em>
  but with extra post-apocalyptic adventures! Gamers don't have to be fans of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  already, but there are plenty of easter eggs to make the game extra special for those who do.

  From one iconic cartoon family to another, fans of
  <em>
   The Simpson's Tapped Out
  </em>
  may appreciate this city-builder based on the irreverent adult cartoon,
  <em>
   Family Guy
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   <strong>
    Family Guy: The Quest For Stuff
   </strong>
  </em>
  is constantly updating with new content to keep players coming back. Just like
  <em>
   Tapped Out,
  </em>
  the voice lines are all performed by the talented cast of the hit TV show,
  <em>
  </em>
  which is a real treat for die-hard fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Family Guy: The Quest For Stuff
  </em>
  has so much in common with
  <em>
   Tapped Out,
  </em>
  starting with the basic premise. In both games, the main patriarch (in this case, Peter Griffin) has accidentally destroyed the town, and it is down to them to rebuild and bring everyone back.
  <em>
   Family Guy: The Quest For Stuff
  </em>
  has quest upon quest for players to complete to unlock each character and fill the town once again.

  Everyone's favorite Evil Queen has drawn a dark veil over the Disney Kingdom, and it is up to the player to break the curse! Mickey Mouse and Goofy are the first to arrive at the scene and begin to look for their friends. Soon, the park fills with childhood favorites like Woody from

   <em>
    Spongebob Adventures
   </em>
  </strong>
  is another adventure sim game based on a popular 90s cartoon just like
  <em>
   Tapped Out.
  </em>
  Another of Plankton's dastardly plans has backfired, and it is up to the two hapless heroes, Spongebob and Patrick, to save Bikini Bottom. Just like
  <em>
   The Simpsons Tapped Out,
  </em>
  there are areas to uncover as players progress and well-known characters to unlock. Spongebob and Patrick's tasks are almost endless, from clearing debris to growing crops and crafting jellyfish food.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike
  <em>
   Tapped Out,
  </em>
  there seems to be more variety in
  <em>
   Spongebob Adventures,
  </em>
  plus Bikini Bottom takes less time to clear up than Springfield! Players can visit new locations like the Jellyfish Fields to uncover treats and top up energy, so Spongebob and Patrick can continue with their mission to tidy up their town.

  As a creative playground,
  <em>
   Brixity
  </em>
  is one of those rare games that actually allow players to do whatever they want. It's more of a pocket
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , where players use Blueprints to craft unique buildings and locations that also have a purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  That being said, it's not that simple. The main problem with
  <em>
   Brixity
  </em>
  is that players can only access a certain series of Blueprints with the base version, as the other series remain behind a paywall. Of course, it's worth it for those willing to pay, as a new pack of Blueprints delivers tons of new ideas to life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from the builder side,
  <em>
   Brixity
  </em>
  also allows players to customize their characters and engage with the created buildings through a variety of activities. Like racing circuits that allow players to compete against each other.

  <em>

    Goosebumps Horror Town

 </p>
 <p>
  This

  game offers lots to do and plenty of ways to get extra cash and resources, such as crafting disgusting treats and researching the town at the library. One of the best features in
  <em>
   Goosebumps Horror Town
  </em>
  is when players build monster dens and invite the creatures to rampage through the town, scaring the children! Fantastic frightening fun.

  Unlike all the games above where there is a glass ceiling of in-app purchases that prevents players from a faster progression,
  <em>
   Pocket City
  </em>
  is a game made by gamers, for gamers! The game puts the player in charge of a small town and gives them some resources to grow it.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the player makes progress, maintaining a balance between industrial, commercial, and residential districts becomes more important. The small town in the beginning gradually grows into a metropolitan while the challenges become bigger and bigger.
  <em>
   Pocket City

      <title>7 Best Soulslike Games That Are Mostly Boss Fights</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-soulslike-games-mostly-boss-fights/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Few genres manage to capture the attention and imagination of players across the world, like the soulslike genre. The dark lore, high-stakes difficulty, and for many titles, the boss fights, are all core components of this genre that help tie together some pretty disparate games into a coherent identity. Challenge is the keyword with soulslikes. The gameplay is a challenge, understanding the narrative is a challenge, building a character is a challenge.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  But a good soulslike doesn't just have high difficulty. It has a reward for those that can overcome the difficulty - something that makes each struggle worthwhile. And what greater struggle is there than the almighty boss fight? What better reward can there be than watching some colossal foe finally fall by your hand? For players who want to skip the ambling around maps and get right to the boss fights, these soulslike titles keep the focus on imposing, difficult, capstone enemies.

  Built around a tight, but incredibly satisfying group of weapons,
  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  is one of the unique - and arguably one of the best - soulslike experiences out there. It is almost antiquated in its incredibly focused scope and overall small world design in an industry that prides itself on a 'bigger is better' approach to content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of this small scale means that the game is predominately focused on one thing - boss fights. Each weapon is earned from defeating a boss, and the capstones for progress are similarly tied to intensive boss battles. Part of there being such an emphasis on only a handful of weapons - and several detailed boss fights - means that the animations and hitboxes in these battles often rival much larger and bigger budget games .

  One of the most ambitious and well-received soulslikes to come from somewhere that wasn't From Software in recent years,
  <em>
   Black Myth
  </em>
  allows players to truly integrate themselves and be immersed in the epic quest of this ancient and venerated tale. The core focus of this title, beyond the many well-designed weapons and animations, is the emphasis on spectacular, cinematic boss fights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will find a very cathartic experience here with the layered and intensive boss fights being the main draw to continue exploring a dangerous, mournful world of myth and legend. Any soulslike fans would do well to give this game a try.

  This climactic, isometric soulslike is inspired by many classics in the genre, but brings its own incredibly distinctive aesthetic to the foreground.
  <em>
   Eldest Souls
  </em>
  tells a classic, high fantasy tale of one man and his fabled sword being the last hope of a dying world, but the gameplay is one a truly unique wavelength.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each fast-paced boss battle has its own rules to adhere to, and as they comprise the bulk of the game, this is a soulslike that tests players' ability to adapt over raw damage output. For those that fall in love with the base game, even more bosses are available in the expansion that was released in 2022.

  Like many titles on this list - but with an especially compelling flair -
  <em>
   Titan Souls
  </em>
  is a game where the narrative is built around its most precious aspect - that being the boss fights. A lonesome hero is exploring an ancient world, and the guardians of this ancient, ruined world are the titular titans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each titan is an awe-inspiring display of power, and the adventures of the protagonist will take them into the farthest reaches of a sprawling, colossal kingdom of myth. This is an excellent example of a soulslike that focuses squarely on bosses from both a gameplay and lore perspective.

  Taking an altogether different stance on both the soulslike and metroidvania subgenres,
  <em>
   Ender Lilies
  </em>
  is a title where players utilize the souls of powerful knights to help a more fragile protagonist complete her quest. Each knight has their own powerful abilities that can help players get through the many difficult fights that make up the bulk of this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a fantastic title for those looking to try a different spin on boss-heavy soulslikes and metroidvanias, and beyond this, has an excellent, forboding aesthetic and art style that meshes perfectly with the darker storyline that's being told.

  A more obscure title within the soulslike genre, but one that is absolutely worth checking out,
  <em>
   The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human
  </em>
  has a truly unique design philosophy that emphasizes the beauty - and the danger - of the deep ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  The bosses match the game's aquatic style, with terrifying deep sea creatures all posing their own unique threats as the focal point of the title. No game is quite like this seafaring, boss-focused soulslike, and players who are veterans of the genre will do especially well here.

 <p>
  As well-received, and as hugely influential, as the other modern titles from From Software,
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  is a game that takes a more focused, skill-based approach to the classic soulslike formula. Players won't be relying on powerful gear here so much as their timing and reflexes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The greatest test of these reflexes comes in the form of the boss battles that will continually test players throughout the game. Some of these are the quintessential puzzle bosses that almost every From Software title has, while some are challenges against hulking monsters, or duels against lethally skilled fighters - with each battle adding a new layer of characterization and lore to this fantastic game.

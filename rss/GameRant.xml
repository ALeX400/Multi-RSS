  Some Sea Ganoderma in Seirai are far from Teleport Waypoints, but many can be collected easily. To reach the faraway islands, players can use the Teleport Waypoint near the
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  Thunder Manifestation boss. As it's located on a very high spot, it allows people to effortlessly glide to islands around Seirai.

      <title>How Helldivers 2’s New Ultimatum Grenade Pistol Compares to Other Secondary Weapons</title>

  Another new premium Warbond has arrived in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , introducing a new variety of equipment for players to fight the enemies of managed democracy. Among the new gear available in the Servants of Freedom Warbond is a unique new secondary weapon in

  , the GP-31 Ultimatum.

  While secondary weapons are categorically some of the weakest weapons in the game, the new Ultimatum might just be one of the strongest weapons in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , even as an unassuming secondary weapon. Though it comes with relatively limited ammunition, one shot from the Ultimatum can deal more damage than certain Stratagems, opening up new loadout possibilities for

  GP-31 Ultimatum’s Weaknesses
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Low ammo capacity
  </li>
  <li>
   Limited range
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  According to the weapon’s stats page, each shot from the GP-31 Ultimatum deals 4,500 damage, far exceeding the damage from a single shot from some of the best secondary weapons in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . Beyond secondary weapons, the Ultimatum hits harder than several grenades, primary weapons, support weapons, and Stratagems. In other words, the Ultimatum is seemingly one of the strongest weapons in the game right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being listed as having medium armor penetration in the weapon’s stats, the GP-31 Ultimatum can destroy heavily armored enemies and certain destructible mission objectives like Automaton Detector Towers and Illuminate Encampment Ships. This makes the Ultimatum perfectly suited for high-difficulty missions where heavily armored enemies and mission objectives frequently spawn. With the Ultimatum, a new secondary weapon capable of penetrating heavy armor opens up countless possibilities for new meta loadouts in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  's higher-difficulty missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the biggest downsides to this weapon is its limited ammo capacity of two shots between the one reserve reload and one loaded projectile. Consequently, using this weapon means that players must constantly resupply via the Resupply Stratagem, the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="640226" style="color: #9242ff; ;">
   <img loading="lazy" src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/05/helldivers-2-b-1-supply-pack-2.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22"/>
   B-1 Supply Pack
  </span>
  backpack Stratagem, or looting ammo packs from POIs. However, most secondary weapons in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  have limited ammo reserves by default, so this isn’t exactly a unique problem for the Ultimatum. Considering that one well-aimed shot from the GP-31 Ultimatum can destroy nearly every existing enemy unit and destructible mission objective, the weapon’s relatively limited ammo reserves are arguably more than manageable.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_12">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     The Siege-Ready body armor perk in
     <em>
      Helldivers 2
     </em>
     can increase the Ultimatum’s ammo reserves by one additional projectile.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  The other notable weakness of this weapon is its limited range. Due to the weight of the Ultimatum’s explosive projectiles, they curve downward at a steep rate immediately after being fired. Even once players get used to the flight path of these projectiles, their maximum travel distance is still quite limited. Much like the weapon’s limited ammo reserves though, having limited range is another common quality of most secondary weapons in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , so this is to be expected of secondary weapons anyway. It can take some practice to find the optimal range where players won’t take friendly fire damage from their own Ultimate projectiles, though mastering this weapon is arguably well worth the effort.

  Helldivers 2’s New GP-31 Ultimatum Hits as Hard as a Stratagem
 </h3>
 <p>
  Despite the Ultimatum’s limited ammo capacity and range, this weapon can be truly devastating when used properly. It may not have the luxury of plentiful ammo or a long range like the original Grenade Pistol, but the Ultimatum is still one of the strongest weapons in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  even among over-the-top support weapons and Stratagems. For players looking for a unique new secondary weapon, the GP-31 Ultimatum from the new Servants of Freedom premium Warbond can be a game-changer.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda

  has seen hit after hit in an unbelievable run of acclaim and accolades. Nintendo has also continued to take the franchise in unique directions, notably doing so last year with the newest entry,

  is the timeline of its story. Among the most hotly debated parts of the franchise among the fanbase, the

  Zelda In Chronological Order Helps Gamers Appreciate The Lore
 </h3>
 <p>
  In one breath, playing
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  series in the order of its timeline could help players appreciate the franchise's lore a bit more. While the stories of most games are not entirely connected, there are ways where the stories of some games build on earlier (or later) entries. Thus, playing the games in chronological order can be a unique challenge, especially for hardcore fans who have already played through the series and would understand it more than a newcomer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, playing the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise chronologically might help keep the games fresh for some players. Since different titles in the series play differently, playing the games in the recommended timeline order allows players to jump between altogether different titles. This means gamers won’t feel like they’re constantly experiencing more of the same, and the changes in styles can keep gamers on their toes and serve as an interesting challenge.
 </p>
 <h3 id="zelda-rsquo-s-timeline-split-might-make-a-chronological-playthrough-confusing">
  Zelda’s Timeline Split Might Make A Chronological Playthrough Confusing
 </h3>
 <p>
  Even so, playing
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  in its timeline order might be fruitless unless one is a hardcore fan of the series. After all, the story of
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  is not exactly linear to begin with, and most notably, the series' timeline splits after
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  . Following this game, the timeline breaks into three separate parts before vaguely merging back together in some way within the events of
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  To that end, the splitting of the timeline makes playing
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  in chronological order a difficult proposition. Given the three distinct paths the franchise splits into, it could be difficult to decide whether to tackle one timeline at a time or to regularly swap between the three. This could work against one of the pros of playing in chronological order, as it only makes the lore even more confusing to figure out.

  Playing Zelda In Chronological Order May Take Away From The Gameplay
 </h3>
 <p>
  Playing
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  in the timeline’s order would also make it harder for players to appreciate the gameplay evolution of the series. The timeline kicks off with the 2011 title,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword
  </em>
  , and from there, forces players to go forward and backward in release order often. As the gameplay of
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  is truly its shining star, it might be harder to appreciate what makes the franchise special when players are jumping back and forth in the franchise’s timeline.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  ’s timeline is certainly a unique aspect of the series, playing the games chronologically may only be best recommended to players with pre-established experience with the franchise. As much as this can help players appreciate the franchise's lore, the branching nature of the chronology and frequent jumps between its release order may turn away newcomers to the series. Newcomers to the franchise are best served playing the series in its release order to help appreciate how the series has revolutionized and innovated across several gaming genres.

  Even though there are many characters who straddle the line between good and bad in

  Loving the booze and neglecting his work duties does not mean Gladwin Moon is evil incarnate. However, the personality and arrogant aura he has developed is not exactly demonstrating good behavior. Whilst at Hogwarts himself, although petrified of Demiguises, Gladwin was a real bully, traumatizing classmate Piers Pemberton for years.
 </p>
 <p>
  As an adult, and after Gladwin became caretaker of Hogwarts in the late 1870's, Demiguise Statues begin to appear in nooks and crannies around the school, as well as in Hogsmeade and surrounding wizarding villages.

  Marianne Moffett is the owner of Gwyneria, a potentially prize-winning Diricawl. Later in the player's journey through
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , while exploring the wizarding village of Marunweem, Marianne calls them over. Conversing with Mariane triggers the Birds of a Feather quest, which involves traveling to a local diricawl nest and capturing Gwyneria in the Nab-Sack.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the initial conversation, players will get a strange sense that Marianne wants Gwyneria back for more sinister motives than missing her pet. Gwyneria is an albino diricawl and, as such, her fashionable feathers would sell for many galleons. Any player with a love for animals should, upon returning to Marianne with the Nab-Sack, elect to keep Gwyneria safely in their vivarium, rather than hand her over to be abused.

  The unnamed second master of the house-elf Tobbs is abusive and dominant. Heartbreakingly, no matter what the player does in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy,
  </em>
  Tobbs the house elf will die. In the Plight of the House-Elf quest (which is essential for unlocking the Nab-Sack), Deek tasks the protagonist with searching the cave for Tobbs. After exploring a network of tunnels underground, the player comes across the corpse of Tobbs, together with a letter.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the master's comeuppance for his complete disregard for (and downright abuse of) Tobbs, he is eventually killed by an acromantula, which the player has to defeat at the end of the quest.

  Until June 2024, anyone playing
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  on any console other than a PlayStation would never have got to meet Casandra Mason. In some ways, they would have been all the better for it. Cassandra Mason, together with her cheeky but innocent house-elf Penny, owns a haunted shop on the edge of Hogsmeade,
 </p>
 <p>
  In Minding Your Own Business, Cassandra initially appears innocent, offering to sell her shop to the player. However, when the chest is opened at the back of the shop, the player is plunged into a mansion within the chest, haunted by the imprisoned poltergeist, Fastidio. The true evil in Cassandra is revealed when she duels the player to the death, eventually being arrested and incarcerated in Azkaban.

  Viktor Rookwood craves power, and thus pursues sources of ancient magic for himself. He tries numerous methods of gaining said magic throughout the game. Rookwood and his cronies, dark wizards and Ashwinder soldiers, pursue the protagonist once they learn the protagonist's connection and aptitude for ancient magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the player visits Hogsmeade and enters Ollivanders for the second time in a quest, they leave with a modified wand in order to deal with what Ranrok has become. Even though Rookwood and his followers initially supported Ranrok's rebellion, here he tries to persuade the protagonist to hand over the wand to him and thus, the power. Rookwood meets his end in a damaging battle in the middle of nowhere, when he apparates both himself and the player to a remote location filled with his loyal Ashwinder soldiers. Tragically, the Keeper Charles Rookwood is mortified to learn what his ancestor has become.

  Theophilius Harlow is an exceedingly nasty character in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy.
  </em>
  Acting as Viktor Rookwood's right-hand man, Harlow uses the Killing Curse (Avada Kedavra) on the protagonist and spends much of his time hunting down the protagonist too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though Harlow rarely speaks, the protagonist feels his sinister presence constantly, from the first visit to Hogsmeade, to the battle showdown outside the manor in Manor Cape (Harlow's Last Stand). This is a huge and potentially fatal battle, as Harlow has zero scruples and tries to kill, torture, and drive the protagonist crazy with the three Unforgivable Curses.

  Believing in goblin supremacy so passionately and so strongly that he will stop at absolutely nothing to claim the final repository of ancient magic, Ranrok is the leader of the goblin rebellion. As
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  's main antagonist, Ranrok and his expansive band of loyalists begin their takeover wizardkind by invading the village of Feldcroft.
 </p>
 <p>
  His cruelty and murderous actions culminate in the final boss battle in the game, as Professor Fig and the protagonist make their way to Ranrok's Dragon. Somewhat unsurprisingly, Ranrok shares numerous traits with Lord Voldemort, including the desire for species domination, his willingness to murder, and his quest to destroy a student.

  The Carrot On A Stick quest requires a little bit of escorting, so be prepared to fight against several waves of wolves throughout the forests. But first things first: let's take a look at where this mission starts, and the best way to complete it.

  To start the Carrot On A Stick quest,
  <strong>
   players will need to complete the Sheep Among Wolves quest,
  </strong>
  then find Shepherd Stanislav and offer to assist him with his sheep problems. It turns out, this time, players will need to help him find a Ram and escort it back to the pen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the Lost Sheep quest, players actually need to herd a live animal to complete the mission, and therein resides the difficulty of this quest; they will have to do it in a wolf-ridden forest a little ways away from Stanislav's position.
 </p>
 <p>
  The video below shows the exact position of Bernie, the Ram, and how players will need to dispose of the wolves to start escorting him back to safety. But be warned: several packs of wolves patrol the zone and they can be really annoying to deal with, especially if players haven't invested in the Houndmaster Perk tree yet, which is highly recommended for every build.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_9">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     The Houndmaster Perk Heightened Scent allows Mutt to sniff out enemies and wild animals at a much greater distance than the dog's base ability, so having this Perk active is a must for every track quest in the game. Players should invest in it as soon as possible to save lots of trouble and effort.

 </div>
 <p>
  Following a straight line from the pen in the direction of the Quest Marker, players will be able to find Bernie quite fast. The main problem remains the wolves, so it is highly recommended you clear out as many packs as possible before proceeding with the escort part of the mission. Also, bring some Buck's Blood potion to increase Henry's Stamina, which helps deal with the wolves.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players see that the Ram stops following them, they will need to reach him and 'talk him' into following them again. Henry has some of the funniest retorts in the game, and this quest is as silly as it is stressful. The Ram tends to go astray, and it can end up right in the middle of a pack of wolves, which causes the quest to automatically fail.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember not to throw the carrots, since they're the only reason that Bernie puts up with Henry's 'lamb jokes.' On the other hand, try not to deviate too much from the path, since it will probably trigger more wolves to spawn and things can get really messy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, a known issue of this quest is that there's a chance to target Bernie by mistake when using Mutt's 'Sic'em' command, and he will attack the Ram instead of the wolves. As such, keep a close eye on the cursor and avoid killing the Ram by mistake. (Stray arrows can deal friendly fire damage to Bernie as well).
 </p>
 <p>
  After getting Bernie back in the pen, talk to Stanislav to receive your rewards, which include a Balanced Dice to gain an unfair advantage by betting against NPCs in taverns.

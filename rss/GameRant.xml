      <title>Why a Persona 4 Remake Releasing Sooner Rather than Later Would Make Perfect Sense</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/persona-4-remake-rumor-soon-p3-reload-assets/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Ever since the release of
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  in early 2024, there has been much discussion about the prospect of a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Persona 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  remake. The fourth numbered entry in the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  series may not be as dated as the original
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  , but it still isn't on par with modern
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games in some respects.
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  's 3D character models and overall UI design pale in comparison to
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  and the aforementioned
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  . Plus, its gameplay could be improved with the addition of some quality-of-life features and upgraded dungeons.

 <p>
  Several insiders have alleged that a
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  remake is indeed in development, and even though Atlus hasn't officially announced anything yet, speculation surrounding this title has started to heat up again. Recently, Shihoko Hirata, the singer who provided the vocals for many of the songs in
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  , posted on her Instagram account that she had been hired to work on an unannounced game at a Tokyo-based recording facility known as MIT Studio. The facility in question has exclusively been used by Sega and Atlus in recent years. Because of this, many believe that Hirata is working on an unannounced
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  remake. This may sound absurd to some, but there may be some truth in these rumors, especially considering that a
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  remake could be released sooner than one might think.

 <h3 id="a-persona-4-remake-would-likely-follow-persona-3-reload-39-s-template">
  A Persona 4 Remake Would Likely Follow Persona 3 Reload's Template
 </h3>
 <p>
  If a
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  remake does exist, it will probably follow the same template that
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  used. In other words, the original game will likely be remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4, and the voice actors and the soundtrack will be replaced with updated versions. Additionally, dungeons may be slightly reworked, and combat may be tweaked to make it more similar to
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  . Changing
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  this much would, no doubt, require a lot of time and effort. However, a potential remake of the game may not take as long to develop as
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  did.
 </p>
 <h3 id="atlus-could-reuse-some-of-the-assets-from-persona-3-reload-in-a-persona-4-remake">
  Atlus Could Reuse Some of the Assets from Persona 3 Reload in a Persona 4 Remake
 </h3>
 <p>
  Even though they have entirely separate casts of characters, the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games usually feature similar combat mechanics, enemies, and attacks;
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  are no exception in this regard. Many of the enemies, or shadows, in
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  <em>
   Reload
  </em>
  are also present in
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  . The Angry Tables, Magic Hands, Gracious Cupids, Battle Wheels, and Immoral Snakes, for instance, all make an appearance in both games. Even some of the sound effects for the shadows in the original
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  were outright reused in
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Like most AAA titles these days,
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  took more than 4 years to develop. Although Atlus didn't have to write a new script for this game, it still had to rebuild the original
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  from scratch using a new engine, which was likely time-consuming. Since the foundation for a current-gen
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  remake has already been established, though, perhaps a
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  remake would take one or two years less to create. Atlus can do what the fellow Sega subsidiary, RGG Studio, does with its own
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series by reusing assets when developing new games.
 </p>
 <h3 id="the-rumored-persona-4-remake-could-be-released-sooner-than-initially-expected">
  The Rumored Persona 4 Remake Could Be Released Sooner than Initially Expected
 </h3>
 <p>
  Some may frown upon the idea of reusing assets instead of making new ones, but in the
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  remake's case, this would make a lot of sense. A playerâ€™s experience would not be dramatically worsened if
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  and a
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  remake had some of the same character animations and 3D models, and because of that, Atlus may be more inclined to do this. Taking this into account, it seems quite plausible that the rumors about Shihoko Hirata and the
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  remake are true. Maybe this rumored
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  game is farther along in development than initially expected and, if so, it may come out as early as 2027 or 2028.

 <p>
  Competitive Points and Legacy Competitive Points are two such currencies that players can utilize. As these currencies are used to buy new weapon skins to show off on their mains, they are quite a popular aspect of the Competitive play scene, and often part of the reason more casual players dip into Competitive Play to begin with. For everything you need to know about how to earn Competitive Points and Legacy Competitive Points in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , how the currency functions, and what can be purchased with them, all relevant information has been included in the guide below.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , the only way to earn Competitive Points is by
  <strong>
   playing the Competitive Play game mode
  </strong>
  . This currency is given out as a reward for each match tied or won, giving players an incentive to continue grinding the ranks to climb or save up for their weapon skin of choice.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    For every Competitive game won, players will receive +10 Competitive Points.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    For every Competitive game that results in a draw, players will receive +5 Competitive Points.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Players will not receive any Competitive Points for Competitive games that result in a loss.
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  On top of the passive +10 / +5 for wins or draws, players will advance their Competitive Progression System by continuing to play and win games. After earning 30 Progress Points, players will gain an additional 100 Competitive Points, up to 30 rounds of progression for a total of +3000 Competitive Points per season.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lastly,
  <strong>
   Competitive Drives
  </strong>
  are a feature introduced in Season 12, enabling players to earn a variety of rewards including extra Competitive Points across the last week of a Competitive season. Players will earn
  <strong>
   +1000, +2000, and +3000 at the first, third, and fifth Competitive Drive Checkpoints
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  During a Competitive Year of
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  , Competitive Points are the only currency that can be earned. However, upon each new Competitive Year, a new weapon variant (Jade, Galactic, etc) is introduced, and all unspent Competitive Points on your account will be turned into Legacy Competitive Points. A new competitive year initially restricts players to only being able to purchase the new weapon type with their Competitive Points - likely done as a precaution to stop players from stockpiling their points and immediately buying out all of the new variants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead, Legacy Competitive Points can be used to purchase weapon skins that are locked within the initial stretch of a new competitive year - such as the Gold and Jade Weapons in Season 15. This restriction may eventually be lifted a couple of seasons into the competitive year as Jade weapons were, enabling players to purchase all weapon skin variants with their active Competitive Points further down the line.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   WWE 2K
  </em>
  series has consistently improved with each new installment since
  <em>
   WWE 2K22
  </em>
  . The presentation is exceptional, and the gameplay is accessible. Additionally, a highly anticipated feature has made a comeback in
  <em>
   <strong>
    WWE
   </strong>
  </em>
  <em>
   <strong>
    2K25
   </strong>
  </em>
  : the chain wrestling mechanic, which was last seen in
  <em>
   WWE 2K19
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  The return of this mechanic is great news for fans of traditional technical wrestling and adds another layer of depth and immersion. Like the trading blows feature in
  <em>
   WWE 2K24,
  </em>
  chain wrestling triggers a mini-game where the wrestlers can go back and forth, trading wrestling holds.

  The chain wrestling mechanic can be initiated at the start of a match while
  <strong>
   both wrestlers lock up at the same time
  </strong>
  with a
  <strong>
   chain icon
  </strong>
  above the wrestler's health bar. However, you can manually initiate a chain wrestling early in the match, even if both chain icons have disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
  To activate chain wrestling manually, use the following commands:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation:
   </strong>
   Grab the opponent with the
   <strong>
    circle button and hold it
   </strong>
   until the chain wrestling begins.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Xbox:
   </strong>
   Grab the opponent with the
   <strong>
    B button and hold it
   </strong>
   until the chain wrestling begins.
  </li>
 </ul>

     <strong>

  When chain wrestling is active, it initiates a
  <strong>
   circular mini-game
  </strong>
  with three actions:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Wrench:
   </strong>
   a grappling hold like a headlock, leglock, armbar, and more, depending on the position.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Switch:
   </strong>
   a transition to another grappling hold.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Attack or Drive:
   </strong>
   This will be an attack move or a push, driving the opponent into the corner to break the chain wrestling loop.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Each segment will indicate which action has a better chance of winning in the grapple, represented by
  <strong>
   green segments
  </strong>
  within the circular mini-game. Select the one with the green segments with the highest number of blocks, or try your luck with a different action using the left joystick.

  To win the grapple, move the left joystick in a circle until you feel the
  <strong>
   hotspot indicated by the vibrations
  </strong>
  . When the red circle has stopped expanding, rotate the left stick again to find a new hotspot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Wrestlers can potentially keep the chain wrestling going for a while with grapples and maneuvers that go back and forth. Wrestlers with a higher grapple tendency are more likely to try and grapple from the outset, but many wrestlers will start the match with attacks.

  While most fans love the chain wrestling mechanics, some will prefer to get down to the action straight away instead of trying to simulate a classic style wrestling match. To switch it off, use the following steps:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   On the main menu screen, move the joystick right to locate and select the
   <strong>
    Gameplay
   </strong>
   option.
  </li>
  <li>
   Under the Gameplay menu, scroll down to
   <strong>
    Chain Wrestling
   </strong>
   to switch it
   <strong>
    on or off
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  That's everything needed for the chain wrestling mechanics and how to initiate them at least twice in a match.

  When
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  , Rocket Racing, and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Festival launched,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  released a bunch of new cosmetic types in the Item Shop. From car bodies to LEGO builds and instruments, gamers had multiple never-seen-before items to try out. However, this was back in December 2023, and since then, there hadn't been anything too out of the ordinary in the Item Shop - but this all changed this season.

 <p>
  Kicks, a brand-new type of cosmetic, are now available in the Item Shop and the Battle Pass. To celebrate the release of kicks as the most recent cosmetic type in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , Epic Games is giving away a free emote, but it's unknown if it'll return to the game in the future so gamers should get it while they still can.

   Air Jordan 1 High OG kicks
  </strong>
  available on the Dynamo TNTina Quests page, they should put them on and play this emote in the lobby for bragging rights. Here is how the Show 'Em Off emote looks with the

  The Show 'Em Off emote was added to the Item Shop to celebrate the launch of the kicks as a new
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  cosmetic.
  <strong>
   Since it is a promotional item, it is likely that the Show 'Em Off emote is just a celebratory item and will not return once it leaves the Item Shop

 <p>
  It has not been confirmed that Show 'Em Off won't be available in the future, but this is what has happened before. The
  <strong>
   Hot Marat emote
  </strong>
  was added to the Item Shop for 0 V-Bucks to promote the
  <em>
   Wreck-It Ralph
  </em>
  sequel,
  <em>
   Ralph Breaks the Internet
  </em>
  . The movie was released on November 21, 2018, and the emote was available in the Item Shop for two days on November 24 and 25, and it has not returned since then. Despite being free, it is now considered one of the rarest emotes in
  <em>

  This quest begins when you speak to Bellara after coming back from Weisshaupt, assuming you've completed her first personal quest already. To start this second quest, you'll need to select the Elven Ruins area from the map, because there's no eluvian that goes directly there. Since you don't normally have access to this area, the quest will begin the moment you enter it.

  The quest starts in the same location as your first visit to the Elven Ruins, but you quickly end up on a new path that takes you to a new area. There's a blue barrier blocking the road you took the first time, so turn right instead and walk into the portal.

 <p>
  You'll fight against a mixed group of sentinels and spirits, then deal with a level 36 Greater Pride Demon. It's a tough battle, especially thanks to the small arena and the demon's combined barrier and armor bars.

 <p>
  Once you're done, use Tinker on the broken power node, then pick up the power crystal to de-power the barrier out. Bring the power crystal to the power node halfway across the bridge ahead to create a secondary bridge that leads to a small chest. Keep going forward to slide into a new area, and a new battle.

 <p>
  During this fight, focus on the Greater Spellwights first. They can fire lightning bolts that track to your location, and the window to dodge them is short. After all four enemies go down, the miniboss Burning Anger (a kind of rage demon) will smash through the wall, and two more Voltaic Shades will appear to support it. Burning Anger has several attacks you need to watch out for:

  Head through the wall Burning Anger smashed through. You might see a chest on a balcony above, but you can't reach it from your current room. Instead, use Tinker to fix the power node ahead, then drop in the power crystal from the alcove to your right. You can drop into the water below, but there's nothing down there to collect.

  On the far side of the bridge, turn right and follow the passage to find a campsite with an interesting note. Continue up the ladder to reach the chest you saw earlier. Back at the bridge, take the left path to reach a small chest.

  Go straight ahead now to fight a Frenzied Shade. After it goes down, Bellara will comment on the satchel in the road. Don't forget to grab the Memento to the left of the satchel.

  Use Tinker on the power node ahead, then remove the power crystal to deactivate the barrier. There's another node straight ahead, and placing the crystal there will let you reach another campsite with a small chest. Back on the main path, you'll come across a staircase down, but the door at its base is broken. Instead, go around the side to eventually reach the Veil Jumpers.

  In the final room of this quest, Bellara will have a conversation with an unexpected person from her past, along with his new master. After they leave, a fight begins against two Greater Shades and two Voltaic Shades. All of them are vulnerable to cold and resistant to necrotic.

  Bellara mentions that she can free the Veil Jumpers by deactivating the two large crystals at either end of the room. Keep in mind that you can only use abilities like Intuitive Tampering outside of combat, because breaking one of the crystals will summon a new wave of enemies. This second wave matches the first wave.

 <p>
  Breaking the second crystal will release the Veil Jumpers, but it also summons a Devouring Shade, a Shade Rejuvenator, and Toxic Yearning. The shades have the same elemental affinities as the last two waves, but Toxic Yearning is vulnerable to electricity and resistant to necrotic. Here are some tips for defeating Toxic Yearning:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Yearning sometimes creates pools of toxic (necrotic) poison on the ground. Standing on them causes damage, but they aren't very dangerous.
  </li>
  <li>
   Yearning can create a set of ten projectiles that fire all at once and from different angles. Each projectile doesn't deal much damage, but there are a lot of them. You can guard against them, but you may want to dodge out of the way instead.
  </li>
  <li>
   Yearning has a spin attack that goes on for several seconds. You'll want to dodge out of the way, since the attack can deal serious damage if you get caught in it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Devouring Shade and Shade Rejuvenator have ways to support Toxic Yearning, so eliminate them first.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  When the last enemies fall, you can speak to Bellara to end the quest. Before you go, be sure to open the large chest that appeared behind the two Veil Jumpers. The game jumps to Arlathan Forest and a discussion between the Veil Jumper leaders and Bellara. When the conversation finishes, you get 2,250 XP and +100 Veil Jumpers Strength.

   <em>
    Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game
   </em>
  </strong>
  sometime in early 2025 for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC. Here, players will be able to live the relaxing lifestyle of a Hobbit in the emerging village of Bywater. While the game is single player, gamers can still take part in numerous fun activities to help build up Bywater, including decorating Hobbit Holes, trading with townsfolks, and hosting extravagant meals with neighbors. Players may also encounter some familiar, iconic faces in Bywater, but there’s one pair who may shine exceptionally well in

  : the trouble making cousins Merry and Pippin.

  Both
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  book and film trilogy feature four Hobbits as primary protagonists in the war to defeat the Dark Lord Sauron. Fans of the books and films likely remember Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee as the duo that trekked across Middle-earth to Mount Doom and destroyed the One Ring. However, some fans might have forgotten two other Hobbits that helped Frodo and Sam on their quest: Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. All four Hobbits were childhood friends, but Merry and Pippin were the most troublesome of the bunch, even being recognized by the wizard Gandalf the Grey for their pranks and thievery.

  It was Merry and Pippin’s fun-loving nature that got them entwined in Frodo’s quest to destroy the One Ring when they stole crops from a local farmer and ran into Frodo and Sam on the way to the Prancing Pony. Once they joined the Fellowship, their goofiness reduced slightly but still appeared throughout in times of celebration such as the aftermath of the Battles of Helm’s Deep and Isengard. However, their foolishness still showed at times of great peril, including when Pippin awoke the Goblins in the Mines of Moria and when he later picked up Saruman's Palantir. Merry was generally shown to be the smarter of the two cousins.

  Merry and Pippin’s Feats and Legacy

 <p>
  Despite their fun-loving and often foolish personalities, both Merry and Pippin showed great bravery in the War of the Ring. The two were able to convince the tree-like Ents to fight the evil wizard Saruman and attack Isengard. Pippin journeyed with Gandalf to Gondor, helped defend the city from Orcs, and saved Faramir. Merry traveled with Eowyn to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and helped defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. Both of the Hobbits later helped fight Sauron’s final army at the Battle of the Black Gate and even led in the Battle of Bywater to free the Hobbit village from Saruman’s control in the books.

  <em>
   Tales of the Shire

  ’s exact place in
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  timeline is still relatively unknown, but there is still potential for Merry and Pippin to appear in the game. So far, only one main character from
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  has shown up in the game’s marketing, Gandalf the Grey, setting
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  before
  <em>
   The Fellowship of the Ring
  </em>
  . While there’s a long stretch of time before the
  <em>
   Fellowship
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  could be set after
  <em>
   The Hobbit
  </em>
  in order to allow Bilbo Baggins to offer some of his Dwarven treasure as possible decor and for young Merry and Pippin to appear in the game.

 <p>
  Merry and Pippin could serve as NPCs who can be seen occasionally pulling off pranks or stealing some things from the player’s neighbors in Bywater. This could provide some comedy and fun chaos to the relatively peaceful life in Bywater. Merry and Pippin could additionally act as NPCs who give players quests to retrieve items that are needed for some of their dastardly deeds. This could encourage players to explore more of the area around Bywater and offer players more of a chance to interact with some of the most famous Hobbits. In short, adding Merry and Pippin to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game
   </em>
  </strong>
  could help exemplify that this game is set in one of the most optimistic and jolly places in all of Middle-earth.

 <p>
  A recent leak from the beta servers has revealed that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  will be adding two new echoes and four new poses to the Imaginarium Theater in Version 5.3. Though character outfits and glider skins used to be the only type of cosmetics in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , the Imaginarium Theater opened up the possibility for the developers to introduce new cosmetic rewards at a regular pace.

 <p>
  While they may not be as flashy as character outfits, the Thespian Tricks and Envisaged Echoes add some extra flair to each individual character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . The former makes it easier to pose within the game's Photo Mode, whereas the latter adds a unique trailing effect when sprinting. Thespian Tricks can be obtained fairly easily through the Imaginarium Theater, but Envisaged Echoes are gated behind a difficult challenge catered to a specific character.

 <p>
  For Version 5.3,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players can expect to see four new Thespian Tricks for Bennett, Yae Miko, Tartaglia, and Lynette. Once again, they seem to be freeze frames taken from each character's idle pose, which should help players in getting that perfect Photo Mode shot. On the other hand, the new Envisaged Echoes belong to Kazuha and Ganyu in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . Kazuha can have a trail of autumn leaves following his footsteps, whereas Ganyu's echo is a trail of faint-blue snowflakes. Both the echoes and the poses were shared by Kazusa Leaks.

 <p>
  While the Imaginarium Theater in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  can sometimes hint at upcoming banner characters, this is not always the case – as seen with Wriothesley in Season 1. That being said, with Ganyu being one of the Opening Characters in Season 7 and having an Envisaged Echo added in Version 5.3, her chances of appearing on the Event Banner before Shenhe are rather high.

 <p>
  It should be noted that Cryo characters in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  struggle to feature on the Event Banners compared to characters that use other Elements. It's no secret that the developers struggle to find a place for Cryo in the modern meta, as even Citlali is designed to primarily support Pyro or Hydro characters. Though buffing neglected Elemental Reactions such as Superconduct, Freeze, and Shatter is a good step forward, it's fair to say that there are no current Cryo characters that can make the most out of the new changes. That being said, Wriothesley in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  remains a respectable hypercarry, and players can still clear the Spiral Abyss with Ayaka. While Cryo may not be a doomed element, it is certainly one that's currently lagging behind. Players will be able to pick up the new Thespian Tricks over the course of Version 5.3, which is set to launch on January 1, 2025.

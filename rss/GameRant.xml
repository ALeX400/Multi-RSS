  <em>
   Haikyuu Legends
  </em>
  is one of the representatives of sports simulators. And since the game is based on the popular
  <em>
   Haikyu
  </em>
  anime, players will have to play volleyball using various techniques and tactics. By winning, players will earn Yen, which is needed to spin new abilities. Fortunately, the game has a way to easily get extra money in just a couple of clicks, namely
  <em>
   Haikyuu Legends
  </em>
  codes.

  Using them, players can get various goodies, including valuable Yen. But as befits
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  codes, their validity period is quite short, so you should hurry.

 <p>
  Even though in
  <em>
   Haikyuu Legends
  </em>
  you can do only a few actions besides moving and jumping, the gameplay is quite complex. Depending on the action you choose, you can score a goal on the opponent's field or miss the ball. For this reason, it takes time for beginners to get used to the controls. However, you do not have to win matches to earn money. Instead, you can redeem
  <em>
   Haikyuu Legends
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each such code grants players various rewards, including money. So, if you want to buy spins for Yen, then use the codes while they are active. But it is worth noting that they expire quite quickly. Therefore, we do not recommend that you delay redeeming them.

  Respawn Entertainment has revealed
  <strong>
   <em>
    Apex Legends
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’ Season 24 Takeover patch notes, bringing plenty of buffs for weapons, updates for Armor and Helmets, the new Arsenals feature, and much more.
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  Season 24 also introduces a new Ranked system for both new and returning players, along with a wealth of fixes across several aspects of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the years,
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  has made a name for itself in the battle royale genre, offering a solid alternative to games like
  <em>
   PUBG
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , which dominated the genre in 2019. As a live-service game, it has undergone significant changes since its initial release, with many updates introducing new content over time. Far from being finished, Respawn Entertainment continues to release new updates while also planning a major 2.0 patch to expand the
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  experience in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Respawn Entertainment has finally rolled out the highly anticipated
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  Season 24, bringing major changes to the meta. The game now features Arsenals, new stations with fixed locations scattered across every map, where players have easier access to weapons and ammo. Additionally, Season 24 introduces new perks for the Assault class to make it more powerful and improve its weapon economy. The Assault class can now carry extra ammo, has two additional grenade slots, and retains access to Red Extended Supply Bins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Several Legends received updates in
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  ’ Season 24, especially Ash, who sees many improvements to her Arc Snare and Phase Breach. Arc Snare is now harder to break and immune to certain abilities that could instantly destroy it before, while Phase Breach has an increased range, travels faster, and features a new VFX effect to indicate max range when in placement mode. Moreover, Ash can now press “Jump” in the air to dash, and when she reaches level 3, she gains an additional dash charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The patch also makes some changes to
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  ’ support role, removing the ability to heal double with small meds or gain increased movement speed while healing. The developer explained that these nerfs were necessary because the identity of the role was being lost, and Respawn wants to make Supports more team-oriented rather than just hard to kill. The update also introduces a new set of challenges for new and returning Ranked players, which must be completed before they can join Ranked.

  <em>

  </strong>
 </p>

  </li>
  <li>
   EVO required to reach Level 3 increased to 1700 (was 1350)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dev Note: Red armor allowed for a much wider health disparity in the mid to late game which reinforced activities like farming damage on the outskirts and avoiding encounters to collect resources. By lowering the total Armor available to these actions and the levels required to earn them, you can now get end-game ready more easily and focus on what matters most—the fight.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Accelerated Weapons
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Assists with an Accelerated Weapon equipped will no longer grant the extra 30% ult charge in Mixtape Modes
  </li>

  GAMEPLAY UPDATES
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   NEW Arsenals
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  These stations provide players with easy and deterministic access to weapons and ammo of their choice.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Stations across all POI's on every map with fixed locations
  </li>
  <li>
   Ammo type provided randomizes each match
  </li>
  <li>
   Equipped with an enhancing terminal that upgrades one weapon matching the ammo type per Arsenal
   <ul>
    <li>
     Enhancing grants an upgraded attachment and provides an optic if one is missing
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Healing
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Cells now take 2.5s to complete (was 3s)
  </li>
  <li>
   Syringes now take 4s (was 5s)
  </li>
  <li>
   Cells &amp; Syringes now stack up to 6
   <ul>
    <li>
     Players now start with 4 Cells and 4 Syringes (was 2 each)
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Battery and Medkit spawn rates have been slightly increased
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dev Note: Players will undoubtedly need to continue popping meds whenever they can with lowered max health, a universal gold helmet perk, and a ton of weapon buffs. We’ve decided to shave down some of those sharp edges to make healing a little easier across the board.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Helmets
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   White, blue, and purple have been removed from the loot pool
  </li>
  <li>
   Players no longer start with a white helmet
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dev Note: Finding and equipping Helmets has always been a bit lackluster in both feeling the impact of wearing one and making the potential damage output a bit murky. Removing headshot damage reduction from the game makes damage more consistent, understandable, and easier to calculate.

Their adjustments this season should make them feel more consistent at range, improve their performance when tracking enemies, and staying on target while providing headshots without stealing the play-making potential of our snipers.

  <em>
   Dev Note: Shotguns are receiving a base damage increase, but losing their ability to deal increased headshot damage. They already represent incredible burst damage, but hitting those headshots create sharp output spikes that’s difficult to account for. This change creates a more understandable damage landscape that encourages players to land as many pellets as possible (instead of aiming for the head and whiffing half of them). Mozambiques will retain their headshot damage as a hybrid shotgun-pistol and the Care Package version of the Peacekeeper also keeps it to really lean into that slug shotty territory.

  <em>
   Dev Note: The Support Class was very strong last season. The faster movement and double small med heals gave these Legends rapid combat-reset potential that made them effective skirmishers, but didn’t inherently have a team-oriented feel. While this was great during the season of Support, we felt their identity was stronger as revival experts and this change will let them focus on that team-oriented specialization rather than feeling hard to kill.

  <em>
   Dev Note: Ash was overdue for some improvements to her kit to resurge her as a top Apex Predator. Many of her changes aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of her abilities: the improved placement, distance and speed of her Ult, and the snare’s tether point snagging from the projectile’s point rather than her escaping target. Most notably, Ash sees the addition of a brand new movement passive - reminiscent of her titan’s ability of yore. Her new dash is an incredibly effective mid-combat repositioning tool or distance closer making her a more effective skirmisher when closing in on her prey or quickly out-maneuvering in a duel. We expect to see a lot of impressive Ash players rise to the top with many of her upgrades doubling her abilities this season.

  <em>
   Dev Note: Ballistic has had a few updates, but has never really found his footing to lead the charge. Integrating the Sling and extra bullet upgrades into his kit gives more players access to the core of the Legend while empowering his Ult with speed—increasing his natural combat effectiveness and encouraging his squad to push and engage. Allowing Ballistic to carry a Crate Weapon in his Sling has always been something we’ve been dubious of, but this season we’re taking a bold stance to let Ballistic go…well, ballistic. The increased number of Tac charges should also allow players to more freely deploy the Overheat into their combat patterns or control the field if they also opt into the lasting bullet upgrade, giving more range of play and options for Ballistic.

 <p>
  <strong>
   NEW Road to Ranked Challenges
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Introduced a new set of challenges to unlock Ranked for new players and returning players who have not yet reached the level requirement.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Level 20 minimum still required to access Ranked and this is reflected as one of the challenges
  </li>
  <li>
   Existing players above Level 20 retain access
  </li>
  <li>
   Party restrictions apply: all members must complete challenges to access Ranked
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dev Note: The previous system of only requiring Level 20 was very prone to abuse by third-party bots, and could also be achieved by players who preferred Mixtape or LTMs. This new system will ensure that all new players joining Ranked have done the required work in BR matches and tested their mettle to a sufficient level to earn a spot in the competition.
  </em>

 <p>
  <strong>
   NEW Bot Royale Tutorial
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Notes will appear to assist with Legends, weapons, loot, and gameplay scenarios
  </li>
  <li>
   Low ammo or health items also receive prompts to ping nearby desired loot items
  </li>
  <li>
   On by default for accounts below Level 20 and will turn off once that threshold is reached
   <ul>
    <li>
     Can be manually turned on/off through the System menu under “Tutorial Systems”
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Weapon Mastery
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Trial simplification
   <ul>
    <li>
     Re-designed all trials
    </li>
    <li>
     Removed weapon level restriction for trials
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dev Note: The current Weapon Mastery system presented some issues, including overly complex gating mechanics that disrupt progression, trials demanding high player skill levels, and excessive reliance on randomness that can slow or stall progress. These new trials remove unnecessary randomness, shifting the focus back to the essence of weapon usage: dealing damages and eliminating enemies. If you’ve already completed trials and earned rewards they will remain unaffected. If your trials were partially completed or 90% done, no problem! Your progress will be converted, no need to start over.

  </em>
 </p>
 <h3 id="graphics">
  GRAPHICS
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Improved CPU rendering performance on all consoles
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   DX12 (PC)
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Changed the way that ultrawide monitors handle 16:9 and 16:10 resolutions in full-screen mode. They will now have pillarboxing (black borders on left and right) and no stretching. This behavior can be disabled with +mat_wide_pillarbox 0 launch argument, if stretching is desired.
  </li>
  <li>
   CPU rendering performance improved 5%-10% (situation based) and some frame drops may be reduced
  </li>
  <li>
   Added a launch argument +mat_minimize_on_alt_tab 1 that allows behavior similar to DX11 where tabbing away from/clicking out of the fullscreen game causes Apex to minimize
  </li>
  <li>
   Improved loading performance after compiling shaders for the first time (up to 30% faster on some systems). Note that shaders always need to be pre-loaded to minimize gameplay stuttering.
  </li>
  <li>
   Added a launch notification for players with incompatible GPUs that DX11 support will be discontinued
  </li>
 </ul>

   <em>
    Mini Heroes: Magic Throne
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a mobile game in the idle genre. In it, you will lead a team of small but strong characters on a dangerous journey through uncharted territories with a bunch of different enemies. Unfortunately, you won't be able to help your team directly in the battle, as the fights are completely automated. But you can unlock the better characters and upgrade them.

 <p>
  While the first game had a few romance options on top of bath maids always being available,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  seems to have many more short-term romances or flings for Henry to enjoy on his travels.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  One such romance opportunity is available during the Wedding Crashers main quest, but it's
  <strong>
   not with Myshka
  </strong>
  , the girl whom Svatya Thrush has a wager with Henry over. Instead, Henry has the chance to romance
  <strong>
   Doubravka, a shy girl sitting by herself
  </strong>
  as nobody else will offer to dance with her.

  While at the
  <strong>
   wedding in Semine
  </strong>
  , Henry has lots of objectives and can also talk to many other guests or engage in mini-games such as dice. While walking around the garden where guests are dancing, players may hear
  <strong>
   a woman calling Henry
  </strong>
  over. She is
  <strong>
   by the arch
  </strong>
  that connects the garden to the courtyard.
 </p>
 <h3 id="ask-doubravka-to-dance">

 <p>
  This is
  <strong>
   Doubravka's mother
  </strong>
  and upon talking to her, she will
  <strong>
   ask Henry to dance with her daughter
  </strong>
  , as nobody else has asked and she's too shy. To be able to romance Doubravka,
  <strong>
   answer 'I'll dance with her'

  Doubravka is
  <strong>
   sitting nearby in a purple dress
  </strong>
  with a ring of flowers in her hair. Go up to her and
  <strong>
   ask her to dance
  </strong>
  . She will be a bit hesitant at first, and here players can
  <strong>
   try to pass one of the skill checks
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   If the check fails
  </strong>
  , fear not as there is another option to
  <strong>
   offer Doubravka a drink
  </strong>
  . She will say yes, and Henry should go and find some wine from a table and return it to her.

  While dancing with Doubravka, players will notice that

   she keeps standing on Henry's toes
  </strong>
  , in fact, his health decreases a little each time.

 <p>
  When the dance is over, and she expresses her joy,
  <strong>
   Doubravka asks Henry if he enjoyed it

  . To romance her later,
  <strong>
   lie

 <p>
  A bit
  <strong>
   later during the night
  </strong>
  , once Henry has completed some main objectives which advance time, Doubravka will
  <strong>
   call out to Henry
  </strong>
  as he's passing her original spot by the fire. She wants to tell Henry something, and if players want to
  <strong>
   romance Doubravka
  </strong>
  , they should
  <strong>
   answer with the following three responses
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   '
   <strong>
    I'm listening.
   </strong>
   '
  </li>
  <li>
   '
   <strong>
    I like you, too.
   </strong>
   '
  </li>
  <li>
   '
   <strong>
    I see. Let's go then.
   </strong>
   '
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If players select these dialogue options,
  <strong>
   Doubravka will lead Henry upstairs
  </strong>
  for some alone time.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_21">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     Don't forget to redress Henry before walking out. Otherwise, guests will lose opinion of him for being almost naked.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Afterward, Henry can go up to Doubravka to ask how she enjoyed it, but players might not want to hear her honest response.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is also an
  <strong>
   alternative way
  </strong>
  for this romance to unfurl. If Henry keeps saying
  <strong>
   'not now' to her advances
  </strong>
  , Doubravka will eventually offer Henry a drink, leading to a questionable moment that somehow she seems to enjoy more.

      <title>What New Weapon Could Kratos Get in an Egyptian God of War Game?</title>

  As should be expected of any good action game franchise, weapons play a vital role in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    God of War
   </strong>
  </em>
  series. In
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , weapons aren't just tools that let players dispatch hordes of foes in gory fashion, they're a key part of the narrative, with each one being a reflection of the mythological setting it's found in, and each one being tied to a key event in Kratos' journey.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  franchise has had plenty of iconic weapons over the years, from the Blades of Chaos that symbolize Kratos' servitude to the Greek gods, to the Leviathan Axe that represents his redemption and connection to Laufey. For years, fans have wanted a
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  game set in Ancient Egypt, and according to some recent rumors, it might finally be on the cards. And if Kratos journeys to Egypt next, it's a safe bet to assume he'll add another distinct weapon to his arsenal.

  Probably the most iconic weapon associated with Ancient Egypt, the khopesh is a sickle-shaped sword/axe hybrid. For over 1000 years, the Egyptians used the khopesh to circumvent shields and pierce key organs. Smaller iterations of the khopesh were often used as an off-hand weapon, being used to land the killing blow. If the next

  Ranged weapons aren't usually commonplace in Kratos' arsenal, but a

  game set in Ancient Egypt could change that. Ranged weapons were a vital part of Egypt's military strategy, and the composite bow was considered one of the civilization's best tools. Made of animal horn, sinew, and wood all combined and laminated together, the composite bow is able to deliver as much power as a "self bow" while being much smaller.

  The Ancient Egyptians would also often use simple slings during hunting and warfare. Essentially just a basket, some string, and a few stones, a sling could be used by Kratos as a sort of quickfire ranged weapon, being used primarily to counter oncoming attacks rather than deal significant damage at range.

  Kratos has wielded plenty of hammers in his time, and an Ancient Egyptian mace would function very similarly. Often used with two hands, an Egyptian mace is just a big hunk of metal on the end of a stick that was used to bludgeon foes, and that simple tool could be exceptionally deadly in Kratos' godly hands.

  An Ancient Egyptian weapon with a very distinct design, the fan axe was a 5ft-long polearm made of bronze. Due to its elegant but impractical shape, it's believed that the fan axe was mostly used as a ceremonial weapon, though that hasn't stopped it from appearing in a handful of games over the years, such as Ubisoft's historical brawler

  . While a mace, bow, and sling might be more useful to Kratos in the heat of battle, the fan axe would give the god a distinctly Egyptian weapon for his ever-growing arsenal.

  The Impact Break system helps to weigh the impactful attacks in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Tenkaichi
  </em>
  . The system allows the fighter to damage huge sections of the environment by using a signature ki blast on the opponent. It helps to make the battles more exaggerated and thematic, especially with its anime shots.

 <p>
  What makes this system very impactful are the camera angles and aftermath. The perspective changes similar to the show, catching different angles of the attacker before shifting focus to the defender. The defender can react depending on his current ki gauge. Once the ki super ends, the camera showcases the destruction, revealing the strength of the attack. If the opponent was in the blast, they are left concerned and bruised in the crater or trail of destruction.

  Area Destruction is an essential option for Raiders to rain their dominance on the map in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z The Breakers
  </em>
  . Itâ€™s available after the raider gets enough energy to transform into a higher-ranked form. The most traditional method is to kill a civilian or survivor. The more unique methods depend on each raider, whether through automated time, taking damage, or using certain moves.

 <p>
  Once the raider transforms into a stronger form, Area Destruction is immediately accessible. This allows the raider to jump unreachably high on the map and scout each area before choosing which to obliterate. It takes a while to charge, though it limits the survivorsâ€™ grounds and resources. Itâ€™s perfect for showing the destructive force of a Dragon Ball villain.

  An environmental feature is introduced in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast
  </em>
  to utilize the surroundings more often. Fighters can knock their opponent into the wall or ground, burying them in the environment. Itâ€™s a common situation that makes the fighter more vulnerable such as Goku being pressured by Majin Vegeta during Majin Buuâ€™s Revival.

 <p>
  This mechanic relies on environmental awareness since its great rewards benefit either fighter. Itâ€™s a faithful inclusion that allows players to continue their advantage and extend damage with combos.

  Sonic sway is one of the new defensive mechanics in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3
  </em>
  . It allows the user to dodge the opponentâ€™s quick attacks with little effort as if theyâ€™re in the
  <em>
   Matrix
  </em>
  . Itâ€™s similar to how Goku and Perfect Cell attack each other while dodging at light speed. As punishment during the animation, the opponentâ€™s ki is drained as they continue whiffing their attacks. Whatâ€™s worse is the attacker is left open for a counterattack.

 <p>
  The defense option is helpful, though its use is limited. It can only work against light melee attacks, which makes the user vulnerable to strong smash or rush attacks. It requires reading and predicting the opponentâ€™s plan.

  Players can personally engage in the

  </em>
  timeline through character customization in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Xenoverse
  </em>
  . Players can use one of five canonical races designed with different combos and traits. Each race has unique equipment, especially transformation forms like the Namekian giant form or Majin kid buu form.

 <p>
  The greatest customization option is configuring the skills. Skills are acquired in a few ways, whether through the shops, mission completions, or mentorships. Familiar characters can become mentors who teach players skills and transformations or assist them during battle. Players can socialize with heroes, villains, and even the champion. With these amounts of options, players can create their ideal warrior through appearance and combat.

  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3
  </em>
  is one of the earlier games that feature the most essential aspect of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  , beam struggle. This mechanic occurs when two fighters use ki-based beams simultaneously at each other. When the ki beams clash, players must mash on their analog sticks to win the struggle. The losing player takes damage while the winner takes the struggleâ€™s glory.

 <p>
  Beam struggle is one of the most casual fun additions that isnâ€™t too common in the modern market. One of the major reasons is it's anti-competitive, being unbalanced in tournament play. It's been omitted since developers are making more competitive games for veteran players like
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Xenoverse
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Fighterz
  </em>
  . Competition does help video games last longer, though beam clashes are still one of the most hype interactions for anyone.

  What makes
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z Kakarot
  </em>
  very different from other Dragon Ball games is its open world. Many
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games focus on the major battles for Goku and the Z-Fighters, but never the events before or after the fights. Various activities are available between the canonical battles, giving players a peaceful break. The world is vast with familiar characters to interact such as Eighter, Nam, Bulma, Z-Fighters, and so much more.

  The Parallel Quests system is the most effective way to set up different interactions in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2
  </em>
  . Parallel quests are missions for the players to complete within the Dragon Ball timeline. Some dark force is interfering with certain events, forcing the need for time patrollers to assist. It allows the players to witness canonical events and what-if situations when exploring different timelines.

 <p>
  EX Fusion is a main mechanic that widens limitless potential in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Fusions
  </em>
  . EX fusion is a unique technique that allows two fighters to fuse as one stronger warrior. Itâ€™s very similar to the potara fusion since it requires the fighters to wear an accessory, but it also needs the fighters to do the fusion dance to activate. EX Fusionâ€™s major difference from the two fusions is its permanent time limit. The only way to defuse is to remove the fusion gauntlet, the metamo-ring.

 <p>
  Another difference is its unrestricted limitations. Thereâ€™s no consequence for the fighters to fuse with different power levels or races. Anyone can use EX Fusion freely, building a wide cast of fusion characters like Gohanks, Karoly, Prillin, Vegehanks, and more. It gives a lot for the players to discover different combinations, becoming one of the best additions to
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  .

  If you're playing as a tank or any other class that uses physical force as a form of crowd control, then Collision Chance might be an important stat for your build. Whether or not you get Collision Chance does depend on what weapon combos you use in
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty

  , but if controlling the battlefield is your thing, here's what you need to know about how to make most out of this stat.

  Simply put, Collision Chance refers to
  <strong>
   your character's ability to successfully hit Collision effects
  </strong>
  . It's very much like Hit Chance, except this stat determines whether your enemy gets affected by a Collision skill or not. The higher your Collision Chance score, the better your odds, generally speaking. The

 <p>
  The way this works is the game checks if your Collision Chance is higher than the enemy's Collision Evasion. For every 10 point difference between those two, your chance of successfully inflicting a Collision effect increases by approximately 4%. If the enemy's Collision Evasion is
  <strong>
   higher
  </strong>
  than your Collision Chance,
  <strong>
   then your odds of hitting them will worsen
  </strong>
  .

  Collision is a tag referring to
  <strong>
   crowd control effects that displace your enemy
  </strong>
  . Two good examples are the
  <strong>
   Strategic Rush and Chain Hook skills for the Sword and Shield
  </strong>
  â€” the former has Collision: Push, while the latter has Collision: Pull.

 <p>
  There's also Collision: Push on the Crossbows'
  <strong>
   Collision Shot,
  </strong>
  and Collision: Prone on
  <strong>
   Ascending Slash
  </strong>
  , which is often used to set players up for one of the Greatsword's strongest skills, Guillotine Blade.

 <p>
  Ideally, players should only get Collision Chance if their build relies heavily on landing a Collision effect. With that said, it's a good stat to have if you're using Guillotine Blade as one of your main damage skills. It deals significantly more damage if a target is Prone. However, don't hyperfocus on building Collision Chance, as there are other stats that are much more valuable when it comes to dealing damage or tanking hits.

  Bayern Munichâ€™s best formation in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  is finely crafted to use the talent available.
  <strong>
   The 4-1-4-1 layout works best here as all the highest-rated players are in the Starting 11 and are placed in positions that work best for them.
  </strong>
  The midfield is strong and spread out, attack is afforded creativity, and even defense is strong and fluid.

  The
  <strong>
   4-1-4-1 formation
  </strong>
  sees two wide midfielders.
  <strong>
   The pseudo-wingers help you better cover the field in terms of defense or attack, providing Bayern Munich with more creative liberty
  </strong>
  . When talking about player roles in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  , both Coman and Olise are set as Wide Playmakers. With this, they come in to create a high-passing spread with the two CMs, Kimmich, and Kane. Coman and Oliseâ€™s pace and dribbling stats are of great help in this regard.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Musiala and Mullerâ€™s skills help in creating a wider playable net for Bayern Munich's best formation in
   <em>
    EA Sports FC 25
   </em>
   .
  </strong>
  Playmaker (Roaming) works well for them and helps boost Kane's Attacking Foward++ role. The presence of a CDM in the Holding++ (Roaming) role also helps out in getting the ball back before the backline needs to get involved. The three of them are more than enough to outplay any midfielder, so you can let go of any concerns you have about their flexibility.

 <p>
  Thereâ€™s another factor, or two, really, that helps Bayern Munichâ€™s best formation in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  stand tall - Davies and Kimmich. Alphonso Davies is lightning fast on the ball, which means you can easily run past anyone to support attacking plays or rush back to cut a counterattack. Meanwhile, Kimmich is an elite Attacking Wingback. He has an efficient, intimidating presence on the field.
  <strong>
   Whether youâ€™re talking about defense or going upfield to help Olise, Muller, and Kane, Kimmich is the natural starting right back in
   <em>
    EA Sports FC 25

   .

  The talent present in the midfield and defense, not to mention attack, will intimidate any opponent.

 <p>
  Starting things off, Bayern Munich's Harry Kane is one of the best strikers in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  . He has 93 Shooting - 94 Att. Position, 95 Finishing, and 94 Shot Power - and 94 Reactions. This means he'll always find a gap to exploit, no matter how good the defense is. Kane also has Finesse Shot+ and Power Header this season, so you can easily score from outside the box or even from crosses and corners.

 <p>
  When talking about the wings, Coman's Rapid+, First Touch, and 87 Dribbling can help you get past even the fastest center-backs in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  . He's set in the Wide Playmaker (Attack) role and can go right up to the top. This
  <strong>
   creates neat lines of passing in Bayern Munich's formation with Kane, Musiala, and even Davies as the Falseback.
  </strong>
 </p>

 <p>
  On the other side, Michael Olise is new to the team. He comes with 84 Vision, 82 Crosses, and 84 Dribbling, His Whipped Pass and Technical are incredibly helpful, and Finesse Shot can help you score while the opponent is busy dealing with Kane, Muller, Musiala, and even Kimmich.

 <p>
  Let's head to Bayern Munich's midfield core now. Musiala, Muller, and Palhinha are absolute gems. Musiala's Technical+ and Trickster grant you the ability to use new and exclusive skill moves in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  , while Incisive Pass buffs passing acumen.
  <strong>
   Muller's experience clearly shows in how he plays. Be it 87 Vision, 92 Att. Position, or 91 Reactions, he's a complete all-rounder threat.
  </strong>
  Since he and Musiala are also good shooters, you can go for varied strategic plays to keep things fresh and your opponent off balance.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1047} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Palhinha is a promising defensive midfielder in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  . There's one point of concern, 52 Pace, but that's more than compensated by his defensive skill. Palhinha comes with Bruiser+, Slide Tackle, and Long Ball Pass. In terms of stats, he has top-notch 90 Strength and 95 Aggression, along with 85 Defending.
  <strong>
   Palhinha's function as a CDM thus brings a ton of defensive stability to Bayern Munich, especially with the Holding++ (Roaming) role.

  <strong>
   At the backline, Davies can run up and down the wing all day, every day.
  </strong>
  Keeping him as a Falseback gives you an additional boost in the midfield, and his pace means he'll outpace any player you target. Kimmich's Attacking Wingback++ is supernatural in its efficiency, so you can rest assured that you always have an advantage there.

  <strong>
   Kim Min Jae's 83 rated card is deceptive
  </strong>
  â€”he's way better. He comes with excellent stats, not to mention
  <strong>
   important playstyles like Power Header, Aerial, Block, and Intercept
  </strong>
  . As such, he can suppress even strong aerial threats with ease. Upamecano is much the same, but with better pace, strength, and aggression. His Bruiser playstyle is quite effective in winning the ball back.

  <strong>
   Bayern Munich's Starting 11 star, Manuel Neuer, is easily one of the best goalkeepers in
   <em>
    EA Sports FC 25
   </em>
   .
  </strong>
  83 Diving, 88 Positioning, and 83 Reflexes work smashingly with his 6'4 frame. Moreover, Pinged Pass+ and Long Ball Pass can help you get started on a counterattack right away. Neuer also has Far Throw, so that's an added advantage.

  Bayern Munich's best substitutes have great talent, but they're on the bench because the Starting 11 is just that good. Moreover, all the substitutes come with good stats and playstyles. This ensures that even if you have to sub out a player due to stamina or an injury, these guys will have your back.

  <em>
   <strong>
    WWE 2K24
   </strong>
  </em>
  has officially revealed the Bray Wyatt Edition of the game. When it was released back in March 2024, the
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  fans had a choice between the Standard, the Deluxe, and the Forty Years of WrestleMania Editions. While those who have purchased the Forty Years of WrestleMania edition were led to believe that it was the ultimate and most complete collection of the game that included all the content,
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  just announced another version that will introduce some new material.

 <p>
  Earlier in October 2024,
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  teased new Bray Wyatt models and entrances. With just a date of October 16, 2024 as the sole information given, some fans had speculated that new MyFaction models were going to be introduced to the game. Especially since many other alternate characters like Big Poppa Pump made it to that mode, it was an educated guess by many players. However, it seems the assumptions may be wrong as
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  has just unveiled a new version of the game for sale.

 <p>
  Revealed in a tweet by
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  , the Bray Wyatt Edition will be arriving on October 16, 2024. This version of the game will introduce the alternate appearance of Bray Wyatt based on the Becoming Immortal documentary, a new Uncle Howdy model which will have Bo Dallas underneath the mask, and a special Mattel Elite Series 112 Bray Wyatt playable character that also includes the classic Wyatt Family theme music. In addition, Firefly Funhouse Friends MyFaction Manager cards are also included, along with an in-game version of The Fiend's championship title, and 67,500 virtual currency.

  Similar to
  <em>

  's Bad Bunny Edition, those who already have the base game will have the ability to purchase the DLC content as a standalone pack. However, purchasing the DLC pack will only yield 15,000 virtual currency instead of the originally mentioned amount. Still, it may not seem like a bad deal as many fans have long been waiting for updates regarding Bray Wyatt and his cohorts.

  When exploring the Fascist Armory in

   <em>
    Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
   </em>
  </strong>
  , you will see a locked equipment room warning about monkeys nearby, which triggered the Monkey Business mystery.

  Basically, Indy needs to follow the trail of the monkeys as they stole many essential items, including the key to the equipment room. If players wish to unlock the room, and collect useful materials from inside, make sure to complete the Monkey Business mystery.

  Similar to A Child’s Play mystery in
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  , Indy will find a clue that sends him on a treasure hunt. However, in the Monkey Business mystery, you will be following the monkey trail and trying to find a key instead of an actual treasure.

 <p>
  To trigger the quest, head to the Fascist Armory and make sure to wear the Royal Army outfit, otherwise Indy will need to sneak or fight his way in. After leaving the boat at the nearby dock, crawl under the wired fence to enter the Fascist Armory. Approach the nearby two-story building and head to the second floor.

  The second floor should have a board with a monkey warning on it. Snap a picture of it with your camera to trigger the Monkey Business mystery. You can also read the nearby note stating that all the keys to the equipment room are gone, hinting that the monkeys had taken them. Now that you have all the necessary information, it’s time to search for the little thieves.

  More often than not, games put the player in the shoes of the hero of the story. This is especially true for action RPGs, in which the player is usually given flashy powers and set against some stereotypical army of darkness. However, not all action RPGs are made the same, and some allow players to shape the story however they like.

 <p>
  There are many choice-based games where your decisions matter; some of these are also action RPGs. In these games, the player can choose to be either a hero or a villain, and it can be a lot of fun playing as the bad guy for once. We've compiled a list of some of the best action RPGs with evil routes. To qualify, the games had to have fairly hefty RPG systems and action-oriented combat. We've lumped some series, like Mass Effect, together to avoid repetition as one entry.
  <strong>
   The games are ranked according to aggregate review scores and their reception upon release.

  Instead,
  <em>
   Vampyr
  </em>
  was all about making the player feel like a morally conflicted vampire. Everything about
  <em>
   Vampyr's
  </em>
  gameplay and systems was centered around that goal. For example, in most RPGs, players level up by gaining experience, but in
  <em>
   Vampyr
  </em>
  , the best way to become powerful is by feeding on important NPCs. The player is encouraged to build up bonds with quest givers to build up the value of their blood before feeding on them. The more bloodthirsty the player is, the more powerful they become, but they doom London in the process. By the time the player has earned the most evil/worst ending in

   Vampyr

  , Jonathan has become one of the scariest vampires in video games.

  Much like
  <em>
   Vampyr
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade’s
  </em>
  choices revolve around either embracing one’s vampiric nature or trying to retain some semblance of humanity.
  <strong>
   The more civilians the player fed on, the more evil powers like Dominate or Dementation they used, the lower their humanity became

 <p>
  Alongside these gameplay-based decisions, the player was also encouraged to make difficult story-related decisions. Making calls like joining the evil Sabbat or supporting the villainous Prince LaCroix certainly counts as going down the evil route. On the other hand, a "good" playthrough saw the player adhering to the Masquerade and choosing to protect humans rather than using them as cattle. It's decisions like these that make
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade
  </em>
  one of the best games with a vampire protagonist.

  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  might be an FPS, but when it comes to storytelling, it’s an old-school Obsidian RPG full of moral choices. In fact, it's hard to think of another action RPG with quite so many choices to make. Whereas a “good” playthrough is all about taking on the Galaxy’s most evil corporations, an evil playthrough sees the player becoming the ultimate corporate shill in one of the best evil endings in RPGs.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Besides siding with The Board, the player can be almost comically evil
  </strong>
  . Most NPCs can be freely murdered at any time, and, in an evil playthrough, the player can happily kill those who trust them for personal gain. Who cares about the rest of the galaxy when you can live as a wealthy Byzantium elite?

  As a classic Bioware series, the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  games give the player countless opportunities to be either good or evil. While the games occasionally try to make major decisions appear morally gray, decisions like handing Isabella over to the Qunari or giving Fenris over to his master, Danarius, are clearly evil.
  <strong>
   While the games may have started out as slightly less action-oriented, later entries have thoroughly embraced action RPG combat.
  </strong>

 <p>
  The coolest part of making decisions in
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  is that the big ones roll over to later games. By consistently making these evil choices, players can create a version of the Dragon Age world where their protagonist leaves a trail of betrayal, destruction, and moral compromise across Thedas. This doesn't just mean the Dragon Age games are immensely replayable, it makes them some of the best action RPGs for evil playthroughs.

  The
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  series looked dead for a while, but 2025 is set to be a good year for fans of the series. It might be true that some entries in the franchise were better than others, but few other action RPGs encourage player choice to the extent that the Fable games did. Players can shape their character's path by performing “evil” deeds like theft and murder and by making evil choices during quests. They were even judged over their choice of food, like chowing down on crunchy chicks over tofu.

 <p>
  One of the best parts was how these kinds of decisions impacted the player’s character physically. Taking an evil path would lead to the player growing horns, becoming paler, and getting glowing red eyes. NPCs also reacted to the player's decisions, with shopkeepers shunning evil players from their stores and villagers simply refusing to converse. It'll be interesting to see what an evil route looks like in the new Fable when it releases; choice-based games have come a long way since 2010.

  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  series has always been a little more subtle when it comes to making moral decisions. Its world is morally gray, and Geralt likes to paint himself as an impartial bystander rather than a hero. This being said, there are plenty of decisions in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  that can easily be characterized as evil. For example, betraying Roche to Djikstra, killing Keira, and manipulating the Red Baron into hanging himself are all pretty evil.

 <p>
  In the games' massive overarching story, the consequences of these kinds of decisions can range from small to massive, but they do tend to snowball. Making selfish or "evil" decisions tends to undermine Geralt's relationship with Ciri. Making a series of bad decisions leads to her death in the game's finale. Outside of Ciri, being a not-very-nice guy can come with other unexpected repercussions for Geralt (cheating on Yennefer and Triss is a bad idea). This all being said, one of the best things about
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  games is their morally ambiguous nature. It's not always clear which choices are good or evil, and sometimes the games are as likely to reward the player for making an evil choice as it is to punish them for trying to do the right thing.

  The
  <em>
   Fallout

  games started out as turn-based RPGs, but ever since
  <em>
   Fallout 3,
  </em>
  the franchise has featured FPS combat and increasingly action-oriented gameplay. The series has never shed its decision-based RPG roots, however, and all the modern games offer the player plenty of chances to be evil. Both
  <em>
   Fallout 3

  and
  <em>
   New Vegas

  have karma systems that keep a tally of the player's actions and reward them with certain perks and NPC interactions depending on how they play.

  Which game has the most evil route is up for debate.
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  is arguably the most morally gray and its endings/ decisions are largely a matter of perspective.
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  , on the other hand, lets the player be an absolute menace. They could side with the fascist Enclave, blow up Megaton for caps (or simply the giggles), and deprive the Capital Wasteland of clean drinking water. Meanwhile, in
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  players can make evil decisions like joining the Casear's slave-owning regime (and even enslaving their own companions) or wiping out other factions to make themselves the Mojave's dictator.

 <p>
  One of the most famous aspects of the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  series is easily its Paragon vs. Renegade system. Playing as a Paragon typically meant making morally "good" decisions and treating others with respect. Conversely, being a rude jerk and making more brutal decisions earned Renegade points. Being either Renegade or Paragon unlocked different skills, changed Sheperd's appearance in
  <em>
   Mass Effect 2,
  </em>
  and came with massive story ramifications.

 <p>
  Technically, Sheperd is never really "evil" since even in Renegade playthroughs, the player is still trying to save the universe. Still, being a Renegade often feels evil, seeing as the player could do things like doom an entire species to extinction and get the crew of their ship killed.
  <strong>
   Sadly, the series dropped the ball with
   <em>
    Mass Effect 3’s
   </em>
   ending, which boiled all these moral decisions down to a simple, underwhelming choice.

  In true Bethesda fashion,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  empowers the player to be pretty evil. While the main quest doesn’t necessarily have an “evil route”, plenty of side quests do. Most famously, the Dark Brotherhood quest line sees the player become a ruthless assassin who works for the Night Mother.

 <p>
  Likewise, the Dawnguard DLC made players choose between becoming a blood-thirsty vampire or a vampire hunter, with the former feeling pretty evil. Other quests have the player making demonic pacts with Daedra and even sacrificing loyal companions. Much like with
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  , the player is also free to just be a massive jerk and can murder non-vital NPCs at will, betray friends and generally be a pain in the butt.

  When it comes to open-world games that embrace freedom,

  is hard to beat. Its status as one of the best action RPGs ever made is also beyond doubt at this point. What fewer people talk about, however, is how downright evil
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  lets the player be. Like the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  games that came before it,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has plenty of endings to unlock, with some of them being pretty evil.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Take, for example, the Loathsome Dung Eater quest line, which is just as evil as it sounds.
  </strong>
  That one ends with the world being taken over by an evil curse. Similarly, the Lord of the Frenzied Flame ending sees the player betraying Melina and burning the entire world to a crisp. Outside the endings,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has plenty of other evil opportunities. The player can be a murder hobo who travels the world killing friendly NPCs, and several quests give the player the opportunity to betray friends, sometimes for no personal gain. The worlds in FromSoftware's games are always bleak, but the developer always makes sure the player can make them even darker.

  Like other tactical shooters,
  <strong>

  </strong>
  Ballistic demands high precision, regardless of your chosen weapon. Accuracy is key to eliminating enemies effortlessly, gaining an advantage over opponents, and securing wins more consistently.

 <p>
  To achieve this, fine-tuning your crosshair settings is essential. The crosshair serves as your primary guide for where your shots will land, making it an invaluable tool for aiming effectively. Optimizing these settings will enhance your precision and efficiency, giving you the upper hand in matches and improving your chances of success. That said, here are the best
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic crosshair settings.

  <em>
   Fortnite

  Ballistic may not offer a wide variety of default crosshair options, but optimizing the available settings is
  <strong>
   crucial for maintaining precise aim
  </strong>
  . If you’re transitioning from other tactical shooters, you might find Ballistic’s default crosshair less suited for high-precision gameplay. While it can be functional for some players, leaving it unchanged could impact your accuracy, potentially causing you to miss shots that require pinpoint precision.

 <p>
  This adjustment
  <strong>
   prevents the weapon from following the gun's recoil pattern while shooting
  </strong>
  . While understanding a weapon’s recoil is helpful for better control, preventing the crosshair from following the recoil pattern while firing while staying still – especially at long distances – ensures that your shots are more precise. Combined with the spread setting explained above, which keeps your crosshair centered, you can aim and shoot effectively.

  These settings can vary based on your playstyle and familiarity with the crosshair and recoil mechanics of other shooters. However, the adjustments outlined in this guide are
  <strong>
   designed to minimize missed shots and significantly enhance accuracy
  </strong>
  , particularly when firing from the hip without aiming down sights.

  compared to other tactical shooters where ADSing is less common. However, similar to those games,
  <strong>
   staying completely still while shooting is essential
  </strong>
  . Moving while firing increases both spread and recoil, making it much harder to maintain control and land shots on your enemies.

  The Details section is where you'll find the most significant opportunities to boost performance in
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  . Pay close attention to the Lighting and Shadows settings, as they have a substantial impact on framerate. On the other hand, Texture Quality has little to no effect on performance, provided your GPU has enough VRAM to handle the load.

   <em>
    The Last of Us Part 2

  </strong>
  puts its players through the emotional wringer as Ellie and Abby's separate journeys for revenge bring the two face to face. Joel's shocking death in
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  at the hands of Abby was jaw-dropping enough, but having players experience half the game from her perspective was even more bold. While the choice was incredibly controversial and divisive back in 2020, the passage of time has shown that the back-and-forth between Abby and Ellie's perspectives tells a gripping story that showcases how hollow revenge can be.

  's story pits the characters against each other in two separate boss fights; the first from Abby's perspective and the second from Ellie's. Seeing these characters from different viewpoints is truly effective, and if

  happens, developer Naughty Dog may want to recycle such an encounter one last time.

  Despite their differences, Ellie and Abby have many similarities, with the biggest of all being their taste for revenge. The two care for their loved ones deeply, which leads to both of them doing horrible things in order to avenge these relationships. However, during the final fight between Ellie and Abby, the former comes to realize the further emptiness that killing Abby will bring, allowing the latter to escape. It's a controversial decision, but a powerful one. Although Ellie's lust for blood may seem to have subsided, that doesn't mean a potential
  <em>
   TLOU Part 3

  won't reignite the conflict between the two.

  The Last of Us Part 3 Showing Ellie and Abby's Evolution Through Combat
 </h3>
 <p>
  It's unclear where a third chapter of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  might go, but theories have suggested a possible new time jump. If this is the case, then a story that bounces between older and wiser versions of Ellie and Abby could be compelling. A third chapter featuring these two characters would likely imply that they are bound to cross paths again, and if they do, it probably won't be a peaceful encounter. Bringing the Abby and Ellie boss fights back in
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  could be a perfect way to showcase how the two have changed and grown since
  <em>
   Part 2
  </em>
  .

  Depending on how many years have passed since they last saw each other, the two could be far more skilled at fighting, which could bring even more heart-pounding combat sequences to life. When playing as Abby, having to watch out for Ellie's agility was just as scary as coming in contact with the infected. On the other hand, playing as Ellie against Abby's brute strength was a completely different challenge. To say Abby and Ellie have gone through a lot is an understatement, and this has informed how their characters fight and survive.

  Adding more years of learned skills to these characters would only make them stronger, but only time will tell what
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  holds. Ellie and Abby's fates are left open-ended, which hopefully means answers will come eventually. However, there is also the possibility that Naughty Dog goes in a completely new direction with the franchise.

  Gamers have been trying to find clues as to what Naughty Dog's next game could be. While many hope for a
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  , it could also be a fresh IP. Even if it's a brand-new IP, though, there will hopefully still be space to wrap up Ellie and Abby's stories in the future.

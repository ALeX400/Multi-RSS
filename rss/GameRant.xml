  For any number of reasons, be they physical disabilities or unforeseen injuries, some gamers may be forced to play with only one hand, either permanently or temporarily. While this hindrance does limit certain types of gameplay, some titles operate with a simple point-and-click progression. Others even offer more accessible alternatives in the Settings menu to make the typically challenging aspects of gameplay less strenuous. While some companies sell ergonomic controllers to support one-handed gaming, it isn't always necessary to spend extra money to enjoy certain horror games, even if they aren't all as fast-paced as
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Disabilities or injuries shouldn't deter gamers from doing what they love, even if the game catalog is a little thinned out for players who are forced to play without the advantage of two hands. Regardless, many innovative and intriguing horror games present an immersive, accessible experience for gamers of all ages, abilities, and impairments.
  <strong>
   Here are a few horror games that are suited to one-handed gamers.

  <em>
   Doki Doki Literature Club!
  </em>
  isn't suitable for young children or the easily disturbed.
  <strong>
   Dan Salvato's psychological horror game, disguised as a harmless dating simulator,
  </strong>
  allows one-handed gameplay even without modifications.
  <em>
   Doki Doki Literature Club!
  </em>
  is a visual novel that has a low level of interaction and prioritizes its engaging storyline before overly complicated controls. The player controls an MC who joins a new literature club at their high school under the encouragement of their friend, Sayori. There, the MC meets three other girls; Monika, Yuri, and Natsuki.
  <em>
   Doki Doki Literature Club!
  </em>
  uses a minigame to determine which of the three girls (excluding Monika for storyline purposes) to romance by composing a poem of certain keywords appealing to each girl's nature.

 <p>
  Depending on the outcome of the minigame, the MC will experience scenes with their chosen love interest and have the opportunity to engage with them one-on-one.
  <em>
   Doki Doki Literature Club!
  </em>
  is played from a first-person perspective and requires no physical exertion beyond clicking dialogue responses or selecting keywords during the minigame portion. Before starting
  <em>
   Doki Doki Literature Club!
  </em>
  , it is recommended to go in blind and refrain from searching spoilers beforehand for the most authentic and impactful playthrough.

 <p>
  On the surface, since it falls into the category of more action-packed horror games,
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  doesn't seem suitable for one-handed players. However, Supermassive Games made
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  more accessible for not only gamers with physical limitations, but also anyone who enjoys a less stressful experience and wants to focus on narrative.
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  follows eight young adults who revisit Blackwood Mountain for a winter getaway exactly one year after the supposed death of their two friends. As the night progresses and clues arise relating to the disappearance of Hannah and Beth Washington, they find themselves fighting for their lives against the spirit of a mythological, cannibalistic creature. Every choice has a consequence, as
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  employs the butterfly effect mechanic.

 <p>
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  offers the option to choose between traditional and motion controls.
  <strong>
   To make the QTEs more manageable, there are options in the Settings menu pertaining to how fast the QTE prompts time out
  </strong>
  . For one-handed gamers, it might be worthwhile switching the QTEs to an unlimited timeframe. This will allow players to take their time instead of frantically mashing buttons. Supermassive Games' other titles, such as
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  , also offer these QTE adjustments.

  <em>
   At Dead of Night
  </em>
  is another point-and-click horror experience, and an impressive one at that. Players control Maya, a student who finds herself hunted by Jimmy Hall, a psychotic man who kidnaps and murders residents of the Sea View Hotel. Jimmy has imprisoned Maya's friends in their hotel rooms, forcing Maya to undertake the dangerous task of freeing them alone. In order to convince Jimmy to release her captive friends, Maya must communicate with the ghosts of Jimmy's past to uncover his deepest, darkest secret. Although a strictly point-and-click approach might sound repetitive,
  <em>
   At Dead of Night
  </em>
  manages to keep the formula interesting and inventive.

   At Dead of Night
  </em>
  has a compelling story and an unsettling atmosphere for building tension.
  <strong>

  </strong>
  . Described as a "part horror film, part horror game and part ghost hunt,"
  <strong>
  </strong>
  <em>
   At Dead of Night
  </em>
  utilizes nostalgic live-action cutscenes that were popularized in the late '90s and early 2000s to expertly craft an immersive, terrifying cat-and-mouse game between Maya and Jimmy. All the while, it incorporates atmospheric elements reminiscent of influential horror games such as
  <em>
   Amnesia: The Dark Descent
  </em>
  .

  From Polish developer Paweł Koźmiński,
  <em>
   World of Horror
  </em>
  is a 1-bit role-playing game. It follows a traditional dungeon crawling format in a pixel art style with lore inspired by the works of horror legends H.P. Lovecraft and Junji Ito. The game revolves around solving five distinct mysteries, each one unfolding in self-contained playthroughs. After solving a mystery, the player is awarded a key. Obtaining all five keys unlocks a lighthouse, where the player confronts one of several Cthulhu Mythos deities.
  <em>
   World of Horror
  </em>
  uses a "DOOM" meter to determine how soon the entity will be summoned. If the "DOOM" meter reaches 100% before the Old God is defeated, everyone and everything will cease to exist.

 <p>
  <em>
   World of Horror
  </em>
  has a turn-based combat system where counterattacks are pre-selected in battle to use against enemies. There are 14 unique playable characters with 20 different paths to take. Many mysteries have multiple endings, giving the game a longer lifespan and huge replay value.
  <strong>
   As

    World of Horror
   </em>
   is a choice-based game, it requires nothing more than a computer mouse to enjoy

  Set in a reimagined version of Lewis Carroll's Wonderland,
  <em>
   Alice is Dead
  </em>
  is a point-and-click noir mystery where the amnesiac player character finds Alice deceased. They must identify Alice's murderer while working towards rediscovering their own identity in the process. Not long after arriving in Wonderland, the player character is revealed to be the White Rabbit, and someone in Wonderland has a bounty on his head.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alice is Dead
   </em>
   builds the story around interactive elements of the environment, such as inventory items, NPC interactions, and changes in scenery.

  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  is an amalgamation of multiple genres, all wrapped up in one enthralling deck-building game. In this turn-based, roguelike, puzzle-solving adventure, the player finds themselves trapped in a cabin, where an elusive gamemaster forces them to partake in a series of tabletop games.
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  unfolds as three separate acts documented in a found-footage horror style. An internet content creator named Luke finds himself in a
  <em>
   Jumanji
  </em>
  -esque scenario and forced to continue a game of
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  , found on an in-game floppy disk. In order to oppose Leshy, the gamemaster, players must gather a deck of animal-themed cards by means of drafting, self-mutilation, and surgery. With each game, the player gets closer to unlocking the secrets lurking inside Leshy's cabin.

  Lauded by Steam reviewers as one of the best indie games of the last decade,

   Inscryption
  </em>
  features no hard boss fights or complicated combo moves. Instead, it encourages players to rely on their instincts and intuition to outsmart Leshy. While
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  does play like a simplistic point-and-click game, it demangs know-how and strategic thinking.
  <strong>
   It would be easy to play
   <em>
    Inscryption
   </em>
   one-handed so long as the player has their wits about them
  </strong>
  . Leshy doesn't discriminate based on physicality, but he will punish players who aren't on top of their game.

  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  has various options for players as they seek to build new characters with varying roles and backstories. When players decide to take on a role such as that of a Death Knight, a class that was introduced with
  <em>
   The Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  expansion in 2008, one of the initial steps is deciding on a race.

 <p>
  According to the lore, the Death Knight was once a great warrior, fallen in battle and brought back to life by the Lich King. The terrifying idea is a cool place to start with a new character’s story. However, some races in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  aren’t allowed to become Death Knights, and others aren’t as good at providing the stats a Death Knight wants for better progression.

     Normally, the different races of Azeroth have their unique starting areas. However, all Death Knights begin their journey from
     <strong>
      Acherus: The Ebon Hold
     </strong>
     , a location in the Eastern Plaguelands. Only the Death Knight has a starting area based on class instead of race.

  The Mechagnome race is a strange blending of different ideas to form a race of highly evolved if diminutive creatures that can be hugely useful in battle. While a Death Knight will normally be a much larger, imposing creature, there are specific reasons that this half-mechanical gnome subset makes a great Death Knight, especially for a Tank build.

 <p>
  Combat Analysis allows them to learn about their enemy so quickly they can learn to defeat them far more easily as the battle continues. Other party members will love Mastercraft because it gives everyone access to a repair bot and Cooking recipes. Skeleton Pinky is a lockpick, so no Rogue is needed, and the other skills include abilities that self-heal and distract enemies away from allies.

  , the Forsaken makes the most sense as a Death Knight. In the days of Classic, the race also known as the Undead only had the two buffs of Cannabalize and Will of the Forsaken. Just on their own, these were considered some of the most OP racial traits in the game.

 <p>
  Cannabilize negates the need for carrying food and Will of the Forsaken breaks any kind of fear mechanic. Both of these are great for melee fighters of any class, and the Death Knight is a close-range class regardless of the build. Increased resistance to Shadow damage is always a bonus, and Touch of the Grave is an ability that returns hit points to the Death Knight when they make both physical attacks and cast spells.

 <p>
  The Goblins are another horde race that could easily contend for being one of the best Death Knight options in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  . The reasoning behind their capability is simply that the role of a Death Knight comes with the huge weakness of being unable to escape combat situations when the worst danger presents itself.

 <p>
  What any Death Knight needs is a quick way to survive in this situation. This is provided by the Goblin ability Rocket Jump, which can jump players forward far enough to escape negative effects and brutal numbers of enemies. Goblins also come with Time is Money, which helps with haste boost; and Rocket Barrage, which helps with extra damage.

 <p>
  The entire idea of a Death Knight is that they stay in any fight until they win or die. As such, Dwarven Death Knights are common in Azeroth. They can stay in a fight for a long time because they have the right traits to be heavily armored and good in melee combat, and are not likely to try running away anytime soon since they are short and slow.

 <p>
  The best Dwarf trait for becoming legendary Death Knights is their racial trait Stoneflesh, which allows them to clear debuffs every two minutes. Secondly comes their Might of the Mountain racial, which can help players with self-healing.

 <p>
  One of the biggest considerations about choosing a race in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  is its appearance. Players might want to make sure the racial and passive traits of their race match well with the class they're using, but the lore of their character and appearance can also be huge factors. Worgen looks the part in heavy armor, especially the plate armor of a Death Knight.

 <p>
  Additionally, they have some useful traits. One of their passive traits gives players an extra critical hit chance, which is useful in combat. One of their racial abilities, Darkflight, helps players escape. This is a particularly useful trait for Death Knights, who tend to move quite slowly and struggle to escape when overwhelmed.

  One of the potential roles for a Death Knight is to be a tank that has to absorb a lot of damage and stay in battle for a long time. Trolls are perfect for this because of a higher health regeneration rate than normal. With these traits, they are ideal for the role of a Death Knight.

 <p>
  Trolls also have a passive that reduces the lasting time of movement impairs, allowing them to escape when needed, another significant aspect for a Death Knight. Trolls are also naturally big creatures that look the part wearing the heavy armor of a Death Knight, helping to create lore for a character.

 <p>
  In the days when
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  was an RTS game, the Nigh Elves were a reclusive society with a distrust of most other races, but especially the Orcs, who invaded their native Azeroth and started chopping down their beloved trees. The Night Elves have evolved since then as one of the Alliance's core races and was also where the Demon Hunter class originated. They also make ideal Death Knights.

 <p>
  Quickness gives the Night Elf a better chance to dodge attacks and improves their movement speed, Wisp Spirit gets the player to their corpse and back to leveling faster, and any kind of damage resistance is also handy. The best addition for a Death Night might be Touch of Elune, which increases critical strike during the say and haste rating at night.

  The main face of the Horde forces is the Orcs, and for good reason. New Orc characters get to explore some of the most brilliant and fun lands and characters at the beginning of their journey. What's more, any Death Knight needs one thing above all others, and that is the extra strength to do damage to their opponents and win battles.

 <p>
  Melee damage and strength are hugely important to Unholy Death Knights. Orcs generally have great strength and physicality in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  , making them ideal choices for such a position. Their “Blood Fury” gives them one of the best attack buffs available in the whole game, which is also very useful to this class.

  The racial trait, The Human Spirit, boosts all secondary stats from all sources, making them a good option for practically every class in the game, and could be one of the most overpowered racial traits in the game. Their lore, starting area, and general popularity all help as well, and the NPCs are generally well-rounded and interesting.

 <p>
  Playing as a human is a good choice for beginners to
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  because they make it easy to get to grips with the game and world. Human Death Knights work well as they have similar strength to the Orcs, though without quite the same level of bulk and pure strength. The Will To Survive trait removes stun effects similar to the Forsaken ability, Will of the Forsaken.

  Blood Elves, allied to the Horde, are the best for playing as a Death Knight with a Blood build, thanks to their arcane powers. While Death Knights are traditionally one of the most tank-like classes in the game, there are some gaping weaknesses in the Death Knight style that have to be addressed if players wish to survive.

 <p>
  Arcane Torrent is the best emergency save for a Death Knight in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  . It allows Death Knights to dispel enemy effects while gaining back the Runic power that most of the Death Knight abilities will require. All of this, in addition to the great appearance and lore of Blood Elves, make them one of the most surprisingly great options for Death Knight status.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Smite 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  has made a lot of improvements to the original game, featuring a much more streamlined approach to playing. Gone are the wide range of champion archetypes; they have been replaced with a focus on Strength, Intelligence, or a hybrid of the two. While this can help
  <strong>

  The Jungle role can sound like an easy task, as it involves a lot of PvE engagement to grow stronger rather than going up against other players. However, this is still one of the hardest roles to master. Playing the jungle role on a competitive level means having a deep understanding of moving around the game’s map and ambushing enemy gods to help one's team gain the upper hand. The opposing Jungle role does the same and also demands adaptability.

 <p>
  Gamers who like the idea of playing the Jungle role should do so once they have a firm grasp of all the game's mechanics and are ready to help their teammates in lanes that need them, while players in lanes will have much less to worry about and can focus on a more self-contained gameplan. A great choice for players who want to play the Jungle role is Mordred, as he can be built to play the role but also for more beginner friendly roles.

 <p>
  The Middle role goes to the player planning on playing the Mid Lane. Both the Solo Lane and Mid Lane will have a player going in alone but with different ways of playing the game. The Solo role will offer more survivability due to it being more tanky, and it can provide some great options for countering. Those who take on the middle Lane are going to play very aggressively with massive damage numbers and escape when things get overwhelming. Not being as tanky means that there is less room for error, and it is easier to die. Hades is a great option for this lane.

 <p>
  Before trying this role in Conquest, players should try out their God in Arena. Arena is sort of like a Deathmatch game mode where gamers and their teammates will face off against an enemy team of Gods. This lets them get a proper feel for actual combat in terms of engaging and pulling away from scraps. This is a transferable skill for playing in the Conquest game mode, where calling roles will be far more important. The Mid Lane is also a much more likely target to get ganked by the Jungle role.

 <p>
  Both the Carry and the Support will be in the Duo Lane. Of these two, Support is by far the harder of the two, as a poor support means both characters going down. Carries will rely on working alongside the Support role in the earlier parts of the game, and they will become far more capable on their own as they near the endgame. Carry Gods can be devastating come the endgame, but they need to be developed.

 <p>
  They will have a higher rate of survival than the Middle role, and being familiar with Support makes for a great learning experience. Players who play Carry will also passively pick up on how their partner is playing Support and what to expect from them. This makes it one of the best roles for beginners looking to play Support God like Ares and know what their teammate will need from them during matches.

  When
  <em>

  players first get into the game, they will have a lot to learn, and the Solo role will let them play the game even while they are still green. The Solo lane is all about balancing offense and defense and playing against the opponent Solo role God. This means that the vast majority of the experience is self-contained, though players still learn about many of the other elements as their teammates play them.

  People who thought that handheld gaming shouldn't be taken seriously sang a different tune after Nintendo's continued efforts to do justice to this form of gaming. The 3DS was the sole reason why this company was still afloat after the colossal failure of the Wii U, and the Switch has shown how powerful a hybrid console can be that combines the best of both worlds. As a result, fans will have a great time playing handheld games that make the most of this medium. Players can enjoy everything from bite-sized experiences to fun gameplay-driven titles.

 <p>
  Many genres have made the most of the portable gaming experience, and strategy titles are no exception. The best games in this genre let players enjoy easy-to-understand gameplay loops that feature a ton of depth. These titles force players to use their minds on the go to find the most optimal solution to the problems that stand in their way.

  Many people wondered how a mobile
  <em>

  game would work, especially one where Agent 47's stealthy exploits were reduced to what seemed like a fancy board game. Thankfully, not only did
  <em>
   Hitman Go
  </em>
  let players enjoy one of the simplest and most imaginative video games of all time, but it also kickstarted a trend of games that used other IPs and gave them a strategy twist.

  Players must observe a stage and figure out the best moves they can take in any given situation. As one would expect, the first few levels in this game are as easy as they come. Things get interesting when the game starts ramping up its difficulty and introduces new enemy types and hazards that players must overcome. It's an excellent game that made the most of the handheld's limitations, letting players enjoy small, satisfying levels that they could tackle at their own pace.

   Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
  </em>
  is noticeably lighter than its predecessor (with the art style reflecting this change). But still, fans of tight, engaging turn-based strategy games will find
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
  </em>
  to be one of the best handheld strategy games they can get their hands on.

  The story of Joan of Arc is familiar to any history buff. This peasant came from nowhere to lead an army, before being persecuted for being a witch. Her legacy as the defender of the French nation is impressive. Players who want to check out the story of this amazing knight with a fantasy twist will love what the PSP strategy game
  <em>
   Jeanne d'Arc
  </em>
  brings to the table.

  With the English forming a pact with demons to take over France, a young village girl and her friends decide to embark on a quest to save her nation after a divine voice gifts her an armlet that lets her wield the power of the heavens. The game's cel-shading and riveting plotline make it one of the best strategy games on the PlayStation Portable. It's a shame that more people haven't checked out one of the best portable video games of all time.

  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  is one of the greatest strategy video game series of all time, and is a mainstay on Nintendo consoles. Most people would think that this series was popular in the West from its very first entry. However, it took a long time before
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  made a splash outside of Japan. The Game Boy Advance served as the console that helped this series reach immense levels of popularity.

 <p>
  Known only as
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  in the West,
  <em>
   Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade
  </em>
  is a challenging and rewarding strategy RPG with amazing visuals and an epic story. The gameplay is far from easy, with the looming threat of permadeath making it harrowing for players to go through a level. A single costly mistake can lead to the death of a party member they've grown attached to. The epic storyline and Lyn's memorable role as the protagonist make it clear why this game was a major success. This game paved the way for
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  to become one of Nintendo's most valuable IPs.

  There are multiple chapters of Chaos Space Marines that players can choose to play as in the Eternal War game mode of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Space Marine 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . While you can't play as the Thousand Sons seen in some missions of the main campaign, players do have some freedom when playing as Chaos Space Marines.

  While there is a ton of creativity when building your loyalist Space Marine, the customization with Chaos Space Marines is more limited. Despite these limitations, players can still find fun in changing some aspects of their Chaos Space Marines when trying to beat out the forces of the Emperor in PVP.

  To play as a Chaos Space Marine, you
  <strong>
   just have to get lucky when a new game of Eternal War starts
  </strong>
  . Of those in the game, they will be randomly selected between Loyalists and Heretics after the map loads. While a list of players on each team appears before the game starts, and is only displaying teams and does not indicate who are Loyalists and Heretics.

  Every game is a new draw, meaning staying in the same lobby won't increase your odds, though

  Customizing your Chaos Space Marine is much more limited than what you can do with Loyalists.
  <strong>
   Each Chaos Chapter is tied to a specific class
  </strong>
  , and wearing the armor of that Chapter will require you to play as a specific class in the game.

  While the actual Chapter armor and look are stuck to each class, you
  <strong>
   can change the colors of any Chaos Chapter to be another Chapter's colors
  </strong>
  in the same way you would your Loyalist Space Marine. To change the colors and customize your Chaos Space Marine, select the class of the Chapter you want to customize and select the, "Edit Armor" option. Along the right side of the screen will be the Heretic Astartes button which will switch to the Chaos Space Marine of that class and let you change their colors to whichever you'd like.

  A clever
  <em>
   <strong>
    Destiny 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  player and Marvel fan recreated the fan-favorite
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  leader Star-Lord using a unique combination of in-game armor and shaders to deck out their Guardian. The player's creation proved popular online, garnering thousands of views and impressing the massive community of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  fans who engage with the game's cosmetic systems to make unique creations.

 <p>
  Cosmetics have been a major part of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  even since the first game, as the sheer amount of gear, armor, and weapons available provides ample opportunities for unique combinations of items. In fact, the game even has exclusive cosmetic items available in the in-game item store the Eververse, where players can spend the premium currency Glimmer on various outfits, emotes, and color shaders.

  Reddit user Chobwokk shared images of their
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Guardian to a subreddit dedicated to players' in-game outfits, showing off their cosplay of Star-Lord from Marvel's
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  franchise. The cosplay consists of a red leather jacket adorned with various buttons and a wide collar, black pants with a red, shining pattern on them, and a gun holster attached at their hip.

  Fans were clearly impressed by the outfit, as they showed up to the comments in droves to praise the user's look and how accurate it was to Star-Lord's actual design. According to the original post, the Guardian's costume was intended to emulate the way Star-Lord appears in the
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  video game from Eidos Montreal and Square Enix.

 <p>
  Of course, given the distinct visual style of
  <em>
   Destiny 2,
  </em>
  the outfit is not a one-to-one recreation, but the attention to detail from the player was impressive to fans nonetheless, as it even has a few subtler references, as well. For instance, the Guardian, whom the original player confirmed is using the Titan class, has what appear to be rockets jutting out from his legs in a way similar to Star-Lord's from both the game and the Marvel Studios films.

  Cosplaying pop culture icons using Guardians in

  is a beloved trend within the fandom, as players frequently show off their costumes through social media. Marvel heroes are common fodder for players looking to create a standout Guardian, too, with surprisingly accurate results, like a

  fan running around dressed as Spider-Man, and another playing the game as one of his biggest enemies, Mysterio.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  has captured gamers' attention since its reveal four years ago. All the released footage looked impressive, which led some players to doubt whether the actual game could live up to the hype. Despite being the debut title from Chinese developer Game Science,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  delivered exactly as promised. Players are impressed with standout features such as top-notch graphics powered by Unreal Engine 5, fast-paced and varied combat, and well-crafted boss fights with little to no repetition.

 <p>
  However, it's clear that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  isn't without its flaws, as certain aspects could have been executed better. Many players have already voiced their biggest concerns with this new action-RPG. With just a few minor tweaks and additions, the overall experience could be significantly improved. From the absence of a mini-map to the abundance of invisible walls that disrupt immersion, here are some issues that need to be addressed.

 <p>
  Unlike many action-RPGs or soulslikes,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  features no map at all, leaving players to explore its vast areas entirely on their own. While it's clear that the developers aimed to encourage a sense of exploration without players relying on an artificial mini-map, this approach is a double-edged sword due to the game's level design. Early areas might feel relatively easy to navigate due to their streamlined nature, but by Chapter 2 — and especially in Chapter 3 — levels become far more expansive and layered, with numerous interconnected pathways and verticality. What makes this even more challenging is that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's environments tend to blend together, lacking distinct landmarks to aid in navigation.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":999} -->

 <p>
  As a result, requests for the addition of a mini-map have become prevalent within the community. With numerous hidden secrets, optional bosses, treasure chests, and collectibles scattered across vast areas, the lack of any tracking system can frustrate players, especially when they're searching for a missing meditation point. While fans have already created their own external interactive map for the game, it would be ideal if the developers addressed this oversight in future updates.

 <p>
  Another issue that hampers exploration in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is the abundance of invisible walls, which break immersion and make navigating the game world even more difficult without a map. Frequently, players find themselves unable to progress despite the environment appearing passable. Conversely, some players might dismiss certain pathways, assuming they lead nowhere, only to miss out on hidden treasure chests or secret areas. This inconsistency makes exploration in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  occasionally feel lackluster, leading players to wonder how much better the experience could have been.

  While it's unrealistic to expect the removal of all invisible walls or significant changes to the environment's design in a game as large as
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , a mini-map that highlights actual routes and dead ends could provide a simple solution. This would ease exploration, especially for completionists.

  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  isn't a true soulslike game, but rather an action-RPG that borrows several familiar elements. However, sometimes this borrowing doesn't fully work. FromSoftware's games are known for their cryptic NPC quests that are almost impossible to decipher without a guide. Many games that follow the soulslike formula have adopted a similar approach,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  included. Although there aren't too many side quests in the game, the ones that exist are definitely worth completing, as they offer valuable rewards, including new spells.

 <p>
  A simple quest tracker or log to keep track of active side quests would be a helpful addition to
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  . It would make it easier to follow up on any NPCs worth revisiting and ensure that players don't miss out on crucial rewards. There's really no reason for the game not to have one.

  The trading system in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  also could use some improvements that wouldn't be difficult to implement. There are several NPC merchants in the game who sell useful resources, upgrades, and key items, with their inventories expanding as the game progresses. Additionally, the in-game store at Shrines (similar to bonfires) offers specific goods tied to the chapter area or secret locations, which makes shopping unnecessarily complicated. Moreover, players are only able to sell gold pieces or treasure statues to merchants, and nothing else.

  Given the abundance of consumables and gathered resources, every

  player will have items they'd like to sell in exchange for Will (the in-game currency) to upgrade their gear or Cultivate Spirits. However, this option is currently absent.

  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  features excellent character progression, offering several distinct skill trees for staff stances, various spells and transformations, celestial medicine passive buffs, and more. What's even better is that each of these systems is highly flexible, allowing for unlimited respecs with little to no penalty whenever players want to try something new. However, for some reason, this flexibility doesn't extend to the Spirit Cultivation system. Once players upgrade certain Spirits (and there are many), they cannot reclaim the resources spent to invest in newer options.

  While players can always farm more Will and Blood of the Iron Bull from enemies, the ability to freely respec Cultivated Spirits — even if it only returns part of the investment — would be a valuable addition. It would encourage more experimentation with different Spirits and make this aspect of the game more dynamic and engaging.

   Black Loong
  </strong>
  is one of the secret bosses in the second chapter of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </strong>
  </em>
  . To unlock this boss, players must defeat a few bosses and acquire a specific item, which can open the blockade outside the boss's arena. Players who can best this powerful Yaoguai King will get their hands on numerous crafting materials, as well as a Spell cooldown reduction Curio.

  To find Black Loong, you must first progress in the second chapter until you reach the
  <strong>
   King of Flowing Sand
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Second Rat Son
  </strong>
  in the
  <strong>
   Sandgate Village
  </strong>
  . After defeating the Second Son, head to the
  <strong>
   Valley of the Despair
  </strong>
  Keeper's Shrine and enter the cave to reach the
  <strong>
   First Prince of Flowing Sands
  </strong>
  . There is a wall in this boss arena that you must break, which can be done quickly by luring the boss towards it.

  As the fight commences, the boss will leap up in the air and slam down his twin hammers on the ground, causing a small shock AOE. You can dodge towards the boss as he is about to slam down his weapons. After the slam, depending on how far you are from the boss, the boss can perform an attack where he smashes his weapons together, causing an AOE shock explosion. The boss does this three times, the player must dodge at the right time. The third smash is delayed, so be ready to delay your dodge.

  Black Loong uses his hammers and starts to strike one after the other in his basic strike combos. This attack can go on for a four or five-hit combo. If you can position yourself at the back of the boss, you can constantly deal damage while staying behind him and avoiding taking damage.

  After losing 33% of his health, the boss will breathe electricity into his mouth, which is a sign that he is about to launch his drumming attack. In this attack, the boss constantly
  <strong>
   smashes his weapon on the ground, creating a shockwave
  </strong>
  that must be jumped over to avoid. He does this several times before ending with a much more powerful shockwave. The boss performs this attack again after losing another 33% of his health.

  For people who enjoy a full-on, hardcore gaming experience and treat it as a second job rather than just casual fun, there's something truly satisfying about seeing all that hard work pay off within the game.

  Typically, the journey begins with a protagonist who's almost completely useless and desperately in need of some sort of development to advance to higher levels — both in terms of skills and character. The more hours players sink into the game, honing their character, and gaining experience, the more satisfying the whole ordeal feels. And that is why a well-developed, all-rounded progression system is essential for a game to feel complete. While there are a lot of good open-world titles out there that have pretty neat progression mechanics, some games (particularly RPGs) stand out more in this department.

    Updated on August 24, 2024, by Fatima Naeem:
   </strong>
   The definition of a good progression system can vary widely, depending on individual preferences and game design. Some might prefer the classic RPG progression system — where strength and stats incrementally increase until the player character reaches a near-godlike state. Others might prefer a non-linear, material-based approach, where the emphasis shifts to upgrading gadgets and gear rather than just improving numerical stats. Ultimately, most games strive to create a sense of growth and advancement for the player through their highly meticulous progression systems — which becomes crucial when it comes to massive open worlds and their near-infinite growth potential.

  <em>
   <strong>
    No Man's Sky
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a survival-adventure game set in an undisclosed universe characterized by a futuristic planetary backdrop. The game is basically like
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  but in space, and plays out like a pretty normal survival game apart from its massive procedurally generated world that encompasses a staggering number of planets, all interactable and explorable.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  plays out like a typical survival game, where the player starts as a weakling with nothing on hand and eventually builds themselves up to be (for the lack of better words) rich and well-established, its futuristic setting and surprisingly hardcore combat system does give it a sort of edge. The game is mostly centered around exploration and doesn't necessarily hold the player's hand through a linear progression because of its sandbox elements. The more one explores, the more they'll be accustomed to the borderline daunting setting. The in-game currency, known as Units, is the primary source of upgrades for essentially anything, including new ships, multitools, exosuit customizations, and additional slots for more epic upgrades.

  Alex Mercer's strength is highly multi-faceted and could even prove to be a bit too much for newer players. He starts as an average weak guy but can be turned into an absolute abomination with his non-stop growth. The progress of the game is entirely based on experience points referred to as EP (Evolution Points), which are almost always generously rewarded for completing missions, side quests, and one-on-one encounters.

  That said, these EPs are drained just as quickly as earned since every upgrade requires them in large amounts. The skills that can be upgraded range from movement and survivability to subclasses such as sprint and jump. Certain events trigger the unlocking of additional events and award medals, which can then be utilized to enhance Alex's strength further.

  may not be everyone's favorite, nor is it considered one of the best open-world action-adventure games out there, but it definitely deserves credit for having one of the cleanest and most accessible progression systems of the late 2000s. The game is old, for sure, and may not keep up with today's gaming standards — but for a game made in 2007, it has amazing gameplay and some pretty fancy graphics to back it up.

  The game's progression is fairly simple — non-linear growth with a very consistent upward trajectory. The player character's progression is skill-based and is driven through these things called Experience Orbs, which can be collected by completing different missions, taking down various bosses and generals, or doing miscellaneous tasks scattered across the map. Upgrading skills and abilities is the primary goal in the game, but generally, powering up will naturally increase vehicle and weapon stats too. Each upgrade gives players a tangible sense of their agent's growing strength, making
  <em>
   Crackdown's
  </em>
  progression feel fairly natural and organic.

    Far Cry 5

  is the fifth installment of the renowned
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  series and is categorized as an action RPG for its extensive and immersive gameplay. Just like its previous releases,
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  is once again set in an open world, this time with Montana serving as its central region. And like every other
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  game ever made, it has no shortage of places to explore, quests to complete, and bad guys to defeat.

 <p>
  In terms of story,
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  has a very straightforward way of indicating its progress. Players simply need to accumulate lots of Resistance Points (the experience points in this particular game) and use them to go further down the boss hierarchy to fight stronger and meaner bosses — or in this case, cult leaders. To develop new skills and abilities for their character, players need to earn perk points by doing certain tasks and completing challenges. One can use these perk points to obtain skills ranging from increased health and inventory space to improved weapon handling and the ability to tame wild animals.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise. This particular entry sets itself apart from the other
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games in terms of being centralized more around combat and story rather than stealth, which ultimately makes it a game with a decent progression system. However, most
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games have awesome progression systems, and
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  is no exception — it's just the one that made the list.

  Most skills and items in
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  are upgradable. The main character has a skill tree that is divided into three types of abilities: Assassin, Hunter, and Warrior. Players can use XP points to upgrade any of the sub-skills in these branches, and opt for a certain playstyle suited to their taste. Additionally, there's a plethora of weapons available throughout the game, ranging from swords and tridents to armor and bows, each capable of being boosted in its own right.

 <p>
  Finally, the most major aspect of
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  is its significantly improved naval element. Players can take control of the ship, Adrestia, and utilize and enhance it for combat, exploration, and even just for wreaking mindless havoc.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Metal Gear Solid 5: Phantom Pain
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the one game on the entire list that breaks away from the typical number-driven progression systems found in most games and opts for a more realistic approach to warfare and growth. Sure, these are just a lot of fancy words to say that
  <em>
   MGS5
  </em>
  has a good progression system, but it all stands true nevertheless. What makes this game stand out is that not only is the player character gradually getting stronger, but the enemy AI is also consistently adapting to the player's growing strength and adjusting itself accordingly.

 <p>
  Mother Base, the central hub in
  <em>
   MGS5
  </em>
  , is where the real action takes place. Players can use the in-game currency to upgrade the base, enhance weapons, and vehicles, and even improve the soldiers under command. They can even buy some very high-tech gadgets for some serious firepower and go completely ham with them. Players don't get to progress in the game by 'getting stronger through stats,' they get to do it by upgrading everything around them.

  The game doesn't depend on the player grinding for XP points. Instead, it's more centered around the player learning new techniques and honing skills. Sure, the general gist is sort of the same old thing — completing side quests and challenges to learn said new techniques — but none of it feels forced. Players do not get stronger for the sake of progressing in the story, but rather for the sake of actually getting stronger.

  The skill tree featured in the game has four main skills: combat, alchemy, signs, and general — all four are upgradable using ability points. Ability points are essentially the currency for leveling up, and naturally, they're earned by playing the game. Weapons and armor can also be upgraded and enhanced using runes, glyphs, and smithing.

  It would be sacrilege not to include
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  on a topic celebrating the best progression systems in gaming. To put it simply, the game is utterly daunting. It's a 2022 action RPG developed by FromSoftware and does a great job of establishing itself as one of the most difficult games ever made — as one might expect from a FromSoftware game.

  The game has multiple — and that's putting it loosely — progression routes and players get to choose whichever one they want and still have a unique path. Each path offers its own leveling-up assignments and mechanisms, rewarding players with runes upon completing challenges and quests. These runes can be used to enhance abilities and upgrade items/weapons. There's also a plethora of other progression mechanics, such as Ashes of War and crafting.

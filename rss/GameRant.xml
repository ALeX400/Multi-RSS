      <title>Best Free Open-World Games To Play Right Now</title>

  Free-to-play games come in many shapes and sizes. Battle royales and hero shooters are probably the most oversaturated in this day and age, but genres like MOBAs and MMOs are not going away anytime soon. The latter tend to have a few big names that dominate the scene, but they occasionally welcome new properties that manage to survive beyond a year or two.

  <strong>
   Free open-world games
  </strong>
  are not extremely common, with most examples falling squarely in the MMORPG sphere. Simply put, these sorts of projects are huge investments for developers and publishers, so they rarely go the free-to-start route unless they are specifically focusing on multiplayer. Still, not every MMO is open-world, and the ones that do qualify cover a wide range of quality. What are the
  <strong>
   best free-to-play open-world games

  Even if they might not always hit the mark, the launch of a new MMO is always exciting since they promise potentially years' worth of content.
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  has been available in some corners of the world for a while, but its (free) Western debut landed on October 1, 2024; currently, NCSoft's project is in a decent and exciting state, showing more than enough promise to suggest it will be around for a long time.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  is very much designed to be a classic-style MMORPG, which means a heavy focus on multiplayer combat and guilds. Consequently, this game requires players to get social and is somewhat hard to recommend to those who mostly want to be lone wolves.

  More importantly for the topic of
  <strong>
   free open-world games
  </strong>
  , the map is segmented into zones like traditional MMOs. While open enough,
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  is not a sandbox and players will mostly be working their way through each area rather than just exploring the entire map freely. While not for everyone, the game has plenty of positives, including impressive visuals, fun traversal, a mix-and-match class system, and decent combat. Customization is decent too.

  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is an ambitious hodgepodge of mechanics that is set in a large sandbox. While far from flawless, Starry Studio's project can be a lot of fun, regardless if it is played solo or with a few friends. Due to an alien substance known as Stardust, Earth has fallen in dark, apocalyptic times, leaving behind a corrupted hellscape overrun with twisted mutants that once were humans (or something else entirely).

 <p>
  Along with following a story that explores the group responsible for this situation,
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is primarily an open-world survival game with third-person shooter gameplay and a fun creature-collection system. Players must collect resources, craft shelter and tools, fight monsters, and even collect them so they can help out.

 <p>
  Although not too unique, the open-world benefits from pretty good visuals and creative monster designs that reward exploration. The crafting and building aspects are arguably
  <em>

  's strongest feature, and they are both relatively deep. The gunplay is decent too, even if enemies do not put up much of a fight.

  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  have somewhat similar takes on open-worlds. For the most part, the games focus on missions set in fairly self-contained areas; however, players can visit open locations that are designed to be explored freely, and they contain stuff like missions. Basically, they are expansive hub areas, and they are not immediately available. New players will have to work their way through a somewhat lengthy tutorial/opening section before gaining access to these landscapes. Still, they are worth the effort and add a great deal of content to the overall experience.

  Unlike
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  's limited free-to-play options,
  <em>
   Warframe

  is quite accessible and does not punish players for not investing cash. The campaign can still be a grind, but the combat and lore are both good enough to keep things interesting. If someone is looking to immediately play an open-world project,
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  is not the best pick; however, those who are fine with an open-world being one piece of an overall great puzzle should check out this freebie.

  Somehow,
  <em>
   RuneScape
  </em>
  is still thriving more than two decades following its debut. The MMORPG was one of the first of its kind on the market, and while hundreds of other games have shown up to take its place, precious few have had the longevity and appeal of

  The RPG's calling card is its progression system that allows players to gain experience points through the execution of skills. It makes most actions feel purposeful, even if the combat itself is quite simplistic. The open-world offers a surprising amount of variety, although the free version does come with its share of restrictions that reduce the overall enjoyment of the experience.

  was a massive success right out of the gate, and miHoYo has done a good job of maintaining the game's momentum. Set in the beautiful world of Teyvat, the action RPG allows players to build teams of four characters that they can swap in battle, and the campaign's harder challenges require a balanced party filled with fighters who complement each other.

  Combat is generally the main focus, but the game encourages exploration as well.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  launched with a reasonably large open-world, and subsequent updates introduced new regions to expand the map. Although the end-game can be frustrating for non-paying users, the main story is quite accessible by free-to-play standards, provided someone tolerates
  <em>

  's gacha system.

  Launching in 2014 and still going strong,
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  has enjoyed a long and healthy life. Largely revolving around survival, the game has a few notable things that have helped heighten its popularity. For one, most modern PCs should be able to run
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  since it really does not require powerful specs. Obviously, its "free" price tag does not hurt, especially since the game can generally be enjoyed without requiring monetary investment. The community is also active and fairly welcoming, and this extends to the modding scene.

  Although not much of a looker compared to plenty of modern open-world games,
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  's voxel art style actually sets it apart from most of the genre's survival offerings since they tend to lean into realistic visuals. Sure,
  <em>

  <em>

  is closer in gameplay and tone to something like

  Thegamecompany has earned its immaculate reputation.
  <em>
   Journey
  </em>
  is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest games of all time, and the developer followed up that masterpiece by crafting an expansive MMORPG built around creating connections. Rather than focusing on combat,
  <em>
   Sky: Children of the Light
  </em>
  is all about exploration and socializing, two elements that should be treated as inseparable. Now, technically, the game can be enjoyed solo, and players can spend weeks flying through this kingdom's various regions in search of winged lights. However, the process is way more fun with a couple of companions.

  Although initially premium products,
  <em>

  and its sequel are both free on the Xbox Store, and the games are backward compatible with the Xbox One and Series X/S. While the second entry has its positives, the original
  <em>

  utilizes a skill-based progression system that rewards experience orbs depending on the player's actions; basically, the more somebody uses a skill, the more proficient they become at it. This creates a satisfying and rewarding gameplay loop that ensures players never feel static. As the project debuted in 2007, Pacific City is a fairly quaint open-world by modern standards, although it works well as a sandbox to facilitate absolute mayhem.

  can be grueling, but the game can also be really addictive. Rather than focusing on an overarching story, the MMORPG is primarily driven by its resource-gathering, crafting, and Fame systems. The latter determines the equipment players can equip, and acquiring weapons and armor serves as the main gameplay loop. Essentially, players grind until they can craft their desired equipment and then head out into the world's zones to take part in PvP. If an adventurer is killed by another player, they lose their equipped loot (if they are in a Full Loot area), which means they will have to start crafting once again.

 <p>
  <em>
   Albion Online
  </em>
  does offer different ways for players to approach its content. For instance, if someone wants to solely focus on PvP combat, they can skip the whole crafting element by simply buying weapons and armor from other players. While fairly vast, the open-world is sectioned into zones to accommodate various playstyles or routines. Certain areas only have PvE, while others incorporate PvP action but lessen the death penalty.

  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  takes a few obvious hints from HoYoverse's playbook, to the point of mostly incorporating the same mechanics, just slightly tweaked. While not garnering too many points for originality, Kuro Games turned to these systems for a reason: they are popular.
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  brings to life a post-apocalyptic setting where humanity has been pushed to the brink due to a phenomenon that has caused monsters to appear, and Resonators are the only people capable of taking on these threats. After picking a gender, players are cast as Rover, an amnesiac with a few unique Resonator abilities. Mostly a blank slate, the protagonist does not have much going for them beyond good designs for both genders; consequently, the campaign quickly pairs them up with a couple of characters who have bigger personalities.

 <p>
  At the moment,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  is very much a mixed bag with plenty of positives and negatives. On the one hand, the real-time combat is fast-paced, satisfying, and relatively challenging. Unsurprisingly for a gacha game that wants to encourage rolling for new Resonators, players have access to a party of characters at any time, allowing them to switch between fights in the middle of battle (and swapping is promoted). Echoes are another neat mechanic that grants players an opportunity to pick up a defeated enemy's echo, which can then be equipped. Moving away from combat,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  becomes a bit more messy. While not terrible so far, the story is so front-loaded with exposition that conversations become tiresome rather quickly. The open-world looks decent, especially Huanglong, but is not extremely fun to explore at the moment, although that could change in the future.

     , but it is not quite there yet. That said, the main campaign should not take that long to complete at this stage, with most playthroughs likely lasting just over 20 hours. As such, this is not a bad time to give

  Launching out of nowhere alongside
  <em>
   Fortnite Rocket Racing
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Lego Fortnite
  </em>
  sounds like a match made in heaven, and the crossover is well on its way to proving that. While not officially labeled as "early access," Epic's spin-off feels like a work in progress. Consequently,
  <em>
   Lego Fortnite
  </em>
  is currently a bit light on content and might struggle to keep someone's attention as indefinitely as a few other survival games like
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  . However, the game's current state contains more than enough positives to justify a recommendation, especially if players plan to engage in co-op. Outside a few (very popular) releases, the survival genre tends to cater to older players rather than younger ones, so a project that prioritizes the latter is always welcome since the world needs alternatives to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Dropping players into randomly generated worlds,
  <em>
   Lego Fortnite
  </em>
  challenges players to craft a base by gathering materials. The game does not try to reinvent the wheel, opting instead to streamline some of the genre's core concepts while still encouraging creativity and experimentation. When venturing into the unknown, players can expect to engage in a touch of combat, which is generally quite simplistic. Nevertheless, these encounters offer a pleasant change of pace from the material-gathering and base-building loop, and they can be somewhat difficult too.

  This absolutely

  lets players fully immerse themselves in the universe of the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  franchise. What's interesting about
  <em>

  This tailors a unique narrative experience depending on how players play the game. There are also various PvE and PvP activities sprawled across more than 20 different planets across the galaxy far far away, making for an impressive amount of content for even free-to-play players.

  Yet another movie franchise-based RPG game,
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings Online
  </em>
  lets
  <em>
  </em>
  players explore the shared open-world of Middle Earth. There are six different races to choose from in the game; dwarf, elf, high-elf, hobbit, man, and beorning. There is also a wide array of classes and specializations to select from in
  <em>
   LOTRO
  </em>
  .

  The game is an amazing recreation of Tolkien's books and is available for everyone to immerse themselves in. Whether someone is a fan of the movies or an MMORPG-head in general, this is a title worth getting into; however,
  <em>
   LOTRO
  </em>
  shows its age in quite a few places, particularly its uninspiring combat. That said, any die-hard fan of the source material should take it upon themselves to try out the game. The developers do a great job of adapting the world and storylines, to the point of being the most thorough version on the market. The free content should keep somebody busy for a very long time.

  Nowadays, the market is oversaturated with RPG Maker games, to the point that many of these releases can blend together. However, despite inspiring many fan projects and spiritual successors, there is only one
  <em>
   Yume Nikki
  </em>
  . Madotsuki does not need to physically leave her room to visit strange worlds – she only needs to fall asleep. Once the girl starts dreaming, players can jump into more than 10 worlds (and many strange locations within them), each of which comes with its own surreal aesthetic.

 <p>
  <em>
   Yume Nikki
  </em>
  foregoes a story in favor of atmosphere and free-roaming. Madotsuki is essentially lucid dreaming, and the indie game does an incredible job of replicating that feeling. Outside of collecting costumes, the title leaves players to their own devices, encouraging them to lose themselves within the bizarre and uncomfortable environments. While not for everyone,
  <em>
   Yume Nikki
  </em>
  is such a unique experience that most people should give it a go.

  <em>
   Babbdi
  </em>
  is a different type of open-world game, especially for the free-to-play market. Since most of these projects lean into MMO territory, they are designed to keep players coming back for weeks, months, and years. Even if they might not cost any initial money, they are huge time investments that not everyone can afford. Consequently,
  <em>
   Babbdi
  </em>
  offers a refreshing change of pace since it will likely not keep anyone busy for more than maybe an hour or two. Created by a very small team, the game drops players in the eponymous city and challenges them to escape. That is largely it. While not completely devoid of lore or environmental storytelling,
  <em>
   Babbdi
  </em>
  's selling point is primarily exploration, along with the implementation of some neat items like a trumpet.

 <p>
  Open-world games are defined by scale and ambition, and that extends to this release. Sure, the city is relatively small and barren, but it is atmospheric and has impressive verticality. The world is fascinating and oddly relaxing, all the while still coming across like something ripped from a fever dream. There are not all that many indie open-world free games, so
  <em>
   Babbdi
  </em>
  fills a niche while not overstaying its welcome.

  <em>

  has lived in
  <em>

  's shadow since its launch, despite the games not overlapping all that much in most categories. However, they are both free-to-play open-world action RPGs with anime visuals and gacha systems, so comparisons were always going to happen. While rough-around-the-edges,
  <em>
   Tower of Fantasy
  </em>
  has its positives that justify a recommendation, and one of them happens to be perfect for this discussion. In terms of open-world exploration, this project is surprisingly good, delivering both fun traversal mechanics and a varied range of locations.

  The game has quite a few major regions and cities, like Aesperia and Vera, and they are not only expansive but also gorgeous while having distinct styles.
  <em>

  also generally nails its mobility, presenting players with quite a few exploration options so they can decide how to tackle the map. In other areas,

  can be hit-and-miss, although the combat and character selection are both respectable for the most part.

  Featuring an origin story that is
  <em>
   almost
  </em>
  more interesting than the release itself,
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  is an addictive roguelike survival game that does the basics extremely well. Players spawn into a sandbox and simply have to survive, which involves crafting, eating, fighting monsters, working with allies, or engaging in PvP. All these elements are fairly conventional for both the sandbox and survival genres, but
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  combines them in a way that is both accessible and fairly challenging.

 <p>
  While the core experience does not change much,
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  has a few different game modes that slightly alter its rhythm. For instance, if players want to have a more leisurely playthrough, they can pick Creative Mode so they won't have to constantly fear for their lives. Although not overly packed with sights to see, the islands/maps are pretty in their own stylish way.

  Launching into open beta in 2023,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  has become more accessible thanks to a Switch port and a Steam release. The full release is expected to drop at some point in 2024, so anyone who decides to dive into this
  <strong>
   free open-world game
  </strong>
  should expect a few bugs; however,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  is not too terrible in that area, even if experiences can vary from user to user. Singularity 6's life sim aims to provide a carefree escape from reality, dropping players into a rich and peaceful fantasy world. As with most of these games, players will spend their time setting up their perfect homestead, which involves developing a decently-sized plot.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  moves at a slow pace, purposefully so. Farming and refining resources take a while, and quite a few hours will pass before players have a proper home to call their own. Everything takes time, although this is negated by a skill system that features eight professions that should be developed; consequently, players should be jumping from skill to skill rather than waiting for one to complete a cycle.

 <p>
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  is not going to be for everyone. As popular as life sims have become, they are still an acquired taste, and Singularity 6 has taken the genre and stripped away intrinsic incentives or traditional goals. However, if someone is craving a second life,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  presents that opportunity.

  Nexon's
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  is a strange case. While one of the better free games with an open-world, it is not one of the
  <strong>
   best open-world free games
  </strong>
  . Contradictory as this might sound, this project's value is determined by other areas, and its open-world element is among its worst aspects.
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  is worth playing for its satisfying third-person shooter gameplay, which is arguably among the most enjoyable in the free-to-play scene.

 <p>
  The playable characters, known as Descendants, also have pretty fun designs, and they all come with unique traits that make them worth trying out. Beyond that, the story is fairly cliche, although it is elevated by a sometimes impressive presentation. Due to using Unreal Engine 5, the graphics are generally impressive, and an argument could be made that this is the best-looking free game.

  In the last few years, it's often been the case that at least one Indie game has seemingly come out of nowhere and been a major hit. For example, last year had
  <em>
   Dredge
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Cocoon
  </em>
  , 2022 had
  <em>
   Tunic
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  , and 2021 had
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  . Just two months from 2024's end, it seems safe to say that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Balatro
   </strong>
  </em>
  is 2024's breakout Indie sensation, with its addictive roguelike deck-building gameplay and top-notch community support keeping it immensely popular eight months after its initial launch.

  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  has become so popular, in fact, that it's now able to collaborate with a handful of other popular titles, including some heavy hitters in both the Indie and AAA space. Called the 'Friends of Jimbo' pack,
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  's first crossover landed in August, bringing cards based on
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  . A second Friends of Jimbo pack has just been released, adding another set of cosmetic collaborations, including ones based on another beloved CD Projekt Red title.

  Balatro Has Added Cards Inspired by Cyberpunk 2077
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  has come a long way since its infamously troubled launch in December 2020. Thanks to a consistent stream of updates and patches from developer CD Projekt Red,
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  has become the RPG it always meant to be, and last year's acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion raised it to all-new heights.

 <p>
  Public perception surrounding
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  has changed drastically, to the point where it's now one of the biggest highlights of
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  's recently released Friends of Jimbo pack 2. With this completely free update, players can now customize their deck to include a set of cards based on
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  . Keanu Reeves' iconic Johnny Silverhand takes on the role of
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  's King of Spades, while Rogue Amendiares is the Queen, and Jackie Welles is the Jack.

  Stardew Valley, The Binding of Isaac, and Slay the Spire All Feature in Balatro's Latest Crossover Pack
 </h3>
 <p>
  Just like
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  's first Friends of Jimbo pack, this second update adds three more crossover cosmetics alongside the CD Projekt Red collaboration.
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  is now in
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  , with the game's General Store clerk, Pierre, taking on the role of the Jack of Diamonds. Marnie leaves her ranch to become
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  's Queen of Diamonds, and Lewis, the mayor of Pelican Town, becomes
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  's King of Diamonds.

 <p>
  The adorably gruesome and macabre
  <em>
   Binding of Isaac
  </em>
  also joins in on the fun. Isaac himself becomes the King of Hearts, while his Mom takes a break from being the final boss to take on the role of the Queen of Hearts, and a decapitated dog becomes the Jack.
  <em>
   Slay the Spire
  </em>
  gets three collab cards as well, bringing the Silent, the Ironclad, and the Defect to the game.

 <p>
  There are now eight major collaborations in
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  , but that might not be the end of things. In its official announcement of the second Friends of Jimbo pack on Twitter,
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  's developer teased more collaborations with other titles in the future, signing off with "Is this the full squad, or is there more to come?" There are still plenty of other Indie games
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  could crossover with, with fellow card game
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  being a great example.

   two methods to obtain the Jet Gun in

   Zombies

  The first involves spending some Essence in the Mystery Box and relying on a little luck to add the Wonder Weapon to the inventory. Players can spend 950 Essence to get a weapon from the box but there is a chance the evil bunny makes an appearance instead of the Jet Gun.

  The second method doesn't involve spending any Essence at all. Instead, players have to navigate their way around Liberty Falls. First, head to
  <strong>
   E4 on the map coordinates and head to the front of Lilly's Flowerpot store
  </strong>
  . At the front of the house is a hosepipe. Interact with it to earn the Water Valve.

 <p>
  Next,
  <strong>
   advance to the Liberty Lanes Bowling Alley
  </strong>
  . Inside the alley is a water gauge on the wall near the lanes.
  <strong>
   Smash the panel
  </strong>
  open and place the Water Valve onto the wall. The water pressure will begin to build up. This is a tricky task to complete solo as the undead are still capable of dealing damage. Step three involves finding
  <strong>
   the Handbrake
  </strong>
  . Advance to the Graveyard and
  <strong>
   take out the Groundskeeper
  </strong>
  that spawns nearby. Once eliminated, the Groundskeeper will drop
  <strong>
   the Toolshed Key
  </strong>
  . Head to the shed located near D4 on the Tac Map where the Handbrake is laid on a table.

  With the Handbrake now in possession, it's time to get the

  </strong>
  which requires players to eliminate a Mangler or crafting it at a nearby workbench. Crafting it costs 1,250 Salvage or players can loot it from a Mangler once it's downed. Next,
  <strong>
   move to the Radio House
  </strong>
  and use the Mangle Cannon to break down the door. The Electrical Wires are inside the piles of wires.

  The Electrical Wires are the final part to collect. Now it's time to craft the Jet Gun. Find a nearby workbench and
  <strong>
   combine the three parts to assemble the Jet Gun
  </strong>
  . Now, players can use it to continue the main quest or to decimate any undead threats that will aim to bring the game to an early end. The Jet Gun in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the strongest weapons in the entire game. The ability to clear out hordes of Zombies in the blink of an eye is excellent, especially when reaching the higher rounds.

  Crime has been a key subject in gaming ever since Hiroshi Suzuki’s
  <em>
   Manbiki Shounen
  </em>
  used shoplifting as a basis for stealth gameplay. Though while committing crimes has worked wonderfully for
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, Hitman,
  </em>
  and more, there are also a wide range of games dedicated to stopping crimes.

 <p>
  Usually, this came via fisticuffs, like in
  <em>
   Streets of Rage
  </em>
  , while others included detective-style investigations
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  fisticuffs, like
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Asylum.
  </em>
  That said, real detectives don’t have breath-detecting cowls like the Dark Knight nor spirit mediums like Phoenix Wright - not usually anyway. These games use more
  <strong>
   realistic ways of solving crimes
  </strong>
  , with investigation, clues, testimony, and a lot of deduction.

  <em>
   Murder mysteries have been inspiring people for centuries, be it through classic Agatha Christie novels, or on TV through shows like Castle and Murder, She Wrote. It's even convinced some people to take up amateur sleuthing themselves, or become actual detectives, criminologists, and investigators. Even so, they tend to take some artistic licenses with crime solving. Video games do the same thing, offering fanciful settings, powers, and other mechanics. But a few have tried to be more authentic, making players search for clues, talk at length to different NPCs, and use their own logic to figure out who did what. There are more of them than people would think, as this list has been updated with more detective games that take a realistic approach to mystery solving.

 <p>
  By its premise alone,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Return of the Obra Dinn
   </strong>
  </em>
  doesn’t sound very realistic. The titular Obra Dinn is a ship that went missing around the Cape of Good Hope in 1803, taking all 60 souls with it. When it suddenly reappears off the coast of England 5 years later, it’s up to the player to figure out what happened to everyone aboard. The circumstances are spooky, and it’s as supernatural as the player’s ‘Memento Mortem,’ a pocket watch that lets them recreate suspected deaths.

 <p>
  Yet getting ahead in the game involves investigating the scenes closely for all its clues, noting them down, and deducing what happened. Players must be accurate, too, as they’ve got to validate the fates in pairs or triples rather than making one educated guess. Some deaths are similar enough that players can get away with making the same conclusions, but others require more careful and exact deductions. Otherwise, the player will be left on the ship with a lot of bad memories.

   <em>
    Paradise Killer
   </em>
  </strong>
  's premise is anything but realistic, as it sees the Syndicate, an organization of immortal aliens, abduct humans from Earth in an attempt to create the perfect society on Paradise Island. When it inevitably fails, they sacrifice its citizens to create the next attempt. On the 24th incarnation of the island, the Syndicate Council are found murdered, putting its 25th recreation on hold. To solve the mystery, the Syndicate sends detective Lady Love Dies to find the true culprit, then personally execute them if they're sentenced to death.

 <p>
  However, its gameplay is more grounded by comparison, as Lady Love Dies has to examine crime scenes, talk to witnesses and suspects, and piece the clues together to figure out the facts. It takes place in an open world, where the player can go anywhere they like and talk to whoever they want in any order and at any time. They could even solve other mysteries, and put people on trial. Though if they don't have all the evidence they need to expose the island's secrets, it's going to be a short session in court.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Disco Elysium
   </strong>
  </em>
  takes place in a fantasy world called Elysium, where its ‘isolas’ are separated by a misty tissue called ‘The Pale’ that induces insanity and death with prolonged exposure. Beyond that, it resembles life in a Communist country and takes inspiration from grittier detective media like
  <em>
   The Wire
  </em>
  and novels by Dashiel Hammett and China Miéville. This is certainly evident in its surreal storytelling, where the player must investigate the death of a hanged man in Martinaise.

  The plot gradually unfolds a wider conspiracy and delves into the player’s character, Lieutenant Harry DuBois. But to get there, players must improve their detection by finding the right clues and making the right dialogue choices. Without them, they wouldn't be able to develop the right skills and thoughts needed to aid the investigation. They can also help tip things in their favor during skill checks, as players can have all they need, but they'll still need luck on their side to succeed.

   <em>
    The Case of the Golden Idol
   </em>
  </strong>
  uses point and click elements, as its Exploring Mode requires clicking on characters, objects, etc., to pick up keywords and phrases relevant to the story. Namely, how the titular Golden Idol is involved with the Cloudsley family and the mysterious secret society known as the Brotherhood. Things get strange quite quickly, though the way to figure out what's happening is more straightforward.

 <p>
  When they enter Thinking Mode, players can piece the evidence together to come to different conclusions that reveal more of the plot. It can reveal the names of more Brotherhood members, the rooms they stayed in, what they had access to, etc. It's quite a merciful game, as it’ll clue players in a little by letting them know whether their segments are correctly placed or not, allowing them to rearrange things when necessary. To get all the right segments, players can't leave any stone unturned in Exploring Mode.

  <em>
   Obra Dinn
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  have fanciful settings but use realistic detective methods, such as clue logging and pressing witnesses and suspects for information. But how about a game that has a realistic setting
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  realistic gameplay? There are plenty around, though few follow the most famous detective in fiction, like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments
   </em>
  </strong>
  does. This title sees Holmes and Watson go around Victorian England and solve cases based on actual
  <em>
   Holmes
  </em>
  short stories.

  Players search for clues, then piece them together on a ‘deduction board’ to figure out the results. Each case has multiple solutions depending on how well players figure things out, if they find the culprit, and whether they choose to absolve or condemn the criminal in question. Its fanciest detail is ‘Sherlock Vision,’ where Holmes can look more closely at items to derive new information from them, like finding hidden inscriptions or signs that something's been moved.

  Point &amp; Click adventure games were popular fixtures on PCs and microcomputers throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. But by the late 1990s, their gameplay and moon logic puzzles felt like old hat next to 3D platformers and first-person shooters. Still, they went out with a bang, offering some of the strongest games in the genre, with the likes of the
  <em>
   Broken Sword
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Grim Fandango
  </em>
  , and Westwood Studios' take on the classic movie
  <strong>
   <em>
    Blade Runner
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Well, kind of.

  It takes place during the flick, and features its characters, some of whom are played by their original actors. But it follows a different runner: Ray McCoy. New to the job, he's tasked with tracking down a group of replicants who killed some animals. But when he follows their trail too closely, he's framed for murder and forced to go on the run. By talking to suspects, finding clues, analyzing photos, and using the Voight-Kampf test to find replicants, he can solve the mystery, and get one of 13 endings depending on their choices in-game.

  Despite its blunt title,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Murder Mystery Machine
   </em>
  </strong>
  aims to make players really think like detectives. Players take the roles of District Crime Agency newbie Cassandra Clarke and the experienced-but-burnt-out Nathan Huston to investigate the murder of a famous politician. The evidence says he was killed in a botched robbery, but as they delve further, they touch upon a more complicated plot that could have grave consequences.

  Players explore settings and crime scenes as isometric dioramas, where they can move the place around to get a better look at things. Then, they can piece together their clues, witness testimony, and more on their Charlie Kelly-style mindmap. Once they link things accurately, they'll get more dialogue options to advance the case and get closer to the truth. Its controls take some getting used to, as they can be a little clunky. But its inventive approach to gameplay has kept players going back to it to solve its 8 chapters over and over.

  Walking simulators are often derided for not offering much in terms of gameplay, but it can be nice to just explore a virtual world and figure out what it's like through environmental storytelling alone. Given that detective games are all about careful observation and deduction, they could fit walking simulators like a hand in a glove. At least EQ Studios must’ve thought so, as that became the basis for
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Painscreek Killings
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Players take the role of Janet, a journalist tasked with figuring out why the formerly bustling town of Painscreek was abandoned and how it connects to a series of killings in the area. They can walk all around town in search of clues and logic puzzles that involve careful observation to solve. There’s no handholding here; players must investigate the town carefully on their own to come to the right conclusions.

  </strong>
  sees Detective Jenks explore the village of Edenton in search of clues and testimony into the apparent suicide of Kate Vine. On top of using point and click elements to open new areas, Jenks must find the contradictions in his interviewees’ statements by comparing one detail to another. The more lies and truths he exposes, the closer he gets to solving the case. While it has its flaws, it's a fun, experimental game with plenty of campy charm to go with its intriguing gameplay.

  FMV games seem to be coming back in style, as there are more games experimenting with using live-action footage in their gameplay. For example,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Centennial Case: A Shijima Story
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a mystery puzzle game that sees novelist Haruka Kagami work with Eiji Shijima, a scientist who studies aging. He thinks his family passed down a special fruit that, once eaten, could stop the aging process altogether. But when a dead body is unearthed at his ancestral home, he asks Haruka to help figure out who killed them, along with other mysteries surrounding his family.

  It splits its gameplay up into 3 parts. In the Incident phase, players watch the murder take place to find clues to the culprit's identity and their methods. Then they can use the collected clues to form a hypothesis in the Reasoning phase, where they can make multiple deductions and see where the mystery leads them. Then, when they're sure, they can go to the Solution phase to catch the murderer. The smarter ones will fire back with their own counter-arguments, so players have to be sure their hypothesis is airtight.

  Another FMV game that plays to the strengths of the genre is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Her Story
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It takes the form of an old computer OS from 1994, as the player must watch multiple clips from an interview with Hannah Smith over the disappearance and subsequent death of her husband Simon. She’s asked off-screen questions that the player can’t hear, leaving them to deduce the context from Smith’s answers.

 <p>
  By cross-referencing her details with information from the database, players can figure out the more complex plot surrounding the Smiths as well as how Simon met his end. The most intriguing twist involves discovering who the player’s character is. Though to learn that, players will have to try the game out for themselves.
  <em>
   Her Story
  </em>
  shows how well FMV games can work with the right minds behind them.

   <em>

  . This game offers up multiple cases of crimes for Cole Phelps and Jack Kelso to investigate, giving players a more up-close and personal look at investigating crime scenes, gathering key information from colleagues like coroners, etc., and interrogating key people for more information. In this title, things can get quite grisly when investigating homicide cases.

  Its revolutionary face-scanning tech was meant to aid this, where players could look at the person’s facial expressions to figure out whether they were being economical with the truth. It worked fairly well, too, even if some of the expressions came off as funny rather than intriguing. That said, as far as detective games go, it was one of the most authentic with its setting, investigations, and the fierce pressurizing of suspects when Phelps and Kelso needed answers.

  Detective games became a craze in Japan during the mid-1980s.
  <em>
   Famicom Detective Club
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sanma no Meitantei
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Snatcher,
  </em>
  among others, have players wander open worlds (albeit by changing screens), investigating the areas, and talking to key figures/interrogating suspects for key info. Why did it catch on so well? It’s because of Yuji Horii and
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Portopia Serial Murder Case
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  On top of revolutionizing RPGs through
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  , Horii practically invented visual novels by letting the player and their assistant Yasu figure out how bank president Kozo Yamakawa met his end in a locked room. Combining a first-person view with point and click elements, branching dialogue, and twists, it was as realistic as detective games could get in 1983, and it became the basis for many future detective games in the following decades.

  Giovanni returns this March 2025 with powerful Shadow Monsters in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  . While his battle roster remains the same as the previous month, winning against them is still challenging. You must strategically select counters to secure a win.

  You must
  <strong>
   first locate Giovanni
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , and then only can you initiate the battle. Once you
  <strong>
   defeat 6 GO Rocket Grunts and all three Leaders
  </strong>
  , Sierra, Arlo, and Cliff, you can
  <strong>
   get a Rocket Radar
  </strong>
  leading to Giovanni’s location. The Team GO Rocket main boss has numerous powerful Shadow Pokemon, which requires thorough preparation. That said, this guide details the best Giovanni Shadow Pokemon counters for March 2025.

  The battle with Giovanni has three rounds; the main boss has an individual Shadow Pokemon for the first and last rounds. But the second round is tricky, Giovanni has 3 Shadow Pokemon he can choose from. Since the second round’s opponent is random, you must carefully strategize your
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  counters to defeat Giovanni.

 <p>
  Some of the best
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  counter teams for Giovanni would be
  <strong>
   Machamp, Swampert, and Xerneas/Togekiss
  </strong>
  . You can use the Fighting-type Machamp to exploit Persian’s type-weaknesses. If Rhyperior is his second choice, Machamp can also deal heavy damage before being knocked out.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the second round, you can proceed with the Water and Ground-type Pokemon, Swampert. The monster’s Ground-type attacks work well against Nidoking. Its Charged Attacks help deplete Giovanni’s shields quickly. You can also use Togekiss in the second round if Giovanni chooses Kingdra.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Fairy-type Togekiss also comes in handy on the last round’s Dragon-type Palkia in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Fairy-type Pokemon like Xerneas or Togekiss can easily counter Kingdra or Palkia, dealing massive damage while resisting the opponent’s attacks.

  Ubisoft has become a developer renowned for their post-launch support, with many of their games receiving countless patches and updates after their release to keep them fresh and accessible for players to enjoy. While this obviously applies to their live service games where the multiplayer experience is always being tinkered with and altered, it even refers to single-player titles too, which tend to receive a graphical boost, alongside an enhanced frame rate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the past few years, Ubisoft has enhanced the FPS of numerous games as a way to encourage players to dive back in for another playthrough, which is far from a bad idea considering how fun a lot of them are. With the gameplay looking and feeling a lot smoother, it makes the game all the more fun and immersive to play, and though it might look like a small upgrade on paper, a 60FPS perspective can drastically change the experience as a whole.

  <em>
   New Dawn
  </em>
  is a standalone expansion to
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  , and though its map is only roughly a quarter of the size, it's well worth jumping into for a quick and easy run-and-gun playthrough, especially now that the frame rate has been upgraded. When it was on 30FPS, while the game still looked great, the blurriness could sometimes make it hard to appreciate the vibrancy of the world, which is packed full of bright pinks, blues and greens, due to years of lingering radiation.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the modern version of the game though, it's easy to get distracted in between missions from just admiring the environment, which certainly isn't a bad thing. Nobody should expect
  <em>
   New Dawn
  </em>
  to provide a deep or complex story anywhere near the level of
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  , but the addictive FPS gameplay, paired with the breathtaking visuals, and 60FPS compatibility, still make for a fantastic game.

  Though
  <em>
   Star Wars: Outlaws
  </em>
  has technically had a 60FPS option since launch, the game itself has still been patched numerous times by Ubisoft, to where it's now a lot more enjoyable than it was when it came out. The main focus for Ubisoft was fixing the stealth, which now feels a lot more challenging and less gimmick-heavy. Setting the display to 60FPS is the best way to feel truly immersed in
  <em>
   Outlaws'
  </em>
  environments, which is really where the game truly shines.
 </p>
 <p>
  From back-alley bars filled with bounty hunters and merchants to giant facilities crawling with deadly Stormtroopers, all of these areas truly feel alive and lived in thanks to the bolstered frames and realistic enemy animations. As far as
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  games go,
  <em>
   Outlaws
  </em>
  is a pretty good time for longtime fans and newcomers to the franchise alike.

 <p>
  Initially, Ubisoft's ambitious third entry in the experimental
  <em>
   Watch Dogs
  </em>
  series was only able to run at 60FPS on PS5. However, an upgrade to 60 frames was promised as part of the game's road map, and it's fair to say that it makes a pretty big difference. It adds a lot of realism to London as an area, and makes the driving, and of course, the hacking, even more fun and responsive.
 </p>
 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Legion
  </em>
  , there technically isn't a main character, as players are tasked with assuming control of other civilians they find on the street to make up their mini-army of hackers. It's an interesting mechanic, and one which works surprisingly well due to how diverse the members can be in their abilities. Thanks to Ubisoft's 60 FPS upgrade, the game plays better than ever, and is still one of the best-looking games they have put out in recent years.

  Though
  <em>
   For Honor
  </em>
  is technically a fighting game at its core, it also borrows a lot from MOBAs and team shooters to create an utterly unique experience that really can't be compared to anything else out there. Because of how precise players need to be with their swings, dodges, and parries, having 60FPS will provide a huge advantage over the standard 30.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, Ubisoft was quick to add a 60FPS upgrade right after the PS5 launched, and with the game still being updated to this day, it's packed full of content to enjoy, and also includes a lengthy progression system. While it can be a little tricky to get into at first, it feels very rewarding to stick with
  <em>
   For Honor
  </em>
  and learn all of its hidden systems which will pay off in the heat of battle.

  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  is often seen by fans as one of, if not the best entry in the series, which is certainly saying something given how critically acclaimed many of these games are. What makes it so much fun to play, outside of the intriguing story and memorable characters, is the amount of freedom gifted to the player. While there's plenty of jaw-dropping scenic routes to enjoy as part of the beautiful Hope County, the map also contains more than enough Peggy outposts to liberate, ensuring players always have something to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking of the map,
  <em>
   Far Cry 5's
  </em>
  Hope County is split between three different regions, each ruled by one of Joseph Seed's brutal subordinates, which adds a ton of variety to the environments and enemy types. In early 2023, Ubisoft decided to breathe new life into the fan-favorite game by giving it an enhanced FPS upgrade, making for one of the very best open world games on the PS5 right now.

  As a highly competitive tactical FPS that requires twitch-like reflexes,
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  essentially needs to run at a higher frame rate to be responsive enough for players to enjoy. Being able to quickly swing around a corner or throw down a grenade or gadget at the last second can make or break a round, so thankfully, PS5 players will have a 60FPS option to keep them up to speed during a match.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  has been one of Ubisoft's most consistent games in terms of post-launch support, with new Operators being added every few months, along with plenty of balance adjustments to maintain a fair playing field. The hotly anticipated
  <em>
   Siege X
  </em>
  is going to be shaking things up a lot, so there's never been a better time for fans of fun and fluid FPS games to dive into
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>

  Near the end of 2024, Ubisoft took everyone by surprise when announcing a seemingly random update for
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Syndicate
  </em>
  , which allows the game to run at a smooth 60 FPS. The game itself is a decade old at this point, which is why nobody saw it coming, but
  <em>
   Syndicate
  </em>
  still holds up as an incredible entry which harkens back to the more stealth-based core gameplay of the originals.
 </p>
 <p>
  As players navigate their way around an immensely detailed Victorian London, they'll be free to switch between Jacob and Evie; twins who possess different abilities and strengths to make them useful in different scenarios. The villain and overall story isn't the best that the series has to offer, but gameplay-wise, Ubisoft knocked it out of the park with
  <em>
   Syndicate
  </em>
  , especially with the parkour, which is arguably the best in the entire series.

  In the lead up to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Mirage
  </em>
  , Ubisoft decided to randomly upgrade one of the most well-received modern entries in the series,
  <em>
   Origins.
  </em>
  While
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  is fondly looked back on by many for its stunning open-world depiction of Ancient Egypt, it was also the game that took the series into more of an RPG route. However,
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  still manages to keep the traditional stealth as part of the gameplay, and with the addition of Bayek's eagle, it makes scouting out enemy camps even more enjoyable.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 60FPS upgrade makes the gameplay much smoother, especially since it allows Bayek to feel more responsive and less like a walking tank. This can help out a lot in parkour sections, but also when sneaking around, where bumping into a random wall can prove costly.
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  also has a plethora of great DLC expansions, especially Curse of the Pharaohs, which can all be enjoyed in buttery 60FPS on the PS5.

      <title>Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Why Were Its Starters Chosen?</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-starters-chikorita-tepig-totodile-why/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  With the latest trailer for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends: Z-A
   </strong>
  </em>
  revealing its trio of starter Pokemon from across the franchise's generations, the ultimate pick of Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile has raised questions as to why Game Freak chose these three. With its predecessor,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  , setting the precedent for featuring an intergenerational mix of starter Pokemon, it seemed highly likely that
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  would continue the trend with its own starter trio. As a result, rumors and leaks about
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's starter Pokemon have surrounded the game ever since it was first announced in early 2024.

 <p>
  However, the surprise picks for
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's starter Pokemon still seemed unusual, as the game breaks from
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus'
  </em>
  conventions; two of its starter trio originate from the same generation. While the official confirmation of its starter Pokemon means players will have a better understanding of
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  ahead of its launch in late 2025, it raises new questions as to why these three were picked. Between the potential for new regional variants and the uncertainty around Gen 2's Cyndaquil absence in
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , it seems Game Freak could reveal more about its starter Pokemon throughout the year.

  Similar to
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  and its intergenerational starter trio,
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's newest trailer has confirmed that it will do the same with its starter Pokemon, with its trio consisting of Gen 2's Chikorita and Totodile alongside Gen 5's Tepig. The announcement might come as a surprise when, following the game's reveal, rumors about
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's starter Pokemon ranged from the return of
  <em>
   Pokemon X
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Y
  </em>
  's starter trio to a mix of Pokemon from Gens 3, 5, and 8. But beyond disproving early speculation from the
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community,
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's apparent favoritism of certain generations for its starter Pokemon has been an even greater surprise.
 </p>
 <h3 id="pokemon-legends-z-a-39-s-trailer-and-pokemon-legends-arceus-could-explain-its-starter-picks">
  Pokemon Legends: Z-A's Trailer and Pokemon Legends: Arceus Could Explain Its Starter Picks
 </h3>
 <p>
  One potential explanation as to why Game Freak has chosen these particular Pokemon for
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's starter trio stems from both the game's recent trailer and another
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  ' feature. After first introducing its intergenerational starter trio,
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  pushed the envelope by debuting the series' first-ever regional variants of starter Pokemon final evolutions. As was the case with
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  ' Hisuian Samurott and Typhlosion adding a new dimension to their types as well as their designs, it seemed possible that
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  might do the same with its starter Pokemon.
 </p>
 <p>
  This would explain why Chikorita and Totodile were selected for
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , as their final evolutions, Meganium and Feraligatr respectively, are mono-type Pokemon that could benefit from a regional variant. Even
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  's trailer seems to support this theory, as its gameplay revealed Chikorita using the Fairy-type move Disarming Voice and Tepig using the Rock-type move Rollout. Though this is only speculation for now, it could suggest that Game Freak is planning to introduce new regional variants, and why Cyndaquil is missing from
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  after already featuring in
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  . Some particularly plausible variants include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A Grass/Fairy type Meganium.
  </li>
  <li>
   A Water/Dark type Feraligatr.
  </li>
  <li>
   A Fire/Rock type Emboar.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Ultimately, while Chikorita and Totodile seem like natural choices for a

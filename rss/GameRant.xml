  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  player nearly faced disaster when trying to catch a Hundo Dialga with their very last raid Premier Ball. The success is made even more sweet for the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  player, as this was their first attempt at the raid.

  <em>

  raids are exciting, but also nerve-wracking. Players can potentially get some of the best Pokemon in the game by participating in raids, but that chance comes with the risk of walking away empty-handed. Since
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  raids don't let players access their stores of various Poke Balls, it can potentially be tricky getting a good outcome.

  player Readous has plenty to be happy about, and they took to the game's main subreddit to discuss their successful ending.

  </em>
  's Origin Forme Dialga started appearing in 5-star raids on November 18, and this player was quick to participate in fighting one. The player shared screenshots of their encounter with the CP 2337 Dialga, with the nerve-wracking "Last Ball!" warning on-screen. Readous notes that they hadn't realized it was a Hundo until they'd already casually tossed and missed with a couple of Premier Balls. Thankfully, despite their mistake, the last Premier Ball sealed the deal, and they shared the catch and evaluation screens to prove it.

 <p>
  <em>

  players have shared their congratulations with the player. While this particular Dialga lacks the coveted Roar of Time, it's nonetheless a catch to be proud of. Unfortunately, Readous is far from the only player to experience something like this, and not everyone gets the same happy ending. One player lamented that they'd been trying to catch a Palkia and messed up with their last ball, accidentally tossing it onto the floor and losing the Palkia in the process.

 <p>
  While getting a Hundo in the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  community is usually a pretty big deal, there's still plenty of time left to look for more. The Legendary Pokemon will be appearing in Raids through November 27. Pokemon fans who encounter an Origin Forme Dialga and want to maximize their chances should make sure to use any Razz Berries they have on hand, and to aim for Excellent Throws. Curveballs can also potentially boost the chance of landing a catch, though the most important thing is obviously to hit the target. Having a Dialga break away from a ball is upsetting, but wasting them on total misses would probably feel much worse for the average trainer.

 <p>
  To acquire the Specialist Pack, players will need to
  <strong>
   trade in a Redacted Weapon at the Weapon Trade Station
  </strong>
  on Area 99. Redacted Weapons are eight-attachment weapons of red rarity, which can be obtained in one of three ways. The first method is to
  <strong>
   find them at designated locations around the map
  </strong>
  — with one of the most sought-after being the LR 7.62 Sniper Rifle at the Reactor towards the center of the map.

  The second method is by

  Once players have secured a Redacted Weapon, they can head to a Weapon Trade Station (marked as a weapon icon on the map) and
  <strong>
   trade it in for the Specialist Pack.
  </strong>
  Weapon Trade Stations can be found in almost every POI on Area 99, so players will not need to travel far to find one. Once players have picked up the Specialist Pack, they will be granted access to every single Perk in the game. The Specialist Pack will also remain equipped even after a player dies.

As the dark winter months draw near, a snowbound scary story can be just the thing to enjoy from the comfort of a cozy couch. There is something inherently enticing about the contrast of blood on snow or the homely glow of a fire-lit cabin isolated against a dark winter night, which is why the images are so often invoked in horror tales.

  Certainly, if nothing else, it allows for the appreciation of such a landscape without the need to freeze to death to see it. Then again, horrors can lurk in any refuge from the cold. Although freezing may seem preferable once inside, the trapdoor shuts and the deathly silence of the dark cavern is all that can be heard, or some misshapen shadow from a corner of that homely cabin suddenly rears up from the dark. For anyone looking to scare their way to the winter holidays,
  <strong>
   these horror games should do the trick.
  </strong>

  With compelling and highly comforting narration performed by Sean Bean, the player must navigate the mountain pass with only their map and a set of coordinates to find their way forward. The environment is fantastically realized with an endlessly dread-inducing soundscape.

  Before Frictional Games scored their massive hit with
  <em>
   Amnesia: Dark Descent
  </em>
  , there was the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Penumbra
   </em>
  </strong>
  series. The structure of the later
  <em>
   Amnesia
  </em>
  games can easily be spotted throughout this first-person, narrative-driven stealth horror experience. However, there are some notable deviations, such as a bare-bones physics-based combat system.

 <p>
  <em>
   Penumbra
  </em>
  is a lonesome experience with most of the game taking place in dark tunnels under the snowy landscape above and only the voice of the crazed survivor, Red, for support. Despite not seeing much snow,
  <em>
   Penumbra
  </em>
  maintains an abysmally cold, dead atmosphere that is sure to keep anyone playing thankful for the warmth of their own home.

  A Canadian-set winter murder mystery where, after a dramatic car crash, the player finds themselves alone in the town of Atamipek Lake. Snowbound and with nothing more than their car, detective intuition, and the cosy narration of an older Canadian man, a murder must be solved and a snowstorm survived.

  does a great job switching between the atmosphere of being comfortably alone and alarmingly isolated. Driving the car over snow-covered back roads and checking through the rooms of a fire-lit abode in the wilderness can put the player right at ease, then a sudden bang from downstairs when it seemed so certain no one was home offsets all that comfort in a second.

 <p>
  The first of Supermassive Games forays into what has now become their niche genre of horror game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Until Dawn
   </strong>
  </em>
  is set in a cabin in the mountains populated by a group of late teens with a propensity towards being stupid and dying horribly. Classic stuff.

 <p>
  It’s a well-put-together choice-based narrative that plays around with the tropes of the genre and player expectations to keep them on their toes. The snowy mountain setting is often stunning to look at; all the more so in the recent remake.

  Set on a huge shipwrecked icebreaker, the
  <em>
   North Wind
  </em>
  , the player must investigate and find out what befell the crew of the ship and its cause. A game with a unique little narrative where players are challenged with not only finding the dead crew but also going into their last memories and, one by one, changing the outcome.

  Few games capture the atmosphere of absolute bone-aching cold that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Cryostasis
   </strong>
  </em>
  does. Everything is frozen over; every surface, every corpse. Stalactites droop from the ceilings and the ship quickly feels more like exploring an ancient icy tomb. Even the player's health meter is measured in heat, as finding sources of warmth is the only way to heal.

  A rare Wii-exclusive horror title with the unique setting of the mountain Chomolonzo in Tibet,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Cursed Mountain
   </strong>
  </em>
  follows Eric Simmons' search for his brother as he treks up the mountain. It's a bit of a slow burn and takes its time getting to the good stuff, but there is an interesting story and plenty of atmosphere to be found within.

 <p>
  While overly long, the early sections in the isolated mountainside villages make for a good setup for the wilderness of perpetual winter that follows and to establish just how far from any living people Eric is.

  Games based on films seem to largely be a thing of the past, probably because, more often than not, these games turned out to be a hurried low low-effort mess to capitalize on the attention the film release was getting. Not so with Computer Artworks' 2002 game
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Thing,
   </strong>
  </em>
  based on John Carpenter's classic 80s remake.

 <p>
  This game is by no means perfect, but it's certainly a game with lots of effort put into it and is a good attempt to convey the tension of the film in video game format. With a multitude of characters who can join the player's team, each with their own varying levels of trust, fear, and possible infection, it makes the player feel isolated even in company. With the remake scheduled to come out soon, it might be the perfect horror game to pick up this winter.

  While most of the playtime of
  <em>

  is understandably set in the metro tunnels of Moscow, the excursions up to the snowy surface make for some of the most memorable moments.

 <p>
  An extremely talented artist from the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  community recently shared a bunch of their own custom cosmetics for Venture, and they come with fitting sprays, player icons and namecards, weapon designs, and even hypothetical in-game interactions with other heroes depending on the skin. Creative fans of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  often have fun designing custom skins for their favorite heroes, particularly for many of the newer heroes that have come to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  over the past few years.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":480} -->
 <p>
  This is because many of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's newer heroes tend not to have much in the way of cosmetics - especially compared to the many heroes that have been a part of the team-based FPS since the beginning.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's nature as a live-service game means that new content has to come regularly, typically introducing a totally new hero every other season. Though almost every season also comes packed with new cosmetics, spreading out new skins across the ever-growing hero roster has proven somewhat challenging for the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  team.

 <p>
  With the frequency that heroes are introduced in the game nowadays, every new playable character in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  ends up with little time in the spotlight before the next one is introduced. This is especially apparent with Venture, who is infamous for receiving the short end of the stick when it comes to cosmetics and is remarkably still without any legendary skins even seven months after their debut. Thankfully, one artist known online as kaechii recently shared 15 Venture skins of their own design, including cosmetics based on sharks, pumpkins, and even
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  's Sans. Venture fans should take a look through all of these fantastic designs themselves, each of which is complete with custom weapon designs, unique character interactions, and matching player icons.

  Overwatch 2 Fans Should Take a Look at These Fanmade Venture Skins

  To look at one example, though, the shark-themed "Fin-ture" skin concept even includes a neat quirk in which the skin's fin will pop up through the ground while Venture is burrowing. The "Punk Rock" skin looks just like the name suggests, and being a skin themed around music, the designer made sure to include a couple of unique elimination interactions with other
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  heroes, such as Lucio.

  's newest and 41st hero, Juno, was introduced earlier in the game's 12th season. The game's current Season 13 hasn't introduced anyone new, but it has come packed with new cosmetics to collect and modes to play. This of course includes the limited-time Overwatch: Classic, which lets players relive the legendary experience of the original
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  by bringing back old maps and even hero abilities - the good ones, the bad ones, and the utterly broken ones.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Roblox
   </strong>
  </em>
  is introducing new features intended to help protect children who use the game platform. The new move follows criticisms and controversy pointed towards
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  over concerns about children's safety while using the platform.

 <p>
  Since 2006,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  has been a popular game service, giving users not only a way to enjoy games but a platform to build their own. As
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  has tons of games within the game, there's plenty for players to choose from and do, all while users are given the opportunity to meet others and make friends. However, some new restrictions may make that a little more difficult.

 <p>
  Effective immediately,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  users under the age of nine can no longer use any games or experiences that rate higher than Mild, with a parental consent option to access Moderate content. However, the biggest changes are in the works. In the months to come,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  will be introducing strong limits on accounts belonging to kids under the age of 13. 13-and-under kids won't be able to direct message others outside of games and experiences, won't have access to public broadcast messages outside of games and experiences, and the game will add a parental control that determines whether users can send private messages. Additionally,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  will prevent users under 13 from seeing any experiences that have yet to be rated with a Content Label. Certain social activities will be age-gated.

  New Roblox Settings Give Parents More Control
 </h2>
 <p>
  In addition to everything else, parents can now view a number of important statistics regarding how their kids are playing. Accounts with parent privileges can view screen time and a child's friends list. They can also add a number of restrictions, like how much time kids can play, spending restrictions, and controlling access to chat options and certain content. All of these steps are intended to give parents more say in what their kids are doing and to help ensure that nothing illicit happens, which has been a concern.

  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  has been hit with a number of accusations over the years in connection to child safety. In 2023, a class-action lawsuit was brought against
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  . The lawsuit claimed that
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  's methods of filtering content and control over what kids can see is lacking, potentially creating a risk of kids seeing things they shouldn't. Giving parents more control over everything a kid does in
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  will likely help to make parents feel safer about their children's use of the game platform.

  </em>
  has several locked chests and safes hidden around various locations that players can crack open to reveal rewards. However, finding their codes can be a bit of a struggle, as they might require you to solve a mystery or fetch a note from a heavily guarded Nazi camp.

  The Wehrmacht chest is an interesting one to open up in
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  , as it requires players to analyze the numbers on a hand of cards and input them into the chest. You'll need the Wehrmacht key and disguise in order to access this chest.

  FPS games are some of the biggest and most concurrently played games in the modern gaming landscape. Titles such as
  <em>
   Counter Strike 2
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  boast consistently high player counts but offer vastly different experiences, demonstrating the breadth of the genre.

 <p>
  One niche within the FPS games genre is military simulation. These are titles that strive to portray a realistic military depiction, often through their gunplay. Some FPS games offer incredibly immersive experiences through the use of realistically simulated bullet and projectile physics, be they milsim titles or games that simply strive to simulate bullet physics realistically.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Rainbow Six Siege
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most popular competitive FPS shooters. Loosely set in the Tom Clancy
  <em>
   Rainbow Six
  </em>
  series, it boasts solid gunplay and strategic gadget use in order to create a complex and compelling competitive environment. This gameplay has resulted in the large
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  professional scene.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  is by no means a realistic experience, many of its predecessors did tend to lean towards more realistic gameplay. One realistic bullet mechanic did make it into the game, however, resulting in one of the most crucial gameplay elements. Each bullet does physics-based damage to walls, breaking them uniquely, offering the ability to shape rooms and create unique sight lines using bullet holes and impacts. Bullets also realistically penetrate eligible surfaces, creating a realistic risk to using certain objects and walls as cover.

   <strong>
    Escape From Tarkov

  is generally considered as the pioneering title of the extraction shooter genre. It blends survival, RPG, and traditional FPS elements to create a hardcore PvPvE experience.
  <em>

  is wholly unique, with few other games providing the same tension and heart-pounding action.

 <p>
  One of the more hardcore and subsequently nerve-wracking elements of
  <em>
   Escape From Tarkov
  </em>
  is the ballistics mechanics. Not only do bullets have realistic physics applied, resulting in the need to lead shots and estimate bullet-drop, but the game also has realistic ballistics. Each bullet in the game has unique speed and penetration values, affecting how they travel, how much they break through armor, and how much damage they deal.

    Squad
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a realistic military simulation title that pits two teams against each other in an objective-oriented PvP experience. Games last for extensive periods of time, and teams must travel across great distances with very real consequences for death. As such, Squad includes realistic milsim mechanics, including bullet physics.

 <p>
  Engagement distances in
  <em>
   Squad
  </em>
  can be quite far, resulting in the need to lead targets and account for bullet drop. There are also suppression mechanics and an incredibly realistic damage model that can mean one or two shots is fatal. Another element regarding projectile physics is that RPG and Tank shots deal unique damage to vehicle armor based on where they are hit, with realistic deflection and penetration systems in place.

  <em>
   Arma 3
  </em>
  operations may last for a long while and often take place over incredibly large maps. This, much like
  <em>
   Squad
  </em>
  , means that engagement distances are often long and require plenty of forward planning. All bullets and projectiles have realistic physics applied to them, an aspect that is especially heightened over long distances. This means that, whether players are using guns, tanks, aircraft, or mortars, bullet and projectile physics play a key role in the gameplay of
  <em>
   Arma 3
  </em>
  .

  Sniping titles, such as
  <strong>
   <em>

    Sniper Elite
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the
  <em>

 <p>
  While the
  <em>
   Hunter: Call of the Wild
  </em>
  is most known for its animal behavior and tracking systems, its ballistic system is certainly an impressive element of the game. Players can use a variety of weapons, most commonly long-range hunting rifles, each with different statistics. Players must pay attention to range and wind direction in order to take their shot, requiring patience and a solid knowledge of the bullet drop in order to hit their target. The game then realistically calculates penetration and entry point in order to determine the lethality of the shot.

  RPGs are getting longer and, for the most part, that's great. In an age of soaring video game prices, value for money is a major consideration for many gamers. However, it also has its downsides. There's no worse feeling for an RPG fan than getting a dozen or so hours into a game they're enjoying and realizing that their character's build sucks and there's no way to change it.

 <p>
  Best-case scenario: this simply kills one's enjoyment of the game as fans are forced to play a character they no longer enjoy. Worst-case scenario: progress is next to impossible as one's character build is completely unfeasible. This is why many of the games with the best progression systems include the ability to respec. Sure, every decision in an RPG should carry weight, but nobody likes wasting their time. These are some examples of RPGs with great respec systems that understand that most gamers have a limited amount of free time.

  The current version of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a very different beast from what fans got in 2020. After a famously rough launch, CD Projekt Red worked hard to earn back gamers' trust, something they finally gained with the 2.0 update. Among countless other changes, this update added a much-requested respec system. Something the game desperately needed after so many changes.

  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  might be one of the best open-world FPS games, but at its heart, it's still an RPG, and it's important to build a character that suits one's playstyle. If fans realize they've gone wrong,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk
   </em>
   gives players exactly one chance to respec their attribute points
  </strong>
  . One chance is better than nothing. The game is much more generous with perk points, thankfully. These can be changed at will with no penalties, allowing a certain degree of flexibility. While it would be nice to have more chances to respec attribute points (maybe by paying a ripperdoc), at least this system ensures that character-build decisions still carry weight and encourages a certain degree of roleplaying.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  was easily one of the biggest games of 2023. That's hugely impressive when one considers how faithfully it recreates some of
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  ' most intimidating aspects. It's a 100-hour+ long RPG that can be brutally punishing if the player messes up their builds. The game has one of the best RPG class systems. There's a lot of information to work through when building up one's player character and companions, and it's easy to go wrong.

  Thankfully, Larian Studios gave players a way to respec. Early on in their adventure, players can rescue an NPC called Withers from the Dank Crypt dungeon. If they save Withers, they can recruit him to hang around back at camp. He's one of the game's most important NPCs, capable of reviving dead party members and respec-ing them. Each respec of a character costs 100 gold. In the early hours of the game, that sounds like a lot, but by late in the game it's pocket change.
  <strong>
   As befitting an RPG of this caliber,
   <em>
    BG3's
   </em>
   respec system balances giving weight to build decisions while also giving players a way to fix their mistakes and experiment
  </strong>
  .

  FromSoftware's Soulsborne games have always put a lot of emphasis on perfecting one's character build. They're brutally hard games (for some) that can require hours of grinding if one realizes too late that they've made a mistake with a build.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  does allow players to respec their character, but they have to jump through some hoops first.

  Players can respec after reaching the Academy of Raya and meeting Lucaria. Each respec will cost 1 larval tear, a fairly rare item (there are 18 in the base game and 9 in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC). The Academy is found a fair way into the game, and it'll likely take most gamers many hours to get there. As an open-world game that embraces player freedom,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  had to include a way to respec. This one might feel a little restrictive at first, but it fits in with
  <em>
   Elden Ring'
  </em>
  s difficulty level and still gives determined players plenty of chances to rebuild their character.

  Before the studio became famous for

   Baldur's Gate 3

  , Larian Studios was most well known for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Divinity: Original Sin 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Another well-respected CRPG,
  <strong>
   the game has one of the most open-ended respec systems in any RPG
  </strong>
  . All players need to do is turn on Gift Bags (a kind of developer-approved mod) in the game's menu and visit a Magic Mirror.

  These mirrors can be found in Fort Joy in Act 1 and after that in The Lady o' War. Using them lets players respec every aspect of their characters, turning a mace-wielding warrior into a spell-slinging Wizard if they wish.

  However, there is a cost associated. The first respec comes with a hefty discount but subsequent respecs become increasingly expensive. The
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  games are almost endlessly replayable, but it's great that changing one's playstyle doesn't mean starting over again. It also makes sense considering the technology of the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  universe and the franchise's lore, that characters would be able to change their abilities on the fly.

  A big part of playing as Geralt is finding a playstyle that suits the gamer, which means investing ability points in the right skills. But
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a long game and using the same old skills over and over again for dozens of hours can get old. Luckily, CD Projekt Red provided a lore-friendly way to reset Geralt.

 <p>
  Brewing and drinking potions is a big part of the
  <em>
   Witcher
  </em>
  lore, and to respec Geralt all the player needs to do is get their hands on a Potion of Clearing.
  <strong>
   They cost 1,000 Crowns (which isn't cheap) but, after reaching level 30, can also be found in chests as very rare drops
  </strong>
  . That cost might sound annoying, but it stops the system from being abused, and by the time the player has likely gotten bored of their build 1,000 Crowns shouldn't really be a big deal.

  When
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released way back in 2012, it was kind of a big deal, but it was quickly forgotten. That's a shame because it was a pretty great RPG with excellent combat and plenty of options when it came to building the perfect warrior. The game's story was all about changing fate, so it made sense that the player character could be respec-ed by using an NPC called a Fateweaver.

 <p>
  Each of the game's major cities had one. For a relatively small fee that grew with each respec the payer could reset all of their skill and ability points. The game was never particularly hard, but it was nice to have the option to experiment with different playstyles and use high-end gear your character couldn't previously use.
  <strong>
   In 2012, it was relatively rare for RPGs to include respec systems, and even now, developers are only just catching up with
   <em>
    Kingdom of Amalur's
   </em>
   easy-to-use system

  .

  In recent years,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 76
   </strong>
  </em>
  has enjoyed one of gaming's greatest redemption arcs. After a notoriously rough launch, the game has undergone updates that have tweaked almost every aspect of its gameplay. What was once a controversial entry in the series is now one of the most popular. However, not everything has changed that much. Traditionally, respec-ing perks and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. traits weren't an option in
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games, but
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  has always used a perk card-based system.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":11,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":11,"nbrPlacementsScanned":11,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":605} -->
 <p>
  Initially, not everyone was a fan of this system and many fans felt it overly dumbed down
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's
  <em>
  </em>
  already ailing RPG aspects. But
  <em>
   Fallout 76's
  </em>
  system makes sense for an MMORPG. Throughout their time playing the game, and predominantly by leveling up, players unlock perk cards. These perk cards can either be upgraded (if the player has multiple copies), sold, or equipped. The cards can be equipped and equipped at will at no cost (except legendary perks), allowing the player to essentially respec on the fly. The game encourages experimenting with builds and Perk Card Machines can be used to create custom loadouts. Overall, for the kind of game
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is, it's a pretty great system that allows the player to respec at will although unlocking all the best legendary perks requires a lot of grinding.

  This one might be a controversial pick, as not all

  </em>
  purists are happy with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Diablo 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  's
  <em>
  </em>
  respec system.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Respec-ing in the game couldn't be easier.
  <strong>
   All the player needs to do is go to the Abilities menu, where they'll have the option to either refund single skills points, Paragon levels, or their entire build
  </strong>
  . At lower levels, respec-ing one's character is cheap, but the costs can mount up.

 <p>
  Since buildcrafting is basically the whole point of
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  games, many fans appreciated the addition of respec-ing but not everyone is pleased. While the system allows untold build flexibility, it also makes it easy for high-level players to swap builds while grinding late-game activities. That's the kind of thing that used to require starting a new character.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":12,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":12,"nbrPlacementsScanned":12,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1138} -->

 <p>
  To be fair to Blizzard, they've tried to discourage such behavior. Completely respec-ing a level 50 character would cost 52,000 gold, a cost that could reach an eye-watering 400,000 + gold when including Paragon levels. Pretty much everything about
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has been controversial since it was released in 2023, though so this debate seems likely to keep raging on. Still, for casual fans, an option to respec remains much appreciated.

  It continues to be a common complaint among gamers that too many modern RPGs lack respec systems. But that trend could be changing.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the most recent release on this list, and it has one of the most accessible and player-friendly respec systems mentioned here. All players have to do is visit the
  <strong>
   Skills menu
  </strong>
  and hit the "Refund Points" button. They can either refund all their points or do it one at a time. No visiting a designated NPC, no tracking down rare items, or shelling precious gold. Just press a button.

 <p>
  Considering a run-through of the game can hit 80+ hours, and most players will spend at least 30-40 hours, it's nice to know how easy respec-ing in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is. This system allows players to experiment with different playstyles and explore the game's extensive skill tree. Hopefully, future massive AAA RPGs will take note and let players respec without jumping through too many hoops.

  One of the biggest surprises from Gamescom Opening Night Live,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dying Light: The Beast
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a brand new installment in Techland's open-world zombie franchise. Though it originally began life as a story DLC for
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dying Light: The Beast
  </em>
  is now a fully-fledged standalone adventure, apparently containing over 18 hours of content and a wealth of new features. But that isn't the most exciting aspect of
  <em>
   Dying Light: The Beast
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  By far the most exciting reveal from
  <em>
   Dying Light: The Beast
  </em>
  's announcement trailer was that Kyle Crane is back as the main playable protagonist. With the series' original protagonist having been presumed dead, it'll be interesting to see how Techland resurrects the fan-favorite character, though even the most die-hard
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  fans might now be wondering just how this new entry fits into the franchise's timeline.

  In the Spring of 2014, Global Relief Effort agent Kyle Crane lands in the city of Harran to hunt down Rais, a criminal who holds sensitive information about the virus that's now wreaking havoc on the city. After weeks of turmoil, Crane eventually finds Rais, secures the information, and decides to stay in Harran to help his newfound allies and friends.

  Just a few months later – in the events of

Crane stumbles upon a cult that supposedly has this cure, and he attempts to gain their trust. Once ingratiated into the cult, Crane meets The Mother, a human-Volatile hybrid who forces Crane to drink a substance that will turn him into the same monster.
  <em>
   Dying Light: The Following
  </em>
  then gives the player two choices. One sees Crane siding with The Mother to destroy Harran with nuclear weapons. The other sees him kill The Mother, leave the countryside, and seemingly turn into a Volatile.

  takes place 22 years after the events of the first game and its DLC. In

  <em>

  According to
  <em>

  's official description, the game will take place 13 years after the events of
  <em>
   Dying Light: The Following
  </em>
  . While Techland is remaining fairly tight-lipped about Kyle Crane's current status, it has been confirmed that Crane has been the subject of brutal experiments for the last 13 years. It seems as though these experiments have given him some new beast-like abilities, as well as a strong desire for revenge on those who have kept him locked away. Being set in between
  <em>
   Dying Light 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>

  , it'll be interesting to see how much

      "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Remake" may not need co-op, but its story remains strong, making it a worthwhile PS5 experience.

  The
  <strong>
   PS5
  </strong>
  is moving along nicely, and 2024 could shape up to be the generation's biggest year yet. There are already plenty of amazing games to play. The system's backward compatibility alone grants players access to some of their favorite titles with a serious graphical boost.

 <p>
  There are quite a few
  <strong>
   great co-op games
  </strong>
  players can run on their PS5s and play with friends locally or through the internet. Enthralling storylines have never been the domain of these kinds of titles, but it doesn't mean that good writing has never been successfully incorporated into a co-op game.

   <strong>
    Updated August 25, 2024 by Mark Sammut: Co-op PS5 games with great stories
   </strong>
   are not a weekly occurrence, but they are also not so rare that they are impossible to find. Crucially, gaming has so much diversity that different projects warrant different types of stories, which makes the term "great" flexible. To illustrate that, an August 2024 release has been added that has a great story for the type of game it is, despite the plot being nothing special by most metrics.

  The
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  games are just the best bite-sized RPGs. All three entries offer delightful romps with simple but satisfying combat, streamlined progression and weapon systems, and a whole lot of cat puns. The latter is enough to warrant a recommendation, but
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  has way more to offer than witty dialogue that emphasizes the franchise's adorableness. Overall, this is probably the best game in the series, which means something in a franchise defined by consistency.

 <p>
  While not revolving around co-op like
  <em>
   Cat Quest 2
  </em>
  , which has two protagonists who are both central to the story, the 2024 sequel's implementation of the feature is arguably just as good, at least in terms of the gameplay. Although not important to the story, the second player can mostly do the same things as the main user, so they should not feel too short-changed. Narratively,
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  mostly just tasks players to find a treasure before a sinister pirate, a situation that serves as a justifiable excuse to explore the gorgeous world. Nobody is going to claim the plot is deep, but it fits the game's tone and world perfectly, all the while presenting plenty of opportunities to interact with cute NPCs.

 <p>
  OK, this one is rated on a curve. Beat 'em up games focus very little on their stories, usually just throwing out a few still images in between stages.
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  is no different, and its narrative is largely irrelevant and certainly not a reason to pick up the project. However, relative to similar releases, the story is charming and well done. The game includes a lot of references to past
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  projects, filling the campaign with Easter Eggs and identifiable bosses.

 <p>
  If someone is specifically craving an accessible beat 'em up with fantastic co-op,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  is arguably the best option on the PS5. They also get to play through a cute story filled with loving nods to the franchise's legacy.

 <p>
  This case is weird. Starbreeze's
  <em>
   Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
  </em>
  was specifically designed around the player controlling two siblings simultaneously, a decision that helped foster a strong connection with the characters while also complementing the story's theme of brotherhood and dependency. Despite seemingly being ideal for co-op, Starbreeze deliberately avoided adding multiplayer to the game, and while playing it, this omission never feels like an oversight or mistake.

 <p>
  Avantgarden's remake adds co-op, allowing each player to control one brother. Except for a graphical upgrade, this change is the main difference offered by the 2024 version, and it arguably produced a less memorable overall experience. That said,
  <em>
   Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Remake
  </em>
  is still an above-average
  <strong>
   PS5 co-op game with a great story
  </strong>
  that can readily be completed in a single sitting. Even if it does not reach the heights of the original, it is still worth playing.

  OK, it might be a stretch to describe
  <em>
   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  's story as "great" since it plays things very safe. That said, the game is a spot-on imitation of James Cameron's movies in this area, delivering a straightforward but sound narrative defined by epic action alongside plenty of opportunities to take in the Western Frontier's natural beauty. The latter is undoubtedly
  <em>
   Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  's main selling point since the open-world is nothing short of gorgeous, along with being as expansive as any other modern Ubisoft project.

  Considering the gameplay is not far removed from
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  , the fact
  <em>
   Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  handles co-op similarly to that franchise makes sense.

  is generally presented as a single-player experience, but a guest can jump in at any moment, and their progress will be saved for their campaigns. Although nothing too special, this system works well and helps extend the game's staying power.

  <em>
   Gotham Knights

  garnered a mixed reception at launch, and that is being kind. In truth, it was among 2022's most disappointing games, and its reputation has not started to mend. However, nowadays,
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  is far easier to recommend since it is frequently discounted and can be accessed through subscription services like PS Plus Extra. And, for all the title's flaws, its story is quite good.

  Sure,
  <em>
   Gotham Knight
  </em>
  's plot does not reach the same heights as the Bat Family's greatest comic storylines nor does it match Rocksteady's trilogy, but that does not mean it has no value. The playable characters share a camaraderie that feels genuine, and they grow quite a bit throughout the campaign. The central mystery/story is consistently engaging and well-written, even if it can be predictable at times.

     <em>
      Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League

     , another disappointing DC game with a passable story that is elevated by 4-player co-op. Honestly,

  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  is a great single-player open-world game that features accessible but challenging combat, breathtaking visuals, a historical Japanese setting, and a pretty good story. While nothing too amazing, the latter is generally told well and features a strong range of secondary characters, most of whom have bigger personalities than Jin, the protagonist.
  <em>
   GoT
  </em>
  is fantastic, but the standard story does not support co-op.

  Fortunately, Sucker Punch eventually released
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  , a multiplayer mode that has enough content to feel like a fully fleshed project in its own right. Although not completely removed from Jin's story and Mongol invasion,
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  adds a mythological element, casting players as resurrected warriors who come back to take on an Oni uprising. The premise is, admittedly, a bit fantastical and far-fetched compared to the fairly grounded central story; however, it is told with the same sense of gravitas and top-tier presentation.

  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  is split into four modes, and most people will likely spend their time in Survival. This option allows four players to engage in PvE co-op to defeat wave after wave of enemies and protect three regions. While fun and replayable, Survival has no plot; consequently, if some narrative drive is what someone is seeking, they will need to check out Story. This mode features 10 arcs that are split into three chapters each, and they tell fairly self-contained tales that are similar to
  <em>
   GoT
  </em>
  's side quests, albeit with a supernatural twist. Although not amazing, the stories are relatively fun and do not overstay their welcome.

  The
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  games are always reliable options when it comes to lighthearted co-op games, and
  <em>
   The Skywalker Saga
  </em>
  is a contender for the best in the franchise. Covering all nine main movies, the campaign is chock-full of content, Easter eggs, and unlockable characters. Die-hard
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  fans should get a kick out of seeing this humorous but still quite authentic adaptation; conversely, people who are not that into the sci-fi property should still find something to enjoy in this gorgeous adventure.

  <em>
   Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga
  </em>
  handles local co-op in largely the same way as other
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  games, permitting friends to go along for the ride without impacting much of the story. Online co-op is not supported, so this is just for those looking to take on the Empire from the comfort of a single couch.

  As part of the "Ascension" update,
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  added co-op, permitting up to two players to combine forces. Only online co-op is supported, and the feature is activated once someone dies for the first time. After that point, that person will be able to host a public or private session from Selene's crash site; alternatively, they can join a cycle. Co-op does not significantly change the
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  experience, although the game's difficulty is ramped up to make up for the fact there are two Selenes.

  Gearbox's
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  has been delivering fun co-op first-person shooter mayhem for over a decade, and all the entries are a blast in their own right. The first entry to debut directly on the PS5,
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  is a spin-off that builds upon the ideas of
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep
  </em>
  , a
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  DLC. Set within the world of a tabletop game, players create a character and then go on a comical adventure to stop the Dragon Lord.

 <p>
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  has awesome gunplay, comfortably the best in the series so far. The story does not take itself all that seriously, and while the humor is hit-and-miss, the spin-off is more consistently charming than some of the franchise's recent main entries. The overall narrative is rather forgettable, but the minute-to-minute writing is generally solid. This is an easy recommendation for fans of
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  or anyone looking for a lighthearted FPS set in a fantastical universe.

  's implementation of 8-player co-op is unique as well, with the group voting to determine each character's actions.

  Roughly a month after coming out on PC,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  made its way to the PS5, and Larian's project survived the transition in one piece. Based on
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  , the RPG delivers in nearly every area, be it combat, customization, storytelling, or co-op support. The latter highlights
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's tabletop origins since players can set up a co-op campaign save file that they revisit as a group; obviously, this can be quite a commitment, so the game also offers new players the chance to join existing playthroughs.

 <p>
  Set in a vast and complex world, Larian created a deep RPG that emphasizes player choice, particularly in its secondary content. The turn-based combat system can be initially overwhelming if someone is not familiar with the studio's previous releases, but it is rewarding in the long run. In co-op, players are allowed and even encouraged to do their own thing and decide when they want to come together.

  If horror is a group's genre of choice, then they cannot go wrong when it comes to Supermassive Games. The developer has carved out a niche for itself in the co-op interactive drama market, with
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  chapters all being dependable picks. 2022's
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  is another feather in the studio's cap, and it supports up to 8 players in both local and online co-op.

  An ode to 1980s slashers,
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  wears its inspiration on its sleeve. As tends to be the case with these sorts of stories, the game finds a group of teenagers heading out to the eponymous location with plans to spend the night. Things quickly go wrong, and one of them might be responsible for the mayhem. Depending on how many people are playing the game,
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  could just assign a single character to every player, which will force everyone to decide whether they will prioritize self-preservation over what is good for the collective.

  Developed by Hazelight Studios, a company whose primary focus is co-op experiences,
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  is a deeply emotional story of a little girl coping with her parents' divorce by playing with hand-made rag dolls that resemble her mom and dad. The girl's tears falling on the dolls trap her parents' souls inside the toys, and they become the two-player characters.

 <p>
  Players will have to travel through magical realms that are a reflection of the parents' positive memories of one another. By solving environmental puzzles and completing platforming challenges, they attempt to mend their broken relationship and get back into their own bodies. From the gameplay perspective, it's a fun, challenging platformer that relies heavily on cooperation between players. However, it is its creative, unique narrative that makes this game a truly essential title to play on the PS5.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Tales of the Shire
   </strong>
  </em>
  is honed in on the ultimate goal of any town simulator, creating the coziest vibe possible for every player. Considering the game's connection to
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , many fans have clamored for any number of iconic characters to make an appearance. However, there's one slightly less renowned character who could fit right into this earthy town simulator.

 <p>
  One of the Shire's most defining characteristics is its isolation. As a consequence of this, very few characters from
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  have any meaningful connection to the home of the Hobbits. This fact runs in direct contrast with player demands to encounter and interact with their old favorites. Thankfully, one character who's already made it in may provide a path to another perfect inclusion.

  Tales of the Shire Has Limited Options for Popular Characters
 </h3>
 <p>
  The simple fact is that many of the most popular characters from
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  have little reason to appear in a game like
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  . Many of them, such as Aragorn and Legolas, are warriors who wouldn't match the cozy tone the game is seemingly going for. The Shire is home to Hobbits like Frodo and Bilbo, and it's reasonable enough to assume they may make an appearance. However,
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  needs more variety than the folks that already live there.

 <p>
  Fortunately for players and developers alike, the setting does happen to have an ace up its sleeve, and that's Radagast the Brown. Gandalf the Grey is perhaps the most iconic character in all of Tolkien's many works. Gandalf has always held an appreciation for Hobbits and their way of life, thanks to his close friend Bilbo Baggins. Aside from its residents, Gandalf is certainly the character with the strongest connection to the Shire. Players wouldn't want Gandalf to get lonely, and another of his closest friends has the perfect down-to-earth vibe for
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  .

  Radagast the Brown Should Join Gandalf in Tales of the Shire
 </h3>
 <p>
  Gandalf is only one member of an order of wizards originally led by Saruman the White. Among the ranks of these powerful protectors of Middle-earth is Radagast the Brown, perhaps the most mellow and innocent member by far. While his role in Tolkien's original writings may have been relatively small, Radagast was made a much more significant character in the film adaptation of
  <em>
   The Hobbit
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  First introduced in
  <em>
   The Hobbit
  </em>
  as a dear friend of his fellow wizard, Radagast's greatest weakness is also his greatest strength. Radagast is honest to a fault and perhaps a little simple-minded, qualities that earned him Saruman's contempt and Gandalf's sincere affection. More importantly, they are some of the qualities that would give Radagast a unique role in
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Moreover, Radagast has a deep love of the natural world, and especially the wild animals that inhabit it. As a town simulator of sorts,
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  promises to let players tend to their own idyllic estate within the titular town. Even if Radagast doesn't have the same deeply rooted connection to the Shire that Gandalf does, there are few characters more well-suited to the Hobbit lifestyle. Radagast is extremely knowledgeable about cultivating gardens, and could even lend a whole host of collectible critters.

 <p>
  In terms of personality, Radagast does share some of the best traits of Hobbits, though he's a far cry from their worst. Hobbits may be peaceful and honest, but they can also be prone to backhanded gossip. Radagast would never stoop to that kind of behavior, but this contrast only serves to make him more promising.
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  could use more characters to accompany Gandalf. From his wealth of knowledge about the natural world to his easygoing personality, Radagast has it all.

  Each and every zone within Khaz Algar takes you deeper below the surface of Azeroth in
  <strong>
   <em>
    World of Warcraft: The War Within
   </em>
  </strong>
  . At the very depths of Khaz Algar, you will find the dark and foreboding kingdom of the Nerubians: Azj-Kahet. Danger lurks around every corner, but there are plenty of rewards for those who can brave the terrors of Azj-Kahet.

  For players hunting the Skyriding Glyphs, this is their last stop. There are 11 Skyriding Glyphs that are well hidden across the zone, and if you manage to find them all you will get an achievement (and mount if you have found all the other Skyriding Glyphs up to this point). Some of the Skyriding Glyphs can be tricky to find, but here is where they can all be found.

  Players participating in the closed alpha test of Valve's upcoming MOBA,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deadlock
   </em>
  </strong>
  , are reportedly already encountering cheaters within the unreleased game. The highly-anticipated new title from Valve has seen plenty of buzz revolving around the game's early testing period, even before the new MOBA's official reveal.
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  was already seeing player counts above 10,000 in the early testing phases before Valve had officially announced the new hybrid of third-person shooters and MOBAs. Now, the game is having issues with players cheating in the alpha test.

 <p>
  Valve's newest IP was already a topic of discussion even before the developer officially revealed its next title late last week. Rumors and leaks had swirled around the new Valve game, said to feature a unique cross between shooters and MOBAs, and many fans noticed the game ramping up its testing earlier this month. Valve would finally officially announce
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  , with the Steam page for the game's early test version going live on Friday. However, fans playing in the game's closed alpha are reporting early issues with in-game cheaters.

  Valve's Deadlock Already Reporting In-Game Cheaters
 </h2>
 <p>
  As reported by Dexerto,
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  's closed alpha has become the victim of cheaters making their way into the game's testing period. Valve has already made a statement to the game's testing community, encouraging players to report in-game cheating with the studio working on "larger anti-cheat systems." While Valve did not confirm any specific cheats being used, fans have speculated that
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  may fall victim to similar styles of cheats to
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  , including aimbots and wall hacks. Access to
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  is currently limited to players being invited by friends who are already participating in the closed alpha.

 <p>
  The early cheating issues in
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  should be nothing new to Valve, with the company often dealing with cheaters in its other competitive games. Games like
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Counter Strike: Global Offensive
  </em>
  are notorious for cheaters abusing third-party software to gain an unfair advantage, with Valve often taking sweeping action against cheaters.
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  is said to use Valve's proprietary "Valve Anti-Cheat" software for its in-game cheat prevention, with many fans suggesting the service is insufficient at combating cheaters in Valve's other games.

 <p>
  While cheating is now believed to be an issue in
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  's testing period, the game's hype shows no signs of slowing down. Just days ahead of the game's official announcement,
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  boasted a higher player count than
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , with more than 40,000 players in the closed alpha test. Valve also recently allowed footage from the game's closed alpha to be shared publicly, giving fans their first look at the upcoming MOBA. With plenty of eyes on the game,
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  is set to make a major splash when it finally fully launches.

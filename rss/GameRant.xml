      <title>6 Best Games With Healthy Polyamorous Dating Options</title>

 <p>
  As romanceable characters become increasingly well-written, diverse, charming (and exceedingly attractive in high-quality cutscenes), monogamous and polyamorous gamers find common ground by wishing they could court more characters simultaneously. Dating several characters might be purely practical for players who lack time for several playthroughs to uncover every line of romantic dialogue or judge which love interest benefits gameplay most. But for polyamorous people who actually date multiple partners in healthy, consensual relationships, non-monogamous romance options in gaming reflect their real-life experiences.

 <p>
  Importantly, polyamory in video games should not be confused with non-consensual infidelity; for example, romances in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  are not ‘polyamorous’ because the player must date multiple people secretly or risk love interests feeling betrayed and deceived. To be ethically polyamorous means dating people who give informed consent to sharing their partner romantically.
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  were praised for relationships with multiple NPCs (with in-game incentives of increased resources for each spouse), but are these characters genuinely, happily polyamorous? Underwhelming portrayals of polyamory feature NPCs who are oblivious that the player is courting others or who lack the detailed coding and characterization to have nuanced reactions to non-monogamy. The best depictions of polyamory in gaming aren’t about harvesting NPCs’ hearts in exchange for in-game benefits, but about crafting meaningful, deep romances that all characters enthusiastically consent to.

  In the successful farming simulator
  <em>
   Stardew Valley,
  </em>
  players were torn between romancing numerous endearing villagers and choosing one main partner,
  <em>
  </em>
  but gamers need not make this agonizing final choice in
  <em>
   Verdant Skies
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pumpkin Days
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Verdant Skies
  </em>
  is a colony-building game with all the essential ingredients of farming, hunting, and seducing multiple love interests. Seven characters will happily engage in non-exclusive relationships and dating all seven lovers simultaneously is rewarded with the Colony Charmer achievement. However, polyamorous players cannot be married, nor can they have babies.

 <p>
  Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Pumpkin Days
  </em>
  offers 100 dateable characters and a marriage of up to three partners in one wedding ceremony. Players can have a maximum of eight children, but it may not be possible to have children with many different parents. Positive representations of polyamory can be undermined if life sims heavily restrict marriages or forbid having children with multiple partners. Unfortunately, wholesome portrayals of children being raised in healthy, polyamorous households are relatively non-existent in gaming.

  From 100 Baby Challenges and beyond, Simmers have always bent the rules of monogamy in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Up until 2024, Sims who “cheated” by dating more than one Sim were met with a rapid face slap (in
  <em>
   The Sims 2
  </em>
  fashion), trash can kicking, and newspaper thefts. However,
  <em>
   new features from The Sims 4 Lovestruck
  </em>
  expansion pack
  <em>
  </em>
  reinvented relationship structures in the franchise, facilitating non-monogamous relationships (and serial daters, for those who need 100 baby daddies).

 <p>
  With newly introduced customizable relationship boundaries, players can adjust whether Sims experience jealousy over non-physical, physical, or sexual romantic interactions and can opt into jealous tendencies that can be altered through healthy conversations.
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  still lacks unique animations for multiple partners who want to cuddle, kiss, hold hands, or sleep in bed all at the same time. However, these changes are a huge first step for EA to accommodate diverse sexualities beyond the cultural mainstream and acknowledge that polyamory shouldn't be a taboo, X-rated feature.

  Conceptually,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Waylanders
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most ambitious, lesser-known RPGs with polyamorous dating options. Set in a mythical kingdom modeled on ancient Europe, players immerse themselves in Celtic mythology while warring for the throne. Players encounter a variety of romanceable characters, who may be monogamous, polyamorous, simply not interested, or crushing elsewhere. To add to the complexities, players unexpectedly time travel back and forth hundreds of years between the Dark Ages and Medieval Spain, causing mayhem in all aspects of civilian life, including romantic connections.

 <p>
  Many mortal love interests will have perished and reincarnated, retaining their souls but reappearing with new genders, personalities, cultures, and experiences, forcing protagonists to court them from scratch. Immortal lovers will remember time-traveling players but maybe rightly miffed about centuries of romantic absence. Poly and queer relationships are perceived differently when shifting between sexually progressive ancient Celtics to Catholic Spaniards.
  <em>
   The Waylanders
  </em>
  has been criticized for bugs and underdevelopment, attributed to the hugely ambitious gameplay that GATO Studios aspired towards. However, the exciting complexities of their queer and poly dynamics mixed with chaotic time travel make
  <em>
   The Waylanders
  </em>
  an intriguing choice for exploring polyamorous dating in gaming.

  The merits of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur’s Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  are plentiful, but praise is especially due to how this 2023 turn-based fantasy RPG celebrates consent-focused polyamorous romance options.
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  recreates the joy of tabletop 5th Edition
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  , with incredible freedom of choice with character designs, builds, and party compositions; the romance options are just as nuanced, with diverse combinations for healthy relationships. While many characters choose to be monogamous,
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  offers players the choice to date multiple companions in a harmonious way.

  The game champions Archdruid, Halsin, who is mindful of only pursuing romance with the player if their pre-existing lovers consent to his presence and participation. While Shadowheart and Astarion enthusiastically consent to the player’s courtship with Halsin, Karlach’s permission is laced with fear of losing the player; she requests a “don’t ask, don’t tell” situation that is valid within polyamorous relationships, but from Act 2 onwards Karlach is most comfortable in a monogamous relationship. Other characters including the Emperor, Minthara, and the Drow Twins welcome open relationships, but resentment towards Minthara results in Halsin, Will, and Karlach declining polyamorous scenarios with her, again demonstrating that healthy polyamorous depictions include the right to opt out.

  Polyamory in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pathfinder: Kingmaker
   </em>
  </strong>
  is much more nuanced, flawed, and compelling than harvesting the hearts of nonchalant NPCs who don’t interact with one another. In this 2018 isometric realm-building RPG, players are invited to join a pre-established couple, Octavia and Regongar, who became trauma-bonded after being enslaved together. Their upsetting history is the root of many issues, as Regongar struggles with insecurities and self-harm, while strong-willed Octavia fears commitment after her imprisonment. Thankfully, polyamory isn’t treated as a magical cure to solve their problems, nor is polyamory blamed for their tension; the game acknowledges that all relationships are complicated and flawed and require open communication to thrive.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pathfinder: Kingmaker
  </em>
  excels in enabling players to consent to each stage of transitioning into an equal, loving partner in the triad, as Regongar and Octavia often ask for the protagonist’s permission to proceed romantically. Regongar and Octavia both actively, and vocally consent to dating others, and the player is given countless opportunities to set their own boundaries and choose whether they feel jealousy when Octavia flirts with strangers, which either generates conflict or is readily respected. Unfortunately, this codependent couple will canonically die if players separate them by dating one half only. This places great culpability on players to nurture the triad, while applying negative connotations that polyamory is a coping mechanism or that monogamy should be discouraged. The complicated example of polyamory in
  <em>
   Pathfinder: Kingmaker
  </em>
  is as progressive as it is problematic; it cannot be upheld as a perfect role model for healthy functioning polyamorous relationships, but it remains one of the most detailed and consent-focused polyamorous dating options in gaming.

  Non-conventional to its core, roguelike RPG
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hades
   </em>
  </strong>
  defies tradition wherever possible. Not only does
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  reward players for dying, but Zagreus derives masochistic pleasure from his battles, deaths, and relationships; his courtship with sadistic repeat boss, Megaera, thrives when she flirtatiously threatens Zagreus with her “painful” whip to his delight. Zagreus can simultaneously romance Thanatos, the personification of Death, with no negative repercussions.

  While protagonists in other games (such as
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  ) would be rejected or attacked by love interests for their infidelity, Hades takes a uniquely unexpected route. When Megaera and Thanatos confront Zagreus for romancing them both, they are not jealous or competitive. Instead, they seductively offer intimacy as a triad, initiating a polyamorous relationship if Zagreus consents. Unlike games that dabble unethically and non-consensually in courting multiple lovers,
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  makes it clear that all parties must consent to a poly situation; Megaera reassures Zagreus that they won’t “cling to each other viciously” as mortals might, and he is free to date anyone else. The game’s sequel,
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  , has been in early access since May 2024, but players hope that new protagonist Melinoe will also consensually explore queer, polyamorous relationships with as many love interests as she pleases.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Splitgate 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the highly anticipated sequel to the portal-powered shooter that took the gaming world by storm, is set to launch sometime in 2025. Announced on July 18, this free-to-play 4v4 title from 1047 Games aims to build upon the original’s success. Although the first game found a receptive audience when it launched in 2019, it wasn’t until
  <em>
   Splitgate
  </em>
  's viral console release in 2021 that it truly captured the gaming spotlight. With its signature physics-based mechanics and addictive multiplayer,
  <em>
   Splitgate 2
  </em>
  is poised to be a thrilling sequel that feels nostalgically familiar.

  <em>
   Splitgate
  </em>
  and CEO of 1047, who shared insights into the game's development journey, how they’re building on the foundation of the first game, and details about upcoming features.

  Personally, I am very happy with the crouch sliding! When I go back to play the original
  <em>
   Splitgate
  </em>
  , it definitely feels amiss. My team and I carefully analyzed crouch sliding in games like
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  to really nail our version.

  I think a great moment stemmed from participating in weekly playtests in the studio. While the design team conducts them daily, not everyone else does. After each playtest, we conducted surveys asking questions like "Did you have fun?" or "Did you want to keep playing?" Our ultimate goal was to create a game that was undeniably better than the first. Early on, without animations or sound, it was difficult to gauge our progress. Last November, we had a pivotal moment when the team unanimously agreed, "Yes, we've surpassed the first
  <em>
   Splitgate
  </em>
  . This is it."

  Hmm, not in particular. At the end of the day, we wanted every button press to be fun. For example, when a player reloads, they might see a cool spin or a satisfying visual effect as they insert a mag. On the other hand, we found that EMP grenades weren't fun. Tossing a grenade at a wall only for the enemy to open a new portal a few seconds later didn't feel like a great use of a player's time.

  I probably shouldn't say too much now, as it might be a bit of a spoiler. I will say, in a lot of video games, characters die and respawn without any explanation. This concept is going to be explored in a future cinematic, but I can't provide any details at the moment.

  I hope no faction will be overwhelmingly dominant, but it's possible that may still happen. Strategy will be crucial, especially since players can't switch Factions until the end of a round. While you can adjust your loadout after each death, choosing between Aeros, Meridian, or Sabrask is fixed until the next round.

 <p>
  This means you might strategize based on the previous round, such as deciding, "The enemy team was all Sabrask last round. What if we all go Aeros this time?" Of course, when professional players have tested the game, they've indicated that it's best to have at least one of every Faction on the team.

  offered players five new endgame bosses, including Grigoire, the Galvanic Saint. These bosses provide a challenge for late game players, and drop generous rewards. To fight them, it is necessary to reach a certain World Tier and collect summoning materials, which are then sacrificed at an altar.

  How To Summon Tormented Grigoire

  The Tormented version of Grigoire is a much more powerful boss (level 200), but is summoned nearly identically to the base version. Simply use some extra materials in the same location. Players will need to take 15 Living Steel and two

  Tips For Fighting Grigoire, The Galvanic Saint

 <p>
  Each endgame boss has an element that its damage primarily consists of. Grigoire's is Lightning. Therefore, players can boost their chances of surviving the boss' attacks by drinking an Elixir of Lightning Resistance or Socketing Topaz gems into their Jewelry.

  Players can get this item from
  <strong>
   Tortured Gifts of Living Steel
  </strong>
  , which appear during Helltides and cost 300 Aberrant Cinders. This currency is quite easy to get since it drops from enemies that appear during the event, and therefore does not need to be farmed separately. Usually, players will encounter enemies a little stronger than the typical elite, but it still won't be as difficult as a boss battle. Helltides run almost constantly in World Tiers 3 and 4.

 <p>
  If fans have trouble finding a chest, they should visit a website called D4Armory. There they will find an interactive map with the location of Living Steel chests. There is also information about the respawn timers of Bosses, Legions, and Helltides. With this information, players will be able to farm any of the game's endgame activities.

  A recent
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has revealed details about how the Artifact Selector will work in Version 5.0, including the most optimal way to feed the gadget with discarded Artifacts. While randomness and chance have always played a part in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , on account of it being a gacha game, many players find its role in Artifact farming to be needlessly excessive. A wide array of factors separates a desirable Artifact from a worthless one, and the odds are deliberately stacked against the player.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  continues to add new Artifact Sets to accommodate its ever-growing roster of characters, it also perpetuates an endless cycle of what the community now views as a bothersome grind. Each Artifact Domain has two different sets that can drop, and each Artifact Set is made up of five pieces in total. Not all attributes are created equal, and obtaining a Goblet from a desired set with a desired main stat can often take weeks of farming.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":960} -->

 <p>
  To solve this issue, the developers are planning to introduce an Artifact Selector as a quality-of-life feature for
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.0. This gadget will allow players to not only create a 5-Star Artifact on their own, but also pick its set, type, main stat, and two secondary stats. However, there is a catch. The Artifact Selector can only be used to craft one Artifact from a particular set every two weeks and requires a Sanctifying Elixir to be used. The details and number-crunching for this system were revealed by HomDGCat and shared on the Genshin Impact Leaks subreddit.

  In order to create an Artifact using the new gadget, players must first obtain a Sanctifying Elixir. The paid Battle Pass in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  will provide one Sanctifying Elixir on its own, but there will also be a way to reliably craft Elixirs without needing to spend any money – by consuming leveled Artifacts that the player no longer needs or has chosen to discard. Different pieces of an Artifact Set will require a different number of Sanctifying Elixirs, with Goblets being the most expensive.

 <p>
  When converted to raw experience, the most efficient way to create a Sanctifying Elixir in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  would be to exclusively feed it with Artifacts that are Level 4, as the percentage-to-experience ratio for fully leveled Artifacts is more than halved. With Version 5.0 introducing three new characters to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , players will no doubt be busy farming Artifacts in the new Natlan domain. While it remains to be seen if the new Artifact Selector gadget will yield satisfying results, it is certainly the biggest effort that the developers have made in addressing the grind.

  The Druid is one of the most versatile classes in the
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  universe and can take on any role in the party depending on their build.
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  uses the 5e rules from the popular TTRPG when building a Druid, but one difference is the choice of Circles, the Druid sub-classes that determine the details about their skills and abilities.

  The Circle of the Moon is one of three Druid Circles players can choose from when building their guardian of nature in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  . This is mostly a DPS melee build with some spell abilities, and players can decide whether that's for support, healing, or additional damage.

Players who want to experiment with the class before committing to their own character can experiment with Halsin, but his story isn't available as an Origin character.

  Druids of every Circle often have different roles in the party, and a melee fighter might decide that Strength is more important than Dexterity. Remember that Wisdom is always the Druid's spellcasting modifier.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Strength.
   </strong>
   An important factor for defender classes, this stat is of medium importance to the Moon Druid, who is more often in a damage role.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Dexterity.
   </strong>
   The second most important score for the Moon Druid. Dexterity determines weapon proficiency level and dodge ability.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Constitution.
   </strong>
   More Dexterity means that this Druid can dodge hits instead of taking them, but keep in mind that any character in melee damage needs more hit points and resilience.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Intelligence.
   </strong>
   Possibly the only "dump stat" for any Druid, it's not important for spellcasting or melee-weapon damage in this case.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Wisdom.
   </strong>
   The Druid's spellcasting modifier and most important Ability Score. It's also handy for Perception checks.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Charisma.
   </strong>
   A Druid is often less polished than other classes, such as Paladins or Wizards, but Druids can also be leaders and folk heroes, so this score can end up anywhere.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Ability Score Improvement.
   </strong>
   Great for any class, this gives the character +2 to one ability score or +1 to two of them.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Athlete.
   </strong>
   Increase Strength or Dexterity by +1, longer Jump distance, and faster recovery from the Prone condition.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Mobile.
   </strong>
   Movement speed increases by 10 feet, Dash is unaffected by Difficult Terrain, and movement in melee combat doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Savage Attacker.
   </strong>
   Roll two dice for melee damage and choose the higher result. Essential for close-range fighters.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Sentinel.
   </strong>
   This Feat gives the Druid Advantage for Opportunity Attacks, against them or an ally, and should they hit, the target is rendered immobile for the rest of their turn.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    War Caster.
   </strong>
   Gives the Druid an Advantage on Concentration Saving Throws and the use of Shocking Grasp for Attacks of Opportunity in melee range.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set to be one of the biggest releases next year, and there is still a thick cloud of mystery surrounding the Rockstar title. An announcement trailer and loads of speculation has helped shed light on what could be in store for
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , but one of the biggest questions revolves around a potential online mode.

  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  launched a month after
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  , and the former has managed to become just as, if not more, popular.
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  is a completely different way to experience the city of Los Santos, and many are hoping that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's Vice City gets the same treatment. There is no telling what a potential online
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  could hold, but the mode could find an unlikely source of inspiration in
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  . One of the biggest
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games is the fashion show-focused
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  should consider featuring its own counterpart. In
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  , players go up against one another in a themed fashion showdown, where players vote for a winner, which is a concept
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  could have a lot of fun with.

  Bringing the Extravagance of Vice City to Life
 </h3>
 <p>
  If an online version of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  becomes a reality, the hedonism of Vice City will likely be put on full display. From the nightlife to the antics of the Thrillbilly Mud Club, the world of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is promising plenty of debauchery and extravagance. For an online counterpart, bringing an expensive fashion show into the mix could be a strong way to further illustrate the excessive nature of Vice City.

 <p>
  In a place like Vice City, everything is superficial, and a high-end fashion show could bring that to new heights. Much of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  may be secretive, but the announcement trailer has made it clear that concern over public image is going to be a theme that is explored. Glimpses of the game have shown that social media will play a big role in
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , so it's natural to assume that this will be a major part of the overall story. Where there is social media, there is public pressure to make sure one is looking perfect at all times. This could easily go in line with a fashion show mini-game in an online
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Also,
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  has always gone heavy on social commentary through charmingly crass and outlandish humor, so seeing its approach to a fashion show would be fascinating. An online
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  will have its work cut out for it if it wants to beat the success of its predecessor, and clever mini-games could be the key to making that happen.

 <p>
  One of the biggest questions at the moment is about how
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  will improve upon such a successful franchise. The game's Bonnie and Clyde approach is a fascinating angle, and many are eager to learn more about how this will play out in the game's story. Furthermore, the lack of confirmation surrounding features like an online mode has some eager fans feeling antsy. The first and only trailer so far brought forth a cinematic sneak peek that quickly racked up millions of views, and there will hopefully be more on the horizon soon.

  If
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  manages to hit its 2025 target, there will likely be news of an online mode ahead of release. As the wait continues, only time will tell if
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  online becomes a reality. If it does, though, looking to unexpected games like
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  could bring a fresh spin to the Rockstar franchise's online gameplay.

  This first path is pretty easy to get through. If you haven't glided before in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , it's actually pretty simple. You just need to summon a bird Echo, like the Crow, and then grab it before it flies away. Once you have a hold on it, walk off the edge of the cliff and just move the control stick to control the direction.

  You need to make it to the end of the path's flag on the left, so just keep getting some air by hovering over the wind spots. You shouldn't need to get close to the fire monsters crawling on the wall either.

  The strategy will be similar to the first glide path: to stay as high up in the air as possible while going to the left. Remember that you can stay on top of the updrafts for as long as you want. So, if you need to wait for the hot air to stop coming out of the walls on the left side, you can chill for a second.

  A new
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  leak reveals a game-changing quality-of-life feature coming in Version 5.2 that will let players achieve full exploration in every region. The
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  open-world map has gotten significantly bigger since the game's release and fans have long asked for better tools to make exploration less time-consuming.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Chests in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  are a valuable source of easy Primogems, so players are constantly on the lookout for Luxurious and Precious Chests while exploring a new region. Natlan's Luxurious Chests are particularly rewarding since
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.0 greatly increased the amount of Primogems obtained from Shrines of Depths and other hard-to-find Chests. To easily find Chests, players use Treasure Compasses. In its 4.6 update,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  gave Treasure Compasses a major upgrade by marking the location of Chests on the map. Before this feature, players had to repeatedly activate the Treasure Compass for every Chest, making the exploration process quite tedious. Now, these tools are getting an even bigger upgrade that many fans will find very useful.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1099} -->

 <p>
  According to a leak shared by Blednaya, Treasure Compasses will reveal the location of Seelies and Timed Challenges on the map starting in Version 5.2. As with Chests, the compass will show an icon on the map to point players in the right direction. This feature will be very helpful for completing achievements that require finding a fixed number of Seelies and Challenges. There are rumors that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  5.2 will expand Natlan's map, so this Treasure Compass update could not arrive at a better time.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , exploration can be a player's primary source of Primogems, especially for free-to-play fans. Similarly, completionist players often attempt to achieve 100% exploration in every region for fun. However,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  marks a region as 100% explored even when there are still some Chests, Seelies, and Challenges available. Though it is unlikely that HoYoverse will change this issue, an improved Treasure Compass could still prove useful for Primogem farming.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is introducing Chasca and Ororon in Version 5.2, so fans will need plenty of Primogems to pull for their preferred character.

 <p>
  Recently,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  debuted Xilonen, a 5-star Geo unit that has quickly become a fan-favorite for her kit. Xilonen can easily reduce enemies' resistance, making her a great support in multiple team combinations. She also plays a key role in the latest Archon Quest, which ended in a cliffhanger surrounding The Captain's next move.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans will have to wait for Version 5.2 to see how the Natlan storyline ends.

  Blizzard Entertainment has unveiled everything new coming to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  as part of Season 13, which is set to begin next week. Despite the new season not adding a new hero to the game's massive roster,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  still has a ton in store for players who are fans of spooky season.

 <p>
  Halloween is typically a big time of year for
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  , as many players return to the game for its beloved Halloween Terror game modes, which include the popular Junkenstein's Revenge co-op mode that kicked it all off in the original
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  . A year ago,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  leaned into the Halloween fanfare with its horror-themed battle pass, which included Widowmaker's Ghostly Bride skin, Illari's Night Raven skin, and was headlined by Hanzo's mythic Onryo skin. Season 7 was also home to a
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  crossover, which brought a Lilith skin for Moira.

  This year,

  <em>

  </em>
  unveiled Season 13: Spellbinder, set to go live on October 15. This wicked new season will be headlined by
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  's iconic sniper Widowmaker, who is receiving the mythic skin treatment with Spellbinder Widowmaker, a steampunk-inspired witch skin. Widowmaker was just recently the subject of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's massive crossover with
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  for its 30th anniversary, where she became the elf ranger Sylvanas. Now, she'll finally join other beloved heroes like Mercy and Kiriko in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's coven of witches.

 <p>
  Despite the classic
  <em>
   Overwatch

  sniper finally getting the mythic treatment, some Tank players feel slighted, as only three tank heroes have ever headlined a season with a mythic skin, the latest of which was Orisa, who got her mythic as part of Season 8 almost a year ago. With that said, there's still plenty more for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players to be excited about. Namely, the return of Halloween Terror, which will add a new mode called Junkenstein's Laboratory that lets players upgrade their hero abilities. Reinhardt's Annihilation upgrade adds an explosive touch to his pin, Moira's Doppelganger multiplies her damage orbs, and Reaper's Soul Harvest gives him back his original ability, allowing him to pick up health from felled opponents.

  The new trailer also highlighted Dorado, Cicuit Royale, Numbani, and Havana as maps that are set to receive updates, but it's unclear whether these are temporary Halloween makeovers or permanent adjustments to their layouts. The very end of the trailer teased what's sure to be
  <em>

  </em>
  's next hero. In a room filled with purple shards and graffiti covering the walls, an unfamilair voice can be heard saying "It's looking like a revolution." It's possible that
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  may be gearing up for a new hero reveal and trial weekend going live sometime in November. Until then, fans can look forward to Season 13: Spellbinder on October 15, and

  collab, which fans should be able to expect to drop at some point during the season.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan recently uncovered a cut combat feature hidden away in the game’s files that would have allowed Spidey to perform double-finishers on enemies. The third installment of Insomniac’s comic book gaming series swung onto the PlayStation 5 late last year to near-universal acclaim, continuing the story and building off the already successful gameplay of its predecessors.
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  had two playable heroes in Peter Parker and Miles Morales, and tasked them both with defending the open-world setting of New York City from classic supervillains like Venom and Kraven the Hunter.

  Insomniac’s
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  games have always been rich with details and little gameplay flourishes, and
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  is no different. In the months since the game’s release, eagle-eyed players have searched New York City for hidden Easter Eggs and ties to other famous Marvel heroes, pointing out how Peter and Mary Jane wear matching outfits as a symbol of their love or locating a seemingly ordinary NPC that looks like
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  ’s version of the Chameleon. Some of these details go beyond the game’s programming, such as a hidden trophy room that suggests that the Rhino met a grizzly, offscreen end at the hands of Kraven.

 <p>
  Meanwhile, a Reddit user by the handle of TheEternalVortex recently chanced across some unused code that would have added double-finishers to
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  , allowing Peter or Miles to take down two enemies with a single button combination. They posted a video clip of this code in action to r/SpidermanPS4, with Peter using his webs to pull one criminal into another, taking out another pair with some well-timed kicks, and web-yanking a third pair into the pavement after an impressive flip.

  Cut features being found tucked away in games like Marvel’s
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  isn’t unheard of, as the developers sometimes have to hide an unused element within the game’s code due to not having enough time to remove it outright. Players in the comment section of TheEternalVortex have speculated on why Insomniac decided not to implement double finishers in
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  , with some of the theories being that it would have been too much of a hassle given the diverse range of enemies in the game or simple time constraints.

  Perhaps Insomniac could recycle these unused double finishers in
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  , which is already believed to be in pre-production. A ransomware attack late last year also unveiled some of Insomniac’s other future Marvel projects, like the previously confirmed
  <em>
   Marvel’s Wolverine
  </em>
  as well as Venom and X-Men games. Fans have also been anxiously waiting for Insomniac to announce some story DLC for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but nothing has been confirmed yet.

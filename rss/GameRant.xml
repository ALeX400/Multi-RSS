  As of the time of writing, no video game released in 2024 has managed to achieve a higher OpenCritic rating than
  <strong>
   <em>
    Astro Bot
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Team Asobi's charming yet challenging platformer proved to be a huge hit with both critics and players alike when it was released back in early September, which is perhaps why the news that
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  would be receiving a bunch of free DLC was met with such jubilation by the gaming community.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  DLC will consist of five speedrun stages, each of which contains two new VIP bots. The September State of Play trailer revealed that Eve from
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  squad would be among them, but the rest of the cameo characters remain a mystery at this point in time. For those looking forward to finding out and checking out the new challenge stages for themselves, the following
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  DLC release schedule should prove useful.

  speedrun stages will be released weekly between October 17 and November 14, going live

  DLC will drop at the same time for everyone, so release times for those in other regions will vary (see below).

  <strong>
   Nintendo of America
  </strong>
  is hiring an intellectual property lawyer to help negotiate and resolve IP disputes. Big game studios are no strangers to legal trouble, especially when it comes to defending their copyrighted material. Nintendo is particularly infamous for hunting down cases of copyright infringement, and it seems it won't reverse that trend anytime soon.

 <p>
  Anyone involved in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan-created game space or who's emulated old N64 titles is likely familiar with the House of
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  's aggressive legal stance. Over the years, Nintendo has issued DMCA notices to take down content and sued many sites and users for copyright or patent infringement. Now, to no one's surprise, it's continuing that tradition by posting a job posting for legal counsel for its Intellectual Property Group.

 <p>
  The info was shared by fan account Nintendeal on Twitter on October 14. A screenshot of the job listing shows Nintendo is looking for a member of the Washington State Bar Association with at least five years of experience to join the department dedicated to protecting its IPs. That includes managing the outbound copyright infringement cases the company is famous for and protecting the business from any incoming legal disputes. It also covers the far less dramatic processes of conducting in-house training and handling licensing concerns.

 <p>
  The news of the job opening comes right at the heels of several IP-related concerns for the Big N. A rumored multiplayer
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game just leaked online, revealing a slew of private company resources, both new and old. Nintendo has also had ongoing issues with the growing emulator space. As emulators have become increasingly common, the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  -maker has not backed down from its efforts in trying to take down the site distributing ROMs of its games.

  Nintendo Has a Complicated History of Legal Action
 </h2>
 <p>
  It's unclear at this point if the new intellectual property counsel role is related to a plan to ramp up lawsuits amid growing emulation and leak concerns. However, that wouldn't be a stretch to imagine, considering the company's history of legal battles. Just recently, Nintendo sued a modding business, citing piracy laws. It's even gone so far as to take down live streams and videos of its games in the past, calling them unlawful use of their trademarked material. Not every case has worked out in Nintendo's favor, but many of them have, leaving the developer little reason to stop, outside its reputation with gamers.

  The role could also be to help with larger lawsuits. In September, Nintendo filed a suit against
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  over the perceived similarities between the title and
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  . Hiring a new lawyer could be a move to improve its standings in that case. Whatever the reasoning may be, the position is still open for now, so how Nintendo uses its expanded legal team has yet to be seen.

  Activision has confirmed it will be stopping sales and offering refunds for its upcoming shooter,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , in Kuwait. While
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is just a matter of days away from releasing, the highly-anticipated title has not been approved for release within the country, leading Activision to halt sales and refund all players who had already pre-ordered a copy of the game.

  After two years of new
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  games, developer Treyarch Studios is gearing up for the release of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  on October 25. While the last entry in the series took place during the Cold War,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  will take players on another undercover operation, this time during the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991. For multiplayer fans, there's a whole new omnidirectional movement system that is set to change
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  in a drastic way, while Zombies fans will finally be able to return to the good old days as two round-based maps will be available at launch.

 <p>
  While the launch of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  is just a few days away, Activision has now confirmed in a new statement (via CharlieIntel) that the game will be unavailable in the country of Kuwait. According to the studio, the shooter "has not been approved for release" and will therefore not be sold within the region. It's not clear exactly why the country denied the release of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , but Activision has said that all pre-orders within the region will now be canceled and refunded to the original point of purchase. Although the title won't be available in Kuwait at launch, Activision says it "remains hopeful" that the relevant authorities will reconsider the decision in the future.

  from releasing in the country is unconfirmed, it is speculated that

  's Gulf War setting is the driving force behind the sudden disapproval.
  <em>

  takes place in 1991, just one year after the beginning of the Gulf War, which was sparked after Iraq invaded Kuwait.

      <title>Roblox: Titan Wars Tower Defense Codes (October 2024)</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/roblox-titan-wars-tower-defense-codes/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Even though the recent Skibidi toilet trend has spawned many trivial games on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  servers,
  <em>
   Titan Wars Tower Defense
  </em>
  proves that not everything is so bad. Despite the controversial toilet theme of the game, the gameplay is built around the canonical tower defense system with gacha of unique Cameramen, whose improvement and defense of the fortress is quite good.

 <p>
  In addition,
  <em>
   Titan Wars Tower Defense
  </em>
  has plenty of unique units, and if
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  players want to get them as quickly as possible, unique codes will be helpful. Of course, the codes will not make you too strong, since they do not give you things you couldn't get by defeating several dozen waves of enemies. But, it is a great opportunity to make a couple of free rolls and get new units.

  Activision is taking the initiative to encourage fans to play
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  's campaign by offering free rewards for progressing through the story, which can be used across the game's Multiplayer and Zombies modes. The single-player mode in the past few installments of the franchise has drawn a lot of flak from the community for being subpar, but it seems like the developers are going the extra mile to improve

  </em>
  's campaign.

  In a new blog post, Activision reveals some interesting details about
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's campaign. The blog is the first of a two-part series that provides players with a thorough overview of what to expect from the campaign. One of the interesting details highlighted is that players will earn rewards in the Campaign that can be used for both Multiplayer and Zombies. The specific rewards aren't mentioned, but the blog states that players can obtain them by progressing through the story, upgrading their Black Ops Safehouse, and completing Calling Card Challenges.

  The rewards are not the only interesting aspect of the blog, as it has sparked fresh speculation in the community regarding Alex Mason's future.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 2
  </em>
  has multiple endings based on the choices players make. Depending on the decisions taken during the game, Alex Mason either survives or dies in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 2
  </em>
  . This has left a lot of ambiguity around his future in the franchise. In the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  story video, fans were quick to note that the developers used the cutscene in which Woods shoots Mason in the legs, as the headshot wound is missing. This has led many fans to believe that Mason might return in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  While this might raise the hopes of all Mason fans, the likelihood of him appearing in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  remains quite low. This is because the developers had previously stated that Mason is indeed dead in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . However, some fans also noted that since the tagline of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is "The Truth Lies," not everything the developers say should be taken at face value. Whatever the case is, it is less likely that such a significant part of the lore will be revealed anytime before the release of the game.

  Rogue Factor's upcoming action-adventure game
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hell is Us
   </em>
  </strong>
  , first announced back in 2022, was the subject of a substantial gameplay reveal during the most recent State of Play. This gameplay trailer gave audiences a good look at

 <p>
  Among
  <em>
   Hell is Us
  </em>
  ' most intriguing elements is its approach to exploration and non-linear gameplay. The game will apparently feature semi-open-world elements, as players will be tasked with exploring various biomes and completing side activities in addition to the core objectives of the single-player story. According to the game's Steam page, there will be no map markers, compasses, or similar hand-holding features available to players as they make their way through this semi-open-world, similar to other Soulslike and exploration-centric games of the past few years, which have stripped away these staples as a response to the box-ticking nature of so many AAA adventure titles. Learning from the likes of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  could help
  <em>
   Hell is Us
  </em>
  strike a good balance between engaging and accessible with its exploration.

  Ghost of Tsushima and Elden Ring Offer Good Open-World Compromises
 </h3>
 <p>
  On its face, a massive open-world game like
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  may not seem too different from the likes of
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  , or any other AAA franchise that is criticized for having big, boring maps to explore: it's full of copy-paste content, including repeated bosses and building archetypes like dungeons, and it uses rewards like gear to incentivize long-term discovery. However, it sets itself apart from the competition in a number of key ways, not the least of which being its stripping away of much-maligned features like waypoints and quest markers, which in turn makes exploration feel more organic and less like a rote task or chore.
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  is similarly stripped-back, though still more aligned with AAA gaming conventions in general.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":939} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  But both games have some concessions when it comes to organic exploration.
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's iconic guiding wind feature, which allows players to follow the direction that the wind blows in-game, is an example of this, but the game includes other immersive exploration aids as well, like birds and foxes that can be followed to points of interest. Fundamentally, these are the same as waypoints or map markers, but their unobtrusive nature makes them more engaging and a more seamless match for the sandbox.

 <p>
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Guidance of Grace serves a similar purpose. These wisps of light will point players in the direction of the next main story event, helping them stay on track without totally eliminating the sense of mystery that comes with exploring an unknown open world. Much like
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's exploration tools, Guidance of Grace serves to give players a helping hand while keeping exploration organic, immersive, and, most importantly, in the hands of the player.

  These Features Could Help Hell is Us, But Only If They Support a Strong Open World
 </h3>
 <p>
  It should go without saying that none of the aforementioned features, clever though they may be, are what make exploration in
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  so rewarding. Rather, they buttress open-world design that is already compelling. Maybe
  <em>
   Hell is Us
  </em>
  could adapt some of these features, using some in-world element to subtly guide players to their objectives, but interest-driven exploration would still need to be the priority. If
  <em>
   Hell is Us
  </em>
  can stick the landing with its uncanny and unsettling environment design, on a scale that lends itself to getting lost and forgiving detours, then it will have a good shot at delivering on its promise of "handhold-free" exploration while still being approachable and consistently enjoyable.

  The original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Virtua Fighter
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a pioneer in the fighting game genre. Developed by Sega AM2 and released exclusively for arcades in 1993, the title gained notoriety not only because of its intuitive gameplay, but also its visuals, which were considered realistic at the time.
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  may look rudimentary and basic by today's standards, but back then, it was revolutionary. Sega's renowned fighting game was the first in its genre to feature fully 3D polygonal graphics. This aspect of
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  was a major selling point, and ultimately contributed to the game becoming a worldwide phenomenon in the 90s.

  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  has spawned multiple sequels and spin-offs over the years, from 1994's
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter 2
  </em>
  all the way up to 2014's
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter: Fever Combo
  </em>
  . Unfortunately, though, other than a few ports and enhanced re-releases, the
  <em>
   VF
  </em>
  franchise has been dormant for quite some time. Recent rumors seem to suggest, however, that this may not be the case for long. The prominent insider Midori, also known as RyanFromTheBronx, alleged earlier this year that Sega was working on a new mainline entry in the
  <em>
   VF
  </em>
  series, presumably titled
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter 6
  </em>
  . This report, coupled with a recent tweet from Sega that fans believe was teasing
  <em>
   VF 6
  </em>
  , has led speculation to run rampant about this unannounced game. If Sega is indeed working on this title, then the company's revival of
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  could prove to be a bigger deal than some might expect.

 <p>
  Rumors and teases aside, there are reasons to think that a new
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  game is in development. Back in December 2023, Sega announced a new initiative to resurrect some of its legacy IPs. Among the franchises the publisher revealed would receive this reboot treatment were
  <em>
   Jet Set Radio
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Crazy Taxi, Streets of Rage
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Shinobi
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Golden Axe
  </em>
  . While it didn't provide any specific details about the new installments in these dormant properties, such as their names or release dates, the firm did hint that even more classic Sega IPs would be brought back in the future, in addition to the aforementioned five.

  It's anyone's guess as to what other franchises the company will decide to revive, but based off of recent comments from Sega COO Shuji Itsumi, one of them may end up being
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  . Shortly after Sega unveiled its plans for dormant series revivals in December, Itsumi revealed in an interview with the Washington Post that the Japanese publisher was actively entertaining the idea of making a new
  <em>
   VF
  </em>
  game. Taking all this into account, it seems like the chances of
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter 6
  </em>
  happening are higher than ever before, which is especially great considering the renaissance the fighting game genre has been having as of late.

  Sega Could Capitalize on the Fighting Game Boom With a New Virtua Fighter Game

  Fighting games are becoming more and more popular throughout the years. Two of the biggest franchises in the genre,
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  , have been on a roll lately
  <em>
   . Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  , which released last year, was met with rave reviews and broad commercial success.
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  , meanwhile, debuted in 2024 to near-universal acclaim from critics, selling over two million copies just one month after its launch. If Sega does make a new, high-quality
  <em>
   Virtual Fighter
  </em>
  game, it could end up standing toe-to-toe with these giants and potentially eclipsing them in one regard: approachability.

 <p>
  If there's one thing
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  is known for besides 3D graphics, it's having an accessible learning curve. So many fighting games are hard to get into due to their complex gameplay mechanics, but in
  <em>
   VF
  </em>
  's case, that isn't an issue. The control schemes in most
  <em>
   Virtual Fighter
  </em>
  games are quite simple and easy to understand since general combat maneuvers typically only involve the use of three buttons and an 8-directional control stick. If a new
  <em>
   <strong>
    Virtua Fighter
   </strong>
  </em>
  game doubles down on this approachable gameplay philosophy that previous entries in the franchise had, it may appeal to a broader-than-usual audience, which could lead to it becoming one of Sega's next big hits.

 <p>
  Only one day after
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO
   </em>
  </strong>
  opened its early access period for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners, many players are already hitting a brick wall in the form of Great Ape Vegeta. As one of the earliest fights in the game's story mode, most wouldn't expect the climactic showdown between Goku and Vegeta to pose too much of a challenge. Unfortunately, the Prince of All Saiyans' Great Ape form has always been one of the most difficult fights of the
  <em>
   Sparking!
  </em>
  games, and this proves to be no exception in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  For context, the Great Ape Vegeta fight was already notorious among the
  <em>
   Sparking!
  </em>
  fanbase before
  <em>
   Sparking! ZERO
  </em>
  's release. Even back when the series was still known as the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  games in the West, players were already having a hard time clearing the final chapter of the Saiyan Saga primarily because of the transformed Vegeta. Newcomers yet to familiarize themselves with
  <em>
   Sparking! ZERO
  </em>
  's mechanics are finding it a major struggle to defeat the transformed version of the Saiyan Prince.

 <p>
  Many of these players understandably flocked to social media to share their frustrations. On Twitter, users are expressing their gripes about the fight's difficulty, giving varying reasons as to why they believed Vegeta's Great Ape form posed such a challenge. Many attribute the fight's unfairness to the high damage of Vegeta's ki blasts and how often he is able to use special attacks that can wipe out a player's health bar. Others also pointed out his painful grabs, which, combined with his super armor, means that fighting at close range with the Great Ape is equally hazardous.

  However, there have also been players who revealed they had found ways to cheese the fight without outright lowering the difficulty setting. Several users shared clips showing them spamming ki blasts at range, which was admittedly an often-used strategy in previous
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  video game titles for giant enemies. Some players also figured out how to keep Great Ape Vegeta in a stun-locked state with the use of the new Sparking! Mode mechanic, wherein they would enter Sparking! mode, rush in with a flurry of attacks, then back off to wait for their gauge to recharge and repeat the cycle.

  Despite some frustrating fights,
  <em>

  is still being lauded by newcomers and veterans of the series alike. Early reviews for the title have praised it not only for its fast and satisfying gameplay but its faithful reimagining of the original anime and manga series. For fans of the IP,

   <em>
    Updated October 8, 2024:
   </em>
  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset. After plenty of waiting, the next Episode of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  has finally arrived. As players have seen, Revenant adds a whole new story to pursue with the scorn leader Fikrul having resurfaced after obtaining an Echo. With this new power, Fikrul is raising an undead scorn army at the expense of the Elkisni, so the player teams up with Mithrax and Eido once again to put an end to this new threat.

  Alongside the new story content, Episode: Revenant also sees plenty of changes coming to the game. As expected, Bungie is tweaking the gameplay sandbox with some major adjustments to
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  exotic weapons, buffing roaming supers, as well as finally allowing Titan players to really embrace that tank role with some interesting buffs. The popular Onslaught mode is also seeing some new content, which should push players to jump back into that playlist.

  Trials of Osiris Map and Weekly Adept Weapon

 <p>
  Saint-14 and the Trails of Osiris offer players a high-end PvP activity in exchange for powerful rewards, especially for players who go flawless and earn a trip to the Lighthouse. Similar to most vendors in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , Saint-14 has a reputation system that rewards players for ranking up through playing and completing bounties.

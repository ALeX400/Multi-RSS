      <title>AC Shadows’ Animus Hub is a Nice First Step in What Should Be a Long Journey</title>

  Over the past couple of years, Ubisoft has made it no secret that it has some grand ambitions for the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  franchise. Not only are players being treated to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but
  <em>
   Codename Hexe, Jade
  </em>
  , and a new multiplayer experience also loom on the horizon. If that was not enough, Ubisoft also plans to bring them altogether through the Animus Hub. And with the release of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , players are getting a first look at what that will be like.

 <p>
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  has launched with the first iteration of the Animus Hub, which brings together the three previous RPG titles
  <em>
   , Mirage,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  into one launcher. Along with that, there are missions, rewards, and narrative content for players to explore. While it is not necessarily a game-changer, this hub represents the future of the franchise, and so far, it seems to be pretty promising. However, there is still a lot of work that Ubisoft needs to do before the Animus Hub truly lives up to its potential.

  The Animus Hub is Laying Some Strong Foundations
 </h3>
 <p>
  When players first launch
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , they will be met with the Animus Hub. This feature is being penned as an in-universe product by Abstergo, serving as a collection of historical adventures for consumers to jump into. As of now, those adventures are
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mirage
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  . Each game can be launched directly from the hub, making this feel like a new type of franchise launcher. However, the rest of this massive franchise has seemingly been left out of the fun, for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alongside those five titles come three more features that promise a wide assortment of content for players to engage with. Firstly, there are things known as Projects, which is where the Animus Hub's live-service mechanics seem to be coming into play. Ubisoft has plans to release new missions known as Anomalies that will give players rewards, which seem to be connected to a battle pass. This pass can be found in another tab known as the Exchange, which seems to be locked to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  . And finally, there is a collection of narrative content known as the Vault, which seems to be where all the mysterious Rift cutscenes in
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  are kept.
 </p>
 <h3 id="there-is-so-much-work-left-for-ubisoft-to-do">
  There is So Much Work Left for Ubisoft to Do
 </h3>
 <p>
  While this hub seems to have a ton of potential, it very much needs some work. For starters, because it is launching with
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , that game is the only one that actually launches through the feature. If players want to play one of the other titles in the Hub, they must have it installed, and then they still have to go through that game's starting screen and menus before they can play it. And if they want to return to the Hub, there is seemingly no easy way to do that outside of simply relaunching
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  . With
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  , they can simply jump into the game the second they click play on the Animus Hub and return to the Hub at a moment's notice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, much of the content within the hub is only tied to
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  , making it pretty meaningless for the other four titles included. Future
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  titles will likely have content within the Hub as well, but so should those previous games. Not just the four others included either, but the franchise's entire massive catalog of titles should benefit. This is supposed to be the franchise's launcher going forward, so it really needs to represent the entire franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, since this is the first iteration, there is still plenty that Ubisoft needs to do before its potential is fully realized. With time, the feature will likely see a whole host of new additions, including a multiplayer mode. And hopefully, that happens sooner rather than later, as right now it purely feels like
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  ' launcher when it is supposed to be so much more.

      <title>YouTuber Makes Crab-Themed PlayStation Console Complete With Claw Controllers</title>

      A YouTuber known as GingerOfOz created a crab-themed PlayStation with claw controllers.

 <p>
  A YouTuber has taken inspiration from a crab-themed
  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  drawing, creating their own real-life version of the design. In addition to being playable, the console featured impressive claw controllers that helped sell the look of a crustacean and caught the attention of the PlayStation community online.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the original Sony-developed home console, the PlayStation has become a favorite for many gamers thanks to its many classic titles. Besides its nostalgic game lineup, the console has a recognizable design that many fans enjoy. Sony even released 30th-anniversary limited-edition PS5 consoles and accessories based on the classic 1995 look, evidencing its nostalgia. Recently, one fan took their love of the original PlayStation in a different direction, creating something that looked like it came from the ocean.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a recent project, YouTuber GingerOfOz decided to create a custom crab-themed PlayStation, and the result was impressive. According to the creator, this inspiration came from incredible art made by Anh Dang, who reimagined the classic PS1 design as a crustacean with a couple of claws that doubled as controllers. While the concept looked impressive, GingerOfOz revealed that translating the design to a real-world model was challenging.

  YouTuber GingerOfOz's Incredible Crab-Themed PlayStation Console
 </h2>
 <p>
  In a recent YouTube video, they detailed the many steps involved in creating the crab-inspired PlayStation, along with the many hurdles they had to overcome. Among the difficulties of adapting Anh Dang’s artwork to a real-world design was the shape of the crab. The original crab drawing had a variety of subtle curves and indentations, which GingerOfOz had to make work in their version. In addition, they even had to cut off the outer fringes of the PS1 motherboard they were using in the build to make it fit in the shell. It is worth noting that a PSOne, a smaller version of the original PlayStation console, was used in the project. When all was said and done, GingerOfOz had to create 56 3D-printed parts for the crab-themed PlayStation.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, this custom console build has been a hit with gamers, with many leaving positive comments on YouTube. In the video, GingerOfOz affectionately referred to the console as a “Playstacean” and even showed it plugged into an old CRT television playing classic PS1 games. Some players pointed out how impressive it was that GingerOfOz managed to take the 2D design and transfer it to a 3D model that functioned. While many wanted to purchase a crab-themed PlayStation, the YouTuber revealed they would not sell more units. They noted the hard work it took to build a single one and said it was “janky enough to stress me out if I had to support units out in the wild.”

 <p>
  It is often exciting to see what kinds of custom machines gamers are inspired to build. While GingerOfOz’s crab build is incredible, many others have shared eye-catching designs. For example, another person previously created a massive custom Nintendo 3DS, claiming it to be the biggest in the world. With nine generations of consoles and more people than ever part of the gaming community, it seems only a matter of time before the next incredible custom console build is revealed.

  Players new to the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Bleach
   </strong>
  </em>
  game franchise may take a little time to familiarize themselves with how the mechanics work. The game has a lot of new features from its predecessors and most of the battles are against the Soul Reapers and Hollows.

 <p>
  Additionally, players will learn more techniques that deal with Reishi, Konpaku, and Kido.

  It’s important to remember that
  <strong>
   Zan Ken So Ki is your active character’s core move
  </strong>
  . And with that comes your basic Quick Attack maneuver that will increase the likelihood of landing chain combos. They’re fast but have less defense. Players should note that every attack pattern differs from character to character.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heavy strikes on the other hand break opponents' guards better and allow for more long-ranged attacks as well. The same can be said about Counter Attacks, which you can use to guard against enemy attacks.
  <strong>
   You need only judge your opponent’s attack patterns and wait for the right time to guard to parry it off
  </strong>
  . Most players usually stick to this basic attack pattern: successive quick attacks until Reishi is depleted and then land a heavy attack to cap off the spirit gauge.

  The easiest way to describe
  <strong>
   Reishi is that it’s the health bar which tracks how much damage is taken
  </strong>
  . This is equivalent to your character and your enemy. So, using the
  <strong>
   Zan Ken So Ki
  </strong>
  techniques can break down your opponent's Reishi gauge and thus lower their Konpaku. If players manage to deplete 1 unit of the Reishi Gauge, they can execute a
  <strong>
   Soul Break to trigger a Kikon (finishing) move to destroy all available Konpaku
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Since Konpaku is basically the
  <strong>
   number of lives a character has
  </strong>
  , it’s important to break down your opponent’s defenses until you can deal a
  <strong>
   Kikon move to break their Konpaku
  </strong>
  . You need to
  <strong>
   destroy all Konpaku that your opponents have to win the fight
  </strong>
  . The fight will eventually build up to a Kikon move, so just keep an eye on the bar above and watch out for how many Konpaku your opponent has.

  One important mechanic in
  <em>
   Bleach: Rebirth of Souls
  </em>
  is the awakening and reawakening mode. The difference in combat is huge, but it also depends on the character. Some characters only have awakening mode, whilst some have awakening and reawakening mode. You’ll notice this when the Spirit Gauge at the top corner of the character's screen starts
  <strong>
   glowing
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   “EVOLUTION” is the sign to use your Awakening
  </strong>
  and doing so unleashes an attack that will surely overwhelm your opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sublimation
  </strong>
  occurs when you
  <strong>
   build up Fighting Spirit during your Awakening state
  </strong>
  . This is basically the Kikon channel state, which will
  <strong>
   boost their Kikon Move base DMG by one bar until the battle ends
  </strong>
  . Charging up your Fighting Spirit gauge takes time, but there are two ways by which players can do it: Regular Combos and Reverse Combos.

 <p>
  Reverse Combos are a necessity for
  <em>
   Bleach: Rebirth of Souls
  </em>
  players as they shave off a chunk of Spiritual Pressure from your opponents. The
  <strong>
   Reverse Gauge will be at the bottom of the character screen
  </strong>
  and managing the correct moves takes a little bit of practice. There are a total of three Reverse Actions and each one depends on when you activate them:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Soul Reverse
   <strong>
    (White)
   </strong>
   - Increases Spiritual Power and Recovers Reishi
  </li>
  <li>
   Chain Reverse
   <strong>
    (Yellow)
   </strong>
   - Continue Combos and increase Spiritual Power
  </li>
  <li>
   Burst Reverse
   <strong>
    (Blue)
   </strong>
   - Cancel opponent’s Combos and recover Guard gauge
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Since these are special actions, you can’t expect to spam them at any given time. It’s recommended to save them for more unpredictable moments in the fight, because once you enter the Reverse Action state, you’ll only deal those types of moves for a given amount of time. Furthermore, each Reverse Action depends on the character, so feel free to take your time and figure out how your character best works.

  isn’t an open-world game, players can still head into other arenas and test out their skills. Each match has a different location and a different enemy for you to try out. In true battle gaming fashion, players are required to remember the best combos available and the best vantage point for each attack. So don’t be afraid and step into the Battle Mode arena to test out your skills against prepared enemies and other players.

  After a decade of champion release,
  <em>
   <strong>
    League of Legends
   </strong>
  </em>
  has just ticked over the 170 mark with the release of Mel, a long-range mid lane mage who has seen some flexibility in the Support and ADC roles. But with some tricky-to-understand mechanics and less than conventional supportive capabilities, new players will want to pick up a champion with more consistent healing output, crowd-control skills, and a simplistic kit in order to learn the fundamentals of the role.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thankfully, the Support lineup is wide and full of all kinds of class types and playstyles that can fit pretty much any player's desire. In general, they fall into three main categories: Enchanters, Tanks, and Mages, with a few blurring the lines between, and with each archetype, there are plenty of champions to choose from for players just starting out and looking for an easier time playing the game.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Consistent crowd control and target lockdown
  </li>
  <li>
   Tanky frontliner with some multi-use mobility
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  When choosing a tank to slot into a team, Nautilus is a great choice for establishing a hefty frontline with some serious danger attached to a hook. His abilities are very simple to understand, and while hitting the anchor on enemies can be tricky at times, his auto attacks come with a handy root, and his ultimate launches a shockwave that knocks up the target and anyone in its path, all on a point-and-click ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  His role in the team is like any other supportive tank: stand with the ADC, look for hooks on the enemy carry, and CC anyone diving into the backline. With such consistent CC and power all in one kit, he works well in a range of scenarios and team compositions and brings plenty of tools to the table to deny enemy characters from even being able to move.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Long-range CC spells

  <li>
   Simple, high-damage spell combos and itemization
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Lux is one of the most popular characters in the entire game, with some opting for the mid lane when picking her up and others choosing the Support role where she is equally if not more powerful. Her kit consists of an easy-to-land slow, a double root, a small shield that can be tossed to herself and nearby teammates and a high-burst beam of light that can devastate any champions from a whole screen away.
 </p>
 <p>
  There really isn't much complexity to her, with the most interesting mechanic being her passive that marks champions hit by her abilities, which can then be popped for even more damage with either an auto-attack or another spell. This means that players can set up in a bush and wait for an unsuspecting foe to waddle on by, before pressing Q+E+R to unload the ridiculous burst potential of this small but mighty mage. While Supports might normally be considered healers, Lux takes things into her own hands, letting the player become the carry themselves.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Ridiculously tanky with long CC chains
  </li>
  <li>
   Easy to land combos with no skill-shots
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Sometimes it's nice to hop into the rift and not worry about landing skills on fast-moving targets and, instead, just run at the enemy menacingly. Alistar provides that fantasy perfectly, having a great playmaking kit with consistent CC and a very simple game plan that still has some skill expression mixed into it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The basic combo rotation is W+Q for a dash into a knock-up combo and then casting E to chase down the target with an extra slow and stun to finish. Of course, mistakes happen, and sometimes a play doesn't go too well, but with Alistar's handy healing passive, the lane becomes significantly easier for both the ADC and Support. On top of that, his ultimate makes him virtually unkillable, which is useful for taking on the frontline position during a team fight or running away to safety without taking fatal damage.

  Sona is the epitome of the MOBA enchanter, bringing so much utility and Support to the game whilst not demanding over-the-top mechanics of the player. Her kit revolves around songs, one for healing, one for speed, and one for poke, all of which are either auras or auto-aiming, allowing the player to focus on their positioning and the enemy's skillshots while not missing their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  She also comes with one of the strongest ultimates in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , which, while it is a skillshot, is fairly hard to dodge and comes with a cooldown refund later in the game. Becoming stronger as the game time ticks up is incredibly valuable, and Sona certainly falls into that category, building up stacks on ability casts that reduce her cooldowns. Later on, she is able to basically cast her ult on a 30-second cooldown, on top of providing some impressive sustain and map traversal for the rest of her team.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Easy-to-learn combo that basically guarantees a kill
  </li>
  <li>
   Rhythmic playstyle that teaches cooldown management and when to go in
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Blitzcrank is the poster child for what defines a hook champ. With all his power pushed into the grabbing fist, players can put all their attention into landing just one skillshot, which can turn the tide of a fight in seconds while not punishing the misses too severely. A basic combo looks something like W (to run at the enemy), Q, E, and R if the player is level six, which provides a long CC chain that, if the hook is landed, nets a kill almost every time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just the threat of the hook is enough to scare enemy players away. He also commands so much space with his presence on the rift that players will need to walk carefully through the fog or risk being yoinked into the enemy team. He is a great champ to learn and has one key goal: hook the enemy. Even if the player misses 9/10 hooks, that one big connect onto the enemy ADC is normally enough to win entire games.

 <p>
  Some supports play on the frontline, while others, like Soraka, sit back and let the team do the work, topping their health pools up and running towards low allies for a massive injection of healing. Her healing output is absolutely baffling right from the start, with the limiting factor being that she uses some of her own health in order to cast the spell. But, by landing her Q, she heals herself a significant amount and, just by landing it once, can keep the fight going for a long while.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her biggest asset has to be her ultimate, which casts a beam from the sky that heals all alive allies for a large amount, regardless of whether they are right next to the player or all the way on the top lane. It's an instant cast, with no skill shots required. It's also a great way for players to learn to watch the map and how fights are going elsewhere, as during a 1v1, she can turn the tide in the ally's favor without having to be close by.

   Simplistic CC abilities that can keep her glued to targets for a long time

 <p>
  Leona is another champion who slots into the tank/CC Support category, bringing a sword and shield to the fight and stunning enemies in absurdly long chains that will likely leave them feeling beyond frustrated by the end of the game. A short but fast hook, a stun on an auto attack, and a long-range, easy-to-land stun ultimate make her super strong at getting onto carries playing from afar. What's more is that none of her abilities can be blocked by an enemy, making focus fire significantly easier than other champions.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are plenty of combinations that work with her, ranging from mage carries to aggressive ADCs that benefit from having a super-tanky frontline to dish out the DPS. She even has a survivability tool on her W, which gives her resists and damage reduction, letting her take a heavy beating without any stress or issue. She's hard to play against and easy to pick-up for any tank lovers who want to get stuck in and lock down the enemy.

 </ul>
 <p>
  When it comes to discussions about champion design and characters in MOBAs that are divisive in their gameplay, Yuumi is at the top of the list. The player gets to hop onto an ally and basically let them take the wheel, not needing to move or dodge skills and instead being able to cast some long-range poke, shields, and waves of healing all while never taking a single point of damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  When one doesn't even need to click their mouse around the map, the gameplay becomes so easy it hurts, which gives the player a lot of exposure to new champions and their abilities. This also gives players a chance to get a grasp of how and when to ward safely, due to the increased risk that comes with being a squishy cat. She is simple, easy, and incredibly strong, allowing the player to pick up some victories without stressing over 100s of skillshots and complex game mechanics.

      <title>One Part of the Borderlands Movie May Have Been a Glimpse at the Future</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There’s no two ways about it; the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands
   </em>
  </strong>
  movie did not hit the way it should have. After years in development hell, the movie struggled to find an audience when it finally released last year. Critics did not care for it and fans of the series found the characters unrecognizable from their source material counterparts. In a lot of ways, it’s probably something best moved on from and left in the past, but amidst the disappointment, there may be a nugget of gold for the franchise to capitalize on.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  movie’s bizarre decision to diverge from the games’ canon was a big factor in why it was such a big miss for longtime fans, but it also gave audiences a chance to see characters interact that normally wouldn’t in the source material. One of these character pairings, while seemingly the most nonsensical, could be adapted into the games fairly easily given each characters’ trajectory throughout the series. Plus, some would argue the groundwork for the connection these two share was laid down as early as
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  .

  Krieg and Tina May Bond Over Their Personal Losses
 </h3>
 <p>
  Tina and Krieg were two of the breakout characters from
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  , and they remain fan favorites years after the fact. The
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  live-action film saw these two as an unlikely pair of friends finding each other on Pandora, which isn’t too far off from how they meet in the context of
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  . In the movie, however, the two are much closer, with Krieg acting as an unofficial bodyguard for the wayward pre-teen. This dynamic worked well enough for the movie, but it might be more at home in the games than most realize.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Roland’s death in
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  , Tina was left without her friend and father figure. Her grief surrounding the loss was a massive part of her surprisingly deep character development in the acclaimed Assault on Dragon Keep DLC. Similarly, after the events of
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , Krieg was left without his friend Maya, who kept him (relatively) anchored in reality as he struggled with his insanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both characters have experienced loss in fundamental ways. It’s not the most out there idea to think that they could gravitate toward each other. Tina, though certainly no longer in need of any sort of protection, could do well with another friend like Krieg, who himself would probably benefit from having a friend who could, like Maya, help keep him from succumbing to his more psychotic tendencies. It would be a heartwarming little friendship to see organically form between two fan-favorite
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  characters, and it could go even further if Gearbox finally confirmed one longstanding fan theory about the two’s relationship.

  There’s a long-standing fan theory that Krieg is actually Tina’s father; or rather what’s left of him after Hyperion experiments. Several of Krieg’s sane voice lines in
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  refer to him looking for someone, hoping that she’s safe. These lines have never been given any sort of proper resolution, and scenes from his backstory in his own
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  DLC depict him having a wife and daughter in his past life as a normal man. Granted, the evidence for this theory is purely circumstantial, but at a certain point, the sheer volume of things that point to this being the case seems to add up.

  The largest evidence against the theory of Krieg being Tina's father are comments made by Gearbox staff explicitly denouncing the theory. But anyone who remembers
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  's launch and the mystery around the titular villain’s identity knows that sometimes developers like to misdirect audiences to keep major story twists under wraps. There's plenty of reason and evidence to support the theory, and ultimately it could result in some meaningful development for two characters who've been defined by loss.

  Tina has been hardened by Pandora. Despite her mental instability, she's an ironclad badass in her own right and there's a strong argument to be made that Tina should eventually be a playable Vault Hunter herself. But ultimately she became the character everyone knows and loves because she lost her parents at such an early age. Krieg is the way he is because he lost just about everything there was to lose; his family, his mind, and eventually the only friend who was keeping him tethered and grounded. Since these characters have both lost so much, it would be nice to see them get a chance at something resembling a happy ending by finding each other. Regardless of whether Krieg is positioned as a friend or family member, it would be nice to see the games work in one of the few strengths of the film, as long as their bond is written well.

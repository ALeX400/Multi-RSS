  Nexon's
  <strong>
   <em>
    The First Descendant
   </em>
  </strong>
  puts players in the boots of a superhuman fighter in a war against an alien species. While this setting may not exactly be unique, the game itself blends a number of elements from other similar titles to create an interesting take on the co-op looter shooter genre.

  In a fashion similar to other looter shooters,
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  also gives players the chance to pick a character they want to start with. Picking who to start with can be a tough decision to make, so here's an overview of each character to help you figure out who to use first.

 <p>
  Lepic is the usual
  <strong>
   soldier-type character
  </strong>
  who places a heavy emphasis on
  <strong>
   gunplay and grenades
  </strong>
  , and he's one of the first playable units to be revealed back when
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  was announced. He has the
  <strong>
   highest multi-target damage potential
  </strong>
  out of the three starting characters, and he's a great pick for players who want to stick to mid-long-ranged engagements.

 <p>
  This character is a good all-rounder with solid damage and the ability to lump enemies together via his Traction Grenade skill. If you're looking for a jack of all trades with high-potential DPS against chunky targets, Lepic is your man.

 <p>
  Viessa's main job is to
  <strong>
   turn enemies into blocks of ice
  </strong>
  . Not only does this nullify threats for a short duration, but it also makes landing weakspots against them much easier. Don't be fooled by her role as a Debuffer — Viessa is more than capable of dishing out damage, especially once her targets are already frozen.

 <p>
  Players who enjoy caster-type characters can get a lot of value out of Viessa's kit. She's
  <strong>
   designed for offensive ability usage
  </strong>
  , and if you're looking to make statues out of your targets before shattering them into pieces, then Viessa is the perfect choice.

  Ajax is the tank of the starter trio, and he's practically made for fans of the big, lumbering juggernaut archetype. He may not have the same firepower as some other
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  characters like Bunny, but he's got the utility and crowd control to keep his team and important objectives alive under the most dire of situations.

 <p>
  This character draws
  <strong>
   plenty of similarities to the Titan class in the
   <em>
    Destiny
   </em>
   franchise
  </strong>
  , and if you're looking to control the battlefield by stunning enemies and completely rendering incoming projectiles useless, Ajax has your back.

  The power levels of each character are more or less the same when it comes to clearing all content in
  <em>

  <strong>
   we highly recommend picking Ajax

 <p>
  There are some mission objectives that will require you to defend them. Ajax's barriers almost trivialize these encounters by completely negating incoming damage. Additionally, he's very easy to build around as he's not as ability-reliant as other Descendants. Ajax's kit will make your life easier if you're playing alone, especially once you start farming for the other Descendants.

      <title>Martial Arts Tycoon: How Climate Change Will Affect Character Attributes</title>

  There are plenty of oddball simulation and management games out there, like
  <em>
   PowerWash Simulator
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Gas Station Simulator
  </em>
  , and their popularity cannot be understated. Their nature, at least in part, helped inspire the creation of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Martial Arts Tycoon: Brazil.
   </em>
  </strong>
  Fans of simulators, martial arts, or both will be able to develop their own gym in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, one of the hearts of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, where they'll train and guide their students and build a martial arts empire when it releases. Though it is a tycoon game where players will experience business and finance management, there's also one key element that makes the title stand on its own: environmental awareness.

  After being in AAA development for several years, including co-founding Infinity Ward and the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Franchise, Chance Glasco said he needed a change. Now, he's the CEO and creative director of Good Dog Studios, which is the indie studio working on
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon: Brazil
  </em>
  . At Gamescom LATAM, Glasco told Game Rant that his experience of living in Brazil, his love for jiu-jitsu, the lack of a tycoon martial arts game, and climate change all played a factor in the creation of
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon: Brazil
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon

  was formally announced in July 2023 at BIG (Brazil's International Games) and is currently still in development. Everything one expects from a Tycoon game is present, but it might be surprising to hear how much the weather and climate change factor in as well. This is partially because Glasco is a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, which is working with the climate resilience organization Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center (Arscht-Rock for short) to help keep people safe and informed about climate change through video games.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Instead of focusing on mitigation of climate where we're trying to stop global warming and climate change, where we realize we're already kind of screwed, we focus on things to keep people safe.
  </p>
  <p>
   We're seeing record-breaking heat every year in the south of Brazil and flooding that affected something like half a million people. We've always had climate affecting humans and so what can we do through games to actually keep people safer from climate? We work with developers, we do workshops. In the past, we've done some grants to basically help get some of these topics in the game.

  The way that this has been translated into
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon
  </em>
  may seem simple, but it makes sense in context and helps carry this message all the same. In the game, players will experience a daily temperature that is based on the real average temperature of Rio de Janeiro, which has warm or hot weather all year round, ranging from 70-to-100 degrees Fahrenheit. In
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon
  </em>
  , there are occasional heat waves where, depending on their intensity, players will have to consider spending money to add more fans to the gym. They also have to make sure their fighters have water to drink or coverings to block the sun because, otherwise, their fighters can experience heat stroke or heat exhaustion. This condition could force them to be out of training and/or lower their attributes. The only way to fix this is to put the fighter through rehab.

If a mosquito bites one of your fighters, they might be out for three months and that's going to affect your bottom line.

 <p>
  From
  <em>
   Sim City
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Rollercoaster Tycoon
  </em>
  , open-ended simulation games have captivated gamers' attention because of the way players typically begin with very little and expand it into something extraordinary. In
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon
  </em>
  , players will become Lucas, a young boy who inherits a gym in the favela Morro Santo Amaro. Players will start off on an empty rooftop and must be strategic with how they spend their starting money on some basic equipment and a front desk (made out of beer crates). People will slowly start approaching the start-up gym and express their interest in training in jiu-jitsu; based on their background and traits, players can choose to accept or deny them. Every time a player trains, Lucas earns more money and builds towards upgraded equipment, reputation, and more.

 <p>
  But it's more than business management. Players can develop personalized classes and workouts for their desired length of time to improve their fighters' strengths and round out their weaknesses so that they can compete in tournaments. Glasco added that every NPC has their own character traits and life path, or their history. Based on that, players can watch how an NPC's training has affected them and their lives.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is largely considered to be a masterpiece of gaming. Its story is an emotional thrill ride that pushed the boundaries of the medium and the world Rockstar created is still one of the most immersive and lifelike video game worlds to date. Despite this, there is one chapter of the game’s story that still divides fans six years later: Guarma.

 <p>
  Fans have criticized the fifth chapter of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  ’s story for breaking up the flow of the game. The player is whisked away to the island after the botched Saint Denis bank job and stripped of their hard-earned gear, weapons, horses, and outfits while completing very on-rail missions. It’s easy to see how and why most fans power through the chapter to get back to the mainland as fast as they can. But there are nuggets of gold hidden in the Guarma chapter and the rest of the game would be worse off without its inclusion.

  The Saint Denis bank job is a crucial turning point in the story. The failed robbery sees the Van Der Linde gang take their first major loss to the Pinkertons. The lawmen don’t just put a stop to the score; they apprehend John and kill Lenny and Hosea, two of the moral centers of the Van Der Linde gang. The final mission of Chapter Four is heavy stuff and a lot to take in on a first playthrough.

 <p>
  While some would argue Guarma creates a pacing problem, it’s actually a wonderfully paced segment of the game. The massive slowdown in Chapter Five lets the player really soak in and absorb the events of the previous mission. Rockstar gives a full chapter for the player to stop and languish in the gang’s failure; a full chapter dedicated to grasping how the once unstoppable Van Der Linde gang had been laid so low.

  Guarma is Foreshadowing Dutch’s Fall from Grace
 </h3>
 <p>
  In terms of the story, Guarma is a major shift in the gang’s fortunes, but it also is an excellent piece of character-building for Dutch’s slow descent into madness. Guarma was the first time Dutch was really and truly backed into a corner. In high-stress moments like this, people show their true colors and Dutch didn’t disappoint. Most concerning is his immediate desire to jump into the rebel conflict on the island. He frames it as a positive thing; that the rebels’ values are in line with the gang’s and that they’re in the right to help them. But in reality, he’s escalating a conflict he knows little about to further his own selfish goals, in this case getting off the island.

 <p>
  Almost immediately after getting back to the mainland, Dutch starts his largely one-sided relationship with the Wapiti, which, of course, ends in tragedy for the tribe. Guarma serves as an ominous bit of foreshadowing for what Dutch will become in the next chapter and later in the original
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  . Even if Dutch talks himself up with noble, idealistic language, he ultimately becomes everything he claims to have hated.

 <h3 id="common-arguments-against-the-guarma-missions">
  Common Arguments Against The Guarma Missions
 </h3>
 <p>
  In subsequent playthroughs, the Guarma sections do become a bit of a chore to slog through. But Chapter Five is one of the shortest in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , topped only by Chapter One’s tutorial-focused missions. What’s more, is that Chapter Five doesn’t even stay in Guarma very long. Four missions are all it takes to get off the island and back to the meat of the game that take less than an hour of gameplay.

 <p>
  Speaking in a strictly pragmatic sense, Guarma does not need to be in the game. There are plenty of other instances in the story where the Van Der Linde gang has to evade the law, and they do so without fleeing the country. But from a narrative/writing standpoint, the time spent in Guarma works flawlessly to convey the isolation and aimlessness the gang is feeling after starting their eventual downfall. The
  <em>
   Red Dead
  </em>
  series has some of the deepest, most well-written characters the medium has to offer, and any time spent with them to gain some more insight into their internal worlds and motivations is time well spent.

   And so it is that the shape of the dragon has become symbolic of all manner of protections.

 <p>
  To
  <strong>
   get the Pearldrake Talisman +3 in
   <em>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  , you must go to the Specimen Storehouse in Shadow Keep. Like most of the new talismans in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , players can find it as a lootable item in the environment. If you've reached the Fourth Floor site of grace, getting the Talisman is simple, though it's still possible even if you're still on the Storehouse, the First Floor site of grace.

 <p>
  Teleport to the Storehouse, Fourth Floor site of grace, and turn around. From the ledge, jump down onto the feet of the statue hanging in the air. Travel across its body and jump onto the floor from its head. Then, pick up the item hiding in its hair.

 <p>
  If you haven't unlocked the Fourth Floor, simply travel to the First Floor site of grace. From there, follow the path to the north until you reach a small staircase. Follow it up and turn left to go through some bookshelves. You will come across another flight of stairs that leads to the second floor. Go up them and take the next flight of stairs, going to the third floor as well. Once there, kill the Fire Knight standing next to the ledge. Then, simply go west while staying next to the railing to reach the head of a statue, with the Pearldrake Talisman +3 hiding in its hair.

  Codes are an important option in mobile games that allow players to receive free rewards. This increases the audience, so developers need to make it easy to redeem codes in games. Usually, different developers add the option to redeem codes in the same places, for example, in the profile menu. Thanks to that, gamers who enter the game for the first time immediately know what to do. However, those who are unfamiliar with such games may need help, so we have created a guide that will show you how to redeem codes in

  The upcoming indie platformer
  <strong>
   <em>
    Antonblast,
   </em>
  </strong>
  which is in development for PC and Nintendo Switch, has been delayed to December 3 after hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted the team’s progress. Developer Summitsphere first revealed its “fast-paced explosive action” indie game in May 2022 with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign. Influenced by a range of titles, from
  <em>
   Cuphead
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Metro Dread
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Antonblast
  </em>
  is a side-scrolling platformer with a bright graphic style inspired by urban graffiti.

 <p>
  During September and October 2024, the southeastern United States has had to contend with two devastating hurricanes in short succession. Helene is currently the strongest hurricane on record to hit the Big Bend region of Florida. Hurricane Milton followed two weeks later, causing catastrophic flooding, tornadoes, and numerous casualties. Affected states include Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, and Tennessee, among others.

  Developer Summitsphere has been impacted by the hurricanes and decided to postpone the release of
  <em>
   Antonblast
  </em>
  from November 12 to December 3, 2024. However, gamers who would like to check out the platformer before then can download the
  <em>
   Antonblast: One Blast Demo
  </em>
  that is now available as part of Steam Next Fest. A demo for the game on Nintendo Switch is also in the works.

  According to the developer,
  <em>
   Antonblast
  </em>
  is “all about destruction,” and nearly everything in the game's environment is destructible. Players have the choice to take on the role of either Dynamite Anton or his coworker Annie. Anton uses his giant hammer to smash his way through 12 different worlds and take on "screen-filling" bosses, all with the end goal of recovering the protagonist’s collection of Spirits, which have been stolen by Satan himself.

  Featuring 2.5D graphics and hand-drawn animations,
  <em>
   Antonblast
  </em>
  allows players to move between the fore and background while making their way through the game. Players can rush through the levels, wreaking havoc as they go, or slow down to enjoy the views while listening to the retro-inspired soundtrack.
  <em>
   Antonblast
  </em>
  also offers several game modes, including Hard and Boss Rush. Despite the unexpected delay, Summitsphere’s zany platformer already has many gamers looking forward to its release, with several people noting its similarities to Nintendo’s popular
  <em>
   Wario Land
  </em>
  series.

  While waiting for

  <em>
   Super Meat Boy

 <p>
  One of the most direct ways to counter Sleeper Agents in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is by using the Vigilance Perk in the Perk 3 slot. This will allow you to be entirely immune to the Field Upgrade's effects, and any enemy using it will just appear as they normally should – this means no tag or appearance change. Keep in mind that this Perk is quite situational since, despite helping you go unnoticed, it will be limited compared to other popular options in the third slot.

 <p>
  Another option could be adding the Tracker Perk to your loadout, as this will still mark the enemy's footsteps on the ground even if they're utilizing Sleeper Agent.

 </h2>
 <p>
  Although hostile Sleeper Agents will appear in the match as teammates, the minimap will continue to mark them as enemies. While constantly using the minimap in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is good practice, with Sleeper Agents now added to the threat equation, there’s even more reason to be on top of it.

 <p>
  Additionally, enemies using this Field Upgrade will be pinged by UAVs, and Scout Pulses, and highlighted on the minimap when using unsuppressed weapons. So, be sure to equip these Killstreaks and constantly track the minimap while playing.

 <p>
  Although mastering this may take time, recognizing enemy Operator models can help you identify Sleeper Agents more effectively. At the start of a match, you’ll be assigned to one of two Operator factions: Rogue Black Ops or Crimson One. Each faction has a distinct set of Operators for players to choose from, with some character models featuring special designs and effects, like the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Vault Edition roster.

 <p>
  Despite swapping the enemy's Operator into a basic character model when Sleeper Agent becomes active, the special effects of some skins will remain visible. Therefore, recognizing the Operator models from afar can provide a key advantage in identifying disguised enemies.

 <h2 id="pay-attention-to-footsteps-and-callouts-or-enable-subtitles">
  Pay attention to footsteps and callouts or enable subtitles
 </h2>
 <p>
  While straightforward, listening to the announcer callouts or simply looking out for enemy footsteps can help you stay vigilant and avoid surprise attacks from enemy Sleeper Agents. When using the Field Upgrade, the enemies' step sound effects will be quite louder, allowing you to recognize if you have an imminent threat. However, this will mainly work if you don't have the enemy face to face, as it's unlikely you'll be able to react in time.

 <p>
  As for the callouts, to do this effectively, ensure that your game’s audio settings are configured properly, with effects volume set to maximum. Alternatively, you can enable subtitles, which may be easier to notice during gameplay and will provide additional information to assist you throughout any

  HoYoverse's trailblazing, turn-based sci-fi RPG,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail

  </strong>
  , is among the latest of modern major titles to uniquely tackle the space adventure genre. Between its captivating and dynamic main story, flashy and highly distinctive cast of playable characters, and library of extensive, enthralling world-building lore,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  proves a capable love letter to the genre. Notorious of HoYoverse, however,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  follows in the footsteps of its predecessors in adapting gacha mechanics as well as an integral part of the game's experience. While not required to enjoy the breadth of what
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  has to offer, players who invest in the in-game currency open themselves up to advantages and boons that would otherwise take time and dedication to achieve.

 <p>
  There are a plethora of currency items used to different effects in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . The most mundane of these are credits, collected after nearly any task and used most frequently for the purchase of in-game materials and buffs. There are, of course, rarer and more valuable currencies that can be exchanged for higher-quality rewards. One such currency, Stellar Jade, falls into the sweet spot between 'simple enough to obtain' and 'can never quite have enough.'

  Stellar Jade is the driving currency behind
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's most popular gacha mechanic: 'pulling' for playable characters. Following suit of HoYoverse's older titles, such as
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Honkai Impact 3rd
  </em>
  , the acquisition of characters to compile fun, peculiar, and optimal team compositions is what keeps a lot of players coming back for more. New characters are often teased ahead of time and land in-game with their own dedicated special events and showcases, stoking the flames of players' excitement and interest in gaining new characters for themselves.

 <p>
  That is where Stellar Jade comes in. To gain new playable characters, players will need to collect Star Rail Passes and Star Rail Special Passes depending on the rating and/or specific character they wish to pull for. While there are a handful of ways to acquire these passes, the most direct and cost-effective way to do so is to purchase them using Stellar Jade through the in-game store or Warp menu. There are plentiful ways to obtain more Stellar Jade, with the most passively integrated options being that of completing missions, opening in-game mail and receiving it as an item, and habitually playing some of the game's modes that offer recurrent and daily rewards, including participating in the Simulated Universe, completing Forgotten Hall levels, and increasing the player character's trailblazing rank.

 <p>
  Stellar Jade is also available for purchase with real-world money through the buying of another of the game's special currencies, Oneiric Shards. It's worth noting that collecting Stellar Jade doesn't guarantee a specific pull. What's more, Stellar Jade is not inexpensive for either a real-world wallet or as an in-game resource, as warp pulls have less chance of producing a rare or valuable collectible when using singular Rail Passes rather than ten at a time. Part of the appeal of gacha games mimics the possibility of winning big at a casino; it is a game and a rush of the thrill of chance. Granted, the odds of pulling a desired character or item are much more reasonable than that of winning the lottery.

  With
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  being a live-service game backed by regular support, the game receives frequent updates, patches, and new playable content. Hoarding Stellar Jade for cycling content becomes par for the course when enjoying all else the game has to offer and itself a game of patience while players wait for the drops they hope to add to their arsenal. All in all, the most important takeaway here is to spend this critical resource quite mindfully while trailblazing the stars.

  Arrowhead Game Studios has released a new update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  on October 15, marking the end of the studio's 60-day community commitment with another round of huge weapons buffs, adjustments, and gameplay changes.
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  's 1.001.104 patch is available to download and install now on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam, and although today's update marks the end of Arrowhead's 60-day plan, the studio says it is still committed to keeping a line of communication between developers and fans open.

 <p>
  Although the third-person shooter has been a smash hit with players,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has found itself at the center of multiple controversies since its launch in February. The first came when its publisher, Sony, attempted to force PC players to link their Steam accounts to a PSN account if they wanted to continue playing. This decision was later walked back, but
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  would then go on to be review-bombed after releasing its massive Escalation of Freedom update due to what fans believed were an unnecessary number of weapon and stratagem nerfs.

 <p>
  In response to the backlash, Arrowhead outlined a 60-day plan for
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  where it would release new updates and re-examine its approach to balance changes. The studio's plan has now come to an end with the release of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  's latest update, which is now available on PlayStation 5 and PC. The patch notes detail some lengthy changes with another round of massive buffs, as Arrowhead says the 1.001.104 update includes the remaining weapons and stratagem changes that it wasn't able to finish for the September 17 patch.

  Alongside changes to armor damage, quality-of-life improvements, and weapon buffs, Arrowhead says it has dedicated time to look over some key core systems such as enemy spawning and Automaton targeting. The studio says that thanks to fan feedback, battling the Automatons in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has been fine-tuned to make the experience a lot less frustrating for players.

 <p>
  As the latest
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  update is now live, Arrowhead has celebrated the occasion with a new post recapping the past 60 days. The studio notes that over 70 different weapons and stratagems have seen comprehensive balance adjustments, along with an overhaul to several enemies to ensure they present a challenge while also feeling rewarding to defeat. Other notable changes have also been made to UI and enemy spawning, but Arrowhead says it is still committed to ensuring there is an open line of communication through surveys, patch notes, blog posts, and more.

   We’ve standardized the behavior of Plasma projectiles, which previously had varying characteristics in how they traveled through the air. Now, all Plasma projectiles experience high drag, causing them to slow down faster. However, each plasma weapon still fires projectiles at different speeds and calibers, so their effective ranges will remain distinct. For most weapons, this change won’t be very noticeable
  </li>
  <li>
   With the SG-8P Punisher Plasma you’ll see a less pronounced arc in its projectile path. Instead, it will start off faster and lose speed more rapidly, keeping its effective range about the same

   Previously, once the mission was completed but before extraction, we significantly increased patrol spawns across the entire map. Now, the increased patrol spawns are concentrated around the extraction site, with more patrols appearing the closer you are to it. This change should make patrol spawning feel more logical and reduce the penalty for players who complete the mission but still want to explore the map or collect samples. Please let us know if you still experience issues with the patrol spawning!

If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can enlist… John Helldiver

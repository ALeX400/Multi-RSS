  Players must now rotate three blocks that can be found near the kitchen on the first floor. The goal here is to rotate the left block until "U" faces forward, the middle block until "6" faces forward, and the right block until "D" faces forward. Mae's Lockbox will appear next to the blocks when that is done, and fans of survival games should open it to obtain the Rosetta Researcher's Map.

  is currently facing a little bit of backlash from fans. The game promised that players could play with their friends, challenge strangers online to beat their high scores, and even check out weekly leaderboards that showcase who was the best of the best within the different weekly competitions,

  While all of that is 100% accurate, players have had difficulties understanding how the leaderboards work (which is completely understandable). The way these were implemented is different from what fans expected, which is why it has been confusing to some as to where they actually are. Here's a breakdown of how to see them.

  is to create a sense of competition among players. The games give players who never got to see the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) era a chance to see some of its highlights, but it also gives players a chance to compete to see who is the fastest at certain levels, whether that is among friends or strangers. The weekly leaderboards are meant to be a way for players to show off who did what the fastest.

  Players have been able to access the leaderboards because it seems that the game has weekly rather than regular leaderboards. This means that these leaderboards update every single week to reflect the best of the best within the world at that week's challenges rather than at individual stages and challenges in the game. So, someone may be at the top of the leaderboard one week because they did an amazing job at a challenge and then find themselves at the bottom of it the next week.

 <p>
  While this certainly isn't what fans had expected when they purchased the game, the weekly leaderboards are there. Players just need to check them out each week after the previous week's challenges have ended, making it a little difficult to see the leaderboards. Thankfully, they are still in the game, just hidden behind each week's challenges. Considering there are over 150 challenges in the game and only five weekly challenges, it will take a bit of time before players will see all the challenges make it to the leaderboard.

  Even if the Marvel Cinematic Universe may not be on the same levels it was during the Infinity Saga, it feels like the
  <strong>
   X-Men
  </strong>
  brand is about to enter a new golden age. Not only can fans expect a whole new iteration of the team in the MCU, but they will also be treated to the grand return of many fan favorites in
  <em>
   Deadpool and Wolverine
  </em>
  . Along with that,
  <em>
   X-Men '97
  </em>
  has whisked them away on a fantastic journey and Insomniac has plans to tell its own story through
  <em>
   Marvel's X-Men
  </em>
  . That is a lot of content for X-Men fans to enjoy, and the best part is that it all has a major chance of rectifying one of Fox's biggest missteps.

 <p>
  Although Fox's
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  franchise may have led to some of the best superhero movies around, it also failed to adapt the iconic Dark Phoenix storyline twice. But even though Insomniac has yet to officially reveal its X-Men game, the studio still feels like the perfect fit to finally do that story justice. Even if it takes years before it comes to fruition, fans deserve to experience a good adaptation after decades of mistakes, and one of the few places they may be able to get that is within video games.

  The Dark Phoenix Story Hasn't Had Great Luck With Movies
 </h3>
 <p>
  It is no secret that the X-Men Dark Phoenix saga has not had the greatest luck with adaptations. While
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   X2: X-Men United
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  were met with critical acclaim, the same cannot be said for
  <em>
   X-Men: The Last Stand
  </em>
  . That film was set to adapt Dark Phoenix while also exploring the mutant cure storyline. That combination, along with a few strange story decisions, led to a film that left much to be desired. And because of its lukewarm reception, the entire film was retconned with
  <em>
   X-Men: Days of Future Past
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  After failing to do the story justice once, Fox was committed to trying again in the new rebooted
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  series.
  <em>
   X-Men: Dark Phoenix
  </em>
  was said to be a more faithful adaptation than its predecessor, and while that was true, it also fell flat with audiences. Many critics found it uninteresting and filled with missed opportunities. It would go on to become one of the biggest box-office bombs of all time, with many fans choosing to ignore it completely.

 <p>
  Both of Fox's attempts to adapt the Dark Phoenix saga were met with negative reviews, and as such, the next film adaptation will likely be facing an incredibly steep uphill battle. But since it is one of the most iconic storylines X-Men has, there is a strong chance Marvel Studios will try it again. And while that could lead to a fantastic adventure, it may be better if Insomniac takes the reins for a bit.

 <p>
  Thanks to
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  , Insomniac has shown players that it knows how to handle these iconic Marvel superheroes. The stories it has told have paid a lot of respect to the source material, and it has even provided fans with a pretty good Venom after Sony faltered with its many live-action attempts. So, if it can do that with Spider-Man and his roster of characters, then there is seemingly no reason it could not do the same with the X-Men.

 <p>
  Nothing is known about Insomniac's X-Men game, as it has not even been officially announced yet. But, when it finally is, fans will probably see a lot of familiar storylines with an Insomniac twist. And even though the Dark Phoenix saga may be too big for the first game, based on its previous projects, the studio feels like the perfect place to explore it once more. Because if the film industry cannot do it justice, then it seems like the video game industry deserves a shot at it.

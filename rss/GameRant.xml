  Players who dare explore The Zone in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </strong>
  </em>
  will come across locked-off rooms or complete sections with loot hiding inside. To access said areas, players either need to find a key or a code. One of these locked-off rooms can be found in the Concrete Forest area of the Cement Factory region, which is locked in a small tower. This door requires a key that can be found nearby, but you'll need to do a bit of climbing before getting it. Here's how to unlock it.

  Players can find the locked door towards the west side of the
  <strong>
   Concrete Forest POI in the Cement Factory region
  </strong>
  of
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  . It's on the first floor of a building/tower that connects to a larger tower with a large metal pipe and a rusted structure. The key for this locked door is located inside the tower right next to it. Let's check out how you can retrieve the key for this door.

  If you look towards the right of the locked door, you'll spot a
  <strong>
   huge tower with a staircase on its side
  </strong>
  leading to the top. Approach the staircase and climb to the top of said tower. Do be careful as there's a glass shard anomaly field on the base of the staircase, so taking bleed damage will be inevitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  After reaching the top of the tower, you'll spot a
  <strong>
   hole in the ground
  </strong>
  covered with yellow-painted wooden boards. You'll have to break the wooden boards using a weapon or melee attack to open up the hole. It's safe to drop through it as there's a gravitational anomaly to break your fall, allowing you to land safely.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's a Poltergeist mutant here, so make sure to defeat it quickly before trying to look for the key. Once the mutant is taken care of, look for the
  <strong>
   body of a Pvt. Babych
  </strong>
  that's on the ground. Looting the body will allow players to retrieve the key to the Concrete Forest locked door in
  <em>
   Stalker 2

      <title>NBA 2K25: Best Teams For Shooting Guard In MyCareer</title>

    Summary
   </h3>
   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      NBA 2K25 undervalues shooting guards despite their crucial role in establishing plays and scoring threes.
     </li>
     <li>
      Playing as a shooting guard in NBA 2K25 can be highly satisfying due to the emphasis on scoring from range.
     </li>
     <li>
      Teams like the Charlotte Hornets, Dallas Mavericks, and Milwaukee Bucks are in need of a skilled shooting guard to elevate their gameplay.

 <p>
  The role of
  <strong>
   shooting guard
  </strong>
  isn't given the respect it deserves in the NBA, and that goes for this year's
  <strong>
   <em>
    NBA 2K25
   </em>
  </strong>
  as well. While point guards are the ones who get a lot of attention and glory for being the "general" on the court, the shooting guard is an important piece that can be a real game changer. These players are there to help establish a play, cover the perimeter, and then drill a three-pointer when they have to. They are far more essential than most people would give them credit for.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to playing them in
  <em>
   NBA 2K25
  </em>
  , they also can be one of the most fun positions to play thanks to their reliance on scoring, and specifically, scoring from range. There are few things as satisfying as drilling a big three-pointer in the face of a defender. However, not every team is suited for taking on a new shooting guard in the MyCareer mode, which is why this topic is here to let you know which teams are the best options as players create their character.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Updated January 17, 2025 by Shane Black:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   As the NBA season enters its halfway mark, more teams have emerged in need of help at the shooting guard position. Because of this, this list was updated to provide further context to the teams already on the list as to why their need for a center has been evident, but also add teams who have shown to be in need as well and offer more teams for players to go to when creating a center. It also received more in-text links to other guides to help players even more and give them the best possible chance to dominate the league.

  <li>
   Seth Curry is getting older

  <li>
   LaMelo is a capable PG who needs a good SG
  </li>
  <li>
   Youth makes this team capable of longevity
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Hornets are one of the bottom teams in the league, but that could start to change with a good shooting guard. Seth Curry is currently their starting SG, and while he is fine,
  <strong>
   he doesn't do enough to elevate the Hornets to greater heights
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Bringing in a new, young shooting guard
  <strong>
   would do the team a lot of good
  </strong>
  , and give another point of attack beyond just LaMelo Ball. Plus, with the youth of the team, the development could lead to a long period of success.

  <li>
   Luke and Kyrie make this combo potent

  <li>
   Could be one piece away from a dynasty
  </li>

 <p>
  The Dallas Mavericks just went to the Finals last season and still have some good DNA in their team. Having Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving on the roster helps a lot, and bringing in another threat
  <strong>
   could be a massive boost for them
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Quentin Grimes has shown to be serviceable in his play but
  <strong>
   hasn't really shown the ability to be truly great
  </strong>
  . Bringing in a talented shooting guard could be the thing the Mavs need to become a dynasty in the league.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Jamal Murray has regressed significantly
  </li>
  <li>
   Westbrook is better suited for making plays rather than scoring
  </li>
  <li>
   Jokic makes everything work well
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Despite only being a season and a half removed from being a large part of the championship run, Jamal Murray has not been what the Denver Nuggets need this season. He is moving slower, hitting fewer shots,
  <strong>
   and overall struggling
  </strong>
  in areas that he once excelled at.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of this, Denver may need to pick up a new shooting guard,
  <strong>
   one that can provide the scoring and efficiency
  </strong>
  that Murray once had. Russel Westbrook is there, but he is better when making plays rather than scoring, and playing Jokic is always going to be a good thing.

  . The playing time will be plentiful and there will be a lot of chances for players to prove themselves to the coaches.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plus, teaming up with Steph Curry, who can still hit just about any shot he wants, means creating an offense that
  <strong>
  </strong>
  is borderline unstoppable.
  <strong>
   It's a great situation to play on a legendary team
  </strong>
  with a legendary player as they open a new chapter in their history. Curry is still capable of hitting any shot, but he needs help to take the load off of his shoulders. Losing Thompson has shown to be a big step back in shot production, which is why a new shooting guard would be great for the team.

 <ul>
  <li>
   There is an opening to work alongside Damian Lillard.
  </li>
  <li>
   Giannis will draw a lot of double teams away from players.
  </li>
  <li>
   An immediate contender.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Milwaukee Bucks
  </strong>
  already have two All-Stars on their team in Dame Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo, and
  <strong>
   they could use a third piece
  </strong>
  to send them over the top. In fact, when the Bucks won their championship in 2021, it was largely because they had that third piece in the form of Jrue Holliday, who then went to the Celtics in 2023. The Bucks haven't been able to replace him effectively, and that gap is perfect for any incoming shooting guards who can drill their shots.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coming in as a shooting guard for the Bucks means that
  <strong>
   there will be lots of open shots,
  </strong>
  as Giannis draws a lot of double- or triple-coverage. This opens plenty of doors for players to show the world what they're made of and solidify their place on the roster.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Working alongside CJ McCollum means easy playmaking.
  </li>
  <li>
   Zion will draw defenders away.
  </li>
  <li>
   Already a proven team ready to take that next step.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While CJ McCollum is, technically, a shooting guard, he has proven that he can fill the point guard role just fine on the
  <strong>
   New Orleans Pelicans
  </strong>
  over the past couple of seasons. Because of that, it would make sense to
  <strong>
   bring in a new shooting guard to work alongside him
  </strong>
  and provide even more firepower to their strong shooting capabilities, or pass it inside for Zion's insane dunking.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is room on this team for
  <strong>
   a starting role pretty much immediately
  </strong>
  , but even a bench role would come with an excess of playing time. It could be what turns this team into one that can do some damage in the playoffs, or even contend for a championship.

  The

  are not in desperate need of anything, to be honest. With Shai Gilgeous Alexander emerging as a superstar and the addition of Alex Caruso to anchor their defense,
  <strong>
   the Thunder are going to be a force
  </strong>
  this upcoming season. However, Caruso's biggest strength is his defense, which means a bench shooting guard to provide more offense is a perfect role.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it will be from the bench,
  <strong>
   a second shooting guard is still going to be an important part of the team
  </strong>
  . When the starters are sitting, that means that they are going to need some scoring to replace what they bring. Or when that starting unit needs a little bit more firepower, replacing Caruso with that more offensive player would be perfect.

  <strong>
   a shooting guard can do some real damage

 </p>
 <p>
  Wembanyama is a phenomenal player who will

   draw plenty of defenders away

  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  publisher HoYoverse has settled with the US Federal Trade Commission, with the game publisher being hit with a massive $20 million fine. The fine is due to the way the game's gacha works, as well as its handling of minors' data, with the US federal government accusing
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  of deceiving its players, particularly children and teens, into spending real money when the odds of gaining what was wanted were very low.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has been an extremely popular mobile game, but it has also received numerous complaints from players regarding its gacha system. In order to acquire new characters to fight with and to acquire weaponry for them, players participate in the game's "Wish" gacha system, similar to a loot box, letting players perform a pull for a chance at what the gacha's current banner is offering. However, the odds involved and the age of the audience targeted were things the FTC took issue with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, a settlement has been reached, with HoYoverse required to pay a $20 million fine, which will be taken by the US Treasury. The FTC claims that HoYoverse has spent millions of dollars to promote its
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  gacha system, including a particular sponsored video with SSSniperwolf back in 2021. In the video, which SSSniperwolf was paid $100,000 for, the streamer "wished" 12 times in succession, and successfully got Zhongli, the 5-star banner character at the time. The FTC alleged that the video was edited to make the gacha seem more rewarding than it actually was, noting that it wasn't possible to wish 12 times in a row uninterrupted, and that the animation was abnormal, perhaps indicating that the wishes were scripted and pre-determined.

 </h2>
 <p>
  The settlement also covers alleged mishandling of data involving minors, as well as targeting them for
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  gacha purchases. In addition to producing the multi-million dollar fine, HoYoverse has agreed to no longer sell gacha wishes to any users under the age of 16 without parental consent. All personal information from children under the age of 13 will be deleted by the company, and gacha wishes must be made available to purchase with real money, rather than first converting it to an in-game currency.
 </p>
 <p>
  A spokesperson for the game commented on the agreement, indicating that HoYoverse does not admit any wrongdoing, claiming "many" of the allegations are incorrect. However, the company has agreed to the terms because the company wants to ensure the trust of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's playerbase. The new settlement must be approved by a judge, but it seems unlikely for it to be thrown out.

  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War Ragnarok
   </em>
  </strong>
  holds an abundance of secrets and puzzles, with some being locked behind the credits of the main story. With so much to uncover in
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  , it's no surprise that there are some things best left until last, including some familiar and unexpected faces.

  One of the most interesting discoveries in
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  is where to find Sanctuary Grove, Freya's home from
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  (2018) that was actually a giant tortoise named Chaurli. Kratos, Freya, and Chaurli can have a cold reunion, but only after the credits roll.

  Once the campaign has been completed, players need to return to Sindri's House and throw the Leviathan Axe at the wind chimes to

  . Once summoned, talking to Ratatoskr will see players
  <strong>
   obtain the Pouch of Yggdrasil Seeds

  Once players arrive in Sanctuary Grove, they can witness the emotional reunion between Freya and Chaurli, the giant tortoise who has since been abandoned in Freya's blinding quest for vengeance against Kratos. It's a lovely heart-to-heart, and when facing Chaurli, players can walk to the left to find the Mirkweed plant that is needed for the Nine Realms in Bloom side quest and
  <em>

  trophy.

 <p>
  Former WWE superstar and AEW champion Samoa Joe will appear in the newly announced
  <strong>
   <em>
    Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio just revealed the latest spin-off in its
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series, which will be centered around Goro Majima losing his memory on a tropical island near Hawaii. From there, he must team up with a young boy named Noah to get to the bottom of a plot involving the yakuza and a radioactive waste dump, even becoming the captain of a pirate crew in the process.

 <p>
  The recent
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  trailer featured plenty of action, with Goro battling pirates with both sword attacks and martial arts moves. While there didn’t seem to be any shown in the trailer, it wouldn’t be surprising if Goro unleashes some wrestling-inspired finishers in his latest adventure, as past
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  games have allowed players to defeat enemies using powerbombs and suplexes worthy of the squared circle. Real-life champions of the ring like Kenny Omega, The Great Muta, and Hiroshi Tanahashi have also appeared in the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series, with Yoshiaki Fujiwara even having a recurring role as The Florist of Sai.

 <p>
  Now it looks like another wrestling legend is making his way into the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series, and he’s someone who may be quickly recognizable to WWE and AEW fans. As pointed out on the r/AEWOfficial Reddit forum not too long after
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  was revealed, Samoa Joe can be seen briefly toward the end of the trailer. While his role in the game isn’t entirely clear from the short time he was shown, it looks as if he may be an enemy pirate whom Goro and his friends may need to seek counsel at some point.

  Like many modern-day wrestlers, Samoa Joe has been a playable character in multiple wrestling games over the years, having been featured in the
  <em>
   WWE 2K
  </em>
  series during his tenure at the company. He was also added to last year’s
  <em>
   AEW Fight Forever
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  as part of its Season 4 DLC wave back in April. Outside of wrestling, Samoa Joe starred as the physical actor for Sweet Tooth in the live-action
  <em>
   Twisted Metal
  </em>
  series, and most recently voiced King Shark in
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  .

  Samoa Joe will join the growing list of wrestlers who have had their digital likeness featured in the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series when
  <strong>
   <em>

  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  game will be a major treat for those who enjoy both pro-wrestling and Ryu Ga Gotoku’s beloved series of action RPGs.

  's Lost Isle update added a plethora of items to the game, and Stink Jars are one of the most interesting things players can possibly craft. It works in a pretty unique way, allowing players to create a poisonous area on the map.

 <p>
  Before players are able to unlock Stink Jars in
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  , it is crucial that they have unlocked the Lost Isles first, as this item can only be obtained by getting resources from the Lost Isle. Unlocking Lost Isle is pretty easy as it is available from the get-go. While it might seem quite far at first, one can easily take the Battle Bus and reach it in no time.

 <p>
  Before players can actually get Stink Jars in
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  , it is crucial that they have Stink Glands first. Stink Glands can be a bit tricky to find, as they can only be obtained through RNG. Players will
  <strong>
   need to defeat the critters in the Lost Isles
  </strong>
  and hope that they end up dropping a Stink Gland.
  <strong>
   The best creatures to farm for Stink Glands are scorpions
  </strong>
  , but players can also use others such as Stink Fish that can be found in the Lost Isles. It is not known what the drop rates are, but considering that they are fairly easy to defeat, players shouldn't have a hard time defeating them and farming the Stink Glands.

  <strong>
   Once players have obtained a Stink Gland, unlocking the recipe for Stink Jars is an automatic process
  </strong>
  . With the recipe unlocked, players will then need to head to the Crafting Bench to craft Stink Jars.
  <strong>
   Alongside Stink Glands, one would also need to get their hands on Glass
  </strong>
  to craft Stink Jars. Thankfully, Glass is equally easy to obtain, so players should get going in no time. All players need to do is put 2x Sand and 1x Brightcore in a Metal Smelter, and they will get back Glass. There is a much easier way as well, which involves assigning a villager to a Smelter to get Glass.

 <p>
  Once players have a Stink Jar, they can use it as any other throwable by simply equipping it and throwing it at their desired location. It creates a poisonous area in the vicinity, damaging any creatures close to it.

      <title>Funko Fusion's Untapped IPs Carve a Unique Niche in an Industry of Crossover Franchises</title>

 <p>
  Through
  <strong>
   <em>
    Funko Fusion
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players have been able to check out some of their favorite franchises within a wild crossover adventure. They have been able to spend hours saving the timeline within
  <em>
   The Umbrella Academy
  </em>
  , have beaten back all sorts of dinosaurs within
  <em>
   Jurassic World
  </em>
  , have defeated Ramona's seven evil exes in
  <em>
   Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World
  </em>
  , and even got to see what a
  <em>
   Hot Fuzz
  </em>
  video game looks like. All of this makes for an incredibly unique adventure built for fans, with no other studio really doing it like
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  has.

  For the most part, many of the franchises that
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  has adapted have never really had a video game centered around them. Instead, they have mostly been left out of the gaming fun, and in turn, the fans have not had much to turn to. But that is all changing with
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  , and because of that, the game has been able to forge its own path and identity. Of course, it will still be compared to the likes of LEGO, but what 10:10 Games has chosen to do here is truly special.

  Funko Fusion is Adapting Franchises That Other Studios Have Yet to Touch
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the biggest names in the collect-a-thon co-op market is Traveller's Tales LEGO games, as it has explored some of the biggest IPs imaginable. However, besides
  <em>
   Jurassic World
  </em>
  , none of the franchises that
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  has adapted have gotten LEGO video games of their own. The studio did take
  <em>
   Knight Rider
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Back to the Future
  </em>
  for a brief spin in
  <em>
   LEGO Dimensions
  </em>
  , but besides that,
  <em>
  </em>
  these franchises are all new to the collect-a-thon genre.

 <p>
  Of course, Traveller's Tales is not the only one that plays around with famous IPs. But many of these franchises have gotten standalone games of their own or crossed over with others too. Arguably, it was hard to expect
  <em>
   Hot Fuzz
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Shaun of the Dead
  </em>
  would get the video game treatment, newer horror films like
  <em>
   Nope
  </em>
  have yet to cross over with anything, and
  <em>
   The Umbrella Academy
  </em>
  has mostly been left out. Along with that, franchises such as
  <em>
   Xena Warrior Princess, Masters of the Universe
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Jaws
  </em>
  have not really had any video game adaptations in a little while.

  These Franchises Let Funko Fusion Make a Name for Itself
 </h3>
 <p>
  While some of
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's franchises have appeared in other titles or had games of their own, for the most part, 10:10 Games has forged its own path. It has taken IPs that some thought would never get to shine in a crossover adventure and has made them a core part of the experience. Not only does that give this Funk-fied title a unique feel, but it also finally gives fans the video game experience they have been looking for, which is great to see.

 <p>
  Because of this,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  has built itself as the home for niche and untapped franchises. In doing so, it can avoid endless comparisons to other adaptations of the same IPs and cater to an older audience that may have grown up watching these. While it remains to be seen if that approach works, at first glance, it looks like the exact thing that this new adventure needed to make its mark.

 <p>
  Currently, the studio has plans for even more
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  characters through DLC. As of now, there is no news on what exactly those characters will look like. But, if the game's current
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  DLC is anything to go by, then there is a chance that it brings with it even more unique franchises. And although the title is already filled to the brim with untapped IPs, there is always room for some more.

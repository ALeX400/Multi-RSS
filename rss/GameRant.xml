  An impressive
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  mod turns players into the dreaded Darth Maul of
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  fame, complete with his signature double-bladed lightsaber.
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  has only been out for a week, but it has managed to sell over 10 million copies worldwide and helped boost Steam’s user count to an all-time high. Much of the game's praise stems from its combat and visuals, which draw inspiration from the classic Chinese novel
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  A handful of interesting
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  mods have already been released in the short time since the game’s successful drop, adding interesting new spins to the mythology-infused action RPG. One replaces the Destined One with Goku from
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  , a fitting change as both are directly inspired by Sun Wukong from
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  . Before that, another
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  mod turned the player’s bo-staff weapon into a double-bladed lightsaber from
  <em>
   Star Wars.

  Before creating the previously mentioned Goku and double-bladed lightsaber
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  mods, NorskPL created a reskin of Darth Maul from
  <em>
   Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace
  </em>
  and posted it on NexusMods. When combined with NorskPL's later double-bladed lightsaber
  <em>
   Black Myth
  </em>
  mod, this allows players to hunt down
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  ’s many challenging enemies and bosses as the infamous Sith Apprentice who famously struck down Qui-Gon Jin on Naboo before returning from the grave to seek his revenge during the Clone Wars.

  Darth Maul himself is no stranger to the game world, as he has appeared in numerous titles since his big-screen debut in 1999, almost snagging a starring role in a
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  game before the project was canceled. Maul’s villainy has even spread beyond the confines of the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  universe, as he has been featured as a playable skin in
  <em>
   Fortnite. Elden Ring
  </em>
  players have modeled their Tarnished after him on several occasions, and some
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  players have even explored the cosmos in a recreation of his famous Scimitar spacecraft.

  One of the most popular guns in the current season of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  is finally back to its original state after developer Epic Games reverted a recent nerf it installed on the Monarch Pistol. The Monarch Pistol is the most powerful handgun in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  currently, especially with its ultra-powerful mythical variant, which players can find by defeating Doctor Doom in the game.

  Chapter 5 Season 4 has proven a hit with fans due to the appearance of various popular Marvel characters like Doctor Doom, Mysterio, and War Machine, alongside a slew of new weapons and Marvel-themed items. Some of these items, however, like War Machine's Hover Jets and the Monarch Pistol, recently saw minor reworks in response to fan complaints about the items.

 <p>
  Now, however, as reported by ComicBook.com, Epic has reverted a recent change to the Monarch Pistol that increased its base damage but removed the damage boost players can attain while aiming down sights with the weapon. With the new changes, the pistol technically does less base damage, but with the 1.65 times damage multiplier while aiming finally back in play, its overall damage has still increased significantly.

 <p>
  The weapon also saw a major increase in its fire rate, which was lowered to 1.6 after the recent patch and is now seemingly back to its original number of 2.4, so the Monarch Pistol should be back on top when it comes to pistols this season. Of course,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  has a few different levels of rarity for each weapon, all of which have different base stats, with the rarest variants being the most powerful.

  Doctor Doom appears on the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  island as an optional boss fight this season and drops the rarest variant of the Monarch Pistol when defeated, with his Mythical version doing the highest amount of damage of all. As such, the new reversions of previous changes will have the biggest effect on Doom's version of the Monarch Pistol, making it the strongest handgun in the game this season.

 <p>
  More changes are likely to come as time goes on, seeing as Epic is constantly reworking items to change up the meta in each season of
  <em>
   Fortnite,
  </em>
  but at least for now, the latest changes have put some things back to the way they were previously. There is no way of knowing what kinds of changes or new additions may come to the main game as of now, but with

  </em>
  OG Season 2 seemingly on the way, there will be no shortage of content to look forward to.

  Developed by 24 Entertainment and published by NetEase Games Montreal,
  <em>
   Naraka: Bladepoint
  </em>
  was originally released for PC in 2021. In 2022,
  <em>
   Naraka: Bladepoint
  </em>
  became available on Xbox One and Series X/S, with a PS5 release in July 2023. Pitting up to 60 players in battle royale matches and offering vast arsenals of melee and ranged attacks,
  <em>
   Naraka: Bladepoint
  </em>
  became a big success, selling over 6 million copies over time. However, the game’s stay on Xbox One was short-lived, as developer 24 Entertainment revealed back in June that
  <em>
   Naraka: Bladepoint

  would be delisted from Xbox One on August 28.

  Now, after being available on Xbox One for less than two years,
  <em>
   Naraka: Bladepoint

  has been officially delisted and will no longer be supported on the platform. According to 24 Entertainment, this decision was made due to the technical limitations of the platform, as some new maps and events could not run properly on the last-gen console. Fortunately, players will retain access to their accounts, and can still play the popular battle royale game on Xbox Series X/S or PC.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  series has depicted several distinct worlds with fully realized lore over the years, but there are a few consistent elements that have become staples across the games. Iconic features include magic element names, characters named Cid, and one especially recognizable recurring element, a cute mascot called Moogles, which has become a hallmark of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  as a whole.

 <p>
  Moogles were first planned for
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 2
  </em>
  before being cut. Making their official debut in 1990's
  <em>
   FF3
  </em>
  before sitting out
  <em>
   FF4
  </em>
  , they have since become a staple of the series after reappearing in
  <em>
   FF5
  </em>
  . While they may not have appeared in
  <em>
   FF10
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   FF15
  </em>
  as proper characters, they were referenced in folklore, dolls, and costumes. The designs of Moogles have evolved alongside the aesthetic changes of the games, and some versions of the concept remain more fondly remembered than others.

  This is when Moogles truly gained a significant role beyond just being cute creatures, as
  <em>

  On top of retaining their most iconic look, aside from looking more fuzzy, Moogles are straight-up central parts of this title, serving roles like save points and shopkeepers. While the Mog of this title isn't directly playable, her close connection to Eiko allows for a lot of representation.

  In the world of Ivalice, Moogles were totally redesigned to resemble anthropomorphic rabbit people. This diverged heavily from previous versions, but their new lore stands as well-developed via memorable characters like Montblanc and the species' advanced technological skills.

  In the original release of
  <em>

  </em>
  , Moogles were memorable despite mostly appearing as toys and mascot figures, like
  <em>
   FF7
  </em>
  's artificial Cait Sith. Minor changes like lacking pom-poms separate them, but this was more of an alternative representation of Moogles overall.

  With a chunkier, fuzzier look in these spin-off titles, which feature mini-games like Moogle Paint, these creatures are a memorable part of a lesser-known experience.

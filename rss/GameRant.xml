  You can get a Scorbunny in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  from the start of the Max Out Season. In addition, both of its evolutions, Raboot and Cinderace, along with other Galar Pokemon also debuted. Scorbunny and its evolutions were among some of the most awaited monsters in the game.

  The September 3, 2024, GO All Out event debuts Scorbunny, Raboot, and Cinderace. While there are multiple ways of encountering a Scorbunny in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , you can only get Raboot and Cinderace through evolution. Events that feature the monster increase your chances of encountering one; you might get a High IV Scorbunny. Many are also looking for their Shiny variants and this guide details everything.

  Scorbunny is a Fire-type Pokemon and its maximum
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  CP of 1240. Its stat spread comprises 132 ATK, 79 DEF, and 137 STA, which makes it an average fighter. But the monster’s overall power and damage output increases once you evolve it.

  There are various ways of encountering a Scorbunny; you can get it in the wild, complete Research tasks, and by hatching in-game Eggs. While you can directly encounter a Scorbunny, Raboot, and Cinderance are only available through evolution. Niantic might add other ways to encounter Raboot and Cinderance.

  Pokemon GO: Get Scorbunny In The Wild

 <p>
  While Scorbunny is a wild Pokemon, events featuring the monster can increase its wild spawn rate. You can boost the wild Scorbunny spawn rate even more by strategically using different items.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Incense, Lure Modules, and the Weather Boost effect can significantly increase wild Pokemon spawn rate. Here are the steps to boost Scorbunny’s wild spawn rate during featured events.

 <p>
  You can get a Scorbunny by completing specific Research tasks. In-game content like the GO All Out 2024 Research quests reward Scorbunny encounters after completion. Unlike the wild encounters, you will get a guaranteed Scorbunny encounter upon completing the Research tasks.

  In addition to the wild and Research tasks, Scorbunny can also hatch from Pokemon GO Eggs. You can hatch a Scorbunny through

 <p>
  Tea is one of many different crops to grow and delight budding farmers and tea fans alike in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fields of Mistria
   </strong>
  </em>
  . However, tea is also one of
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  's best crops as a potent cooking ingredient that's fantastic for making recipes with some of the best stamina stats. While there are many cups of tea recipes and consumables you can buy, you'll probably only come across tea as a crop in
  <strong>
   Valen's Request for Tea quest
  </strong>
  , who wants some to restock his dwindling supplies.

  Tea is also a profitable crop with various uses in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria

  <strong>
   get tea
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  , including completing several story quests. It's also only possible to get hold of tea leaves during one particular season.

  Once upgraded, you can buy bags of tea seeds from the General Store for
  <strong>
   300 Tesserae
  </strong>
  each. This might sound pricey, but tea is a summer crop that re-grows once harvested every three days once it reaches maturity, making it a solid investment.

     It takes five days for tea leaves to fully mature into a tea plant you can harvest in
     <em>
      Fields of Mistria

  In the vast world of Bethesda's
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  , anything is possible, which is what one player found out recently during an epic encounter between a vampire, a giant, and a dragon.
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is filled to the brim with different races to play as and creatures to battle against, which is why meeting a handful of them together in the wilds is a notable event.

  Released in 2011,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls

  ’ fifth main installment in the series succeeded 2006’s
  <em>
   Oblivion

  and is set in the titular snowy region. Players assume the role of the Dragonborn and must attempt to slay the dragon, Alduin the World-Eater.
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is one of the biggest open-world games and takes a long time to beat, and thanks to its scale, players are forever finding spectacles to share with the community.

  Posted by DeadStormPirate on Reddit, an 18-second clip of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  gameplay showed a Dragonborn encountering an Ancient Vampire in the wilds. “Why you should always be aware of your surroundings,” accompanied the video, explaining the sudden arrival of a giant and the dragon, Vuljonaak, to assist in the vampire’s defeat. The
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  subreddit community was convinced all creatures of the realm hate vampires, offering one reason why they showed up as allies. Others initiated “a vampire, a giant, and a dragon walk into a bar” joke, but ultimately, the video demonstrated what happens when the world is on the Dragonborn's side.

  Players can choose to walk the Vampire path in the
  <em>
   Dawnguard
  </em>
  DLC, gaining several advantages such as
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  ’s Vampire Seduction ability. Since Vampirism is considered a disease in the game, it's no surprise why other creatures, like the giant and the dragon, would want to see the vamps expelled. However, the community also made the original poster aware that despite the giant and dragon becoming allies against the vampire, the Dragonborn would likely have to face them as enemies afterward.

 <p>
  Witnessing epic encounters, like the user’s vampire massacre, and discovering hidden details within the open world are other instances that
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  fans are accustomed to. Recently, another
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  player found a ghost flag glitch near Arcwind Point that baffled the community, and gaining other players' perspectives on these occurrences has intellectual and often comical gain for the player experiencing them.

  McGinnis is
  <em>
   <strong>
    Deadlocks's
   </strong>
  </em>
  attempt at an Engineer-style character. She deploys turrets, healing beacons, and walls to disrupt enemies, and she has her chaingun and homing missiles to bring the pain. She's one of the best laners in the game, and if played well, she can shove friendly Troopers straight into the enemy's base with little effort.

  Due to her simple but effective kit, McGinnis is easily one of the best heroes for
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  beginners. However, if you want to take full advantage of her skillset, you'll need to know what items to buy, what abilities to prioritize, and how to play her according to her strengths and weaknesses. This guide covers all of these to help you bring the best out of McGinnis.

  McGinnis
  <strong>
   excels at creating kill zones via her walls and turrets
  </strong>
  . She doesn't have as much chasing power someone as
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  heroes like Paradox, but fighting McGinnis in territory that she's locked down is extremely difficult without a significant lead. This makes her a very good split pusher, as she can often handle one or two enemies at once, as long as she has turrets to help her out.

 <p>
  The very core of this build is all about
  <strong>
   indirectly buffing your turrets' DPS
  </strong>
  . Slowing effects from Mystic Slow and Slowing Bullets give turrets more time to shoot at enemies, while Soul Shredder Bullets and Mystic Vulnerability increase the damage they deal with each shot. Turrets have very low Spirit scaling, so it's better to build these items instead of ones that give higher Spirit bonuses (unless you want to build for McGinnis' Ultimate). Slows also give you a better shot at escaping fights you can't win.

 <p>
  McGinnis' biggest weakness is her low mobility, making her a prime target for a
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  hero like Warden. Apart from having no movement skills,
  <strong>
   she only has two Stamina bars by default
  </strong>
  , which means she won't be able to roll, double jump, or air-dash as frequently. This build works around that weakness by using
  <strong>
   Fleetfoot and Superior Stamina
  </strong>
  . The former gives you a burst of speed when used, while the other grants more Stamina bars to work with.

      <title>Best JRPGs For 4-Player Co-Op, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  JRPGs have been around for a long time. When a genre survives for so long and is beloved by so many players worldwide despite being decades old, it's a clear sign that there's something special to it. Whether it's turn-based, strategic game mechanics, character upgrading options, or intricate mission design, there's always something fun to experience. It should be noted that, while games like
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  have a few traits that could make them pass off as JRPGs, they're not generally considered so, as they lack a few other features to properly fall into that category.

  One of the best features a JRPG, or any other game genre can offer, is the possibility to play with friends locally or online. There's just something special about working together with other people to achieve common goals while exploring a fictional world. Here are some of
  <strong>
   the best JRPGs for 4-player co-op, ranked

  This game combines turn-based combat with what could be considered real-time combat. It also allows for character, combos, and skill customization, which is a classic feature in the JRPG genre.
  <strong>
   White Knight Chronicles

  allows up to 16 players to log into a lobby, where they can later form parties of 4 players to go on different missions.

  Millions of players worldwide love the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise, as it has spawned multiple games across several platforms, many animated movies, and a ton of collectibles for die-hard fans. While not a part of the main series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a great spin-off that marked the return of the franchise to a Nintendo console since Final Fantasy VI.

  As it happens in many other
  <strong>
   Final Fantasy
  </strong>
  games, players can take on the role of various characters to explore the world the game is set in. One of the main elements of this game are the
  <em>
   Myrrh trees,
  </em>
  which are magical and must be found by players as they traverse through the wilderness. Unlike other games in the franchise, this title uses a real-time-based combat mechanic, which is quite refreshing.

  When the game was first released, many critics said the game's combat system felt a little simplistic and clunky, but still enjoyable, as the game mechanics gave it some depth. In 2023, exactly 20 years after the original version was released, Bandai gave players the remastered version, which allows up to 4 players in local Co-op mode.

  Set in a world where a race of angels called
  <em>
   Celestians
  </em>
  are the guardians of the realm of mortals,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest 9: Sentinels of the Starry Skies
   </em>
  </strong>
  follows the story of the main character, simply known as "The Hero/Heroine". Faced with the opposition of the
  <em>
   Gittish Empire
  </em>
  , an evil organization thought to be long forgotten, The Hero/Heroine will set out on a journey to gather the last pieces of benevolence to grow Fyggs, a fruit necessary for Celestians to gain access to the
  <em>
   Realm of the Almighty.
  </em>

 <p>
  The game allows players to customize and create the characters in their party, a feature that wasn't present in previous installments of the franchise. While in battle, the game alternates between first and third-person views, allowing for a wider perspective during combat. Players can enjoy Co-op with up to 3 other people, which adds to the experience and makes everything more fun.

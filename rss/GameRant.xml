  <em>
  </em>
  is almost ready to drop on November 14, 2024.

  While new
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  weapons and operators are included in the Battle Pass, Season 1 will add a total of 9 premium Tracer Packs to the in-game store. These packs will contain an operator skin and weapon blueprints, as well as accessories like cosmetic reticles, finishing moves, calling cards, and emblems. Four of the Tracer Packs will contain Ultra Skins: The Parasite Warrior, Eternal Hunter, G'Day Bait, and Kick Some Brass bundles. Each emphasizes a different "wild" theme, and their respective operator skins go for particularly over-the-top effects.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1109} -->

 <p>
  For example, the Eternal Hunter pack's "Volatile" Ultra Skin for Rossi turns the operator into a vampire with a bloodied mouth and glowing red eyes. The Kick Some Brass pack's "Merciless" Ultra Skin for Nazir turns the operator into a steam-powered trooper with brass armor and a stylized gas mask helmet. Kick Some Brass also includes a Mastercraft Melee blueprint for a "Chainblade" weapon with a custom weapon inspect and other effects.

 <p>
  The "wildest" Ultra Skins are designed for operator Carver. The Parasite Warrior pack's "Host," which turns Carver into the victim of a grotesque alien creature, covering him in bloody tentacles, and "Bloke Biter" from the G'Day Bait Tracer Pack turns Carver into a shark-person somewhat reminiscent of
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  character King Shark. The shark skin falls in line with other popular modern
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  premium skins like the "CODasaurus" skin from the
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  era that turned players into dinosaur-headed soldier.

  High dragons provide some of the toughest boss battles that players can encounter in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It’s more than a little intimidating when players have to fight them, thanks to their massive health bars, shields, armor, and destructive attacks that can quickly take Rook and the team out.

 <p>
  This might seem like an obvious point, but it can be easy to forget to always have an ally to hand who can offer some healing. When fighting a dragon, there must be at least one member who can heal, whether it is via spells or with potions.

 <p>
  There are usually some collectible potions spread out that Rook can use on themselves, but one mistimed dodge can lead to a lot of damage or even immediate death, so having a backup plan is crucial. Two healing companions make for an excellent safety net, though it might not be necessary when playing on the easier game modes.

  Weak spots on a dragon are highlighted in purple, but they aren’t present during the entire fight. Players should keep an eye on their front and back legs and their head, as these areas will light up purple when they are in a weakened state.

 <p>
  Rook’s ultimate ability is hugely powerful and can do a fair amount of damage. However, it is best to save this skill for when the purple weakened areas appear on the dragon. Hitting these areas with an ultimate will do even more damage than regular attacks.

 <p>
  Though it isn't advised to hold onto an ultimate for too long - as they can be recharged - it is always best to try and use it when the dragon is vulnerable.

 <p>
  Some dragons have blue shield bars, while others have yellow armor bars, much like other enemies in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . There are certain methods of depleting shields and armor. Ranged attacks bring shields down fast, while charged attacks work best against armor. This is no different for the dragon boss fights in
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Once a shield or armor bar is apparent, players should whittle it down with the appropriate attacks. If the right attacks aren’t used, it will take much longer to get rid of shields and armor. If armor and shields aren’t focused on when they appear, the battle can become particularly lengthy. This is even more so for shielded dragons, as shields will regenerate.

  When a dragon’s health bar gets to a certain level, the creature will fall to the ground and lie prone for a few moments. When this happens, its belly will become a purple weak spot. Players should hit the dragon with everything when this happens. If Rook’s ultimate is charged, they can aim it at the dragon’s purple belly to do massive damage.

 <p>
  The dragon will only lie prone for a few moments, so it's vital to make the most of the time allowed. This will happen a few times during the fight, and players should aim to be ready to pounce when the dragon falls to the ground.

 <p>
  Each dragon has its own vulnerabilities to certain elements, such as poison or electricity. While Rook’s skills and the team’s individual abilities can cater to this - such as Neve’s ice-based skills - runes are an excellent way to do different kinds of elemental damage, no matter what class Rook is.

 <p>
  The different runes in the game give various buffs, but the most useful to equip when fighting dragons are the runes that do a certain amount of elemental-type damage when activated. Only three runes can be equipped on Rook’s lyrium dagger at a time, but the element-based power-ups can make all the difference during a dragon battle.

 <p>
  The Fortify rune makes Rook invulnerable for a few moments, and this can make all the difference during a fight with a dragon. If the player is close to death, waiting for a companion's healing skill to come off of cooldown, or simply all out of potions, the Fortify rune can give them a few extra seconds, which can mean the difference between life and death.

 <p>
  This rune is useful for any situation in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , but it's well worth having it equipped during a high dragon boss fight.

  The 2010s was a standout decade for action RPGs, with Western developers producing games that excelled in both technological advances and gameplay mechanics. A noticeable trend during this time was a shift toward action, as many titles began streamlining their RPG elements and simplifying progression systems to focus on dynamic, visually spectacular combat. This era is known for big-budget sequels that took the best aspects of their predecessors, enhancing their strengths while refining areas that needed improvement.

  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands 3
   </em>
  </strong>

  <em>
   The Pre-Sequel
  </em>

  <em>
   Borderlands 2

  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  may not have had the smooth launch Blizzard hoped for, with a few early missteps that kept it from fully surpassing
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  . However, the
  <em>
   Reaper of Souls
  </em>
  expansion brought much-needed improvements, addressing many of the initial issues, expanding gameplay options, and delivering the darker, grittier tone fans had been hoping for.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  may not be as deep or hardcore as
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  , it has a broader appeal, leaning into a more arcade-style experience that makes it a fun, loot-filled adventure for isometric ARPG enthusiasts. It serves as an ideal time-killer between heavier RPGs. Its availability on multiple platforms and extended support — lasting until 2023, over a decade after its release — solidified its success and enduring popularity in the gaming world.

  From its announcement,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tom Clancy's The Division
   </em>
  </strong>
  captured players' attention with its bold vision for seamless co-op in an open-world action RPG. It delivered on that promise, becoming one of the first extraction shooters to integrate deep RPG elements, from character skills and progression to rich itemization and complex weapon and gear customization. Adding to its appeal was the post-pandemic setting in a snowy New York, creating an atmospheric backdrop that helped solidify its popularity.

  The sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Division 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , expanded the series with a fully explorable Washington, D.C., while retaining elements from the original, and even featuring nostalgic nods with the
  <em>
   Warlords of New York
  </em>
  expansion. Both games remain among Ubisoft's most popular titles, with a third entry already announced, promising to build on this well-loved franchise.

This narrative slowdown, along with disappointing financial returns, led to the series being put on hold, leaving fans without a proper conclusion to Adam Jensen's story.

  Learning from
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  's success,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Origins
   </em>
  </strong>
  marked a major reinvention of Ubisoft's flagship series, shifting it closer to an action RPG than the action-adventure it once was. Subsequent entries,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Odyssey
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  , further bridged this gap, introducing deeper character builds, diverse gear options, and even dialogue choices that add new layers to quests.

  This so-called “Assassin's Creed Mythology Trilogy” has become one of the most prominent open-world action RPGs, celebrated for its expansive, meticulously crafted historical settings, engaging combat, mythological elements, and an overarching story that appeals to both newcomers and longtime fans by expanding the series' rich lore. Ultimately, each game's setting — be it ancient Egypt or Greece — adds a unique flavor, allowing players to choose the historical backdrop that most appeals to them.

 <p>
  Obsidian's
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  is widely celebrated as one of the best entries in the series, particularly for its immersive world, memorable characters, and complex quests. On the other hand,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  introduced a deep crafting system, expanded the game's scope tremendously, and provided hundreds of hours of gameplay, with improved combat and impressive visuals. With no new mainline
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  game likely in the near future,
  <em>
   Fallout 4

  remains the go-to experience for fans of the series' single-player action-RPG style.

  The original
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  was groundbreaking as an action RPG, but BioWare took
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  to new heights by addressing nearly every critique of the first game. With a tighter, more cinematic narrative, unforgettable companions, and a diverse range of environments and missions,
  <em>
   Mass Effect 2
  </em>
  became one of the most impressive sequels of its time, winning numerous Game of the Year awards.

 <p>
  Though
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  didn't represent as big a leap as its predecessor, it leaned further into action and introduced co-op multiplayer, providing a largely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy — despite its famously divisive ending. Both
  <em>
   Mass Effect 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mass Effect 3
  </em>
  are must-plays for any action RPG enthusiast, solidifying the series as one of the best trilogies in gaming history.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings
   </em>
  </strong>
  marked a major leap for the series, particularly from a technological perspective. It was the first game to use CD Projekt Red's own RED engine, which would later power
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  . Upon its release,
  <em>
   The Witcher 2
  </em>
  was praised not only for its stunning visuals but also for its exceptional storytelling and impressive non-linearity. Player choices had a significant impact on the narrative, with entire sections of the game-changing based on decisions, offering unique quests and storylines.

 <p>
  However, it was
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  that truly elevated the franchise, expanding its richly detailed world to millions of players. By merging the cinematic narrative strength of
  <em>
   The Witcher 2
  </em>
  with a vast, beautiful open world,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  became a genre-defining achievement. For years, it has served as a model for open-world RPGs, influencing numerous games and franchises, including
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  among others.

  </strong>
  community has shared a number of impressive in-game farm builds over the years, including one player's stunning Year 7 Meadowlands Farm.

  First released in 2016,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  is a pixelated life-sim game that features farming, mining, fishing, foraging, and crafting gameplay. Players take on the role of a young farmer rebuilding their grandfather's homestead in the countryside of Pelican Town. While most players are able to complete the main story within two to three in-game years, many fans continue to expand upon their character's farms, with some multi-year builds proving to be incredibly impressive.

  Meadowlands Farm offers several unique features, such as

  . The Meadowlands Farm is considered to be ideal for livestock farming, so it should come as no surprise that memulias' beautifully designed homestead features almost a dozen animal buildings, including multiple barns and several coops, plus a couple fish ponds and even a Slime Hutch. Plots of produce crops fill out the space between livestock buildings, and a variety of tree types help to add a natural aesthetic to the industrious yet eye-catching farm design.

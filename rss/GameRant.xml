      <title>Metaphor: ReFantazio’s Mimics Lack a Vital Element They Needed to Steal from Dark Souls</title>

  Mimics hail from 1977’s
  <em>
   Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Monster Manual
  </em>
  and FromSoftware’s
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  series arguably has the creepiest take on them ever due to their alarming height on tall legs and the bone-chilling sound they make. Mimics are classic fantasy monsters whose gimmick has been seen in several high and dark fantasy or RPG franchises since, such as
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  , and even
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  with the
  <em>
   RPG
  </em>
  ’s mimics. Now that Studio Zero and Atlus have taken the plunge into a fully-fledged fantasy-inspired JRPG with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </em>
  </strong>
  , it is only natural that it, too, would adapt mimics.

   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  ’s takes on ‘mimics’ are called Imitecs and essentially play into the same function: disguised as unassuming treasure chests players would otherwise happily interact with, they are actually monsters attacking anyone who opens them. Players can easily tell when a chest is a mimic, though they can’t exploit this knowledge in the same way they can exploit an ordinary overworld enemy, and that’s a letdown since
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ’ approach to mimics could’ve been exceptional in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  ’s countless dungeons.

  ’ chests and mimics are explicitly identified by the chain dangling from them. A real chest that players can loot will have a chain curved inward, while a mimic will have a chain that is straightened outward. Of course, anyone patient enough may also notice mimic chests literally and subtly breathe.

     ’ Lloyd’s Talisman can be thrown at mimics to have them open their mouths to yield loot and fall asleep if players don’t wish to engage with them in combat, but being able to recognize a mimic apart from a chest gives players the advantage of securing a few uncontested hits on them before they’re capable of retaliating.

  Mimics are not to be trifled with idly as they dish out a ton of damage and are hyper-aggressive once active, and yet depending on players’ own damage outputs it’s possible to fell mimics before they’re able to scramble to their feet. This momentary opportunity is precious, and it would’ve been incredible if

 <p>
  Like
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ’ mimics,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  ’s Imitecs are intimidating. It doesn’t help, then, that players are unable to get a couple of whacks in before turn-based combat begins. Even if players discern that a chest is an Imitec by scanning it with Gallica’s Fae Sight, they unfortunately still can’t attack it to gain an advantage or even deal damage to it before opening the Imitec and instigating a squad battle.

 <p>
  This is unfortunate because overworld enemies can typically be flanked and hit from behind, let alone hit them from a distance, to land critical hits early and leave enemies in a stunned state on the first turn of a squad battle. Stunning enemies before turn-based combat starts is essential in many encounters, especially if players want to earn bonuses from defeating enemies while unscathed, and yet Imitecs don’t give players this opportunity.

  It would’ve been a terrific incentive to scan the environment when near chests if players could stun an Imitec and have the fight begin with that ambush state, rewarding players for their attentiveness and spatial awareness with a stunned state on a disguised enemy. Rather, players are left to consider whether they’d be better off leaving mimics where they lie or risk wasting a bunch of MP for whatever sellable item they might retrieve from them.

  Some
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  players are reporting a bug that is deleting their save data. Following its release on October 11,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  has proven to be a massive hit with fans and critics alike, marking the first entry to the
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi

  series in nearly 15 years.

  The early access period for the new fighting title foretold its massive success, pulling in over 90,000 simultaneous players ahead of the game's official release.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  sold over three million copies globally on its first day, with fans quick to applaud the game's packed roster, dynamic cel-shaded graphics, and difficult boss fights. Though the game is proving to be a dream come true for many fans of the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  series, it isn't without its problems, and one bug in particular is causing some players to give up on the title entirely.

  A Reddit post made on the game's subreddit details a particularly troubling bug that deletes save data, including cloud saves, without warning.

  <em>

  . The bug also appeared to be present during the game's early access period, with many players wondering how it wasn't addressed before the game's full release. Many have tried to reach out to Bandai Namco on social media, but the company hasn't yet released a statement regarding the issue.

  While this seems to be the most serious issue with the title at the moment, players have also had complaints about the game's difficulty. Early access players took to social media to share their frustrations with the Great Ape Vegeta fight in
  <em>

  </em>
  , prompting Bandai Namco itself to respond by telling fans to simply lower the difficulty. Some players also feel let down by the lack of a split-screen mode on all multiplayer maps, though one helpful gamer has already created a mod to remedy this issue.

  Although this serious bug is causing major problems, it seems to only impact console users. PC players are continuing to flock to the game in record numbers, with

  seeing a peak concurrent player count of 122,554 on Steam. While the game's publisher is seeing major success with the long-awaited title, a recent report revealed that Bandai Namco is cutting staff and canceling some games, including a contract project with Nintendo.

  Trading cards have been a constant interest in both the playground and the collector market. Though the trend originated with baseball cards (or cigarette cards, to go back even further), the modern conception of trading card collectibles has been defined by games like
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Magic the Gathering
  </em>
  ; not only do these playable card games have the backing of their mechanics and their franchises, but the nostalgia rooted in them has helped their value skyrocket. Certain
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  cards are especially valuable, spawning a massive collector community.

  It's no surprise, then, that the new indie release
  <em>
   TCG Card Shop Simulator
  </em>
  has been a hit. In fact, it's a shock to many that such a tycoon game hasn't been attempted prior—as the fantasy of running a card shop, though niche, is one that's at least somewhat appealing to those in the hobby. Though
  <em>
   Card Shop Simulator
  </em>
  is still in early access, it offers a lot for those interested in the (increasingly rare) art of local card shops.

  TCG Card Shop Simulator Puts Fans On Both Sides Of The Till
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Card Shop Simulator
  </em>
  has the appeal of many tycoon games, albeit with the fun twist of paperboard memorabilia.
  <em>
   TCG Shop Simulator
  </em>
  , like many business sims, removes itself from the stress and stakes of running an actual business—replacing them with the cozy repetition of basic tasks that put the player in control, crafting their empire one customer at a time. However, the colorful cards being sold spark a greater deal of whimsy than other sims—making players more invested in their own inventory.

 <p>
  On that note, though players may not be attached to the parody-Pokemon on its cards,
  <em>
   Card Shop Simulator
  </em>
  certainly replicates the dopamine rush of opening a pack. By allowing players to open packs for themselves, the game not only invites fans to the fantasy of managing bulk card quantities, but grounds them with a relatable experience. Moreover, the grading and reselling of cards is a key element to the game, with some cards being of tremendous value. Players can resell individual cards in display cases, diversifying what could otherwise be a stale experience. Similarly, the ability to host card games in-store adds to both of these roles, which will pay off in particular when the developer makes the in-game TCG playable (which is included in
  <em>
   Card Shop Simulator
  </em>
  's roadmap).

  A Dash Of Satire Sets Card Shop Simulator Apart
 </h3>
 <p>
  Being a niche hobby, collectible card hobbies have been the target of many jokes—jokes that
  <em>
   TCG Shop Simulator
  </em>
  wears with pride. The game's low-poly models, which see semi-detailed humans squished into PS1-era shape-people, grant by themselves a humorous charm. Furthermore, the stink mechanic is a fun take on what could otherwise be a disparaging stereotype. Running up to customers with a cleanser spray to rid them of their cloudy, green aura is a comical little way to play off an old joke and vary up gameplay.

Once you've assembled a team of your favorite anime characters, you'll also need to take care of their upgrade and equipment, which is quite difficult, especially if you're a beginner without resources.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
   </em>
  </strong>
  used to receive a relatively common stream of updates. Now, the game is old enough to have been set in stone quite some time ago.
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  recently received a sudden update, and it's worth looking into for players who want to stay at the top of their game.

 <p>
  It's not an exaggeration to say that
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  is losing speed, if not dying outright. It's not uncommon for developers to lay a project to rest by the time they begin working on a sequel, but
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  has always been a uniquely unfortunate case. Nintendo has not only halted support for the game, it has occasionally gone out of its way to outright obstruct the community. With that in mind, the update released on October 8 could not have come as more of a shock.

  To understand why the new update feels so out of left field, one only has to look into the two previous updates. Before October 8, the last update to
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  was released on February 14 of this year. That may not seem like that long ago, and it isn't. However, the update before that was released as far back as December 2021, which also marked the final balance patch.

 <p>
  Thanks to the severe imbalance of
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  's DLC fighters, players have never stopped demanding another update. Likewise, any time a new update is announced, an extensive balance patch is the first thing that tends to come to mind. Unfortunately for those fans, the October 8 update has a different focus entirely.

 <p>
  Fans looking for balance patches will inevitably be disappointed by the October 8 update, which makes no mention of character changes whatsoever. Instead, the update seems to be focused on what most players would consider relatively minor issues. Considering
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  could announce a sequel at any moment, any update whatsoever comes as a surprise.

   Online: Fixed an issue in which Global Smash Power would not return to appropriate levels when the connection was disrupted with specific timing at the end of a match.

  <li>
   Note: There may be compatibility issues with replays from Ver. 9.0.0 to 13.0.2. Replays from Ver. 8.1.0 and earlier are not compatible. If you want to keep your replays, convert them into videos before installing the update. You can do this via Vault → Replays → Replay Data → Convert to Video.

  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's Latest Update Has Some Unfortunate Implications
 </h3>
 <p>
  Version 13.0.03 may not have been the sweeping update that some players had hoped for. In fact, one of the only two sections is less of an update, and more of a piece of advice. It is customary at this point for
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  updates to render the replays in previous versions unplayable, so it's nice that the patch notes would warn players who may not know. Other than that, the update is a simple bug fix for
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  's online ranking system.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1014} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The release of this update may have come as a surprise, but the message going forward couldn't be more clear. It's wishful thinking to believe this would lead to further updates, let alone anything as ambitious as a sweeping balance patch. Instead, this may very well be the last update
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  ever receives. While the bad news is obvious, there is a bittersweet angle. A decline in support for
  <em>
   Ultimate
  </em>
  makes the development of the next
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros
  </em>
  . game on the Switch successor that much more likely.

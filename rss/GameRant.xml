   <strong>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </strong>
  </em>
  features a world full of life with NPCs going about their day and engaging in various activities. You'll come across some wounded soldiers in the Cooling Towers region who survived a Monolith attack but aren't ready to face another one. The group's commander, Maj. Rodetsky asks Skif if he can help them fend off the second Monolith attack, starting the Matter of Honor side quest.

  After entering the Cooling Towers region in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, players can start the Matter of Honor side quest by visiting the
  <strong>
   Material Assets Storage POI
  </strong>
  . The mission starting point is a building located in the southern part of the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you arrive at the location, you'll hear radio
  <strong>
   chatter between Maj. Rodetsky and Lt. Tryhub
  </strong>
  , discussing about saving themselves from another Monolith attack. Maj. Rodetsky will invite Skif inside the building where he'll request Skif to assist them in fending off the second wave of Monolithian soldiers. Accepting his request will start the Matter of Honor side quest in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  .

    <p>
     There's a bug in A Matter of Honor quest that the door to the building, where Maj. Rodetsky invites Skif to, is locked. If this happens, you'll need to go towards the left side of the building with the broken windows and move around the wall a bit to trigger the conversation and accept the mission.

  The first optional objective you should certainly do is to
  <strong>
   heal up all three wounded Duty soldiers
  </strong>
  near Maj. Rodetsky. Two are near the major and one is lying next to the entrance. Once they're healed, they'll help you defend the position.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, exit the room and turn right to spot a ladder going up to the roof. Reach the top and take the sniping position as a wave of Monolithian soldiers will almost immediately spawn. They'll start coming from the front, so you can either use your own weapons to take them out or grab an
  <strong>
   SUV-MK S-3 sniper rifle
  </strong>
  from the dead body.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's recommended that you switch between a sniper rifle and an assault rifle, depending on how far the soldiers are. Make sure to eliminate them quickly as if they damage Tryhub or Maj. Rodetsky enough, the mission will fail. Once the Monolith assault is thwarted,
  <strong>
   talk to Maj. Rodetsky
  </strong>
  and he'll reward Skif with a decent amount of coupons, making A Matter of Honor side quest in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  complete.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been a cultural phenomenon since
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3
  </em>
  defined open-world video games back in 2001. The brand was redefined further with the hugely successful launch of
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  , which spawned an entire livable world full of dedicated players. Due to the runaway success of
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  , however,
  <em>
   Rockstar
  </em>
  somewhat neglected the single-player experience, allowing a whopping 12 years to pass between
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  and the highly anticipated
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  With money on the table for so long, publishers would presumably be scrambling to fill that void, but there has actually been a stark lack of successful alternatives. That's not to say a few titles didn't forge their own paths for the latest console generation. Any gamers looking to fulfill that crime power fantasy can certainly do worse than these great PS5 games similar to
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  's single-player offerings.

  signature heists to their core elements with a roguelike progression system that sees players level up with minor perks across multiple run-throughs. The game attempted to differentiate itself by adding star power, casting iconic names like Michael Madsen, Chuck Norris, Danny Trejo, and Kim Basinger.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sadly, that seems to have consumed the majority of the development budget with no meaningful planning options and missions mainly consisting of shooting wave after wave of bullet sponge goons. It falls more into the camp of so bad, it's good. For fans looking for a B-movie gangster epic starring the above, it's more than worth its moderate price tag.

  It's fitting that a series that began life as a shameless
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  clone has gone full circle after venturing out into some insane territory to forge its own identity.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Saints Row
   </strong>
  </em>
  is, unfortunately, another game that promises more than it delivers, although it is still one of the closest game to that
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  formula on the PS5.
 </p>
 <p>
  When
  <em>
   Volition
  </em>
  rebooted the series in this fifth installment, they returned to turf wars and an open-world crime sandbox. It lacks the depth and character of its inspiration, but it does sprinkle an extra dose of chaos and customization options in keeping with the series' roots for anyone looking to experiment.

  Likely a more direct inspiration for
  <em>
   Crime Boss: Rockay City
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Payday
  </em>
  series has cornered the market of multiplayer heist simulators.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Payday 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  was not as well received as its predecessor largely due to a familiar problem with bugs and connectivity issues that have plagued previous launches.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans felt rightly aggrieved at another lack of overall polish on a
  <em>
   Payday
  </em>
  product, but like the previous entries, the developers have supported it well post-launch. With a dedicated fanbase and a slew of technical improvements and DLC over the past year, there's never been a better time to jump into

  Moving back to the open world but away from adverse crime, we find another latest in a popular series,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Far Cry 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Set in what is essentially a reimagined Cuba, players take on the role of a freedom fighter attempting to overthrow the oppressive regime.
 </p>
 <p>
  For those who enjoyed the compelling narratives and moral ambiguity of the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Far Cry 6
  </em>
  is arguably the best option. It perhaps doesn't quite match the hype of those pre-launch trailers, but it's still a great villainous performance from Giancarlo Esposito.

  <em>
   Ubisoft's Watch Dogs
  </em>
  is another series that has long-drawn parallels with
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  . The latest entry,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Watch Dogs: Legion,
   </strong>
  </em>
  was slightly less well-regarded than the previous entry, but it's easily the most ambitious game in the series — and maybe the genre, making every NPC recruitable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Watch Dogs: Legion
  </em>
  has impressively fleshed-out hacking mechanics to differentiate it while retaining that open-world GTA feel. It also features a very well-realized near future London map to explore for any players looking to relive the thrill of the lesser-known
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto: London 1969

  It's worth clarifying, that this list is attempting to rank games on the overall quality of the experience they aim to provide, as opposed strictly to their likeness to
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  , which would likely have seen
  <em>
   Saints Row
  </em>
  as the unwarranted top recommendation.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Teardown
   </em>
  </strong>
  bears little mechanical resemblance to
  <em>
   GTA,
  </em>
  but it does offer a very different take on one of its most popular features, the heists.
 </p>
 <p>
  The indie hit features a series of destructible maps with players given unlimited planning time to prepare their route. Once the heist begins, the timer drops to just 60 seconds to grab all the loot and reach the getaway vehicle. Players are essentially limited only by their imagination.

  Given the enormous hype during the build-up of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </strong>
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   CD Projekt Red
  </em>
  would have hoped it would have been talked about as an industry juggernaut of its own, but it instead serves as an apt substitute for
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  . To be fair, much of the damage was done in an infamously disastrous launch with the game released in a frankly unacceptable state.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a shame how frequently that has come up in this small subsection of AAA games. Like the aforementioned, though, the game has received enormous support post-launch and is in a much better state today.
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  offers a hugely dense open world to explore and some deep character progression options — not to mention an incredible narrative running through the dark streets of Night City.

  The
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series began life as a melee-focused
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  alternative based on the infamous Japanese crime syndicate, but it truly has taken on a life of its own, becoming one of the best-regarded AAA series around.
  <em>
   Yakuza: Like a Dragon
  </em>
  successfully reinvented the series as a turn-based RPG, and the sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth,
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the best of all worlds.
 </p>
 <p>
  A rich open world, an engaging if convoluted narrative, a healthy dose of wackiness, and a more fluid combat system that highlights the perfect blend of approaches across the series.
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  is an excellent game in its own right.

  Playing a survival horror game solo can definitely help increase the tension and immersion of the gameplay. Still, there's nothing wrong with jumping in with a friend occasionally as part of a co-op experience. Thankfully, anyone looking to experience the horrors together with a friend as part of a multi-player story doesn't have to look much further than the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  series, which contains plenty of fun and unique titles that allow multiple people to partake in the story at the same time, without needing to spectate or wait their turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there have been several multiplayer modes seen throughout
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , such as the immensely popular multiplayer, this list will focus on those games that specifically feature two to four-player campaigns, rather than extra modes. With that being said, it's time to take a look at every
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  game that features a co-op campaign.

 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_4">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Before jumping in, this list will only consider games that can still be played in co-op today, so those where the servers have been shut down, like the
     <em>
      Outbreak
     </em>
     games, won't be counted.

  After the series ventured off into the action genre with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   6
  </em>
  , Capcom decided to try and bring things back to basics with
  <em>
   Revelations 2
  </em>
  , which featured a much slower and methodical gameplay style to create a scarier overall horror experience. Being able to play with a friend doesn't make the game any less terrifying, especially since only one player will be able to fire a gun while the other can only use a flashlight or another key item to help their partner out when they need to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Making it so both players control unique characters with their own sets of weapons and tools results in some pretty experimental stages and puzzles where players are encouraged to think outside the box to progress to the next area. Alongside its inventive gameplay and creepy atmosphere,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Revelations 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  also features a compelling story and an extremely memorable villain in Alex Wesker.

  Because it features four campaigns,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  ends up being a pretty lengthy thrill ride of a game, which is often considered to be somewhat of a refined taste due to its action-heavy gameplay and over-the-top setpieces. While the game is, therefore, far from bad, it's truthfully a lot more enjoyable when a friend is along for the ride to also be a part of the outlandish hijinks that this title has become synonymous with.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Ada's campaign was originally restricted to single-player upon release, Capcom decided to add in the Agent character so that every story would be co-op compatible. There are even points in the story where a pair of players can come across another pair who are running through a different campaign, resulting in brief missions where four players can be in the same space at the same time.

 <p>
  Though
  <strong>
   <em>
    Operation Raccoon City
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes players back to the horrific outbreak that was first explored in the second and third games, this isn't exactly a faithful retelling of those events. Instead, it's a "what if?" scenario, allowing the game to be as creative and ambitious as it wants and giving players the option of teaming up with up to three other players to explore Raccoon City, all while gunning down hordes of zombies and B.O.Ws, and even meeting a few familiar faces along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though having four players in a series that is known for its methodical horror-filled gameplay may seem like overkill,
  <em>
   Operation Raccoon City
  </em>
  leaves behind a lot of the slower elements of the traditional gameplay, making it much faster-paced and more of an action shooter. As a result, having four people at once feels completely fine, and if anything, is barely enough to fend off the staggering number of zombies thrown at players in each of the fourteen missions across the entire game.

  Just like classic arcade on-rail shooters such as
  <em>
   House of the Dead
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Umbrella Chronicles
   </em>
  </strong>
  allows two players to blast their way through its levels at the same time, without needing to use a split screen. The game retells the events of the first and third game, along with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 0
  </em>
  , granting players the opportunity to relive these classics, but this time, with a friend.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gameplay follows a fairly streamlined loop of shooting down swarms of enemies who become progressively stronger and more durable as the level goes on. Quick reloads and twitch reflexes are crucial for making it through this game in one piece since it's often considered to be one of the trickiest entries in the series. This and the
  <em>
   Darkside Chronicles
  </em>
  are also good games for introducing new players to the series, allowing them to get up to speed with the story while having a ton of fun with the gameplay in the process.

  plays more or less identically to
  <em>

  <em>
   Code Veronica

  and
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  , but even an entirely new story in Operation Javier, which builds upon the relationship between Leon and Krauser, which is later referenced in the mainline titles.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gameplay of

  is a little more chaotic and action-packed than what came before it, but it also contains plenty of extra lore nuggets that newcomers and veterans alike will find a lot of value in. The game's intense and enjoyable co-op gameplay is complemented by its excellent pacing and character development, immersing players into each of the personal stories from beginning to end.

  Though there have long been rumors that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  was originally going to be a solo adventure for Chris, somewhere along the line, Capcom decided to introduce a newcomer by the name of Sheva, who, in the full release, accompanies Chris throughout the entire story. This allows a second player to jump in either locally or online to embark on an epic adventure through Kijuju with a friend where they will come up against all kinds of horrors, from Lickers to Chainsaw Majini, all the way to giant zombified trolls.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reason
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  is so beloved as a co-op game is that it makes this feature a focus for many of its levels. For example, many boss fights will require one player to distract a boss, while the other flips a switch or loads up a rocket launcher to finish them off for good, and this is just the tip of the iceberg of how creatively the game utilizes its co-op feature.

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has discovered a Druid build capable of dealing a surprising amount of damage. It's not a new occurrence of broken builds appearing throughout the
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  seasons, with updates making adjustments that end up making certain characters too strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are plenty of episodes of builds that quickly gained the attention of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players, such as the Whirlwind Barbarian. This build became popular because it allowed the Barbarian to make the most of his melee nature, being good both for the endgame and for leveling up. In Season 6, it was the turn of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players to find a broken Spiritborn build, which, combined with the Unique Sepazontec and Guardian Spirit mechanics, made the new class dish out surprising damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time it's the Druid who's in the spotlight, as
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  streamer Rob2628 has found a new broken build for the class. In one of the videos, he shows the Druid doing exorbitant amounts of damage to the point where the numbers appear negative. The most impressive part is that this happens while the player is at Pit 150, the highest level of endgame activity in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  . In another longer video, the well-known member of Blizzard's ARPG community theorizes about why this build is so powerful.

 <h2 id="cataclysm-druid-is-diablo-4-39-s-new-broken-build">
  Cataclysm Druid is Diablo 4's New Broken Build
 </h2>
 <p>
  In the second video posted by Rob2628, he says he doesn't know exactly why the build does so much damage. He has his theories, however, which revolve around a bug due to Cataclysm scaling with the class's most powerful multipliers, resulting in a shower of numbers when hitting enemies. Cataclysm is one of the Druid's Ultimates that cast twisters and lightning bolts over a long duration. With the start of the seventh
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  season, there are even more reasons for the build to become popular, such as the Ultimate's interaction with the Unique Mjölnic Ryng ring, and being able to benefit from the Voice of the Stars gem.

 <p>
  Curiously, this isn't the first time the Druid has come to the fore in the game's current season. Previously, Rob discovered another broken
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  Druid build during the Season 7 PTR. The build in question was the Boulderstorm, a variant of the Boulder build, which focuses on causing area damage using the Dolmen Stone and the Metamorphic Stone. So far, Blizzard has not addressed this case, so players wait to find out if adjustments will happen or if the devs will keep the build just as it is.

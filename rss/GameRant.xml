  <em>
   <strong>
    Crusader Kings 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  added a few new mechanics with the "Scythe" update, which came out alongside the
  <em>
   Legends of the Dead
  </em>
  DLC. One of them is
  <strong>
   Legitimacy
  </strong>
  , which measures how much a ruler's subjects respect their right to rule.

 <p>
  In general, successful wars and social activities improve a ruler's Legitimacy, while failed wars and diseases reduce Legitimacy. More important rulers need more Legitimacy, while counts and dukes only need a little. Many actions become harder when your Legitimacy is too low in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  , but extra Legitimacy can be surprisingly powerful.

  You can check your ruler's current Legitimacy at any time by checking the crowned head icon in the lower-left corner of your screen. This icon doesn't open up a menu, but you can see your current Legitimacy level by hovering your cursor over it.

  The Legitimacy bar always has five levels, and the names of each level are always the same. However, the Legitimacy level your ruler needs and the amount of Legitimacy you need to reach each level depend on a few factors:

 <ul>
  <li>
   How powerful your vassals are, and how much they like you. Close family members and nobles you personally empower need less Legitimacy than nobles with claims on your titles or rivals.
  </li>
  <li>
   How many of your vassals belong to your de jure titles, and how many belong to "foreign" titles.
  </li>
  <li>
   How long your vassal's house has served your ruler's dynasty.
  </li>
  <li>
   The rank of your primary title. Counts and dukes need less Legitimacy than kings and emperors.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your ruler's rank and cultural era also increase your Legitimacy needs. A Tribal count only needs 60 Legitimacy to reach level 1, "Aspiring," while a High Medieval emperor needs 210 to reach the same rank.
  </li>

 <p>
  Regardless of your rank or vassal demands, the highest Legitimacy level any ruler needs to meet is 4, "True." This means that every ruler can get the extra benefits that come from reaching level 5, "Ordained."

  <em>

  applies several bonuses or penalties depending on whether your ruler is above or below their expected Legitimacy level. Some of these bonuses are the same no matter how close you are to your expected Legitimacy, while others scale based on how close you are to the expected number.

 <p>
  If your expected Legitimacy level is 1, and your current level is 0, your penalties will look like you're two levels away instead of one. Likewise, reaching level 5 when your expected level is 4 will give you something between the one and two-level bonuses. This means a count can benefit more from high Legitimacy, and an emperor may suffer more from low Legitimacy.

 <p>
  The amount of Legitimacy you gain or lose for each action doesn't change, but the amount of Legitimacy you need to change levels goes up as you gain ranks and enter new eras. This means that it takes more Legitimacy actions to improve your standing late in the game, but it also takes more disasters and tyrannical actions to reduce your standing. This effectively means that Legitimacy swings wildly in tribal nations, but tends to be more stable in large, late-Medieval empires.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the next release in the long-running fantasy RPG franchise by Capcom. After two full decades of entries,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  aims to bring a fresh chapter to life. Announced during last year's Game Awards, the wait for this next installment is nearly over, as the game is scheduled to release sometime in 2025.

  Last year, Capcom had one of the best releases of 2023 with the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  remake, but 2024 still has plenty in store for the developer.
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  was one of the first big releases of the year, and although it may not be a perfect game, it still garnered a lot of love from many players. However, the biggest success for Capcom was at this year's Gamescom, as
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  was one of the many high points of the event.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  looks to be an exciting new direction for the franchise, but it also may be taking notes from the aforementioned
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  when it comes to camps.

  Recycling One of Dragon's Dogma 2's Best Features
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  had several features that stood out as a fantasy RPG, especially the camp system. In its predecessor, players had to find an Inn if they wanted to restore their character back to health after a long day of travel. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  changed this, placing various pre-set campsites throughout the map for players to utilize.

 <p>
  It seems like
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is expanding on this concept in an even more compelling way. While out in the field, players can set up camps as bases instead of going back and forth between hubs and the field. What makes this even greater is that these campsites can be used as fast travel points. This completely elevates the
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  camp mechanics, and it could be a game-changer for the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise. That isn't all, though; once a hunt is finished, players do not have to return to the village. Instead, players are given the ability to resupply from whichever camp they are stationed at.

 <p>
  There are many upgrades to be excited about in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , but one of the biggest draws of the game has been its embrace of improving the in-game environments. Environments in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  are being put front and center, and this new camp system is a strong example of the care being taken into its development. With the inclusion of various campsites and fast travel, traversal in

 <p>
  The implementation of diverse mechanics in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is truly shaking up the series formula, and it's for the better. As gaming rapidly evolves, franchises have to follow suit, and Capcom taking note of such fast change will only help the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  games in the long run. Day and night cycles that cause monsters to behave differently, weather that affects combat, and more advanced monster AI are setting
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  up to be a strong release for 2025.

 <p>
  All of these new and improved features combined set the stage for a wonderfully crafted world, and the camping system will allow players to experience each map point in a more enjoyable way. While more news about
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  continues to surface, it will be fascinating to see if the game has taken any more inspiration from
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  .

  Oracles are exclusively Atlantean units. Gamers will receive three of these units when they start a game as an Atlantean civilization. They have a unit ability to see farther and beyond, which is why they're great scouts. Exploring the map is crucial to gaining knowledge of your enemy's settlements and the resources that are available nearby.

  <strong>
   To get more Oracles in

   , players have to interact with the Temple and select Oracle. Gamers need 40 Food and 60 Gold to build an Oracle

 <p>
  When an Oracle is standing still, their line of sight increases gradually, allowing them to scout the nearby area effectively. However, if they're moving, they won't be able to activate the ability. Additionally, while the Oracle's visibility range is impressive, they move slowly and are weak in combat. Thankfully, gamers can improve the Oracle unit by turning it into a Hero Oracle.

 <p>
  When playing as an Atlantean civilization in
  <em>
   Age of Mythology: Retold
  </em>
  , gamers can turn villagers and Oracles into Heroes by selecting them and choosing the Hero option. Once Oracle are turned into Heroes, they remain slow-moving units with low combat strength but
  <strong>
   their sight becomes twice as effective and expands faster
  </strong>
  . Just like other Hero units, Hero Oracles deal more damage to Myth units and can pick up Relics from the environment.

  While there are better Hero units in the game, Hero Oracles have their own advantages, so if you can spare the resources, it's definitely worth turning Oracles into Hero Oracles in
  <em>
   Age of Mythology: Retold

      <title>10 Best Turn-Based JRPGs On Steam, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The RPG genre these days is truly immense, and there are a lot of games that could fit under that umbrella term.
  <strong>
   JRPGs
  </strong>
  are a particularly venerable subgenre, and a lot of major RPG hallmarks can be traced back to it.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":218} -->

 <p>
  Despite its age, the JRPG subgenre is still going strong. The franchises that started the trend, like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  , are still coming out with new entries, and newer series are still joining the throng as well. Here are ten of
  <strong>
   the best turn-based JRPGs currently available on Steam.

  The tactical side of the JRPG genre is often underrepresented in comparison to the more traditional party-focused approach to turn-based combat. Tactics have a rich history in the JRPG space, and there are few games that demonstrate that history better than
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tactics Ogre

  The JRPG genre benefits just as much as any other type of game from the technical advancements that the gaming industry is constantly receiving. As the
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  series demonstrates, though, the industry never forgets its past. The original 2018 game debuted a charming HD-2D artstyle, blending the esthetic sensibilities of the classic RPGs with modern console capabilities.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Octopath Traveler 2

This title more thoroughly connects the storylines of the game's eight protagonists, while also debuting new travelers' tales; shorter adventures that let two characters interact more closely. There are also a number of quality of life upgrades, such as the ability to quickly transition between day and night.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  franchise is one of the biggest names in the JRPG genre, and for good reason. Recently, the franchise has transitioned to a more action-oriented combat system, but many fans still prefer the turn-based approach, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 10/10-2 HD Remaster
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an exceptional example of it.

 <p>
  As the title suggests, this game combines
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  and its direct sequel, boasting a visual overhaul to make both games shine on modern PCs. It also includes content from the international edition which was previously only released in Japan and Europe. For hardcore JRPG fans, this two in one deal is an excellent way to experience one of the high points of the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series and get to know the lovable characters that carry the story.

  Atlus is best known these days for the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games, but that series is only part of a much larger overarching franchise.
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  is a sizable media franchise which incorporates a lot of spinoffs, but the core series is a set of dark turn-based RPGs set in grim worlds where monsters rule.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Shin Megami Tensei 3

  is a standout title, considered by many to be the pinnacle of the series. The recent HD remaster lets fans who got hooked on the most recent
  <em>

  </em>
  games in on this venerable title, which boasts considerably less forgiving combat than its spinoff. JRPG fans who really want to test the limits of their skills should consider giving

  a try.

  In addition to a total graphical overhaul,
  <em>

  also introduces several quality of life upgrades and even adds new content in the form of additional character interactions with new voice acting. The game is missing upgrades from
  <em>
   Persona 3 Portable
  </em>
  , most notably the ability to play as Kotone, but with so many improvements under its belt, this is still a fantastic entry.

  The JRPG genre is most commonly associated with fantasy, and even less conventional entries like the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games still include supernatural elements.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a major exception to this rule. Like its predecessor,
  <em>
   Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  follows Ichiban Kasuga, a former Yakuza member, and restricts its action to the real world.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":974} -->

 <p>
  Despite its lack of supernatural elements,
  <em>
   Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  is still one of the most outlandish JRPGs on the market. Ichiban's adventures often take a truly absurdist direction. Players will be fighting killer robots, helping a crayfish find love, and photographing strangers in an on-rails shooter minigame. Combat in the game is bizarre too, with Ichiban and his friends taking on a variety of everyday jobs and using them to fuel some extremely silly and brutally effective moves in combat.

  The
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  franchise is a foundational part of RPG history. The series has been influencing the genre since 1986, and it's still going strong today.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest 11 S
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the most recent mainline series entry, is an excellent modern JRPG that pays homage to the genre hallmarks that earlier
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  games originated.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11 S
  </em>
  features a story that is epic in scope without losing the humor and quirkiness that has always helped the franchise stand out. The Definitive Edition, available on Steam, expands this already massive game with additional character scenarios, an enhanced musical score, and even the ability to play the whole game in 2D with 8-bit graphics, truly bringing the franchise back to its roots.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Chrono Trigger

  </strong>
  is undoubtedly one of the most renowned JRPGs ever made. The title revolutionized the industry when it launched in 1995, and is still considered by many to be one of the greatest video games of all time.
  <em>
  </em>
  The version on Steam includes updated graphics and gameplay content that wasn't present in the original release, making it a must-have for JRPG fans.

 <p>
  This title features gameplay innovations like multiple endings and character-driven sidequests, which are considered mostly commonplace in the modern RPG genre. Its unique battle system reinvigorates the tried and true turn-based formula with an additional strategic edge, letting multiple characters act at once to perform powerful moves together. From the gameplay to the story, every aspect of
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  is legendary, and JRPG fans would be doing themselves a disservice not to play it.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy

  is a truly immense franchise, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  stands apart. This was the first 3D
  <em>

  game, and it would set the standard for just about every mainline series entry to follow. While the original game was a PS1 exclusive, it has since been ported to Steam with a number of enhancements and quality of life upgrades.

  The impact that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7

  has had on both the
  <em>

  </em>
  as there are main series
  <em>

  games, and thanks to the ongoing

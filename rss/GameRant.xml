  Open-world games are all about giving the player as much freedom as they can muster, but in massive worlds, the player's probably going to need a vehicle to get around. The very best open-world games throw caution to the wind and let the player use their vehicle as a weapon, too, resulting in all kinds of chaos.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it's futuristic hot rods with machine guns attached to the hood or remote-controlled trucks being used like battering rams, plenty of open-world games have great creative uses for vehicles as weapons.

  Though
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  was released in a bit of a sorry state, it's hard to deny that Night City and the driving experience were anything less than exceptional. CD Projekt Red worked hard to imagine what the automobiles of the cyberpunk future would look like, even the free four-wheeled menaces, resulting in all sorts of mayhem.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, any of the game's vehicles can be used as a battering ram against foes galore. Still, several of the fancier vehicles have autonomous weapon systems and can be remote-controlled. In Night City, the player's ride is their fortress.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  games, particularly post
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  , have been adored for their chaos-generating game design where simple encounters can turn into impromptu action movies as things get increasingly chaotic. While each game differs in approach,
  <em>
   Far Cry 6
  </em>
  takes an interesting retro approach to vehicles.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's because the game takes place in a fictional parallel of Cuba where the majority of vehicles are actually outdated compared to modern day. That means the old-school cars take center stage as the distinct voice of the game and can act like brutal battering rams as the player careens through the humid streets at top speed.

  From the very first reveal of
  <em>
   Watch Dogs
  </em>
  , the implicit fantasy was that the player could hack anything in the world and take control. While that fantasy has waxed and waned throughout the franchise, none has gone quite as hard as
  <em>
   Watch Dogs: Legion
  </em>
  in trying to deliver on that original promise.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Watch Dogs: Legion
  </em>
  , not only can the player play as almost any NPC on the streets of dystopian London, but a whole range of hacks become available where vehicles can become remote-controlled death-dealing machines where the player doesn't even need to drive them. Every vehicle is a theoretical weapon, resulting in some genuinely creative setpieces.

  Even for 2008,
  <em>

   2
  </em>
  was a little old-fashioned. Where games like
  <em>
   Call of Duty 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  were trying to push AAA video games into the realm of the cinematic telling of Hollywood-style stories,
  <em>
   Mercenaries 2
  </em>
  was a much simpler proposition from a bygone era. Just have as much fun as you like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Mercenaries 2
  </em>
  is a massive sandbox where everything is susceptible to being torn down by explosions. In the sheer chaos of utter destruction, players can pilot all manner of offensive vehicles to assist in the chaos. In
  <em>
   Mercenaries 2
  </em>
  , players are responsible for their fun, making it a quiet cult hit among its fans.

  Before
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  , other game devs were still trying to out-compete the brilliance of Rockstar open-world crime simulators, and
  <em>
   Saints Row
  </em>
  was the main competition. However, while
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  tends to counterbalance its silliness,
  <em>
   Saints Row: The Third
  </em>
  leaned into absurd comedy and chaos, which separated it from the pack and helped it become one of the most beloved entries in the entire series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, the absurd comedy doesn't just come from weapons or the story, but also from the wide variety of crazy vehicles that become the Boss's most fearsome weapons. Sci-fi, fantasy, and horror are all on the table, with a toybox sensibility at every juncture.

  The
  <em>
   Just Cause
  </em>
  franchise has always prized massive maps, fast mobility, and chaos at every turn. These games are all about causing the biggest explosions imaginable while navigating a massive map with countless hours of fun. While protagonist Rico Rodriguez has his trademark grappling hook and parachute to play with, vehicles also play a big role across the entire franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the latest entry in
  <em>
   Just Cause 4
  </em>
  , the vehicle list is just as big as it's ever been, stretching from rickety three-door cars all the way to military-grade tanks. Vehicles are one of the best ways to cause massive destruction in
  <em>
   Just Cause 4
  </em>
  , especially when they're rigged to blow with a small country's worth of C4.

  Most open-world games tend to fuse vehicles and on-foot action, giving equal attention to both. However, particularly in modern open-world games, it's increasingly rare to find a game that prioritizes vehicle combat over on-person combat, so
  <em>
   Mad Max
  </em>
  still stands out today as one of the best vehicle-based open-world games ever made, and it remains surprisingly well-connected to the movie series too.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the game, players are encouraged to upgrade their Magnum Opus, Max's signature car, which will become their primary weapon in the game from the first hour to the very last. Grappling hooks, weapons, wheels, and roaring engines are where the fun is found here, and the Magnum Opus is one of the best open-world vehicles ever designed.

  Despite being over ten years old, open-world games are still struggling to compete with
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  . Los Santos is the ultimate playground for players looking to let loose, and its ever-growing roster of vehicles largely defines it.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the base game has its share of military vehicles, the continuing success of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  means that increasingly wild vehicles populate players' garages, ranging from flying cars to gun-toting mobile fortresses. At this point, it seems that only the upcoming
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  could surpass it.

  <strong>
   Xu Wu
  </strong>
  is one of the game's unique Cephalopod-type monsters, similar to the Oilwell Basin's apex predator, Nu Udra. Your first encounter with Xu Wu is further on in the storyline while first traveling into the
  <strong>
   Ruins of Wyveria
  </strong>
  and encountering monsters with strange effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  After taking down Guardian Ebony Odagaron, Xu Wu will appear and claim what's left of its carcass, dragging it back to its nest nearby. Your hunter will lead a pursuit and a battle ensues soon after called 'A Hunter in the Void.' You'll have the opportunity to fight different variants of Xu Wu in later assignments and optional quests, including:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Consumer of Void:
   </strong>
   Optional Quest (HR6 or higher required)

  Xu Wu is one of the more unique-looking monsters encountered in Wyveria, and you shouldn't let its smaller size fool you into thinking that it's a pushover compared to other beasts in the region. Its unique attacks can slice and dice you down to size if you're not careful, but it still comes with its own batch of weaknesses for you to exploit with the perfect combination of gear and items.

 <p>
  Xu Wu's main
  <strong>
   elemental
  </strong>
  <strong>
   weakness is Ice.
  </strong>
  While there aren't too many weapon sets up to that point imbued with Ice,
  <strong>
   Hirabami
  </strong>
  is one option. If you recall, that encounter is not too far back in the Iceshard Cliffs, and it's featured in other optional quests as well after defeating it for the first time. It may be worth it to double back and grind for a Hirabami weapon, if it falls within your chosen weapon category.
 </p>
 <p>
  You could also consider a
  <strong>
   Poison-imbued weapon
  </strong>
  such as the ones from
  <strong>
   Rompopolo
  </strong>
  , as Xu Wu is very susceptible to the Poison status ailment. Or if you prefer using ranged weapons such as the Bow or Bowgun, you can wield special ammo to take advantage of those weaknesses.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for armor, you'll want something with
  <strong>
   substantial Dragon elemental resistance,
  </strong>
  as Xu Wu's attacks inflict that type of damage.
  <strong>
   Nerscylla
  </strong>
  is a decent choice with 2 Dragon Resistance on each piece.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Your best option, though, is
  <strong>
   Guardian Ebony Odagaron
  </strong>
  , the monster you fought right before Xu Wu.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Along with great overall defense stats, it also carries
  <strong>
   4 Dragon Resistance
  </strong>
  on each gear piece.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also consider crafting and equipping a
  <strong>
   Dragon Charm talisman
  </strong>
  , which grants additional Dragon Resistance. Depending on your overall gear situation, the choice is up to you.

 <p>
  Many of Xu Wu's attacks are generally what you'd expect from a Cephalopod-type monster. Its tentacles are its main weapons, and they each feature a blade point that it can use for brutal slashing and projectile attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of its more unique attacks include a Dig ability where it will
  <strong>
   burrow underground and attempt to ambush the hunter with its fanged mouth.
  </strong>
  It can also grab the hunter in its tentacles, and you'll need to use your slinger ammo or a stab attack to break free. If you don't inflict enough damage in time, Xu Wu will follow up with a brutal attack before finally letting go on its own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Xu Wu has a number of weak points that are breakable or severable. Its Head is the biggest and easiest target, and can be broken. Adjacent to that, its Mouth is another breakable point. Meanwhile, each of its arms is severable and can be carved separately for valuable crafting items.
 </p>
 <p>
  As mentioned before, Xu Wu is most vulnerable to Ice and Poison-laden attacks, so prioritize those while
  <strong>
   inflicting and destroying Wounds
  </strong>
  . Just keep in mind that its wounds will appear blue rather than red. The more consistent you are with damage, the less opportunity Xu Wu will have to retaliate.

 <p>
  Battle Bot can be completed in as little as 60 seconds. Seasoned players know this event by heart and can get it done in virtually no time. To complete the event, head to Mount Blair Trainyard. If the event hasn't been completed recently, it will automatically start.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players need to kill the security robot, recover two keycards from two nearby Mr. Gutsy Robots, and hit the keypad on either side of the locked building. Doing this will open the door to the building, allowing the player to
  <strong>
   loot all the valuable junk that is lying on the countertops and inside the various cabinets.
  </strong>
  Players typically walk away with adhesive, steel, circuitry, and a plethora of other goods.

  <strong>
   Uranium Fever has a good balance of difficulty, XP gain, legendary enemies, and the amount of junk available,
  </strong>
  making it a popular public event. To put it simply, players need to defend three extractors to mine uranium ore. As the extractors do their job, endless waves of Mole Miners attempt to destroy them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mole Miners are great for gathering loot. Not only do they drop weapons that can be scrapped for steel and other basic components upon death, but players also have a chance of getting some black titanium from downed Mole Miners.

  Moonshine Jamboree is one of the more difficult public events that can pop up on any given server. To complete the event, players will need to protect three moonshine stills from waves of Gulpers, Fog Crawlers, and other tough enemies. They'll also need to fill a bathtub inside the main building with Acidic Gulper Venom.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the event is relatively difficult, players will receive some pretty great rewards upon completing the event, such as rare plans, legendary items, and Raider Reputation. However, putting the rewards aside, more often than not, gulpers can be looted for lots of acid.
  <strong>

  </strong>
  <strong>
   Moonshine Jamboree is the fastest way to get lots of acid.

  Seismic Activity is one of
  <em>
   Fallout 76's
  </em>
  nuked events. Because it requires the player to launch a nuke in order to start it, the player will need to complete a large portion of the main storyline first. However, since this is a public event, if another player launches a nuke over Abandoned Mine Shaft 2, all players on the server are able to join the event.
 </p>
 <p>
  To complete the event, players will need to work together to take down the Ultracite Titan, which has the ability to summon endless waves of Mole Miners. As mentioned in the Uranium Fever entry above,
  <strong>
   Mole Miners are great for farming steel from weapons and black titanium.
  </strong>
  Also, once the Ultracite Titan has been taken down, players will be awarded some Ultracite scrap. This is a rare resource that is very handy for crafting many late-game items.

  Eviction Notice is the hardest public event in
  <em>
   Fallout 76.
  </em>
  Thankfully, it's also very popular, so there are usually plenty of players that attend the event when it pops up. Eviction Notice is also the best event in the game for farming legendary items. However, it's also pretty good for getting a healthy amount of common junk.
 </p>
 <p>
  To complete the event, players will need to keep a small army of Super Mutants at bay and defend the Rad Scrubber. Since Super Mutants typically drop a weapon and other random loot upon death,
  <strong>
   it can be pretty lucrative for farming junk.

  Launching a nuke over Monogah Mine will trigger the event A Colossal Problem. This event sees players head inside the collapsing mine and take on Earle Williams, a hugely mutated Wendigo Colossus.
 </p>
 <p>
  As players attempt to take down Earle Williams, Wendigo will pop up all over the place. These creatures, when killed, have a very high chance of dropping screws and fiberglass spools, plus other junk items. However,
  <strong>
   the screws and fiberglass spools are the best items to pick up from these creatures.
  </strong>
  Upon completing the event, players will also be awarded with some random flux, which is one of the most useful and rare components in the game.

 <p>
  The Scorchbeast Queen was
  <em>
   Fallout 76's
  </em>
  first main boss battle. While there have been several new bosses introduced throughout the years,
  <strong>
   Scorched Earth is still one of the most popular events to attend in the game.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  While it's not particularly lucrative for gathering large quantities of junk, successfully taking down the Scorchbeast Queen does provide the player with some random flux. Players can also scoop up various random loot from enemies that have spawned during the battle. Despite being a very tough enemy, veteran players can take down the queen in just a couple of minutes. This makes Scorched Earth a quick stop for quality components, provided that veteran players are in attendance.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Radiation Rumble is another tough public event. However, like many of the other tough events in the game, it tends to be popular. The more players that attend, the easier the event becomes. To complete this event, players will need to defend Scavengers while also collecting and depositing ore. During the first few minutes of the event, players will be swarmed by Radiated Ghouls. These, when killed, tend to drop a variety of junk items.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the event progresses, more difficult enemies such as Snallygasters and Deathclaws start spawning.
  <strong>
   These enemies also have lots of valuable junk items that can be looted.
  </strong>
  For those who like to pick up lots of loot, this event is perfect as there are so many enemies, each one dropping various junk items for players to snap up.

  Players in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  will come across a few regions in Kuttenberg where they won’t be welcome, and will have a lower reputation with the locals. One such area is the vicinity of
  <strong>
   Sigismund’s camp
  </strong>
  . Inside the camp, players can find a side quest waiting for them, but the first challenge is getting past the guards. The camp has multiple entrances, all watched over by
  <strong>
   soldiers who might demand Groschen
  </strong>
  or tell you to leave on sight.

  Once inside, players will find various merchants and services, including
  <strong>
   Captain Puta

  , who offers the
  <strong>

  </strong>
  quest. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to begin and complete the quest, along with details on potential rewards and challenges players may face.

  Once you find Puta, he’ll assume you’re there for the
  <strong>
   requisition of supplies from Bohunowitz
  </strong>
  . Depending on the time,
  <strong>
   he may ask you to return the next day
  </strong>
  at noon. Wait for the marker to appear in the camp, then speak to him and confirm that you’re ready. In Bohunowitz, you’ll have several objectives,
  <strong>
   mainly collecting supplies from villagers
  </strong>
  . First, talk to
  <strong>
   Bynyek
  </strong>
  near the cart — he can reveal hidden food locations if you pass a speech check. Failing it means you’ll have to search on your own.

  Head to Smil's house and

   speak with Farmer Smil
  </strong>
  . He’ll tell you the supplies are just outside the front door. Loot the sacks, then circle around the house to find the barn. Since Puta won’t be satisfied with only the food the villagers offer, you’ll need to search for hidden supplies to avoid a conflict between the villagers and soldiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the barn,
  <strong>
   head to the far right corner to find another sack of food
  </strong>
  . Exit and look west for a locked door requiring Hard lockpicking. Inside is a wine cellar that completes the hidden beer objective. Report to Captain Puta, and he’ll handle the rest. You can also
  <strong>
   head south from the barn into the forest
  </strong>
  , where you’ll hear cow noises. Once you
  <strong>
   find the cows, report to Puta.
  </strong>
  He’ll send someone to collect them while you continue searching for food.

  If you want to avoid a fight,
  <strong>
   try adding your own Groschen to the chest
  </strong>
  and convince Puta to take fewer supplies. Regardless of how you complete the quest,
  <strong>
   you’ll return with Puta and receive 175 Groschen
  </strong>
  . Alternatively, you can
  <strong>
   kill Puta and the soldiers, making the villagers happy
  </strong>
  . This also lets you loot the dead soldiers’ armor, which you can sell to merchants in any town or village. Kuttenberg has plenty of merchants, so take your armor there.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  continues to introduce new themes and game mechanics with each new competitive season that comes and passes. Season 15 made an interesting change through the introduction of Perks, which operate as pickable passives that can be unlocked for your choice of hero as you progress through a match.
 </p>
 <p>
  As of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 15, every single playable character in the game has four different Perks - two Minor Perks to choose from, and then two Major perks that can be combined to create a combined loadout of one from each category. DPS Perks in particular do a lot to amplify this role in terms of dealing damage, securing elims, and applying pressure. A select few DPS Perks stand out as the best overall options due to the huge impact they can provide your team.

 <p>
  Back prior to his
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  rework, Bastion has the ability to heal himself with a push of a button. Through the Self Repair Major Perk, this ability has returned to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  and quickly made its way to the top as a clear standout choice. Bastion is great for applying heavy pressure due to his powerful DPS potential - particularly in turret mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this is also when Bastion is most vulnerable, and he can often be out-damaged by combined focused fire. A Self-heal helps to balance this out in Bastion's favor, but the huge advantage to the Self Repair Perk is the fact that it has no cooldown, meaning Bastion can consistently top off his own HP whenever he needs to.

 <p>
  Sojourn's Ultimate, Overlock, is already a lethal weapon in the right hands - and Overcharged only adds to this impact. Sojourn is great for any player who has good aim mechanics, with the ability to secure consistent picks by applying damage and hitting your railgun shots to finish them off.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unlimited railgun shots of Overlock can easily turn a team fight in your favor if you hit your targets, on a base level. Overlock increases the maximum energy of Sojourn's Railgun by +50 whenever Overlock is active, meaning Sojourn can effectively one-shot kill squishes whilst this ability is active. This is a huge threat and makes Overclock even more valuable as an ultimate, causing Sojourn to remain one of the strongest picks in the game.

  Torbjorn has received some of the best Perk load-outs in the game, buffing the likes of his cooldowns and the impact of his Turrets. Fully Loaded is a Minor Perk that will automatically fully reload Torbjorn's ammo whenever he uses the Overload ability. As Torbjorn's right-click is often used to chip away chunks of damage from tanks, especially with overload, this makes him even more lethal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Torb can now start applying damage with left or right clicks until he is about to use his last round of ammunition, and then his Overload - which not only increases his attack damage and speed, but will now also fully reload, letting him apply even more rapid damage and huge pressure both on Tanks through focusing damage, and on enemy supports by causing them to utilize powerful cooldowns to heal through the pressure of this focus fire.

 <p>
  One of Sombra's best escapes, or 'get out of jail free' tools, is her Translocator. While it can be used in various ways, such as engaging in a fight for EMP or on an isolated target for a Hack + Virus combo, in more recent seasons it has become more of an escape tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is due to automatically triggering Sombra's Stealth passive upon use - giving her the chance to scramble back to cover, her Supports, or a nearby Health Pack before re-engaging the fight. The CTRL ALT ESC Minor Perk gives Sombra even more self-sustain tools, as now when she Translocates out while on critical health, she will begin a passive health regeneration as well as her Stealth, meaning she can skip dipping off for heals and stay hidden closer to the fight for a quicker re-engagement into the fight.

  Cassidy's Fan the Hammer ability is great for both chipping away at shields or the bulky HP of Tank characters, as well as throwing out quick, rapid fire to confirm a kill on a squishy. Fan the Hammer is constantly used in various combos to quickly kill such targets, along with his stun, roll, and melee, and Quick Draw provides a massive buff to this ability, making Cassidy even more of a threat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quick Draw enables players to individually control each shot of Fan the Hammer, rather than it being a rapid fire ability with a lot of knockback on your crosshair. As Fan the Hammer is absolutely lethal when all shots are landed on a squishy under 100% health, a Cassidy with good aim can take this Perk to the next level.

  Torbjorn is one of the strongest or luckiest characters in terms of Perks received on their Season 15 release. There are almost no bad options with Torb, and his combinations all work really well together. Anchor Bolts provides a huge buff to Torbjorn's Turret, both increasing Torb's throw range by 50% and enabling it to stick to both walls and ceilings.
 </p>
 <p>
  This enables Torbjorn to get really creative with where he places his turret. He can even throw it onto a wall or rooftop, in which he knows the enemy will be pushing in, all from a distance. Every single Overwatch player who has ever encountered a very well-hidden Turret knows just how much of a pain that darn thing can be to get rid of, so Anchor Bolts truly lets Torb maximize such opportunities.

  Venture has remained more of a niche pick throughout the seasons of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  . However, the Excavation Exhilaration Minor Perk gives players much more incentive to pick up the archaeologist enthusiast and try them out. When this Perk is selected, each time a player activates Venture's Ultimate, Tectonic Shock, their ability cooldowns refresh 300% fast, enabling players to essentially spam them.
 </p>
 <p>
  This gives huge play potential for Tectonic Shock, which was already solid at creating pressure on its own. Venture can now Drill Dash or Burrow into the fight, activate Tectonic Shock, and gain a refresh of these abilities in no time at all to continue to assist them in confirming kills and then escaping back out of the enemy team if needed.

 <p>
  Junkrat's Steel Trap is a thorn in the side of many
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players. One of the only abilities on the game that still hard CCs the enemy, Steel Trap provides a pesky annoyance to the enemy team on cooldown, and some easy value for any Junkrat main who knows all of the tricky spots and angles to set them up.
 </p>
 <p>
  With Aluminium Frame, Junkrat's throw range on his Trap is increased by a whopping 50%. Junkrat could already launch his trap pretty far when angling upwards, so with this Perk increased, this is extended a surprising amount. Junkrat can then continue to harass the enemy with his Trap on cooldown, but instead launch it deep into the enemy backline from safety of natural cover, or being behind a Tank.

The Cryo-Storm Major Perk significantly buffs Cryo-Freeze by adding a passive slow and damage effect to all nearby enemies within an AOE of Mei's ice.

  This pairs exceptionally well with Mei's Wall ability, as players can get clever and use the wall to first trap the enemy in. She can then deal damage in close range, and then initiate Cryo-Freeze to apply extra damage and a slow, giving the opportunity to either follow up with the likes of her Ultimate Ability or for her team to focus fire and gun down the enemy as the wall drops, killing them before they have a real chance to escape.

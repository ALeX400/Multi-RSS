  <em>
   <strong>
    Cat Quest 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  has shipped a new major update that adds Mew Game mode, a unique and refreshing way to play for those who have completed the game. This brand-new mode in
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  arrives roughly six months after its August 2024 launch.
 </p>
 <p>
  While finishing a game and then never picking it up again is perfectly fine, it is also understandable to be interested in continuing to play even after completing the campaign. For the latter type of player, who likes to keep going long after wrapping up the story, replayability of a game is a major factor in deciding how long they keep revisiting it. To address this, many developers include a New Game Plus mode that typically lets the player restart the campaign but with all the unlocked benefits from the original playthrough. In this area,
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  developer, The Gentlebros, has historically gone a step further with its own Mew Game mode, which has been a part of
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  since the first entry in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  devs have now finally added the much-awaited Mew Game mode to the action RPG title as part of the latest update. This feature is available in addition to the New Game Plus mode and brings a range of different modifiers into the mix. These options offer the ability to enable certain in-game limitations and gameplay tweaks to make the game more challenging for enthusiasts. While the "Nine Lives" modifier affords the player just nine "Game Over" results before the save file gets deleted, the "Fast Furwards" option doubles the gameplay speed for those looking for a faster playthrough. For
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  players looking for a more relentless challenge, there are modifiers that spawn a better variety of buffed-up enemies or disable leveling up, armor, weapons, and upgrades. Additionally, there are options to restrict the player to using only magic spells and also limit the damage inflicted by the player's ship to a value of one.
 </p>

    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  Apart from the Mew Game mode, the new update also comes with a few bug fixes and balancing tweaks. On the one hand, the damage dealt by Mewteor and Ice Paw has been reduced by a small margin. On the other hand, the bug that caused some
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  items to be available at an unreasonably high level has also been resolved. Further, the shield dodge animation has also been reworked to make it more unique.

  The inclusion of Mew Game mode in

  has brought what looks like a fun combination of gameplay modifiers, aimed at retaining player interest long after the game's completion. This may further incentivize the players looking to explore the Gentlebros-developed co-op game's alternative story endings to kick off a new campaign.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
   </em>
  </strong>
  players are hosting a special "revival week" for the 2019 reboot in an attempt to temporarily boost the game's player count and fill multiplayer lobbies. While the original
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  series spanned between 2007 and 2011, Infinity Ward shocked fans in 2019 when it revealed a fresh take on the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  subseries by rebooting the iconic title. With the shooter approaching its sixth anniversary later this year, fans are now attempting to bring some life back to the critically acclaimed
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 2019 reboot marked a monumental turning point for the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​franchise. Just as many fans believed the series couldn't get any bigger,
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  introduced a huge overhaul of the IW engine as well as the introduction of the series' smash-hit Battle Royale title in 2020,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  ​​​​​​. While later entries in the rebooted
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  series would go on to receive largely negative reviews, many
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  players loved the gritty atmosphere and realism of the original game. Now, almost six years after its initial release, fans are attempting to give
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>

  ​​​​​​one final goodbye with a planned revival week.

  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Players Plan 'Revival Week'
 </h2>
 <p>
  From March 20 to March 27,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
  </em>
  players are planning a "revival week" in which fans of the shooter once again populate the game's servers. The event is being planned by Reddit user Rising709, who took to the
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  subreddit earlier this week to promote the scheduled revival. There seems to be no designated region or platform for the revival, so the hope is that enough people will boot up the game during the week that players all around the world will once again be able to jump into a lobby with ease. With 2019's
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  being among Infinity Ward's best, plenty of fans have expressed their eagerness to jump back in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although plenty of fans said they would participate in the event, Reddit user Comprehensive_Ad4291 pointed out that the week of March 20, 2025, could very well see the return of Verdansk in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  , which could prevent many players from jumping back into
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  . The fan-favorite Battle Royale map holds a lot of nostalgia for
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​players, which is why publisher Activision confirmed the map would be returning in Spring 2025. While there has been no word on an official release date, leaks suggest Verdansk will make its comeback with Season 3 of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ​​​​​​, which should arrive sometime in March.

  The success of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  OG sparked a new trend among live-service titles, as
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  will soon become the latest series to follow in the footsteps of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and bring back a classic map. Plenty of other massive titles, such as
  <em>
   Overwatch,
  </em>
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  , and more have already brought back classic gameplay features and maps for a limited time in hopes of recreating the same success as
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  did back in 2023. It's unclear if the return of Verdansk will have the same effect, but there's no denying that
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  players are desperate to return to this iconic Battle Royale map.

 <p>
  The CEO of the developer behind
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time
   </em>
  </strong>
  has shared some exciting updates on the upcoming game. The action-adventure RPG, developed by the Osaka-based studio Level-5 Comcept, is set to launch on the Nintendo Switch in April 2025. The original
  <em>
   Fantasy Life
  </em>
  debuted worldwide in 2014, receiving widespread acclaim from players.
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time
  </em>
  is designed as a sequel, bringing the series into the modern console era.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2016, the
  <em>
   Fantasy Life
  </em>
  series received a spin-off titled
  <em>
   Fantasy Life Online
  </em>
  , launched exclusively for mobile platforms. While it didn’t receive as much praise as the mainline game, it garnered a mostly positive reception.
  <em>
   Fantasy Life
  </em>
  is known for its color-soaked visuals, distinctive cartoon style, and whimsical character design. With the cozy gaming genre currently surging in popularity and the success of the first installment,
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i
  </em>
  is shaping up to be a highly anticipated release in 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  As spotted by Gematsu and shared on Twitter, Level-5 Comcept CEO Akihiro Hino announced a slight delay in the release of major news regarding
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i
  </em>
  . He attributed the delay to factors such as new hardware and platform compatibility. Hino also mentioned that the game’s visuals have evolved, its content refined for a more enjoyable experience, and that
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i
  </em>
  is on track to be an outstanding RPG. The post also noted that new information will be shared soon.

 </h2>
 <p>
  The mention of new hardware and platform compatibility is likely to further fuel speculation that
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i
  </em>
  could be released on PlayStation. Earlier this year, Gematsu shared a screenshot of the upcoming game listed on the PlayStation Store, though the listing was quickly removed. Hino's latest comments suggest that this rumor may have some credibility. However, there has been no official confirmation yet regarding a multi-platform release for the new game.

 <p>
  For fans of other cozy genre titles like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i
  </em>
  is a 2025 game release to watch. With the game announced two years ago, the last mainline title releasing over a decade ago, and multiple delays during development, the April release of
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i
  </em>
  can’t come soon enough for many long-time fans of the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Level-5 has a strong lineup of RPGs, and for many fans,
  <em>
   Fantasy Life
  </em>
  is considered one of the best. The news from the company’s CEO adds weight to the possibility that the game may be released on both the Switch and PlayStation, which would be exciting for gamers. However, even if that doesn't happen, the April launch will still be a moment of joy for fans.

  Gamescon 2024 had some interesting reveals, but one of the biggest and most exciting surprises for many was the announcement of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mafia: The Old Country
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This is a series that hasn't received much attention since 2016's
  <em>
   Mafia III
  </em>
  , but now it finally has a new entry.
  <em>
   Mafia: The Old Country
  </em>
  promises something new and different. This one's a prequel to the other games, and changes settings entirely. Where the original game dealt with the Italian Mafia in the US,
  <em>
   The Old Country
  </em>
  chronicles the early days of the mob back when it was located in Italy. The decision to move out of America and offer a perspective not seen as often is definitely something that has the potential to make an interesting
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  game. Unfortunately, fans eager to play this new adventure are going to have to wait.
  <em>
   Mafia: The Old Country
  </em>
  doesn't even have a firm release date, beyond being expected
  <em>
   sometime
  </em>
  this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily, players eager to dip their toes into the world of organized crime have options for similarly-themed games to play while waiting. Gangsters have been a staple of Hollywood since the days of James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson, and, naturally, they've found their way into a lot of video games. Players eager to jump into the shoes of the mob have plenty of options for things to try while waiting for
  <em>
   Mafia: The Old Country
  </em>
  .

  The
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series is no stranger to crime, but it reaches a new level in
  <em>
   Syndicate
  </em>
  . This one follows the twins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate Victorian London, a setting known to have a high crime rate thanks to heavy class division. And it just so happens the Templar Grand Master is using a gang called the Blighters to further his agenda. So what can Jacob and Evie do to break his iron grip and free London? Why, start their own gang, of course! This becomes a large part of
  <em>
   Syndicate
  </em>
  's format, as much of the game centers around Jacob and Evie lessening the Blighter's power over various London districts so they can move in with their gang, the Rooks. This one is admittedly closer to
  <em>
   Gangs of New York
  </em>
  than
  <em>
   The Godfather
  </em>
  , but it still features plenty of gang-related action for players to partake in, even if it's more likely to involve bludgeoning the Blighters with a cane than pumping them full of lead.

  Often when people think of the mafia, they tend to imagine the violence that comes with it. Usually, people imagine an Edward G. Robinson-type smoking a big cigar and emptying a Tommy gun into a former ally. This is the image we see a lot in movies and what often becomes the focus of video games, but it's not all just shootouts and fine dining. At the end of the day, the mafia is a business and needs a capable boss to run it. This is what makes
  <em>
   City of Gangsters
  </em>
  unique. It effectively makes the player the Godfather, and foregoes the usual violence in favor of tasking the player with building up and managing a prohibition-era gang. That means generating revenue, overseeing production and distribution, employing staff, and setting up places to sell booze. And since this is prohibition and everything going on is totally illegal, it also means having to find ways to keep the authorities off their back. It turns out that being the Don isn't as glamorous as it looks.

  The
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  series takes a lot of inspiration from iconic gangster movies, so what if there was a way players could explore one of the films that inspired it, but as a game? Well, turns out there is.
  <em>
   The Godfather
  </em>
  , easily one of the most iconic gangster movies and a huge influence on the
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  series, has its own video games. The 2006 adaptation and its sequel casts players as an original mobster whose story intertwines with the movies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Developer Redwood Shores went as far as to get several of the original actors to reprise their roles from the films. They even managed to
  <em>
   almost
  </em>
  get Marlon Brando to return as Vito Corleone, and only failed because his poor health made the audio unusable, not that it stopped his iconic character from returning in digital form. This one may show its age now, but at the time, seeing
  <em>
   The Godfather
  </em>
  return in video game form was a huge deal, and at a time when licensed games had a reputation for being terrible, it really managed to surprise a lot of players.

  Though perhaps one of the most obvious choices, Rockstar's controversial series is easily one of the biggest icons of crime in video games. There's a reason it inspired so many other titles, including
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  . Obviously, the big selling point of the games is, well, grand theft auto, the act of stealing a motorized vehicle (something
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  players are undoubtedly familiar with), but of course, the real reason the series is so controversial is just the sheer range of crimes that can be committed. Each installment takes place in a thinly-veiled analog of a major American city which basically acts as a playground for those who want to indulge their inner criminal without worrying about little things like "ethics" or "collateral damage". Nothing is off the table as far as crime is concerned. Kidnapping, murder, theft, vandalism, destruction of public property. Sure, the police might get called but there are ways to evade them.
 </p>
 <p>
  But for those more interested in the story-driven format of
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  does offer a scathing commentary on American society. The destructive potential it offers is also used as a means of satirizing real-life issues like economic inequality, racism, organized crime, and corruption in business and government. A lot of these themes are at the heart of each game's story.

  Rockstar's famous detective simulator uses a similar format to
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  but with a twist. Instead of playing as a crook, this one centered around being a cop and solving crimes rather than perpetrating them. Of course, one theme the game loves is exploring just how thin the line between cop and crook can get. It can be tough being a half-decent cop in a world so full of corruption and brutality. That does mean a big part of the game involves conducting investigations and finding clues, but it also comes with plenty of action sequences and shootouts against various criminals. The perspective of a cop still allows the player to get caught up in all sorts of issues with criminal underworld-organized crime, petty crime, police corruption, and shady business dealings. Ironically, a lot of the very types of crimes that might be perpetrated in a typical
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  game.

  Maybe some players aren't overly concerned with the story. Maybe they just want the thrill of breaking into a place and making off with a huge pile of cash while outwitting the police. Well, then, there's
  <em>
   Payday
  </em>
  . This series of multiplayer shooters (currently three installments) casts players as professional thieves who work together to pull off heists with big payouts. There are, of course, different ways of accomplishing that goal. More tactful players might try the stealthy approach of getting in undetected, disabling security systems, and avoiding guards, whereas less patient ones can jump straight to pulling out their guns. Either way, the game's heists have a reputation for getting messy and explosive, and a big part of pulling off a successful heist is knowing what to do when the cops show up, whether that's to open fire or try to buy time with hostages. It's an intense experience but when done right the "heroes" (as much as they can be called that) get to escape with
  <em>
   a lot
  </em>
  of money.

  Another one from Rockstar (notice a pattern here?),
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  follows the tragic story of an outlaw gang struggling to survive in the final days of the Wild West. While it might not be the organized crime
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  players are more accustomed to, it is still a harsh story about doomed protagonists trapped in a world that is slowly closing in on them, with much of the story concerning how they cope with their impending doom. This is actually something that fans of
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  or even just gangster movies should relate to, as it's not too far off from the final act of most gangster plots. This is basically the part where everything the hero worked for comes crashing down and they meet their inevitable end. And of course, there is also the opportunity to commit plenty of crimes, with options for how honorably they're committed. The player won't be able to commit conventional grand theft auto here because of the setting, but they can steal horses, wagons, and even
  <em>
   trains
  </em>
  if they feel so inclined.
 </p>
 <p>
  Interestingly, despite
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  being more of a western,
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  players might find one particular plot point interesting. There's a section involving a gangster named Angelo Bronte, who is running what could basically be described as a proto-mafia. Literally, a precursor to the one that would become so iconic during Prohibition.

  Some people like gangster movies but aren't a big fan of
  <em>
   The Godfather
  </em>
  . Let's face it, it's beautifully filmed, but it's also a long, convoluted plot that can be very difficult to follow. Maybe they'd instead prefer something like the iconic 1983 Al Pacino film
  <em>
   Scarface
  </em>
  , which probably had a lot of influence on the
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  games. Well, they would be in luck, because it just so happens that the infamous mobster Tony Montana is playable in
  <em>
   Scarface: The World is Yours
  </em>
  . This 2006 sequel presents an alternate ending where Tony survives the film's climactic shootout, then goes on a quest to rebuild his criminal empire and get revenge on his nemesis.
 </p>
 <p>
  This being the guy who's famous for shouting "Say hello to my little friend" while brandishing an M16, that means committing a lot of murder and mayhem. But it has one other thing going for it that isn't seen in a lot of crime games. After all, Tony Montana was the boss, so a big part of the game is also
  <em>
   running
  </em>
  the syndicate. This is actually something that doesn't happen in a lot of crime games, many of which tend to put the player character in conflict with an existing boss.

  United Front's cult classic puts players in an interesting position, as they play an undercover cop trying to infiltrate a Triad organization in Hong Kong. This is an interesting way to blur the line between cop and crook since it involves a character ostensibly acting for the law while simultaneously having to commit crimes to maintain his identity. The Hong Kong setting also allows for a very distinct environment from the
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  series. After all, the Triads (the common name for mafias operating out of China) are a well-established form of organized crime in film, especially when it comes to their presence in Hong Kong. Hong Kong action movies are basically their own genre at this point. But weirdly, they haven't been seen all that much in video games.
  <em>
   Sleeping Dogs
  </em>
  is a rare exception, one that offers a glimpse into a criminal underworld that hasn't been explored in a lot of detail. Sure its gameplay might be a bit different. There's more hand-to-hand than shooting, but it still allows for plenty of vehicular carnage and a morally ambiguous adventure through the world of organized crime.

  <em>
   Mafia: The Old Country
  </em>
  promises to bring players into the early days of the Italian Mob, but some players may be a bit too eager to dive into the world of organized crime. Well, they might have to wait for the mafia, but for those who aren't too picky about nationalities, they could try the Yakuza. And fittingly, there is an entire series of
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  games. Now for sure, the gameplay is a bit different here, and things can sometimes get weird. There isn't so much car theft, and players are more likely to beat up their enemies than fill them with lead, but it does follow a lot of very similar themes. The series follows various protagonists as they try to navigate the complicated and morally ambiguous world of organized crime in Japan, an environment that easily breeds corruption, betrayal, greed, and violence. A big part of the games is the struggle to do the right thing in a world that relentlessly tries to shatter your moral compass.

      <title>League Of Legends: The Hardest Characters To Play, Ranked</title>

  There are over 160 champions to choose from in
  <em>
   <strong>
    League of Legends
   </strong>
  </em>
  , which means there is something for everyone, including a wide range of skill levels. Just as there are many beginner-friendly
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  champs for those taking their first steps on the Rift, there are also plenty of difficult options.

  The
  <strong>
   hardest champions in
   <em>
    League
   </em>
  </strong>
  often have lots of tiny mechanics which take dozens of games to learn and to get the most out of their kits, players must play on a knife's edge.

   There are many debates about the hardest champs to play in League, with some champions being harder to figure out at first while others have an achievable skill floor, but a skill ceiling that can take years to reach. This list is mostly focused on those who are hard to pick up at first, with some champions being so confusing or complex that many players are put off even attempting to pilot them.

 <p>
  There is also application to consider. For example, early-game and difficult champions like Kalista and Nidalee are useless if players don't get ahead on them, which is hard to do for beginners.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Catching Draven's axes between autos completely changes the play pattern of an ADC.
  </li>
  <li>
   If players don't play aggressively and get ahead, Draven will be practically useless.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Most ADC champions or marksmen play in pretty much the same way, and picking up a new one usually isn't too hard. However, Draven is a notable expectation to this rule. What makes him much harder to pick up is that after every auto, Draven should ideally catch the axe he just threw, which means completely repositioning.

 <p>
  Draven wants to catch axes for two reasons. Firstly, he will deal more damage and can reuse his W for a burst of movement speed. Secondly, every catch results in an extra stack, which he can hopefully cash in by securing a kill. This is how Draven gets strong. Predicting where axes will land, dodging enemy attacks, and chasing down opponents while catching axes are all hard for newcomers to Draven. Even once players have learned to farm with Draven, and they feel comfortable in small bot lane skirmishes, transferring these skills to teamfights is another problem.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Qiyana's elements change the way her abilities work, and the difficulty lies in selecting the right one for each moment.
  </li>
  <li>
   She has a number of surprisingly difficult combos.

 <p>
  To those who don't play Qiyana, she doesn't appear to be the hardest of champions. However, anyone with in-depth knowledge of the mid lane assassin, knows that there's a big difference between a newcomer fumbling around with her abilities and a main who has mastered all the combos for maximum damage.

 <p>
  Qiyana has a plethora of combos and they all need to be executed at lightning speeds, but the other tricky thing about her is knowing which elements to use and when. For example, there are times when using her invisibility makes more sense than her stun, even if the latter seems like the better option at first.

 <p>
  Riven has always been considered one of
  <em>
   LoL's
  </em>
  hardest champions, and when people think of animation canceling and complex combos, she is likely the first name that pops into their head. In terms of jumping into a game without any prior experience, Riven's abilities by themselves aren't that hard to understand or use. The problem is that players will deal very little damage without the correct combos, as she is balanced for players who know them.

 <p>
  With three casts of her Q and short cooldowns across her other abilities, there are dozens of Riven combos to learn, and these need to be memorized and pulled off mechanically. Finally, players must also discover which combos should be used in certain situations. With lots of autos and movement commands before or after her abilities to cancel their animations, it's easy to see why Riven is one of the highest APM champions in
  <em>
   League
  </em>

 <p>
  Lee Sin has always been considered one of
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  's hardest champs for several reasons. Firstly, his three basic abilities all have two parts, meaning there's a lot more key-clicking for the blind monk. As no single ability of Lee Sin's is that strong by itself, success comes down to how players use their multiple casts in combination. The amount of combos on Lee Sin with his two dashes is truly staggering.

 <p>
  Arguably the hardest thing about Lee Sin, however, is his ultimate, which kicks an enemy away. While simple in isolation, kicking an enemy away isn't that useful for a champion who wants to get kills. Thus, players will need to learn how to "insec," which is a term for delivering a target into the team's hands, and in Lee Sin's case, he must find a way to the other side of his opponent to find the right angle. This can be done by ward-hopping or with a kick-flash combo.

 <p>
  Kiting is already one of the hardest mechanics for ADCs, but Kalista takes this to a whole other level. This is because, with every auto attack, Kalista can hop with movement commands that would make a normal champion walk. What this means is that before players can even learn her four abilities, they must first relearn how to attack.

 <p>
  Chasing after enemies or kiting back while dodging skill shots is quite the headache for those new to Kalista. Moving on to her abilities, Kalista is all about landing as many spears on an enemy as she can until they look like a porcupine. The difficulty with this is that her autos and Q don't deal much damage upfront, and instead, players must have experience with her to know exactly when to Rend, pulling out all the spears for terrific damage. Kalista also has many niche mechanics that are required to deal significant damage.

  With how many precise and perfectly timed clicks players must make, Irelia is easily one of the hardest
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  champs. Her skill mostly comes down to her Q, a dash that resets if the target was marked by her passive or if the target dies. She can mark targets by landing her E or R, and keeping her Q active with constant resets takes her from zero to hero.

 <p>
  Irelia players can surge through minion waves as long as they know at which health minions will die to her Q, allowing them to keep going, and when skirmishing or team fighting, only the best can keep on top of only dashing to marked targets. As with any Top-Laner, Irelia also has highly nuanced matchups that must be learned.

  Azir is a fairly unique champion as most of his damage comes from the soldiers whom he commands. In the late-game especially, as one of the best scaling champs in
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  , the auto-attacks from these soldiers can shred through enemy ranks, but doing so is far from easy. Positioning these soldiers is absolutely key as they cannot move on their own accord and only have a short range at which they can attack.

 <p>
  Keeping track of these soldiers, on top of Azir's own positioning as a squishy mage, and using his other abilities is a lot to do, and it can take a while to understand how to play this particular Mid-Laner.

  While the rest of his kit isn't too difficult, most of Gangplank's damage comes from his barrels, and to new players, they are practically impossible to figure out. Unless enemies are under the effects of CC, they won't be hit by a single barrel, as before it explodes they can either destroy it or walk out of range. Therefore, Gangplank players must chain their barrels together, placing and exploding multiple at exactly the right moment.

 <p>
  There is no way to learn this other than to head into the practice tool and load up some tutorials. However, even when players have figured out this mechanic, actually applying it in real games where the enemy moves and attacks is a whole other problem.

  Yasuo is without a doubt one of the most hated
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  champs, but in a large part, this is due to how hard he is to play. Players hate having a Yasuo on their team, as most who try him out can't make use of his near-unlimited dashes and minute mechanics. Instead, as the only way to deal damage to Yasuo is to go in, they end up feeding and providing nothing for the team.

  While some champions are hard mechanically, others require a lot of thought about every decision. Aphelios is the embodiment of a champion who requires brains to play, as he has five guns to switch between, all with their own effects and abilities, and on top of this, they each interact with his other guns in unique ways.

 <p>
  Aphelios is a champion who players must study, as without proper gun management, they will deal practically no damage and be useless to their team. This is all on top of being an immobile ADC, for whom positioning and kiting is naturally a hard skill.

  Hwei is one of
  <em>
   League's
  </em>
  most recent additions to the roster and with an unprecedented amount of abilities, some would argue he is the most complex champion in the game. While most champions have three basic abilities, Hwei instead has three variations of each of his abilities, meaning he really has nine basic abilities. In other words, when Hwei presses Q, for example, he must then press Q, W, or E to choose the variant.

 <p>
  This not only means that Hwei requires fast fingers, but players also have their brains turned on at every moment to make sure they are using the correct ability for the current situation. Naturally, Hwei has many combos and many of his abilities happen to be skillshots too.

   Nidalee's spear is incredibly hard to hit, and without it, she is practically useless.

   Players must play super aggressively by invading and ganking for quick wins.

 <p>
  On top of her notoriously hard-to-hit spears, Nidalee is a hard champion to pilot for many reasons. The first reason is that even farming the jungle is no easy task with Nidalee, as players must learn which places to stand and where to lay their traps.

 <p>
  Nidalee is also a transforming champion, meaning she has two sets of abilities with their cooldowns. Getting the most out of her kit means using all six of these abilities effectively, and knowing exactly when to switch between human and cougar form. Furthermore, while players may find some easy success with her on ARAM, Nidalee on Summoner's Rift is an incredibly early game-focused champion, and players must look for leads by playing aggressively at all times and then pushing any advantage for a quick win.

      <title>7 Atlus JRPGs With The Best Combat, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/atlus-jrpgs-with-the-best-combat/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  RPGs, as far as combat was concerned, used to be very rudimentary. If they had action gameplay there wasn’t a lot of nuance to them like the early
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  games. For turn-based games like
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  , there was a lot of grinding involved. Things have certainly changed over time and Atlus has been at the forefront of changing how combat can feel in a game.
 </p>

 <p>
  Atlus has helped pave the way for innovative active and support systems to make their games feel wholly unique. That’s not to say they haven’t published some great games with interesting combat mechanics too. Let’s look at their history to find the must-plays for RPG fans who love combat and Atlus collectively, ranked by how interactive the gameplay is whether the stories are good or not.

  <em>
   Persona 5 Strikers
  </em>
  is a spinoff from the
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  franchise with similar gameplay. However, the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  team at Atlus had close ties to the developer, Omega Force, to help it fit with the timeline of
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  , making it feel like a real sequel. Players can take on the role of several key party members from the original game like Joker and Queen.

  They can fight waves of enemies with new weapons or they can cast spells and exploit enemy weaknesses like in the main game. It was a great blend of the two games and while it may be repetitive for some, fans will probably dig this spinoff if they missed it originally.

  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor
  </em>
  is a spinoff of the main
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  series that, like
  <em>
   Etrian Odyssey
  </em>
  , is presented in first-person.
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor
  </em>
  instead is a top-down tactical RPG set in the then modern-day Japan.

 <p>
  A group of teens get a mysterious app on their phones when an incident goes down. This incident allows them to summon demons into battle. Again like
  <em>
   Etrian Odyssey
  </em>
  , this game is beyond hardcore and even tactical RPG veterans may struggle. The sense of danger players can get from missions is exhilarating though when victory is awarded.

  <em>
   Dragon’s Crown
  </em>
  is like a spiritual sequel to the Capcom-made
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  games for the arcade. It has a similar 2D style to a brawler/hack and slash game. In each level, players can find dozens of secrets and alternate pathways to unlock new dungeons. Players can choose one of the main characters who each adheres to a typical RPG class like a ranger or mage.

 <p>
  There’s not much of a story and it’s technically short although infinitely replayable thanks to the co-op support. Vanillaware has made some amazing games under the guidance of Atlus, but
  <em>
   Dragon’s Crown
  </em>
  feels like such a pure experience that, sadly, it never got a sequel.

  This series was
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  even before fans knew about that franchise. They are hardcore turn-based RPGs with little story but a great amount of customization options. Players can create a party and then level them up with stat boosts and equipment. Exploring the dungeon is in first-person along with the battle presentation.

  They are beyond hardcore but
  <em>
   Etrian Odyssey 4: Legends of the Titan

  made some innovations to help it cater to a newer crowd. While not a cakewalk, it’s a high point for the series without a doubt thanks to the pure creation behind the classic gameplay.

  is a good splicing of battle systems based on

  games. Players can get into a turn-based battle with four party members who have access to physical skills and magic. Magic is dictated by what Archetypes they have equipped which are the classes of

 <p>
  It’s a deep class system for an RPG but the surprises don’t end there. If players are of a high enough level, they can attack enemies in the field. The action-based combat isn’t that deep but it helps with the repetitive grind players can often find themselves in with a JRPG like

  Besides
  <em>
   Dragon’s Crown
  </em>
  , Vanillaware needs to be commended on their latest game,
  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord
  </em>
  . It’s a mashup of tactical RPGs and RTS games. Players can explore an overworld from a top-down perspective and interact with icons to gather items. They can also talk to NPCs and take on side quests before moving on to the main campaign.

 <p>
  On missions, when two opposing units touch, the gameplay perspective will switch to 2D wherein two parties will fight automatically. Players can set up their units beforehand in
  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord
  </em>
  and depending on the order and characters chosen, different effects will occur from erecting shields to blasting foes with magic. It’s one of the most unique tactical RPG systems in years and hopefully, it gets recognized as such in the upcoming Game of the Year discussions.

  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload

  is the latest game in the series, technically. Even though it’s a remake of a PS2 game that came out in 2006 in Japan, it still feels fresh even without the fresh coat of paint and quality of life improvements. This is the entry that changed everything, shifting focus to teens going to high school and experiencing paranormal activities. Besides that,
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  began Social Links, a sort of dating and hang-out mini-game wherein players could form bonds with NPCs which would then lead to upgrades.

  Players could be normal high schoolers during the day and then go out to explore a seemingly never-ending dungeon at night. Battles were turn-based and players could collect Tarot cards to befriend new Personas and add them to the list. Personas could level up, swap abilities, and be fused to create new ones. There are systems on top of systems in this game and yet somehow it never felt like too much thanks to the pacing. Did this game need to get remade? It very easily answers that question: yes.

  Conan the Barbarian is one of the most iconic characters in pulp fantasy, and the massive fictional world the character inspired endures to this day. It's especially prominent in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Conan Exiles
   </em>
  </strong>
  , an online survival game where players must endure the harsh conditions and merciless peril of the Hyborian Age.

 <p>
  Due to its online nature,
  <em>
   Conan Exiles

  is ideal for single players and groups alike. Solo adventurers can survive on the fringes of society in isolated shelters, while groups can team up to carve out a civilization of their own in the unforgiving desert. No matter what path players choose, adventure and danger await.

  earned a lot of attention for its bizarre premise, combining elaborate survival crafting with familiar creature capture and training mechanics to create something wholly unique. This strange title gives players numerous avenues of play. Fans can forge bonds with their creatures to unleash their true potential, or use them for hard labor in the creation of elaborate factories and monuments.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Project Zomboid
   </em>
  </strong>
  builds on a familiar premise, with players stranded in a zombie-infested post-apocalyptic exclusion zone, trying to survive against the endless undead for as long as they can. In co-op, players can build a base together, fortify it, and furnish it with various amenities in their quest to keep themselves alive and free of the infectious disease that has wiped out humanity around them.

 <p>
  The game is primarily designed around co-op, but solo players are welcome.
  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  becomes much more challenging in single-player, as players no longer have safety in numbers and must carry out all the tasks required to stay alive all by themselves. This makes single-player a fundamentally different experience, and the ultimate challenge for
  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  fans.

  As the name suggests,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starbound
   </em>
   's
  </strong>
  2D survival experience takes fans into space, tasking them with survival on an alien world with a damaged spacecraft. The game offers several charming alien races for players to choose from, and despite the limited perspective offered by its 2D gameplay, the alien worlds of
  <em>
   Starbound
  </em>
  are rich with mystery and treasures to uncover. There are also adorable alien pets for players to recruit.

 <p>
  Solo players are more than welcome to explore the wonders of the cosmos on their own, but the title also fully supports co-op for multiple explorers to team up. The default party size is four, but with a custom server, players can extend that number as much as they'd like. Large groups who want to take part in a survival journey together will likely get a lot of playtime out of

  </strong>
  offers fans the chance to step into the shoes of one of the most iconic horror monsters of all time. Players must rebuild their vampiric legacy after centuries of undead slumber, fleeing from the sun and feeding on mortals in an effort to regain their lost power. Along the way, they must also build up their castle, establishing a proper vampiric lair to lurk in.

 <p>
  The game has robust online multiplayer support as well. Teams of vampires can form a coalition to rule the shadows together, but the game also has PvP options, letting fans raid each other's fortresses and wage war by night. Players of all preferences have the freedom to become whatever sort of creature of the night strikes their fancy.

  The game's bizarre, science-heavy narrative can be experienced in single-player and multiplayer alike. Solo fans can travel at their own pace, solving the mysteries of their strange predicament and amassing an arsenal of bug-killing weapons as they go. Multiplayer groups can build up shared bases and lairs, swapping tools and sharing resources so that they can survive the perils of the yard together.

  Very few video games are as massive in scope as
  <strong>
   <em>
    No Man's Sky
   </em>
  </strong>
  . An entire universe of procedurally generated planets and solar systems awaits, offering more worlds than players could fully chart in a million lifetimes. The single-player experience of
  <em>
   No Man's Sky

  is a profoundly lonely one, forcing players to confront their tiny place in a massive universe even as they plumb the depths of the cosmos and unravel mysteries about the nature of reality itself.

 <p>
  The game's robust history of post-launch support has been a major boon to the multiplayer experience. Teams of fans can group up to explore the universe together, building and sharing massive bases and even taking on specially designed multiplayer missions for an elaborate catalog of cosmetic and gameplay rewards. In a universe as vast as this, there's no wrong way to play.

  2D survival games are something of a rarity, but that hasn't stopped
  <strong>
   <em>
    Terraria
   </em>
  </strong>
  from becoming a hit. This sandbox game's deceptively simple art style hides an incredibly elaborate system of customization, exploration, and creation. Players can adventure to take down a group of imposing bosses, or simply enjoy the title's sandbox and build to their heart's content.

 <p>
  Players can take on
  <em>

  's procedurally generated sandbox solo, or they can team up with several friends. Like with many other survival games, the tone shifts dramatically when other players are introduced. The game becomes less lonely, and easier as well. Both options are valid, and

  caters well to each one.

  The Viking sojourn
  <strong>
   <em>
    Valheim
   </em>
  </strong>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  has yet to emerge from Early Access, but that hasn't stopped fans from picking the game up and running with it. The title's procedurally generated Norse afterlife is rich with danger and mystery, and its status as a proving ground for Viking souls looking to reach Valhalla means the game won't be pulling any punches.

  Teaming up with other players through the game's online multiplayer support is a good way to even the odds. The game's monstrous threats are much easier to handle if players have allies providing support. However, proud and stalwart warriors are still more than welcome to take on the challenges of
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  all by themselves.

      <title>8 Great JRPGs With No Classes</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-jrpgs-with-no-classes/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  JRPGs are known for their expansive stories, often carried by a cast of characters who work together doing epic fantasy things like defeating goblins, fighting huge bosses, or killing god with the power of friendship. A JRPG is defined by its party mechanics, and in order for a game to be well-remembered, there needs to be a tight cast of characters who are compelling both mechanically and narratively in order to really grip the player.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":440} -->

 <p>
  All JRPGs, whether high fantasy epics or urban fantasy wonders, need a good party. But sometimes, especially in games where there's a large emphasis on individual characters or creature collecting, JRPGs will subvert the typical tropes of their fellow games by not including classes. Pre-defined classes can help give players an idea about how they should build their character, but these games let the merits of the character shine by themselves.

  Standing out as one of the hardest titles available on the Switch,
  <em>
   Alliance Alive
  </em>
  pulls no punches and expects the player to develop their party smartly and efficiently, making good use of their pre-established stats to help them shine with the use of one or two weapons.

 <p>
  Instead of classes, characters will level up the skill based around what weapon they're using. A spear user will grow more effective with spears, and gain more spear skills, and so on. This lets many characters be built to match whatever players have in store for them.

  The creature collecting sub-genre has a legacy that stretches much further back than

  A programmer has figured out how to emulate
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  on the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo
  </strong>
  . The Alarmo clock is one of the newest gadgets to be released by the brand. Although it is not the reveal some gamers had expected from the company, now that many feel the Switch has reached the end of its life cycle, Nintendo appears to be using this time to show off ideas that have come across as a bit more experimental.

 <p>
  There are plenty of gamers that consider the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo to be an interesting device for a multitude of reasons. The Alarmo Sound Clock was announced and released in early October and features sounds and music from Nintendo games. The Alarmo reacts to its user's movements to make sure they wake up on time. Although some people may consider its motion tracking and reaction systems impressive technology, the device is only made to play sounds from games, not the games themselves. That hasn't stopped curious owners from pushing Alarmo's limits.

  Programmer GaryOderNichts got
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  running on a Nintendo Alarmo. The user posted a video on social media where they use the dial on the top to move, and the side buttons as keys to scroll through and select menu options. Once a level is loaded in, Gary walks around, using the right side button to fire at enemies. Following up on the initial post, Gary elaborated on the process of getting the game running on the fast-selling Alarmo Sound Clock, discussing its specs and leaving instructions to get
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  running on the device for other gamers eager to try it out.

  Because of the game's compact 2.39 megabyte file size,
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  running on everything has lived on as a meme for some time. During the summer, a developer got
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  running in the 2024 hit
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  , although, at a glance, the game runs much more smoothly on the Nintendo Alarmo. It doesn't seem like Nintendo has any plans to release titles on the Alarmo, but regardless, gamers have found a way.

 <p>
  Although Alarmo isn't the jump in hardware that many are expecting, fans have noted that now is a great time for the company to reveal its more niche projects. Alarmo as well as the newly announced Nintendo Music app seem to be getting plenty of attention from gamers who may just be looking for the next big hint about the Nintendo Switch 2. It seems like no matter what new system Nintendo releases, people will want to play games on it, even if the company is branching out, releasing products that could cement it more as a lifestyle brand.

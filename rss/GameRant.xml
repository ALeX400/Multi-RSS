   <em>
    Guilty Gear Strive
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans should mark March 23 on their calendars, as that's when the full trailer for Venom, the next fighter to join the roster, will be out.
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  was released in 2021, and since then, Arc System Works has been working to keep the game engaging with frequent updates.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  's wave of additional content began in 2021, with Goldlewis, Jack-O', Happy Chaos, Baiken, and Testament introduced to the game as Season 1 characters. Since then, other characters have joined the cast, such as Bridget, Bedman?, and Sin Kiske, Ky Kiske's son, and new stages and additional colors for the fighters. More recently, last year saw the additions of Johnny, Elphelt, A.B.A, Slayer, and Queen Dizzy, Sin Kiske's mother. Now players are gearing up to welcome a new season with more content.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  has unveiled the first look at Venom, confirming that his full trailer will be revealed on March 23. The video will be released at the Arc World Tour finals in Los Angeles, which will determine the champion of the 2024 edition of the tournament. Venom's arrival in
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  comes after it was postponed by the developers, a decision credited to the need to “ensure sufficient time to offer the best possible gaming experience to players.”

  Who is Venom, the Next Fighter to Join Guilty Gear Strive?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Venom is a
  <em>
   Guilty Gear
  </em>
  character with recurring appearances over the years, the first being in
  <em>
   Guilty Gear X
  </em>
  . With long white hair, the assassin is distinguished by having a blue eye drawn on it. His weapon, like other fighters in the series, is quite unusual: he uses a pool cue, and some of his moves are billard-based. The last time fans saw Venom as a playable character was in
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Xrd
  </em>
  , but he makes a cameo in the
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  epilogue along with Robo-Ky as they receive a visit from Millia and Zato at their bakery.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars: Hunters
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be shutting down in October 2025 after releasing its final updates in April. Although
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  seemed to achieve some level of success within its niche, it may not have been the success that Zynga and LucasFilm were counting on to make it worth supporting for much longer. There are disappointed players, but some are hoping the upcoming slate of
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  games will fill the gap left by this entry.
 </p>
 <p>
  First announced in 2021,
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  experienced a series of delays to ensure the title's quality. The mobile title was envisioned as a game that would "entertain for years to come," offering players a hero-based arena combat experience akin to hits like
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  . The team behind
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  expressed a commitment to the title, and the game appeared to release with plenty of potential for growth despite its mixed reviews.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a message on the game's blog, Zynga announced that
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  is set to shut down on October 1, 2025. There appeared to be little indication from the outside that the game may have been struggling. However, despite its relative success, people believed that
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  was up against particularly fierce competition in the live service gaming space, potentially setting it up for failure. This announcement has also served as a 30-day notice, allowing players to max out their Arena Passes, after which in-app purchases will be turned off on April 15.

  The news of
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  ' shutdown appears to have shocked players, especially considering the game was out for a relatively short amount of time.
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  dropped on June 4, 2024, eventually getting an Early Access PC release on January 27, 2025. The game was previously announced to be coming to Steam, and though its web page still exists alongside a new notice that it's not available in the store, many have reported that it has been removed from Steam's searches.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  players will still be able to enjoy the game for a bit longer. Season 5 has received a three-week extension, during which events and shop bundles will be re-run. The Ranked season will also be extended, and the final content update is set for April 15, adding a new Support Hunter named Tuya, who will be available immediately for all players. Although some felt
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  :
  <em>
   Hunters
  </em>
  had a bright future in sight, it seems to be the latest in a wave of recent live-service game shutdowns like
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  . When October 1 arrives,
  <em>

  ' servers will go down, leaving it unplayable.

   </strong>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket has swept the world with fans collecting cards and using them to battle with other players online. Originally, only three expansions were available to players, but this has been more than doubled with the inclusion of Mythical Island, Space-Time Smackdown and Triumphant Light. New cards were added of all varieties, including Supporter cards, which aid players in battle either to give power boosts or even to heal up HP. These are the
   <strong>
    best supporter cards

  The worst supporter card so far on
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  is the Rock-type Gym Leader Brock. Although there are no Rock-type Pokemon in the TCG, they are replaced with the Fighting Energy, which groups together Rock, Ground &amp; Fighting types.
 </p>
 <p>
  Brock's ability is to take a Fighting Energy from the reserve of Energy and attach it to an Onix or Golem. This does come in handy as it gives away two Energy per turn, and it is needed as Golem has one move, a four Energy 150 power Double-Edge. It does have its uses, but only if the right cards are in play.

 <p>
  When it is against the player in battle, a wise thing to do is to retreat to a stronger Pokemon, but this costs Energy to do so. With Koga's ability, his star Pokemon Muk or Weezing can be drawn completely from battle and placed back in the hand, ready for use later on.
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn't as great as a lot of the other supporter cards, but it does give players a chance to save their Pokemon, as the three-knockout limit is not enough. Getting a low HP Pokemon out of the picture may give the player the edge to go on and win.

  , so it was fitting that she was included in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion, which has a heavy Sinnoh theme.
 </p>
 <p>
  This supporter card is fairly useful in the game as it moves an Energy from a benched Pokemon to the active spot. If one of the player's cards is low on HP but still has Energy when swapped for a benched Pokemon, this card can be activated to make sure that players can get an attack away as soon as possible with the new card in play. If it is timed right, the Dawn supporter card can turn the battle in the player's favor.

  Lt. Surge, the American Gym Leader of Vermilion City, has a decent support card in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  . It boosts the power of his stellar 'mons Raichu, Electrode and Electabuzz by moving all Lighting Energy from the benched Pokemon to one of those stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is very useful, especially for Raichu, as its 140-powered Thunderbolt requires three Lightning Energy, but it has them removed after use. Building up energy on the bench and then using this supporter card will be beneficial to instantly have this powerful attack back at the user's disposal.

 <p>
  Grass Energy decks should run in fear when the opponent is using a Blaine deck with his supporter card. Blaine's power gives a staggering +30 damage to any Ninetales, Rapidash, or Magmar. Rapidash only has a 40-power move, and Magmar has 50, so this power-up is much appreciated.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Ninetales should be the target for this as its 90-power Flamethrower is boosted to 120, which will do insane damage, especially to Grass Pokemon, who get an extra +20 damage on top of this. This card may be just what is needed to get the edge in the heat of a battle.

  Cynthia is the Champion of the Sinnoh region in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  games, so it was only right that she received a card in
  <em>
   TCG Pocket
  </em>
  in the Sinnoh-based expansion, Space-Time Smackdown.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the most sought-after cards is Garchomp Ex, with a massive 100-power attack, Dragon Claw, which requires just three energy. To make this card even better is to use Cynthia, who gives a +50 to this Pokemon. Most of the time, this amount of damage will be an instant point. This also works with any Togekiss card too. The downside to using Cynthia is that the deck-type is very limited. But if players are using any Garchomp or Togekiss cards, Cynthia is a must.

  A useful card to use in a
  <em>
   TCG Pocket
  </em>
  deck is the item X Speed, which means that a card's retreat cost is one less. The Leaf supporter card does one better and means that the retreat cost is two less.
 </p>
 <p>
  This can be handy for cards like Moltres Ex and Druddigon, who are in from the start to support the benched Pokemon to build up energy and not necessarily to attack. When suitable Energy is attached to the bench, Leaf can be played to get the Pokemon with no Energy out there. Having as much Energy as possible is a key way to win a battle and Leaf helps to keep those numbers up.

  When the opponent has swapped out a weakened card before the player has had a chance to take it out, Cyrus can come in handy to get that weakened Pokemon back into the active spot and take it out before it can retreat again.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the player times using Cyrus right, they can make sure they gain a point, which can make the difference and potentially win the player the game. It can also be used to swap in a card that better matches the type of the one in the player's active spot, these supporter cards are useful for turning the battle in the player's favor.

  This supporter card has the potential to go really badly or so well that it is overpowered. When the card is activated, the gamer chooses a Water Pokemon and then flips a coin until it becomes tails. For every head flipped, a Water Energy can be attached to the chosen card.
 </p>
 <p>
  This can essentially go on for a while, giving a powerful Water-type Pokemon such as Starmie EX or Gyarados a ton of Water Energy for their powerful attacks. Using Gyarados as an example, its 100-powered Hyper Beam attack requires four Energy to be used. With the Misty card, this can be done much earlier than normal.

  Erika is the Grass-type Pokemon Gym Leader of Celadon City, and her supporter card fits that to a tee with its ability to heal a massive 50 damage to a Grass Pokemon card. Essentially, rendering most attacks useless for at least one turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the tough gets going, this card will aid a lot in battle. It will be useful on Vileplume, Venusaur EX, or Exeggutor EX to give those cards even more help in battle. Every Grass Energy deck should run this card, and if coming up against a Water Energy deck in PVP battles, then it is game over before it has even begun.

  As Erika is useful for Grass Energy decks, Irida is a must for Water decks. It can heal 40 damage to every Pokemon that has Water Energy attached, which is massive as it has the potential to heal the full roster to full in one turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Erika just focuses on one Pokemon while Irida does every card on the field. It can definitely turn the game in the player's favor, and it will be so frustrating for the opponent to see this supporter card activated. The one downside to this card is that it can only be used in certain decks, but the good outweighs the bad on this one and, for those who favor the Water-type, this card is a must for a deck.

  Sabrina may not be a supporter card that is always used, but when it is needed it helps out a lot. The Psychic-type Gym Leader's ability is to make the opponent switch out their active Pokemon with one on the bench.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is up to the user the best way to go about it when using this card, as it may be useful for getting that much-needed third defeat by making the user swap to a card, which can be defeated by the player when the active card was too strong. In battle, this supporter card is definitely one of the best, and it gets bonus points for being able to be run in decks of any Energy.

  Without a doubt, the best supporter card in

  When gamers are looking for an important supporter card, an evolution, or a massive powered EX card, Professor's Research comes in handy. The effect is really simple, but that is what makes this card so important and players should look into adding multiple when building their decks in

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has been hard at work, crocheting Eevee and all of its Eeveelutions. While the set is currently incomplete, the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  creations are adorable, and the way they were created indicates the skill of the artist.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the thought of crochet may have once made people think purely of things like clothing or decorative doilies, the art has expanded to creating plenty of tributes to games and characters. This isn't the first time that a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan has crocheted some of the pcoket monsters from the franchise, with each impressive fan reveal likely inspiring others to join in.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, an artist going by jillianjiggs92 on Reddit has shared that they've been working on crocheting every single Eeveelution. They currently have three left to complete, with a photo showing the adorable collection of Eeveelutions and Eevee sitting side-by-side. The crochet plushes strongly resemble their anime and in-game counterparts. So far, the artist has created Eevee, Vaporeon, Flareon, Jolteon, Umbreon, and Espeon, which leaves them with needing to finish with Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. While fans are already eager to see what they'll look like, it's fairly easy to imagine that they'll be quite cute, judging from those that are already finished.

 <p>
  Fans in the comments have praised jillianjiggs92 for their work, with many pointing to their favorites among the group. Plenty have asked to see an updated picture when the artist is finished with all of the Eeveelutions, while others have talked about potentially purchasing one, should the artist be interested in selling. A few fans with similar skillsets have asked what pattern the artist used, to which they shared that they actually created these freehand. While there are many crochet patterns out there, including some for Eevee and its Eeveelutions, fans have pointed out that jillianjiggs92's appear to be particularly accurate to the original designs, making them ideal for a pattern.

 <p>
  For now, fans will have to wait and see the finished collection, though there's some who hope that the artist may ultimately need to complete four more, rather than three. That's because many
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans have their hearts set on a new Eeveelution premiering in the next major release,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , though there's been no confirmation of such a thing. It's been years since a new Eeveelution joined the franchise, so the series is long overdue for a new one, but whether the next game grants fans' wish remains to be seen.

  While many might know the fates of the Van der Linde gang and how the events of

  With so many outlaws as a part of the Van der Linde gang, it’s worth knowing how each character found Dutch before the events of

  Dutch Van der Linde formed the Van der Linde gang alongside Hosea Matthews after the two attempted to rob each other in the mid-1870s. The duo saw their potential after they managed to rob each other, and Dutch’s silver tongue convinced Hosea to partner up as a duo that could rob the rich and give to the poor – a notion that enticed the good moral standings of Hosea.

  Hosea Matthews met Dutch Van der Linde at a campfire, where the duo, unknowingly robbed each other at the same time. Hosea, impressed by Dutch’s skills and charisma, decided to join him across America as the two would live their own version of a Robin Hood life to rob the rich and give to the poor, albeit without the interference of the law.

  After the death of Lyle Morgan, Arthur Morgan’s father, Arthur was an orphan who didn’t have much skill, but when he ran into Dutch and Hosea in 1877, they saw his potential. The duo took Arthur in as their own and raised him as a son, teaching him how to read, write, shoot, and become an outlaw just like they were.

  Also around 1877, Dutch Van der Linde got himself involved with a fiery woman known as Susan Grimshaw. The romance between them blossomed and may have later fizzled, but the two remained inseparable after she joined up with the trio, turning this old guard of outlaws into the beginnings of a family.

  Around 1885, a young orphan was to be hanged for thieving but was saved by Dutch Van der Linde. This young orphan was John Marston, who would soon come to be Dutch’s golden boy. Like Arthur, Dutch taught John how to read and shoot, and John would become the second son of the gang, with Arthur as his older brother. John is loyal to the Van der Linde gang, but he did leave them for a year after his son Jack was born.

  It’s likely that Josiah Trelawny joined in with the Van der Linde gang escapades after being won over thanks to Dutch’s charisma, perhaps when the two met in a saloon. Josiah isn’t directly involved with the Van der Linde gang and comes and goes as he pleases, but he often has useful information regarding scores and bank jobs which has him cross paths with Dutch over the years.

  Uncle would have joined up with the Van der Linde gang prior to 1894, and it’s not exactly specified why Uncle joined the gang or how Dutch found him. It’s more than likely that Dutch found Uncle amusing, and saw him as a court jester to keep him entertained and charmed, even if he was rather lazy and didn’t like doing any dirty work, or any work at all for that matter. Uncle was a good company to have around, so it’s likely that Dutch saw Uncle getting into drunken trouble in a local town and brought him with him.

  After leaving the Navy after just a short stint, Simon Pearson was down on his luck and needed the financial aid of loan sharks. However, when things went south, Pearson was saved by Dutch Van der Linde, a passerby who took a liking to Pearson’s stories and abilities as a cook, and so Pearson joined as the camp’s cook.

  Orville Swanson may be a man of the cloth, but he’s also a man of alcohol and morphine. Swanson’s strong moral standing never gets in the way of his substance abuse, which is why he was of the right mind and body to save Dutch Van der Linde in an unspecified incident, perhaps an altercation at a saloon that Dutch was trying to rob with his charisma, only for Swanson to talk everybody down. Dutch owes Swanson, which is why this reverend is allowed to stick around.

  Tilly Jackson was forced to become an outlaw at the age of 12 after being kidnapped by the Foreman Brothers, a gang that would abuse her until she retaliated and killed the cousin of the gang’s leader, Malcolm Foreman. Alone and orphaned, Tilly was rescued on the roadside by Dutch Van der Linde, who raised her just as he had done before with Arthur and John.

  These two brothers were loyal to the Van der Linde gang, but extremely vicious and ready to attack anyone that even looked at them funny. While it’s not known how both Mac and Davey joined the gang, it’s more than likely that their rough attitude and similar age difference to Arthur and John saw the pairings meet in a saloon, perhaps over a fistfight or a drink – or both.

  Strauss seems like a late addition to the Van der Linde gang due to his more modern ways of squeezing money out of people by being a loan shark. Strauss was hired as a debtor for the Van der Linde gang after Dutch was impressed with his intellect and financial skills, but due to Strauss’ immigrant status and the gang’s need for financial records, it’s likely that Strauss was recruited later than other members.

  After being dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Army, Bill Williamson would hold a grudge against anyone that so much as looked at him, which is why by 1893, he made a strong impression on Dutch Van der Linde as this drunken dullard tried to rob him. Dutch empathized with Bill’s frustrations, and brought him home to the gang where he’s been loyal ever since.

  1894 saw the Van der Linde gang introduced to Abigail Roberts, an orphan and a prostitute that was brought in by Uncle. Abigail took a liking to John Marston and decided to stay with the Van der Linde gang. While Abigail may have slept with most men in the camp, her affinity to John Marston quickly became love, and her loyalties remained with him.

  Javier Escuella eloped to America after becoming a notorious criminal in Mexico with a bounty on his head far too high to see him return to his home country. Javier had to flee his country after killing an important official in Mexico, and this revolutionary saw sense in Dutch's ideals after the two met while trying to steal the same chickens.

  Somewhere in North Elizabeth, Sean MacGuire saw the perfect targets to rob with Hosea Matthews and Dutch Van der Linde. This young Irishman had the wrong men, as they had already emptied his revolver so that he couldn’t rob them. Instead of punishing the young lad, they gave him a place to stay within their gang.

  It’s unknown how Karen Jones joined the Van der Linde gang, but her loud personality, love for adventure, and the outlaw life, more than likely made her a prime personality for Dutch to pluck out of the lesser society of some small town. It’s likely that Karen was entranced by Dutch’s promise of an outlaw life, leading to Karen joining in a few years prior to 1899.

  Molly came from a wealthy family in Dublin, Ireland, but later abandoned them in a quest for adventure and romance. She found exactly that in America, where she fell in love with Dutch Van der Linde and joined the gang. Her youthful nature and jealous tendencies make her a freeloader with a relationship that isn’t set to last.

  Mary-Beth was a simple street urchin who would use her innocent looks to pickpocket and steal off of unsuspecting folk. However, after getting on the wrong side of the wrong man, Mary-Beth is hunted for her crime, only for her to fall in with the Van der Linde gang for further protection.

  Sometime in 1898, the Van der Linde gang ran into Lenny Summers, a young man on the run from the law after committing a string of murders to avenge the lynching of his father. Lenny saw safety in the Van der Linde gang and decided to stop running from the law alone and start running from it with a band of professionals who would teach him a few tricks of the trade.

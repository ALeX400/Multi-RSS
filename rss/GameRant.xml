  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  is a beautifully designed game on the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  platform where you can express yourself and even compete with other players to see who is more creative and inventive. The main goal is to create a unique, garish, and impressive look for a fashion model to win the competition.

  There are plenty of clothes and accessories that you can choose from to create an image, and you can even choose hair and makeup for the model separately. By redeeming
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  codes, you will receive unique clothes and accessories that you can put on the model and make her stand out from the crowd.

  Although the game has quite a lot of clothes and accessories that you can use for your model outfit, sometimes something is missing, and having a few exclusive items will be a great advantage. Fortunately, the game developers generously reward fans with such bonuses, and you can also get them by redeeming
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  codes. New codes appear occasionally, but their validity is limited, so be sure to redeem them as soon as possible.

  Fortunately, redeeming

  code before, here's how to do it:

   Launch
   <em>

  <li>
   When you're in the lobby, look to the left side of the screen, you will see several interactive buttons.
  </li>
  <li>
   Among them, find and click on the lowest one, an icon with three asterisks.
  </li>
  <li>
   This will open the menu for redeeming codes, where you will see an input field and a button with a checkmark icon.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the active codes into the input field. All letters must be capitalized; otherwise, the system will consider the code invalid.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you have entered the code in the input field, click on the button with the checkmark icon to submit the reward request.
  </li>
  <li>
   If everything is successful, a notification about the item or accessory you received, and its icon will appear in the middle of the screen.

  In order to redeem codes in
  <em>

  </em>
  , players will need to follow the steps below:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":337} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Open
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
   and launch
   <em>
    Car Dealership Tycoon
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   At the top, locate the Settings button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Press it, and insert the code into the text box.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once done, press the “+” button and claim free rewards.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Players should remember that a single code can only be redeemed once (just like in most other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games). That said, there's nothing stopping players from redeeming the same code on multiple accounts.

  The mechanics of
  <em>
   Car Dealership Tycoon
  </em>
  are not much different from other similar games. To begin with, players need to stand on the first pressure plate, and after they progress, stand on the others. That's how the dealership is built. There are three methods to earn money in the game, the first is to enter
  <em>
   Car Dealership Tycoon
  </em>
  codes like the ones that players can find above, the second is to sell cars to customers, and the third is to drive around the city.

  The "Long Journey" side task can be started by
  <strong>
   interacting with the Glass Jellyfish
  </strong>
  , a character
  <strong>
   located on the south side of Rippleby
  </strong>
  in the Iron River region (coordinates:
  <strong>
   7633, -4172
  </strong>
  ). Upon interacting with Glass Jellyfish, you can exhaust her dialogue to accept her request to visit key locations around the map, documenting each visit with a photograph — with the final destination seemingly reuniting her with her father. You will also
  <strong>
   receive the Aqua Bell pendant
  </strong>
  , which will be necessary for summoning the Glass Jellyfish at each key location.

  Upon taking on the "Long Journey" side task, you will be instructed to

   find a wind turbine

  , which can be found on a hillside just west of Rippleby (coordinates:

   6971, -3919

  <strong>
   open up the inventory tab
  </strong>
  with the I key, navigate to
  <strong>
   the Aqua Bell pendant, and press F to summon the Glass Jellyfish

  to the location.

  Once you have visited and taken a picture of the Glass Jellyfish near the scarecrow, you will then need to
  <strong>
   locate a bonfire on the roof of Aiden's Auto Repair
  </strong>
  (coordinates:
  <strong>
   7144, -4510
  </strong>
  ). This area is crawling with hostile enemies, so be sure to take them out before continuing with the quest. From here, simply head to the top of the roof and
  <strong>
   use the Aqua Bell pendant to summon the Glass Jellyfish
  </strong>
  . Much like before, take out the camera and
  <strong>
   take another photograph with the Glass Jellyfish in the frame
  </strong>
  . Upon doing so, you will be free to move to the fourth and final location.

      <title>Best PS5 Games On PlayStation Plus Extra &amp; Premium (July 2024)</title>

 <p>
  In June 2022 in North America, Sony launched a revamped version of
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  that combines the previous model with PS Now. Split into three tiers, subscribers who invest in PS Plus Extra or Premium gain access to a wide selection of PlayStation games. While the library has hundreds of PS4 titles, it also includes quite a few
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5
  </strong>
  releases, something PS Now did not offer.

  With each new month of additions, PS Plus Extra adds a couple of PS5 titles, ensuring the library continues to expand. So far, the selections have been decent, and they have arguably been getting better as the current generation progresses. Consequently, what are the
  <strong>
   best PS5 games on PS Plus Extra

  Although hardly exhaustive, PS Plus has a respectable selection of Soulslike games. For the most part, these releases tend to lean heavily into close-quarters combat, with mage builds being viable in some projects; however, few games prioritize ranged action. Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  series is the definitive exception that blends the core Soulslike experience with third-person shooter gunplay, delivering experiences that bring out the best in both genres. While the first entry is not available, Sony's service has the 2023 sequel, which surpasses its predecessor in most key areas.

 <p>
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  feels big. The campaign is divided into worlds, with each one being fairly large, grandiose, and unique. Even the boss battles emphasize scale, including a particularly inspired encounter against a cube. Impactful and satisfying, the combat is accessible but challenging, and it is enhanced by build variety courtesy of archetypes and weapon modifications. As great as a solo run can be,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is made for co-op.

  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  was one of the first projects to truly come across as a next-generation experience, and the game is still among the console's standard-setters. Insomniac has been on fire over the last few years, and while
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  has hogged most of the spotlight, the studio regularly produces the goods whenever it returns to its other flagship IP.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  is, fundamentally, just another
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank
  </em>
  adventure that delivers exactly what most fans have come to expect from the franchise. Along with stunning graphics, the game has fast-paced and satisfying gunplay, enjoyable platforming, lavish worlds, and charming characters. Although not lacking in new ideas, including the introduction of a second playable character,
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  mainly seeks to perfect the formula rather than reinvent it. The result is a polished, confident, and delightful third-person shooter.

 <p>
  A highlight of the PS4's final main year,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  quickly made its way to the PS5, offering a native version that comes packed with the expansion. Sucker Punch's epic samurai adventure is a technological tour de force, delivering visuals that are consistently stunning. A lot has been stated about the graphics, but
  <em>
   GoT
  </em>
  's brilliance goes well beyond just a pretty exterior. An occasionally frustrating camera aside, the combat combines dodging, parrying, crowd management, ranged options, stealth, and stances to create an impressively deep system that is nevertheless accessible.

 <p>
  Narratively,
  <em>
   GoT
  </em>
  mostly hits the mark, even if the overall story does not hold too many surprises. With the Mongols taking over Tsushima Island, a samurai named Jin sets out to find allies, rescue his master, and reclaim their home. Most of the campaign is framed through Jin's companions, who are generally more interesting than the protagonist. While following a fairly standard structure for the genre, the open-world benefits from consistently enjoyable side quests that emphasize the "common" people's struggle to survive in this post-war setting.

  Housemarque's
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  is a sci-fi epic about Selene, a space traveler who visits a strange planet and becomes ensnared in a time loop. This plot point serves as narrative justification for the third-person shooter's roguelike structure; as Selene explores Atropos' six biomes, her demise will signal a return to the beginning.

 <p>
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  has fantastic gameplay, which is hardly surprising considering the studio's previous releases like
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  . The story builds an engrossing sense of mystery while cleverly diving into Selene's history and mental state.

  <em>

  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West

  has a massive and lavish open-world, fine-tuned combat, and epic enemy designs, particularly for the robotic dinosaurs. Narratively, the game delivers the goods as well, building nicely upon its predecessor's groundwork. Along with just being one of the

  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  started life on the Nintendo Switch, before eventually making its way to other ecosystems. While very popular in general, Capcom's franchise is still relatively niche and can be intimidating for newcomers who have yet to hunt their first monster. Consequently,
  <em>
   World
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  seemed to be designed with the specific purpose of lowering the barrier for entry, providing an accessible experience that still preserves the typical
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  experience that long-time fans have come to expect. As the easiest core title in the series,
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  incorporates a relatively short "story" that teaches beginners the basics, all the while allowing veterans to skip this crash course and jump right into the Hub quests that are the real meat of the game.

 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  is addictive, time-consuming, and an absolute blast. Now, the gameplay loop is pretty basic: hunt, loot, craft, hunt, loot, craft, and repeat for eternity. However, the combat offers a ton of customization options, including 14 weapon types that feel completely different from each other and require dozens upon dozens of hours to master. While the village story missions are single-player, the Hub quests support co-op, which is generally the "ideal" way to experience a hunt. That said,
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  is a blast even when played solo.

 <p>
  A pleasant surprise,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is an indie Metroidvania with a strong artistic identity, responsive platforming, and clever puzzles. Beyond the atmospheric visuals, the latter brain-teasers are the game's main selling point, and every screen is a puzzle that requires utilizing a small assortment of tools in inspired ways to unlock doors and avoid threats (be it intimidating crows or a kangaroo). Putting aside fireworks that can stun or eliminate enemies,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is pretty much devoid of combat, with even boss fights being essentially puzzles with added steps and on a more epic scale.

 <p>
  While not extremely long,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is quite difficult in a few ways. More often than not, the puzzles require thinking outside the box, especially after the first hour of the campaign. Consequently, they can occasionally bring progression to a screeching halt, although they are satisfying to solve. The game does not provide much direction on where to go, leaving players to their own devices. That said, the map is quite detailed and helpful. Even if it might not be the biggest name ever,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is undoubtedly among the
  <strong>
   best PS5 PS Plus games
  </strong>
  and a must-play for anyone into puzzles or Metroidvanias.

  Added to PS Plus Extra and Premium on April 16, 2024,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is undoubtedly a huge get for Sony's service, especially since it was technically a Day 1 addition, at least concerning the PS5 and PS4 ports. Management sims are not particularly uncommon, but Mintrocket's project is a singular entity that combines a few different genres to create something that fits all of them while standing out in each of them. The campaign primarily consists of two sections: exploration/fishing and restaurant management. The former feeds into the latter and vice versa, creating a symbiotic relationship that heightens both sides of the equation.

  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  follows, well, Dave as he dives into a magical sea in search of fish that can be turned into sushi for a restaurant he opened with a couple of friends. During the day, players explore the Blue Hole in search of living ingredients, and they have to make certain choices before they dive into the cold water. For one, Dave can only carry a limited loadout, meaning he has to preemptively pick between equipment suited for different fish, not knowing what he might find in the ever-changing Blue Hole. The daily dives can produce jaw-dropping vistas along with genuine terror (for Dave, the game is not remotely scary) and the occasional boss fight.

 <p>
  The management side of things also works well, even if it is a bit stripped down compared to games dedicated to the genre. Players have a fair degree of control over the restaurant's processes, including hiring staff to ensure things keep running smoothly.
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is not the greatest management sim out there, but it complements the exploration side of things well to create a satisfying whole.

  March 2024's PS Plus Extra lineup of new games was pretty decent, even if it will not go down as an all-time great. Still, most of the month's included projects are worth checking out, and they cover a few gameplay styles as well. Except for maybe
  <em>
   NBA 2K24
  </em>
  , which is an acquired taste,
  <em>
   Midnight Suns
  </em>
  was the month's biggest game. Obviously, Marvel properties will always be fairly mainstream, but Firaxis' tactical RPG is a completely different beast than, for example, Insomniac's
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  franchise. When the game launched in 2022, there probably were quite a few people who held back from investing due to their inexperience with the genre. Although gradually becoming more accessible, tactical RPGs can seem intimidating, and a Marvel coat of paint can only lower the barrier of entry so far.

 <p>
  Consequently,
  <em>
   Midnight Suns
  </em>
  is the perfect addition to a platform like PS Plus Extra since it is both a known property and a niche prospect. While not lacking depth, Firaxis' game is quite accessible, largely thanks to the combat system not relying on RNG to the extent of the
  <em>
   X-Com
  </em>
  franchise. Players step into the shoes of The Hunter, a new hero who finds himself teaming up with a plethora of Marvel's most famous faces. The turn-based action is flashy and addictive, and it utilizes an inspired card-collecting system that adds customization and replay value. Outside of battle,
  <em>
   Midnight Suns
  </em>
  transforms into something of a social sim that allows the protagonist to befriend the available superheroes. This section can be polarizing, but it should be neat for die-hard fans of the comics.

  One of 2023's nicest surprises,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  managed to make a splash despite being surrounded by huge releases like
  <em>
   Armored Core 6
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  . The indie turn-based RPG comes from Sabotage Studio, and it is a prequel to 2018's
  <em>
   The Messenger
  </em>
  . While the games take place in the same universe, they are otherwise wildly different, and they are both great titles in their own right. Paying homage to classic JRPGs,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  tells a gorgeous pixilated adventure set on an island, with the story's protagonists being two warriors who are powered by the moon and sun.

  ' narrative is well-written and engaging, and while initially somewhat prototypical, it goes in a couple of unexpected directions as it moves along. The turn-based combat system is very solid and contains just enough depth to remain interesting throughout the reasonably lengthy campaign, and it even incorporates some real-time elements. Overall,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  is comfortably one of the
  <strong>
   best indie PS5 games on PS Plus
  </strong>
  , if not the outright best.

  It took a while but
  <em>
   Rogue Legacy 2
  </em>
  finally made its way to the PS5 and PS4 in June 2023, debuting directly on PS Plus Extra. On the surface, the sequel to 2013's influential roguelite might not seem to take all that many risks as it largely sticks to the same core formula; however, the game plays out like a perfected version of the original
  <em>
   Rogue Legacy
  </em>
  , which was and still is fantastic. As before, players are randomly assigned a class as they head into massive levels in search of loot and bosses. When death comes calling, they can pick from three new characters who will have different classes and personality traits. While they must start exploring from scratch, players can use their acquired loot to purchase upgrades, so they are not constantly returning to zero.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rogue Legacy 2
  </em>
  emphasizes the differences between its classes way more than its predecessor, to the point that each one feels completely unique. Simply trying out the various options is fun, especially since most classes are fairly complex and take a while to master. Variety is also provided through the many traits, relics, and upgrades, all of which can greatly alter a build or run. The stages are expansive, ambitious, and detailed, ending with memorable boss fights that will test anyone's skills.

  Premium subscribers can check out the classics, starting from the 1993 original release and concluding with
  <em>
   Doom 3
  </em>
  . Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  is part of the Extra tier, along with its predecessor. Id Software knocked 2016's
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  completely out of the park, and the developer could have simply opted to rethread the exact same ground for the sequel; thankfully,
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  carves its own identity.

  While still ultimately the
  <em>
   Doom

  everyone knows and loves, this entry shakes things up by emphasizing the Doom Slayer's range of motion, even including things like a grappling hook. These abilities work beautifully within combat, providing players with more options than ever before. Even with a fairly forgiving dodge function,
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  still packs a considerable punch, especially since ammo is reasonably limited. The campaign does include a few polarizing platforming and traversal sections, but they do not take much away from the overall experience.

  Extra and Premium subscribers have quite a few
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  projects at their fingertips, and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  is the closest to a current-gen experience. While also available on the PS4, Ubisoft's massive open-world game benefits significantly from the PS5's hardware, even if the older version is decent and a solid option for fans of the franchise. Now,
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  is a quintessential Ubisoft package in many ways, which means an expansive map dotted with endless content; more importantly, the campaign is structured around completing a percentage of the open-world quests, meaning players will need to step away from the main story to progress.

  This 2020 release's reputation has arguably declined since its debut, which is unsurprising considering the game suffers from bloat. The combat system is also polarizing, while the full adoption of RPG elements might not hit the mark with long-time fans. That said,
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  still manages to impress, and it is a must-play for anyone remotely interested in Viking culture.

  While more at home on PC than consoles,
  <em>
   Stranded: Alien Dawn
  </em>
  works pretty well on the PS5, and it offers a unique experience compared to nearly every other title on PS Plus. Essentially a 3D
  <em>
   RimWorld
  </em>
  , Haemimont Games' project drops players on an alien planet and challenges them to scavenge, research, defend, and (ultimately) thrive. Starting with a handful of survivors and a crashed spaceship, players must gradually build their group up from nothing, crafting shelter, workbenches, and other crucial tools while remaining weary of the local wildlife.

 <p>
  Niche as it is,
  <em>
   Stranded: Alien Dawn
  </em>
  delivers on its promise to provide a customizable survival sim with decent visuals, deep mechanics, and potentially endless replayability via its scenarios. Regardless of how familiar a player is with these types of games, they should dedicate the first two hours to the tutorial, which does an admirable job of introducing all the mechanics and shortcuts.

  Debuting directly on PS Plus Extra,
  <em>
   Humanity
  </em>
  might not make as wide of a Day 1 splash as
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  , but the puzzle game is nonetheless a big get for Sony's service. Cast as a dog that must shepherd humans across dozens upon dozens of levels, players spend their time setting up directions to try and keep the crowd safely moving along. Although this might sound simple in theory,
  <em>
   Humanity
  </em>
  consistently introduces new mechanics, ideas, and options to maintain a steady challenge.

  Ultimately, this 2023 release is an acquired taste that won't hit the spot with everyone; however, any fans of puzzle games should give it a look.
  <em>
   Humanity
  </em>
  has an eye-catching look, deceptively deep gameplay, and surprisingly intriguing themes, especially for its genre.

  PS Plus Extra launched with the PS4 versions of
  <em>
   Uncharted 4: A Thief's End
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Lost Legacy
  </em>
  , but the PS5's
  <em>
   Legacy of Thieves Collection
  </em>
  was added as part of the subscription service's March 2023 lineup. Now, the last-generation iterations are still absolutely fantastic, comparing favorably with most titles released over the last 5 years. Consequently, the "remaster" package does not bring too many changes, although the ones that are implemented make enough of a difference to establish the
  <em>
   Legacy of Thieves Collection
  </em>
  as the definitive way to experience these two stories.

  Fueled by the power of the PS5,
  <em>
   Uncharted 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Lost Legacy
  </em>
  now support multiple performance modes, allowing players to decide whether to prioritize 4K or 60 fps. The visuals have also been tweaked ever so slightly to give both games an overall cleaner and more immersive presentation. These improvements enhance two titles that were already considered masterpieces.

  AA gaming has been on the decline since the end of the PS3 era, and only a handful of modern releases fall within the bracket. However, a couple of projects do try to walk the line between indie and triple-A, with
  <em>
   Kena: Bridge of Spirits
  </em>
  serving as a prime example. Ember Lab's action-adventure title is visually impressive by any metric, dropping players into a fully realized fantasy world that has some gorgeous locations. In fact, the art style and special effects are arguably the game's strongest features.
 </p>

 <p>
  That said, the rest of the experience is by no means underwhelming. Gameplay-wise,
  <em>
   Kena
  </em>
  is cut from the same bow-wielding cloth as
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  , although it also mixes in some staff-themed melee attacks. While somewhat repetitive, the combat is generally fun and surprisingly challenging, particularly when it comes to the campaign's bosses. Alongside battles, the game relies heavily on puzzles and exploration, both of which are handled well.

  Structured as a roguelite, players find themselves going up against a rather strange figure and a host of other opponents as they seek to win a series of matches. Each victory rewards new cards and upgrades, but multiple losses will send players back to square one.

  Premium subscribers can play through four
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  games, while two of those releases are also on the Extra tier.
  <em>
   Tales of Arise
  </em>
  is the only title natively available on the PS5, and it serves as a fantastic entry point into Bandai's franchise as a whole. While not on the same level as
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  is nevertheless a cornerstone of the JRPG universe, and it sits among the most well-known properties in the real-time action subgenre.

 <p>
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  garnered attention for being among the first current-generation JRPGs, and it lived up to that billing by providing great combat and a lengthy campaign that tells an effective story that ranks among the franchise's best efforts. Offering a range of playable characters who all play differently enough to be worth trying out,
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  is the full package, even if it might not be the best-in-class in every area.

 <p>
  Summer Gullveig is an incredibly powerful unit with the potential to perform up to four actions in a single turn due to her Weapon, Special, and Duo Skills. She boasts the highest neutral base Spd in the game, tied at 47, and an impressive base Atk of 46. Despite her strength in the meta, Gullveig's main weakness is her low defensive stats, which make her vulnerable to being one-shot when initiated.

 <p>
  Summer Gullveig's best Asset is +Spd, as it allows her to out-speed the majority of the meta units even after heavy investments. Additionally, her +Spd happens to be a Super Asset, providing +4 to the stat instead of the usual +3. It is preferable to have -Res as her Flaw due to it being one of the lowest in the entire game. Even with a Res Asset, Gullveig is likely to fall to any magical user when initiated. Summer Gullveig will mainly be relying on the damage reduction from her Golden Sunlight weapon to live when initiating combat.

If unit initiates combat, reduces damage from the foe's first attack during combat by 70% ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and also, grants another action to unit after combat and inflicts "restricts movement to 1 space" on the unit and Pair Up cohort through their next action.

  Summer Gullveig's base skill set is an excellent option straight out of the box, providing her plenty of firepower in various situations and teams. Golden Sunlight, Time and Light, and her Duo Skill give Gullveig the potential to perform up to four actions per turn. Coupled with Flared Sparrow and S/R Far Trace 4, she can initiate combat effectively without compromising her positioning. Odd Spd Wave 4 gives her the crucial Null Follow-Up (NFU) effect, ensuring she can hold her own against other meta units.

   Summer Gullveig can make use of AoE Special Skills like

   due to her ability to perform multiple actions per turn, allowing her to soften surrounding units before tackling them head-on.

   <strong>

   give her more direct firepower at the cost of some utility from her base kit.

   can be used in place of S/R Far Trace 4 for slightly more damage at the cost of mobility.

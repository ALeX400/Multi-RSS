      Seized Construct from Tears of the Kingdom is a mindless brawl that can be defeated easily with minimal effort.

      Armos Knight from A Link to the Past is a disappointing boss that can be defeated in mere seconds due to slow movements.

  Boss battles are something that
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  franchise excels at, with Link’s multiple adventures being the scenario to some of the most challenging and spectacular encounters in video game history. But, unfortunately, these great titles have a fair share of disappointing bosses that can be taken down in mere seconds.

 <p>
  These games tend to present a well-thought-out difficulty curve but, sometimes, players will have to face the occasional boss that doesn’t take much effort to defeat, and thus, it may end up leaving a bad taste in their mouths. As a result, there are several boss fights in
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </em>
  </strong>
  that are surprisingly easy, with the following creatures being some of the most frustrating examples.

 <p>
  The fact that a boss fight is easy may not necessarily mean it is badly designed, as long as it’s a worthwhile experience for the players. This is exactly the case with the
  <strong>
   Seized Construct
  </strong>
  from
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , a boss that doesn’t take much effort to beat, and not even the prospect of having the entire arena flooded with Gloom raises the stakes all that much.

 <p>
  The point of this encounter is to pummel this evil construct with Mineru’s Robot, which Link acquired a few minutes before. This is made even more satisfying if the player fuses it with some other items and weapons that they can get a hold of. But no matter how fun this fight is, the Seized Construct is relatively easy to defeat, and it sadly can’t even be fought a second time like the other dungeon bosses in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom.
  </em>

 <p>
  Contrary to popular belief,
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  bosses were always good, and not just since they switched to 3D graphics.
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  is a solid example of a game with some surprisingly challenging encounters, but the
  <strong>
   Armos Knight
  </strong>
  from the Eastern Palace is definitely not one of them.

 <p>
  The concept of fighting five enemies at the same time was not properly executed, as these knights are just too slow to even pose a threat, and Link will only have to avoid their predictable attacks and strike whenever he can. As a result of this, they can be defeated in mere seconds. The Armos Knights are so easy to beat that they were demoted to mini-bosses later in the game, inside Ganon’s Tower.

 <p>
  The fight against
  <strong>
   Fyrus
  </strong>
  features a clever way of using the Iron Boots, as Link has to equip them so he can pull the chains that are attached to the beast’s wrists to make him fall and gain access to the weak point on his head.

 <p>
  Regardless of how satisfying this strategy is, it is not difficult to pull off and, since Fyrus doesn’t have many attacks, the player will have to repeat it a few times before he’s defeated. This is an intimidating boss with a unique mechanic, but the fight itself gets so repetitive that it ends up being disappointingly simple to defeat him.

  <em>
   Phantom Hourglass
  </em>
  featured a unique control scheme that made good use of the Nintendo DS’ signature second screen. Everything Link does in this game is controlled with this touchscreen, so it only makes sense that it would have a tame difficulty curve, so players can slowly get used to it.

 <p>
  However, by the time they encounter the boss of the Temple of Fire,
  <strong>
   Blaaz
  </strong>
  , it's extremely likely that they have already mastered most of these touchscreen controls. Blaaz has to be defeated by combining his duplicates with the Boomerang, something that is as easy as drawing a simple path with the DS’ stylus. While the element of having to do this depending on the ascending order of the clones’ horns (which are revealed by the map screen) is appreciated, it doesn’t make the battle any less effortless.

 <p>
  Even though it’s arguably one of the best games in the series, the bosses in
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  are nowhere near as good as in other titles. The boss of the Forbidden Woods,
  <strong>
   Kalle Demos
  </strong>
  is a perfect example of this disappointing reality. Despite its colorful and memorable design, its fight is mind-numbingly easy.

 <p>
  Link has to cut through its vines by using the Boomerang and then attack the weak spot on its flower, which is exposed when it falls to the ground. If that wasn’t already super simple, fans discovered that Kalle Demos can be defeated in just one hit if Forest Water is poured on said exposed flower. Curiously enough, transporting the Forest Water to its arena before it expires may be more challenging than the actual battle.

  In the original release of
  <em>
   Majora’s Mask
  </em>
  , the battle against Odolwa was fascinating, despite its lack of difficulty. This felt like a true and intense clash between two swordsmen. Unfortunately, most of these remarkable elements were lost in the Nintendo 3DS remake.

  <em>
   Majora’s Mask 3D

  added an extremely obvious weak spot to Odolwa’s head, which not only made the clash less interesting but also gave players the option to stun him by dropping Deku Nuts on his head, something that is easy to do with all the Deku Flowers scatted around the arena. Even if they decide to use the old-school strategy to fight Odolwa, it doesn’t change much, because he’s way less aggressive than he was in the original release.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Skyward Sword
  </em>
  , a fearsome aquatic beast attacks the Sandship dungeon with its tentacles, and Link has to slowly make his way through the level before encountering it. Sadly, the ensuing battle doesn’t live up to the hype because this boss is
  <strong>
   Tentalus
  </strong>
  , who is infamous for being surprisingly easy to defeat.

 <p>
  Tentalus mostly fights by using its tentacles, which can be severed with little to no effort with just one Skyward Strike. After that, the beast can be knocked out by shooting an arrow at its weak point: its giant eye. Tentalus’ design is already very goofy and non-threatening, but the fact that its weak point is extremely obvious makes this entire boss fight even more unsatisfying.

  <strong>
   King Dodongo
  </strong>
  , the boss of Dodongo’s Cavern. He attacks by inhaling air before shooting flames and, just like any other Dodongo in the game, he can be defeated by throwing a bomb into his mouth to stun him, which gives the player a few seconds to attack him on his head.

 <p>
  After that fairly straightforward strategy, King Dodongo will counterattack by rolling around the arena, which can be easily avoided. This is made even more effortless if Link has the Hylian Shield since he only needs to crouch to avoid taking any damage. This gameplay loop is a major disappointment, because the name and design of this gigantic dinosaur are intimidating in concept, but the execution completely failed it.

  Creating a balanced difficulty curve in a game as open-ended as
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  may be a challenging task, but the developers somehow managed to make it work, seeing how surprisingly hard the initial fight against Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle is. However, this doesn’t explain why the following final clash against
  <strong>
   Dark Beast Ganon
  </strong>
  is so mind-numbingly easy in comparison.

 <p>
  Calamity Ganon’s new giant boar form is undoubtedly menacing, but the actual process of taking it down takes almost no effort at all. Link will have to run around on his horse and shoot Light Arrows at its super obvious weak spots, while Dark Beast Ganon attacks at a slow pace. While this encounter is somewhat epic in nature,
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  is such a well-designed video game that this final battle ends up being disappointing, especially when compared to other iconic final battles against Ganon in other installments.

 <p>
  The common misconception that bosses in 2D
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  games are way too simple and easy exists for a reason, and the
  <strong>
   Angler Fish
  </strong>
  from
  <em>
   Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  is a perfect example of this disappointing trope. At first glance, the concept of this boss is already uninteresting, since it’s just a giant angler fish with a generic design.

 <p>
  And the fight itself is equally mediocre, with the Angler Fish slowly charging at Link, and summoning weak Angler Fries that aren’t much of a threat either. To defeat it, Link will have to swim around and strike the light on its head with the sword, which doesn’t take much time, thought, or effort. The most frustrating thing about the Angler Fish is that it was already extremely easy in the original game, and the Nintendo Switch remake of
  <em>
   Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  didn’t improve this boss fight at all.

  Most fans of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise are usually focused more on the appearance of the Pokemon themselves, which is completely understandable. However, the human characters in this wonderful fictional world, the Pokemon Trainers, also feature some excellent character design that often goes unnoticed, with the
  <strong>
   Gym Leaders
  </strong>
  being some of the biggest exponents of this phenomenon.

 <p>
  Gym Leaders from across all the main
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  regions (with the sole exception of Alola, which doesn’t even have Gym Leaders) usually have amazing character designs that are both pleasant to look at and also perfectly reflect their personalities, backstories, fighting style, and the Pokemon type they specialize in. Naturally, some are superior to others, and these are
  <strong>
   the absolute best Gym Leader designs in the entire series.

 <p>
  Gym Leaders from older
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  generations usually have the added benefit of appearing in multiple installments, with different designs each time, especially in remakes of their original games. In the case of
  <strong>
   Morty
  </strong>
  , his original design from
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold &amp; Silver
  </em>
  was quite bland and didn’t reflect his mastery of the Ghost-type, but he later got an incredible makeover in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Heartgold &amp; Soulsilver
   </strong>
  </em>
  that did him justice.

 <p>
  Morty’s design in Generation Four is really solid because it gives him new accessories with dark colors that make more sense for a master of the Ghost-type, not to mention that his expression also reflects his laid-back and intelligent personality. With one simple redesign, Morty went from one of the most forgettable Gym Leaders, to one of the most popular ones.

 <p>
  The design of the Lavaridge Town Gym Leader,
  <strong>
   Flannery
  </strong>
  , may not immediately say “Fire-type specialist,” but it’s so subtle and well-executed that it feels like a breath of fresh air, especially for a character from one of the earlier generations. This is exactly why she is so beloved among fans, even to this day.

 <p>
  Flannery manages to display a solid sense of fashion while also perfectly representing her mastery of the Fire-type, not to mention that her bushy red hair is also a unique touch that helps her stand out. Her original design was already pretty solid, but her new appearance in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire
   </em>
  </strong>
  looks even better and more defined, even though she didn’t change all that much.

  Due to their solitary appearances and relatively easy battles, most of the Kalos Gym Leaders from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon X&amp;Y
   </em>
  </strong>
  tend to be forgotten by fans, with the ones who got prominent roles in the anime being the only exceptions. This is quite unfortunate because they all have flawless character designs, and the Cyllage City Gym Leader,
  <strong>
   Grant
  </strong>
  , has the best look in the entire region.

 <p>
  Grant is not only a Rock-type trainer, but he is also a seasoned rock climber. In order to reflect this part of his personality, he wears rock climbing gear, his hair is styled to look like climbable rocks, and he even has a few colored accessories that represent the color-coded holds of a climbing wall. This is all quite clever, and it helps make what would otherwise be a forgettable character into a unique &amp; fascinating one.

 <p>
  Back in Generation One, the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise was brand-new and still trying to find its visual identity and, as a result, most Gym Leaders from the classic Kanto region had fairly generic designs. However, there were a few exceptions, and the Poison-type master
  <strong>
   Koga
  </strong>
  was one of them, mostly due to his fascinating ninja theme.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":569} -->
 <p>
  Being a ninja master made Koga far more memorable than most other trainers in the game, and his serious expression elevates the concept even further. Not to mention that the solid use of purple helps him fit with his signature Poison-type even further. Koga has appeared in multiple games – especially after he was later promoted to an Elite Four Member – and he has always looked great, but his most recent design from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Let’s Go, Pikachu &amp; Let’s Go, Eevee
   </em>
  </strong>
  is his best look so far, since the change of having his red scar going over his mouth makes him look even more like a ninja.

 <p>
  Every single Gym Leader has their own signature Pokemon that they send out at the end of the battle, because it’s also the strongest one on their team. Sometimes, it is not easy to decipher what the signature Pokemon of each trainer will be, but when it comes to the Hearthome City Gym Leader,
  <strong>
   Fantina
  </strong>
  , there’s no debate, because there are elements of Drifblim all over her outfit.

 <p>
  Fantina not only has a long purple dress with a yellow X-shaped accessory, but her hair is also stylized in a way that resembles balloons, just like Drifblim itself. It's evident that this similarity is intentional by both the character and her real life designers, especially when considering that Fantina is an elegant Pokemon coordinator who has a lot of appreciation for her Pokemon. As such, she successfully manages to look great and make her clothing work as a love letter to Drifblim, which is really adorable.

  Character designs in
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  have gotten better with each new release, meaning that the Gym Leaders from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet
   </em>
  </strong>
  were all solid candidates for a list like this. That said,
  <strong>
   Ryme
  </strong>
  , the Ghost-type specialist from Montenevera, is definitely the biggest standout in the Paldea region. For starters, the concept of an elderly woman who is a talented and respected hip-hop artist is quite unique and surprisingly endearing.

  Ryme’s concept wouldn’t work as well if it wasn’t for the amazing character design that comes with it. She has the fashionable outfit of a seasoned rapper, which looks even better due to the combination of black &amp; gold coloring, and she even uses her signature microphone in order to perform while she’s battling. The best part of Ryme’s appearance is her hair, which is cleverly stylized to look like a ghostly skeleton's hand. This is an incredible detail that also works as a genius reference to her favorite Pokemon, Houndstone.

  Because of how the Galar League works, all the Gym Leaders in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield
   </strong>
  </em>
  have solid designs that are sadly hindered by the fact they all have to wear similar-looking sports uniforms. However, one of them managed to use this to her advantage and eventually stood out as one of the most iconic characters in the entire series: None other than the Hulbury Stadium Gym Leader,
  <strong>
   Nessa
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":987} -->

 <p>
  In just a few years, she became one of the most beloved, popular, and recognizable
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  characters, and this can be easily chalked up to her impeccable design. Nessa is a professional model, which not only means she’s elegant and good-looking, but that there are also a lot of well-thought-out details in her design that reflect her love for Water-type Pokemon: The blue highlights in her hair, the small floaters in her footwear, and even the fact that her mandated uniform was modified to look like a professional swimsuit. With all these elements, Nessa’s design not only overcame the issue of having to wear a uniform, but it was actually improved by it.

  Years before Nessa was introduced, back in Generation Five, there was another iconic and beloved Gym Leader who also worked as a supermodel, and her name is
  <strong>
   Elesa
  </strong>
  , the Electric-type master from Nimbasa City. Because of her line of work, she is also fashionable, elegant, and her design demonstrates some great use of colors and different styles of clothing. What’s even better is that, as a supermodel, Elesa has an entirely different appearance in the sequel games,
  <em>
   Pokemon Black 2 &amp; White 2
  </em>
  , yet she manages to look amazing once again.

 <p>
  After all, she is all about the potential of electricity in the future, and both of her designs perfectly reflect that, since almost all of her clothes look futuristic. The best character designs in
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  are the ones that have clever little details in them, and Elesa is no exception, since both of her outfits have red and blue headgear that represent the positive and negative poles of a magnet. It’s evident that a lot of thought went into Elesa's design, and this resulted in one of the most interesting &amp; memorable Gym Leaders in the entire franchise.

  Perfect Paradox from
  <em>
   Season of Dawn
  </em>
  returns in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  as one of the meanest Rapid-Fire Shotguns in the game. It has amazing synergy with melee builds, and its damage output lets it tear through tough enemies with relative ease.

  , they'll eventually get a copy of Perfect Paradox and unlock the weapon as part of the general loot pool and Reprised Weapon Focusing option at the HELM. If you're planning on farming for this shotgun, here are some of the god rolls you should keep an eye out for.

 <p>
  As a Rapid-Fire Frame Shotgun, Perfect Paradox is better suited for PvE than PvP. It has shorter range and less damage per pellet compared to other spread shotgun archetypes, making it a bit less reliable against Guardians, especially if you're in some of the larger
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Crucible maps. To compensate for that, it has a much faster fire rate. Perfect Paradox has perks that take advantage of this by giving players more damage per shot, less downtime when reloading, and better stats across the board.

  Perfect Paradox is an excellent choice for PvE melee builds. Pugilist lets you get your melee energy back faster every time you land a Final Blow with the shotgun. Meanwhile, Trench Barrel will help you score Final Blows faster by increasing your shotgun's damage after hitting something with a melee attack.

 <p>
  Trench Barrel is great if you want to shred high-health targets. However, if you're playing something like a Liar's Handshake Hunter or a melee Banner of War Titan build in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , One-Two Punch is the perk you want. Stack enough melee damage buffs, and you should be able to kill champions and some lesser bosses in just a few hits. However, keep in mind that One-Two Punch doesn't work the majority of ranged melee abilities, like Thunderclap, Proximity Knife, and Celestial Fire.

  Rapid-Fire Frame Shotguns are in no way unusable in the Crucible. However, these weapons will usually need up to two hits to kill an enemy player, and given how the Special Ammo works as of
  <em>
   Destiny 2: The Final Shape
  </em>
  , there's little reason to choose a shotgun that kills in two shots when there are options that can kill in a single hit. You're better off picking a different shotgun in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  if you want to stay competitive.

 <p>
  If you really want to use Perfect Paradox in PvP, then you'll want perks that increase its range and handling. Threat Detector lets you draw your weapon faster in emergencies, and Opening Shot is phenomenal in all shotguns — it gives extra range and accuracy, increasing the odds of all your pellets landing on a target. Although, it's very likely that you'll need to hit another shot if you want to take a player down (unless they're already weak).

  A common trend in the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  series is using the weapons of the bosses you defeat, and that trend continues in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Bloodborne
   </em>
  </strong>
  . While not every boss has a weapon that can be used, some of the bosses are hunters, and their weapons are either already available to the player or soon will be.

  Bloodborne also has multiple endings, with an early ending that won't result in players getting access to the Burial Blade. Despite this weapon being obtained so late in the game, it can be used before the true final boss and in New Game +. Here's how to get the Burial Blade in Bloodborne.

  The Burial Blade is the unique weapon of Gehrman, who is fought in two of the possible endings to the game. When meeting with Gehrman behind the workshop in the Hunter's Deal, refuse his request to kill you, and fight him. After defeating him, you'll get the Old Hunter Badge, which allows for the
  <strong>
   Burial Blade to be purchased from the messengers in the Hunter's Dream for 60,000 Blood Echos
  </strong>
  .

  The Old Hunter Badge carries over into New Game +, letting players
  <strong>
   purchase the weapon as soon as they get access to the Hunter's Dream
  </strong>
  . If you wish to use this weapon in the base game for the DLC or late-game Chalice Dungeon farming, fight and kill Gehrman while pursuing the true ending, but die to the Moon Presence. This will allow you to stay in your current playthrough and still purchase the Burial Blade, completing any content still in the game that you want.

  The Burial Blade is a trick weapon that has two forms; a one-handed sword, and a two-handed scythe. While the one-handed sword style can be fairly straightforward, the scythe is very unique and offers its own style of ranged yet quick combat. While in scythe form, this weapon doesn't do the most damage but does offer some of the widest ranges of attacks in the game,
  <strong>
   making it a perfect weapon for dealing with large crowds
  </strong>
  , especially those faced at the beginning of the game if you choose to do a New Game + playthrough.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Legend of Zelda
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise has been around for over thirty years, and in that time Nintendo has released
  <em>
   a lot
  </em>
  of entries. Technically, most of these stories have a shared storyline, but trying to make sense of it can be migraine-inducing. Officially, the franchise's overarching story is split into three different timelines with some great non-canon
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  games thrown in for good measure. However, that makes things sound deceivingly simple.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Within those three timelines, multiple instances of time travel, alternate worlds, retcons, and contradictions make everything super confusing. Add in the fact that at least two games don't seem to fit at all, and fans are left with a situation where even Nintendo doesn't 100% seem to know what's going on. While one could fill a book with confusing things about
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  's timeline (a book called
  <em>
   Hyrule Historia
  </em>
  ), we've attempted to explain some of the most confusing elements here.

 <p>
  Perhaps the biggest obstacle to newcomers trying to understand
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  's timeline is its weird release order. Fans are used to franchises releasing their games in chronological order, perhaps with the occasional prequel thrown in. With the
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  , it feels more like the developers have a dartboard covered with the franchise's different eras and timelines. Wherever the dart lands, that's where the next game is set.

 <p>
  This isn't an exaggeration. The first game in the series, the original
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  , is set much later in the chronology than most of the other games.
  <em>
   Skyward Sword
  </em>
  , which was released in 2011, on the other hand, is meant to be the first game in the series. Everything else is prequels, sequels, and interquels. Or out of canon? It's pretty hard to keep track of Link's greatest achievements when players have no idea when they happened, or in what order.

  Anyone familiar with
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  's story will know the franchise is split into three(ish) timelines. These are all based on three possible endings in
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  :

 <ol>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Downfall/Fallen Hero Timeline:
   </strong>
   Ganondorf beats Link, becomes Ganon, and makes life miserable in Hyrule for everyone.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Child Timeline:
   </strong>
   Link beats Ganon and is sent back to his childhood so he can stop his plot before it starts.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Adult Timeline:
   </strong>
   Link defeats Ganon but isn't sent back in time.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":995} -->

 <p>
  Of these, the Downfall timeline is the most confusing. There are other dark
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  endings, so why does only this one get its own timeline? The developers have never explained why only Link's defeat in
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  , and not other entries, causes a timeline split.

 <p>
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time

  isn't even the only entry to feature time travel.
  <em>
   Skyward Sword

  <em>

  ,
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom

  all feature time travel as a plot device. However, in those games, time travel doesn't lead to branches in the timeline. It's probably best not to think about it too much and just treat the Downfall timeline as a Marvel-style what-if scenario.

  While other
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  villains have come and gone, Ganondorf has been a constant thorn in Link's side. He's always cropping up in his different forms, something that causes no end of confusion if fans stop and think about it. The general rule is that Ganondorf transforms into Ganon in each game after giving up his humanity to get his grubby hands on the Triforce. The problem is that it keeps happening.

  Explaining every reincarnation of Ganondorf isn't easy, especially in the adult Link timeline. In this timeline, the villain is sealed away in the Sacred Realm as Ganon but then pops up again in
  <em>
   Wind Waker
  </em>
  as Ganondorf. What caused him to return to his old form is never explained. On the flip side, in
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  Ganondorf is killed before he can transform, yet crops up later in the timeline as Ganon in
  <em>
   Four Sword Adventures
  </em>
  . How he came back in his transformed state is skipped over. This lack of consistency makes it hard to keep track of Ganondorf's different incarnations and the rules surrounding when he becomes Ganon. That's not great considering he's one of the most important aspects of the franchise's lore.

  The confusion around
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  's timelines has only been made worse by how tight-lipped its creators tend to be. They've repeatedly refused to tell fans which timeline both
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  take place in, only giving the vaguest of hints in interviews. The Wild Era they're both set in is clearly at the end of one of the timelines, but which one is a mystery.

 <p>
  Some fans even think they're set after some kind of convergence that united all three main timelines. That would explain why both games contain references and nods to every game in the franchise, including those from distant timelines.
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  is particularly confusing. As a direct sequel to
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , it's one of the best
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  sequel games but its ending suggests that the franchise's timeline is cyclical, as it seems to loop right back to the beginning. Until the creators give fans some more concrete answers, trying to make sense of these two games is almost impossible.

  Not every
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  fan cares about the chronology of the franchise, but those who do have two reliable sources they can go to: the
  <em>
   Hyrule Historia
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Zelda Encyclopedia
  </em>
  . Among other things, the original
  <em>
   Hyrule Historia
  </em>
  timeline explained where the three Game Boy and Game Boy Color
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games fit into the wider timelines. The
  <em>
   Oracle of Ages &amp; Seasons
  </em>
  games as well as
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  were all set in the period after
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  in the Downfall timeline. The idea was that after saving Hyrule in that game, Link had gone off adventuring and getting himself into all sorts of trouble.

 <p>
  In this original version of the timeline,
  <em>
   Links' Awakening
  </em>
  was a direct sequel to the Oracle titles. Then Nintendo went and retconned it by having
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  act as a prequel to the Oracle games in the
  <em>
   Zelda Encyclopedia
  </em>
  . It's a relatively small change that certainly didn't stop them from being some of the best Nintendo games on the Game Boy Color, but it did add confusion to an already mixed-up timeline. No one is quite sure why the change was made, but many believe the retcon was made to explain why Zelda doesn't recognize Link in the Oracle games. Or maybe Nintendo just doesn't take the timeline as seriously as some fans.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Four Sword Adventures
  </em>
  is an unpopular entry among fans for plenty of reasons. Lots of
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games have weird gimmicks, but
  <em>
   Four Swords Adventures'
  </em>
  multiplayer-focused split mechanic has to be one of the least well-received. Another reason is the damage the game does to one of the timelines. Its backstory makes it clear that
  <em>
   Four Swords Adventures
  </em>
  is a sequel to two earlier Child timeline games,
  <em>
   Four Swords
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Minish Cap
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  and is placed toward the end of the timeline. So far, so good.

 <p>
  But then the game's intro drops the line, "For a time, the people of Hyrule believed that their land was safe," which implies Hyrule had seen a period of extended peace between the original
  <em>
   Four Swords
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fours Swords Adventures
  </em>
  . That's a headscratcher because, canonically, Ganondorf raised his ugly head multiple times during this period. For example,
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  takes place before
  <em>
   Four Swords Adventures
  </em>
  and was a particularly unpleasant time for the people of Hyrule. Either Hyrulians have shockingly short memories or
  <em>
   Four Swords Adventures
  </em>
  doesn't belong at the end of the Child timeline.

 <p>
  Before the events of
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  , there was a major upheaval called the Imprisoning War. It was a time during which Ganon rose, but Link wasn't around to save the day, meaning the Seven Sages had to get involved. They did so by teaming up and imprisoning Ganon in the Dark World. Fans then expected
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  , which was a prequel, to tell the story of what happened in the run-up to the Imprisoning War and why Link wasn't around to stop it.

 <p>
  Instead,
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  confused things by introducing the whole split timeline situation. Technically, the Downfall timeline now represents the run-up to the Imprisoning War, but it's all a bit convoluted. But, not convoluted enough, apparently, because a second Imprisoning War was introduced in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . This is a separate Imprisoning War, however, that imprisons Ganon beneath Hyrule Castle instead of the Dark World. Giving two pivotal events the same name is a great way to confuse fans. In a similar vein, Hyrule is depicted as being founded both at the end of
  <em>
   Skyward Sword
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . The second one might be a "refounding," but no one seems sure, and it's still confusing.

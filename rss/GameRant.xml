  Similar to every other tribe in Natlan, the Masters of the Night-Wind in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  also have their own Reputation system. Since the Reputation system is a little different from the other nations of Teyvat, each tribe has three quests that fall under the Tribal Reputation Quest catalog.

 <p>
  Two of the three quests are usually unlocked the minute you unlock the region, and the same can be said about the Masters of the Night-Wind. Once
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players unlock the Statue of the Seven, heading towards the tribal encampment will automatically trigger a cutscene. Travelers will meet a mysterious Iktomisaurus, and they’ll need to head further into the tribe for the quest to appear in the navigation.

  The Legendary “Color” quest is the second part in the Tribal Reputation quest series and can only be unlocked after completing the prerequisite
  <strong>
   Calling from the Masters of the Night-Wind
  </strong>
  . This quest is pretty simple and will be unlocked once you head through the gigantic front door in the center of the tribe and meet the mysterious Iktomisaurus. Simply follow the quest navigation to meet the Masters of the Night-Wind chief and help him sort out his problems.

 <p>
  You'll need to follow the quest navigation to reach the next area since the teleportation waypoint is below ground in a canyon of sorts. Toltec will require you to head inside, and there are a few spiderwebs that you’ll need to break to get through. Afterward,
  <strong>
   indwell the Iktomisaurus
  </strong>
  and head to the end of the cave. You need to use your elemental sight on the wall in front of you, and when the
  <strong>
   graffiti
  </strong>
  pops up, use the Iktomisaurus skill to remove the barrier.

  Cooking is an important part of Dreamlit Inc’s
  <strong>
   <em>
    Towers of Aghasba
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as it allows you to raise your character’s health bar without having to rely on berries and wild fruits. Since finding berries can take time, having the right cooking tools in your inventory can make everything faster and easier.

  Excitingly, there are many quick meals you can make while fighting off the Withered Razlith, the main antagonist of the game’s story. However, cooking isn’t available from the start; you’ll need to complete a few story quests to unlock it. Here's what you need to know about

  To start cooking meals in
  <em>
   Towers of Aghasba
  </em>
  , you’ll need a
  <strong>
   Campfire
  </strong>
  , the recipe for which Patihoon (the village chef) gives you at the end of the ‘Food for the Soul’ quest. Here are the prerequisites for it:

  <li>
   Complete the ‘Shipwrecked Shimu’ quest.
  </li>
  <li>
   Complete the ‘Establish Our First Village’ quest.

  <li>
   Begin the ‘Food for the Soul’ quest.

 <p>
  During the ‘Food for the Soul’ quest, Patihoon asks for three Lettuce in order to prepare a proper meal for the hungry Shimu, as they’ve been living on Wheat Stew since coming to Aghasba, and it’s time to provide them with a healthier diet. Since Lettuce doesn't grow in the wild, you'll need to farm it yourself. Simply hit the ‘Tab’ button, go to the Build section, and set up a farm. These are the resources you'll need to build a farm in the game:

 <ul>
  <li>
   10 Wood (Wood can be gathered by cutting down trees across the island).
  </li>
  <li>
   3 Rope (Rope can be made using Fiber in the Craft section of the Inventory menu).
  </li>
  <li>
   3 Resin (Resin can be obtained by chopping Resin Fir)
  </li>
  <li>
   3 Common Seed (Common Seeds can be easily collected by harvesting bushes)

 <p>
  Once you're done constructing, plant Common Seeds in the Crop Plot, and wait about five minutes for Lettuce to grow. After you’ve harvested three Lettuce, give them to Patihoon. In return, he’ll reward you with the
  <strong>
   Campfire recipe
  </strong>
  , unlocking cooking, and ending the 'Food for the Soul' quest.

  When you’ve got the Campfire recipe, head to the Craft section of your inventory to check the materials needed to make it. Here’s a quick recap of the items you’ll need to craft a Campfire In
  <em>
   Towers of Aghasba
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1038} -->

 <ul>
  <li>
   5 Wood (To get Wood from trees, it’s crucial that you have a Stone Hatchet. If you don’t have one yet, you can craft one by combining Stones, Sticks, and Fiber).
  </li>
  <li>
   3 Thatch (Thatch is a yellowish-brown fiber that you can grab by harvesting bushes around the land).
  </li>
  <li>
   2 Flint (Flint can be collected by breaking Stone Boulders (giant stones) located in different areas of Aghasba — you'll need a Stone Pickaxe to get some).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Once you have all the materials, open your inventory by pressing the ‘Tab’ button, go to the ‘Craft’ section, select ‘Campfire,’ and hit the ‘Craft’ button to make it. When it’s done, you can place the Campfire anywhere on the island and use it for cooking food.

 <p>
  The best part is that you can remove it by pressing the ‘Q’ button and put it back in your inventory by pressing ‘E.’ This way, you can take it out anywhere while finishing quests without having to gather items and craft it again.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  recently teased some of the balance changes for the Season 14 6v6 tests, including cooldown adjustments, reversions to several hero reworks, and duration reductions for barriers and battlefield obstacles. These and more changes will be implemented in an effort to adapt
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  to the 6v6 format when the first test begins on or around December 17.

 <p>
  6v6 has officially returned to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  in the form of Overwatch: Classic. However, this is only the beginning of a greater experiment with six-player teams, with two different 6v6 tests planned for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14. To facilitate these tests, certain heroes will undergo changes specifically in this game mode.

 <p>
  During a recent interview with
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  content creator Spilo, lead gameplay designer Alec Dawson gave a few examples of these changes. Many tanks in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  are receiving nerfs in the form of higher cooldowns on their abilities, such as with Ramattra’s Void Barrier and Reinhardt’s Charge. Others receive reversions to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  changes – Zarya’s barriers are on separate cooldowns again, Reinhardt loses one Fire Strike charge and steering efficiency on Charge, and Roadhog’s rework has been completely reversed.

  That said, some heroes – especially supports in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  – are receiving buffs instead to help them juggle larger teams. For example, Zenyatta’s Orb of Discord has a bigger effect and no longer has a cooldown per target, and Ana’s Sleep Dart and Biotic Grenade both have their cooldowns reduced.

  These balance changes may sound familiar, as they make heroes play similarly to how they do in Overwatch: Classic. In general, the design philosophy of the 6v6 tests is to move power from the tanks, reduce visual clutter and complexity, but keep
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's "soft crowd control" approach. Obstacles like Lifeweaver’s Tree of Life and Mauga’s Cage Fight will have their durations reduced, tank passives will be removed, and the auto-healing factor will take two seconds longer to kick in. Not everything is being reverted to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  levels, however – Winston keeps his alt-fire, and Mei does not get her Endothermic Blaster's freeze back. It seems like the 6v6 tests will be an interesting intersection between
  <em>
   Overwatch 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  design philosophies.

  While the orbs are your main focus, there are a lot of other unique places to visit, and even more unique items to find. One of which is the Night Light, which lets players change the world to night whenever they are in the overworld; Here's where to find it.

  The Night Light is found in the city
  <strong>
   Theddon, found south of Portoga
  </strong>
  after you get the ship. Leaving from Portoga, sail west until you reach the open ocean then begin sailing south until you reach the southernmost tip of the southern continent. As long as you are coming from the western side of the continent, you can disembark anywhere and walk towards the town.

  The Night Light can
  <strong>
   only be obtained during the day,

  so if you get there during the night go and stay at the Inn in order to change the time of day. During the daytime, head to the blacksmith store and go behind the counter and up the stairs. On the second floor, you'll find a skeleton in a bed and a chest nearby, with the Night Light being in the chest.

  There are many monsters that you can recruit for the Monster Arena that only appear during the night, along with additional unique enemies to farm for XP that only come out at night. If you want to
  <strong>
   change the time back to day, you'll need to rest overnight at an inn
  </strong>
  or wait a few minutes for the game to naturally cycle.

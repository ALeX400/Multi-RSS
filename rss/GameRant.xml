      <title>The Outer Worlds Could Fill a Unique Niche By Going the Opposite Direction as Avowed</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Outer Worlds
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a breakthrough release for Obsidian Entertainment. After spending years working on smaller-scale titles, the Irvine-based developer finally created a new AAA first-person RPG, the first from the company since the launch of 2010's
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  . Although the game wasn't the
  <em>
   Fallout New Vegas
  </em>
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  that many fans had hoped for,
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  was still, in many ways, Obsidian's answer to the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise. It shared a lot of the same dark humor as the post-apocalyptic series, and it was violent and choice-driven, like many of the company's previous works.
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  did receive criticism from some corners of the internet, but it was nonetheless a big hit for Obsidian, both critically and commercially.

 <p>
  More than five years after the launch of
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  , Obsidian is gearing up to release its next AAA RPG:
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  . This highly-anticipated title, which is scheduled to release on Xbox Series X/S and Windows PC in February 2025, is a new, fantasy first-person RPG that's filled with guns and magic. Despite being similar in scope, the two games are quite different in a few respects, like setting and combat design.
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  can, however, distinguish itself even further if Obsidian takes the franchise on the opposite path that
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  took.

  Avowed is Part of the Pillars of Eternity Series, Which Mostly Consists of Isometric CRPGs
 </h3>
 <p>
  Judging by its name, one may think that
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  is a new IP. In fact, just by looking at some gameplay screenshots, those out of the loop would probably conclude that the game isn't part of any existing multimedia franchise and is just its own standalone experience. However, that is not the case. It may surprise some gamers to learn this, but Avowed is actually a spin-off of the Pillars of Eternity franchise, which was created by Obsidian Entertainment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  isn't as well-known as IPs like
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  , but it's still a noteworthy franchise in the overall gaming sphere. The series, up to this point, only consists of two games:
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire
  </em>
  . Both titles were released on modern platforms during the mid-2010s, and they were isometric CRPGs that featured real-time-with-pause combat. The
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  franchise was heavily inspired by the
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  games (
  <em>
   BG1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  , to be exact), which is evident just by looking at its combat and roleplaying mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  <em>
   1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  were both critically acclaimed, but they unfortunately weren't as successful as some of Obsidian's prior works. The second game, in particular, failed to meet the company's sales expectations, perhaps because of its niche appeal.
  <em>
   Deadfire
  </em>
  's lack of commercial success may explain why Obsidian is taking such a drastically different approach to the
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  gameplay formula with
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  . By making it a first-person title instead of an isometric one, the game can appeal to a broader audience, particularly gamers who are fans of
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  , and other first-person RPGs.
 </p>
 <h3 id="obsidian-should-make-an-isometric-crpg-spin-off-of-the-outer-worlds-franchise">
  Obsidian Should Make an Isometric CRPG Spin-Off of The Outer Worlds Franchise
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire
  </em>
  may have underperformed back in the day, but now that CRPGs are more popular than ever thanks to the release of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , it may be a good idea for Obsidian to return to the genre at some point. Perhaps instead of making a new mainline
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  installment, though, it could develop an isometric
  <em>
   Outer Worlds
  </em>
  game instead. Given the strong demand for choice-driven, isometric RPGs at the moment, taking the polar opposite approach compared to what Obsidian is doing with
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  would make a lot of sense. A computer role-playing game spin-off set in the world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Outer Worlds
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise could also fill the void for fans of the classic, Interplay-published
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  RPGs, if handled properly.

  The developers at NetEase Games have released the newest hero shooter,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Rivals.
   </strong>
  </em>
  This game features thirty-three characters from Marvel, each with its own pros and cons. While the launch is considered mostly smooth, it is a hero shooter, and it would be a miracle if it launched without some imbalances and heroes that are considered overpowered.
 </p>
 <p>
  From having a bit too much health to powerful abilities that are already menacing the multiplayer servers,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  does feature characters that have the community grumbling. Thankfully, as it is a live-service game, there are opportunities for NetEase to make changes through updates in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated January 12, 2025, by Melody MacReady:
   </strong>
   Marvel Rivals continues to be one of the most popular free-to-play games as it enters its first season with a new set of content. The latest update not only introduces new maps and modes but also adds two new characters: The Invisible Woman and Mr. Fantastic from The Fantastic Four. These characters fill the roles of strategist and duelist respectively, each with their own unique abilities that make them stand out in this hero shooter. Additionally, over time, other characters have received buffs and nerfs, leading to a more balanced gameplay experience for some, while others remain as overpowered as ever.

  Armed with his dual Element Guns,
  <strong>
   Star-Lord
  </strong>
  is a duelist who quickly fires a barrage of rounds at the opponent and then retreats, making him ideal for flanking. However, the leader of the Guardians Of The Galaxy features a black flip ability, allowing him to not only dodge an attack but instantly reload his guns for another round of his own attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  When surrounded by enemies, his Blaster Barrage attack does exactly as it sounds, making Star-Lord unload his weapons in all directions to damage anyone around him. The character also boasts a strong ultimate attack that makes his Element Guns fire like a beam attack that can cut through armored vanguard characters in seconds.

  Everyone's favorite lovable talking tree,
  <strong>
   Groot
  </strong>
  may be a kind soul, but his kit in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  makes him a deadly foe. Not only do his basic melee attacks have an impressive range for a vanguard, but he can also trap his enemies thanks to his thick vines, and is able to craft walls to keep foes from retreating or protect allies from a barrage of damage while doubling Groot's attacks like a turret.
 </p>
 <p>
  His Spore Bomb is the perfect special attack to combo into Groot's basic attacks, already dealing a good amount of damage, but it spreads out into a small cluster bomb attack as well. Groot can also use his ultimate attack to pull multiple foes together and deal damage over time while imprisoning them.

   Scarlet Witch

  is already an overpowered character in the comics and the movies, so it should be no surprise that she continues to be one in

  . In the game, she saps the life out of opponents using her chaos magic and players have the advantage of her attack tracking opponents, reducing the need for precision aiming and allowing her to defeat an enemy in seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Newcomers should beware, though, that if they hear Scarlet Witch yell out, "Pure chaos!" that is their cue to run for their lives, as she is unleashing her ultimate attack. It is a massive explosion that can destroy everyone, no matter how much health or armor they have, and can result in an entire team being wiped out.

  Similar to Scarlet Witch,
  <strong>
   Winter Soldier
  </strong>
  features an ultimate attack that most players fear. He can leap into the air and slam down with a powerful bionic arm attack. If he immediately defeats an enemy or quickly takes down other enemies that were wounded by the attack, he can use the ability again right away. If timed correctly, the Winter Soldier's ultimate can be used until the entire enemy team is gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Winter Soldier's basic attack is a high-powered pistol that can effectively take out enemies from a distance. When combined with the abilities of his bionic arm, he can defeat even the toughest opponents. It’s advisable to immediately focus on the Winter Soldier when he enters the fight.

  is the prime example of a tank and DPS character fusion, able to charge in and deal a lot of damage fast in a match. Like most Vanguard classes, he has a lot of health already, but at any point, he can use his Symbiotic Resistance ability to grant him an extra 100 health points to keep him going. He can even survive some ultimate attacks thanks to the extra health.
 </p>
 <p>
  The powerful attacks and other abilities turn the playable version of Venom into a force to be reckoned with, such as plummeting down on enemies and swinging faster than Spider-Man. Additionally, his standard attack has a surprising range for a melee attack, all of which turns him into the ideal Vanguard for distracting the enemy team while the rest focuses on the objective.

  is armed with his trusty repulsors in his gauntlets, missiles, and chest beam like most versions of the character. His attacks can hit anyone at seemingly any range, which makes him a danger to anyone because of his ability to fly without any limitations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Amid an intense battle, Iron Man can easily hide high in the air, launching repulsor blasts and energy beams akin to a sniper attack. It wouldn't be so bad if Iron Man didn't have the fastest movement out of all the airborne characters, even without his bonus ability to jet off at great speeds to avoid any possible attacks.

  Many characters from the
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  roster can be compared to
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  characters and
  <strong>
   Squirrel Girl
  </strong>
  is no different. Squirrel Girl is essentially an analog of Junkrat, featuring a main attack to lob projectiles that explode after a second or on impact of an opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike Junkrat, Squirrel Girl's main attack is far more precise and with better range to make Squirrel Girl take out an opponent far across the map. Additionally, she can unleash a stampede of squirrels that can devour foes in seconds, which is technically comic-accurate since Squirrel Girl took on Thanos and won in the past.

  On the one hand,
  <strong>
   Jeff The Land Shark
  </strong>
  is considered the cutest character in the game as he is a tiny shark that looks and moves like a puppy. On the other hand, however, Jeff is a Strategist character who sprays water and launches bubbles that heal teammates, arguably having the fastest healing abilities in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jeff can also heal himself, simply by swimming under the surface of any floor. While he is not invincible while swimming, his small dorsal fin is a challenge to hit, since he moves faster in this mode. Then there is his ultimate attack, which allows him to swallow all teammates and enemies whole. If positioned correctly, he can launch his enemies off the map for multiple kills at once.

That's not what makes her overpowered, though, that honor goes to her Spider-Mines, which she can lay many out onto the map as traps combined with her cannons that make her a nightmare for players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peni Parker also features a Spider-Nest, which has multiple functions: sending out drones that attack opponents within range, allowing Peni to heal over time, and enhancing her speed. It all results in Peni Parker being a constant barrage of abilities that can turn the tide of an entire battle.

  became a notoriously brutal character to go up against. On top of an assault rifle and a shotgun that deal tremendous damage, the Punisher also has access to an armored turret that can wipe out an entire team without even being an ultimate attack, making him a perfect character for beginners.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is humor to be found in a human character like Frank Castle defeating gods and aliens with Earthly firearms, but that's also part of the fun. However, Punisher does have one otherworldly weapon in the form of an exosuit decorated with multiple guns as his ultimate attack, which has already made players run in terror whenever he unleashes it.

  Thanks to his sharpshooting skills as an archer,
  <strong>
   Hawkeye
  </strong>
  has become the bane of many players in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . He is ideal for up-close combat or sniping enemies from afar, with his trusty bow dealing out a large amount of damage and one headshot able to eliminate most foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hawkeye also has a defense mechanism via his melee attack, where he can swipe enemy projectiles out of the air. However, his ultimate attack is what can make him everyone's worst enemy, as he can see the shadows of his foes wherever they go, and as long as he hits a shadow, the player takes the damage, which can allow him to wipe out the whole enemy team without even seeing them.

  Introduced in Season 1, Sue Storm, the
  <strong>
   Invisible Woman
  </strong>
  , is a top-tier strategist thanks to her combination of healing and shielding abilities. She can attack and heal simultaneously with her main attack, while her alternate attack generates a small shield that can protect a teammate from imminent defeat or create an opening for Sue to flank the enemy. Additionally, she can utilize her force field powers to push or pull enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fitting given her name, Invisible Woman also grants herself and her allies invisibility via a massive force field, forcing enemies to fire blindly or enter the field to regain their sight. At the same time, the force field heals over time, meaning enemies are trapped with teammates who are constantly healing. As a bonus, if she is paired with her husband, Mr. Fantastic, she can grant him an armor ability that makes him more durable.

  continues to live up to her title as the Goddess Of Death. She uses her magical darts, which have seemingly unlimited range and deal significant damage, particularly with headshots. Hela becomes nearly unstoppable in certain matches when paired with the right healers and tanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of her basic attack, Hela can escape hectic situations with her Astral Flock ability, turning her into a crow that quickly flies a short distance. Hela can also bombard the enemies with her ultimate attack, sending Nastrond Crows down to deal massive explosive damage that can take out most characters in one or two hits.

  Having two characters in one makes
  <strong>
   Cloak &amp; Dagger
  </strong>
  a bit technical with a lot of experimentation needed to learn their controls. Dagger is all about healing and supporting the team her abilities with minimal damage against enemies, while Dagger can drain an opponent's health in seconds, stun them with his cape, and make allies invisible.
 </p>
 <p>
  When a player learns how to bounce between Cloak &amp; Dagger, swapping between healing and damage properly to balance the two playstyles, it can feel like playing a two-person army. As a result, Cloak &amp; Dagger are the ideal Strategist character for those who want to balance healing and damage.

  <strong>
   Iron Fist
  </strong>
  has quickly gained a reputation as a character the community loves and despises at the same time. Given that the character is an elite martial artist, he features fast and powerful combos that can be used in midair or on the ground, fitting his Iron Fist moniker, but he takes it even further with wall running and self-healing.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Dragon's Defense ability, Iron Fist absorbs attacks from his foes and redistributes them with Yat Jee Chung Kuen as a rapid-fire barrage of attacks that can demolish nearly every character on the roster. Following up the barrage with his healing ability is enough to allow Iron Fist to potentially go an entire match without being eliminated.

  A new update coming to
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Elder Scrolls Online
   </strong>
  </em>
  is set to add new dungeons and revamp the game's starting zones. The upcoming
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  update will be the first major content drop of the year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Against the odds,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  remains one of the most popular MMORPGs on the market. Upon its release, it was met with a lukewarm reception from players, which in the MMO space, can often spell a death sentence. However, ZeniMax Online Studios has remained committed to improving the game, with major DLC releasing every year since launch. This has transformed
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  <em>
   Online
  </em>
  into one of the best titles in the MMO space. At the end of 2024, the developer confirmed a new seasonal system change for new
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  content in 2025, which would see more frequent updates for players going forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a post on Steam, ZeniMax Online Studios gave details about
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Fallen Banners
  </em>
  DLC, which will see the arrival of two new four-player dungeons for players to explore. The first is Exiled Redoubt, where players must "Join Lucilla in infiltrating the stronghold of the once-proud House Albus and discover a plot that threatens to condemn the people of Cyrodiil to endless war." The second is Lep Seclusa, where "You and your allies must defend the Moth Priests and their precious relic from the sinister Orpheon the Tactician and his army of deserters." These new
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  dungeons "feature their own unique storylines, characters, challenges (including unique boss battles), and secrets," with exclusive rewards for completing them.

 <p>
  That's not all, though. Releasing alongside
  <em>
   Fallen Banners
  </em>
  is Update 45, arriving with tons of changes and general improvements to the popular MMORPG. The most exciting addition is the Starter Zone Refresh, giving all the starting areas in the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  a makeover. According to ZeniMax Online Studios, this is "bringing them more in line visually with the detail of
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  ’s recent additions such as West Weald or the Telvanni Peninsula." Both
  <em>
   Fallen Banners
  </em>
  and Update 45 launch on March 10 on PC and on March 25 on Xbox and PlayStation consoles. While Update 45 is free to all players, an ESO Plus membership is needed to play
  <em>

  <em>

  </em>
  dragging on, it could still be a long time before a new mainline title in the series is released, so it's a good thing that

      <title>8 Best World Seeds in Stardew Valley</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stardew Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an open-ended farming life simulation where players can bring their vision of a perfect homestead to life. The game begins with the player inheriting a run-down farm from their Grandpa. As they move to the Valley, players can grow and gather crops, raise animals, and mine for resources to be self-sufficient.

  When they create a new game, players have the opportunity to configure a Random Seed code in the Advanced Options menu. If they do not set a Random Seed, the game assigns a numerical value randomly. The Random Seed value affects how the game’s random number generation (RNG) rolls out. It determines the outcome of various events, including item drops, crop growth, and artifact spawns. As such, players can use specific Seed codes to influence the RNG and manipulate the outcome of certain events in their gameplay. This list compiles the best world seeds to use in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  .

   <strong>
    Updated January 10th, 2025 by Usama Ali
   </strong>
   : With the launch of Stardew Valley Update 1.6, the world of farming has expanded with new possibilities. Certain world seeds can influence the farmer’s journey, allowing them to witness special events that would otherwise have a very low chance of occurring naturally. Among these, seeds that guarantee increased Crop Fairy visits stand out. These magical encounters accelerate crop growth, leading to bountiful harvests and giving players a head start on their farming goals. To help players make the most of their playtime, this updated list now includes two more entries they should consider for their next Stardew Valley adventure

 <p>
  For ambitious farmers looking to conquer
  <em>
   Stardew Valley

  ’s Community Center challenges, seed 203853699 is a perfect choice. This seed strategically aligns the Traveling Cart's inventory with those hard-to-get items, like

  . This way, players can get their hands on valuable resources at just the right time.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, the Traveling Cart can provide an Ancient Seed in Summer, setting players up for a bountiful Fall harvest. To make the most of this seed, keep track of Community Center tasks, watch for rare items at the Traveling Cart, and manage coins wisely—some cart items are super pricey. All in all, this seed is a gift for both perfectionists and completionists in

 <p>
  This unique Seed rolls out a random
  <strong>
   Meteor event at
  </strong>
  the end of Year One, where a rare Meteorite appears on the player’s farm in a random 3x3 area. The chances of this occurring naturally in the game are only 1%. With this Seed code, players can additionally witness
  <strong>
   two more Meteor events by the end of Year Two.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  If they’re lucky enough, players can get an
  <strong>
   Iridium Meteorite
  </strong>
  on their farm that contains valuable Iridium Ore.

   A simple Seed that lets players maximize their profits from the first day of Spring.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Crop Fairy Event has a one percent chance of being triggered in a single playthrough. However, this Seed code makes it possible for players to be visited by the Crop Fairy on the
  <strong>
   very first night of
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Spring
  </strong>
  . She fully grows all the planted crops on the player’s farm, making them ready for harvest
  <strong>
   overnight
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can use this World Seed to maximize their profits on the first day of playthrough by planting as many crops as they can. This way, all crops can be harvested in one day rather than in a whole season, giving players a little head-start on their farming journey.

  The Crop Fairy is one of the most sought-after events in all of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley,
  </em>
  thanks to its very low trigger chance. The seed above makes it possible for players to witness the Crop Fairy twice during their first year, making it an incredibly valuable seed for a fantastic early start. The crop fairy should show up on the third night, but will come back and visit players on the first night of Fall as well. To make this seed even better, players should also gain access to both an owl and a meteor sometime during the first year, making this world generation a cut above the rest when it comes to early-game rewards.

   Provides a great start to the farm life without being too unfair.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This interesting World Seed requires a lot of hard work initially but is well worth the effort in the long run. As soon they run this Seed, players should start clearing out the maximum areas around their farm. This increases the chances for them to experience random events and get the
  <strong>
   Stone Owl or Meteorite
  </strong>
  on their farm. The Stone Owl is a very rare event with only a 0.5% chance of it happening normally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, this Seed also includes a chance for the player to be visited by the Crop Fairy on the
  <strong>
   third day of Spring in Year One.
  </strong>
  To make the most out of this seed, players can plant multiple crops and maximize their earning potential.

  Using this seed code provides players with a quick early-game boost. This seed makes it possible for the farmer to get a few
  <strong>
   Ancient Seed artifacts
  </strong>
  almost instantly. To find these artifacts, players need to dig around the area near Linus’ Tent in the Mountain. The only productive use of this artifact is to donate it to the Museum.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gunther at the Museum will reward players with one pack of
  <strong>
   plantable Ancient Seeds
  </strong>
  along with the recipe to process Ancient Seed artifacts into more seeds. These Ancient Seeds can be grown into
  <strong>
   Ancient Fruit
  </strong>
  . It is an extremely valuable fruit with a base sell price of
  <strong>
   1,650 gold.
  </strong>
  Ancient Seed artifacts are otherwise quite rare in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , with only a 3.7% chance of appearing in an Artifact Trove.

      Fans can expect all Festival of the Lost armor sets to eventually make it into the game, even the losing ones.

      By allowing losing sets to be released later, Destiny 2 players can enjoy a wider variety of armor designs.

  Just a little less than one week ago, Bungie released the third and final Act for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Destiny 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Revenant, the second Episode after The Final Shape. In just a month or so, the third and possibly last Episode of the game will launch in the form of Heresy, which will then lead the way for Codename: Frontiers, a new expansion that will presumably take
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players out of the Sol System. While much of what's coming in the future is still shrouded in mystery, Bungie recently released a TWID post talking about one big change that's coming this year with the Festival of the Lost event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Festival of the Lost is
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Halloween event, and it's typically one of the most beloved, despite the change from the Infinite Forest to Haunted Lost Sectors over the years. It's still unclear if this year Bungie will make changes to its formula for seasonal events, including Festival of the Lost, but the studio has already confirmed that it's moving away from a huge trend. In fact, over the years, Bungie started making community polls where fans had to choose between one of two Festival of the Lost themes for new armor sets for each class - but now, even the losing sets will be released into the game.

  There has long been a debate about whether one should vote for a given set or theme for the Festival of the Lost armor sets over the other due to how the losing sets would never see the light of day. Although cosmetic armor sets are not a key gameplay feature, every year some fans were unhappy with the community vote regarding some themes or sets winning over others. As such,
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Frontiers will finally allow all sets to make it into the game at some point, with the winning ones being released with Festival of the Lost and the others at a later date.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bungie has not yet specified when exactly players will be able to get their hands on the remaining sets, but it has already stated that last year's losing wizard-themed Festival of the Lost armor for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  will be released during Episode Heresy. This is a big change that will likely not go unnoticed, as Festival of the Lost armor is usually some of the best in the game, and the wizard-themed sets are not really out of place within Heresy's setting and tone.

  This year, Bungie is having a community poll between Slasher and Specter armor sets, with them being divided as follows:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Slasher Titan - Jason from
   <em>
    Friday the 13th
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   Slasher Hunter - Ghostface from
   <em>
    Scream
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   Slasher Warlock - Scarecrow-inspired set
  </li>
  <li>
   Specter Titan - Babadook
  </li>
  <li>
   Specter Hunter - La Llorona
  </li>
  <li>
   Specter Warlock - Slenderman
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  With such a vast array of popular folklore creatures and horror movies as inspiration, it seems that players can't really go wrong with their votes for Festival of the Lost 2025. This is especially true now that the game is finally moving away from making just the winning set, much to the disappointment of those who voted for losing ones.

  Why Destiny 2's Change to FotL Armor Comes At a Good Time
 </h3>
 <p>
  This may seem like a small thing, but it's an example of Bungie listening to player feedback that comes just about at the right time, considering the community's low morale throughout Revenant. It's not a game-changing feature, but it may be just enough to start rebuilding trust for the company now that it needs it, and since Frontiers is presumably showing itself in just a month or two, the hype train should depart sooner rather than later.
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Heresy has a big weight on its shoulders for this very reason, as Bungie needs to have a polished launch that feels good to play if it wants to truly win fans back ahead of its next big release sometime in June.

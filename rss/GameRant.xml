  As the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  's life is winding down, all eyes are on Nintendo, eagerly awaiting the unveiling of the company's next flagship console. While rumors and speculation on what players can expect from the successor to the Nintendo Switch abound, Nintendo has remained decidedly tight-lipped about the console. However, the announcement of a new accessory for the existing Switch hardware might add credibility to a leak regarding a new style of Joy-Con for the Switch 2 ahead of the console's official reveal.

 <p>
  Nintendo recently announced the Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way), which allows players to connect and charge a single pair of Joy-Cons without having to attach them to the sides of the Switch console itself. This accessory is the first official Nintendo-produced Joy-Con charging stand, though the company has licensed third-party manufacturers to produce their own in the past. While it might seem odd for Nintendo to produce the first official Joy-Con charging dock seven years after the Switch's launch — and right on the heels of the console's successor, no less — the release of this accessory could signal that Nintendo is preparing players to expect a new type of Joy-Con for the Switch 2.

 <p>
  There have been a lot of leaks and rumors floating around the internet regarding the Switch 2's hardware, but very few concrete details about the console have emerged. Based on comments made by Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa, players can expect the Switch's successor to follow the general design and branding of its predecessor. However, there have been leaks regarding the console that suggest it will be iterating upon the current Switch's design in a few big ways — most notably when it comes to the console's Joy-Cons.

 <p>
  Among the recent Switch 2 hardware leaks is one that comes from accessory manufacturer Mobapad, which allegedly posted these details to its Bilibili page. This leak mentions a new design for the Switch 2's Joy-Cons that features a larger overall form factor and a new magnetic system for attaching them to the console. If this leak is true, then current Switch Joy-Cons may not be suited for attachment to the Switch 2 console, but the release of the Joy-Con Charging Stand might be Nintendo's way of circumventing this issue to allow the controllers to be compatible with the new hardware.

  Nintendo May Be Teasing the Switch 2's Backwards Compatibility with This Latest Accessory
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another major feature of the Switch 2 that has been leaked is its backward compatibility with current Switch games. Included in the same leak from Mobapad is the detail that existing Switch cartridges will work with the Switch 2, but the new console will feature cartridges that won't work on the Switch 1, similar to Nintendo DS and 3DS cartridges. If existing Switch games will indeed be playable on the Switch 2, it would make sense that Nintendo would want existing Joy-Cons to function with the new console as well, since several titles are directly tied to the hardware of current Joy-Cons.

 <p>
  This new Joy-Con Charging Stand could be Nintendo's attempt at preserving the functionality of the current model of Switch Joy-Cons by allowing them to be charged even if they can't be connected to the sides of the new console. In theory, players could still use these Joy-Cons with the Switch 2 while it is docked or in tabletop mode without the need to attach them to the console. If the Switch 2 is going to feature a new magnetically attached Joy-Con, then the release of this charging stand so late into the current console's life could be a hint at Nintendo's plan for backward compatibility and how it will circumvent hardware disparities.

  Smithing is one of the many activities players can engage with and level up in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord
   </strong>
  </em>
  . While there will be thousands of weapons to choose from in the game, many are not well-made and will have fairly low stats for a lord to use.

  While smithing will take some a hefty time and money investment, it will be the easiest way for players to eventually get some of the best weapons in the game for them and their companions to use. All smithing requires charcoal to keep the fires burning; here's where to get it.

  Charcoal is an incredibly rare item that players will need to craft themselves in order to get. The
  <strong>
   recipe requires two Hardwood
  </strong>
  , which can be purchased in any major city. Due to the demand, it may sometimes be out of stock, but waiting or coming back in a day will usually have them being restocked. Back in the city menu, enter the smithy and select the,
  <strong>
   "Refine" option along the top of the screen
  </strong>
  .

  The first option will be to
  <strong>
   turn two Hardwood into one charcoal
  </strong>
  . This will take up your smithing stamina, but will also get your XP in the skill tree. While this can be a tedious process, players can unlock a smiting skill to help with the reward for refining.

  Companions can also be used to refine hardwood into charcoal using their own stamina and earning XP towards their skill tree. Companions can also learn Efficient Charcoal Maker, to greatly expedite the process and make the most out of hardwood. Hardwood can also be obtained by smelting weapons, which also requires one charcoal. This is useful with
  <strong>
   wooden weapons that will reward three hardwood

   Smithing Stamina can only be regenerated by waiting in town

  , and won't return when traveling in the world. Resting in town is as simple as selecting the, "Wait here for some time" option in a city, settlement, or castle. Every companion in your party has stamina, letting you break up the work when necessary and not forcing you to waste multiple in-game days just to smith a few weapons. There is an additional skill players can learn to make their stamina last longer:

  ’s gameplay mainly has players going up against Automatons and Terminids. Players have already encountered a wide variety of enemies from both factions, but the Escalation of Freedom update brings new versions of both enemy types to the game. The enemies revealed include the Impaler, which franchise fans will recognize from the original
  <em>

  . This Terminid is massive and demands the player’s attention, stabbing with tentacles from below the ground.

  It’ll be joined by the Spore Charger, which is shrouded in fog to conceal its position until it’s too late, as well as the Terminid Alpha Commander which is a bigger and meaner version of the Brood Commander.

  has a mostly cooperative community. This is partly thanks to the design of the game, which encourages players to work together instead of being antagonistic towards each other.

  Unfortunately, there’s always going to be players who want to ruin the fun of others. Sometimes, players will cross paths with grief kickers who kick party members out right before a mission ends, robbing the players of mission rewards. Earlier this year, Arrowhead Game Studios stated that it is working on a solution to the problem plaguing the community, and it appears that a fix has come. In the Escalation of Freedom update, when players are kicked from a session, they will spawn into a new one as the host with all the team’s loot from their previous session. With this change, all players will be able to claim their loot even if they are kicked.

  Doctor Octopus is among the more intriguing teased elements of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  . Appearing in a post-credits scene in
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  , the famous villain is visited by Norman Osborn in the RAFT prison. He's scribbling in a book in this scene, and when asked what he is writing, he says "the final chapter," heavily suggesting that he will return as a villain in the next entry, possibly partnering with his one-time nemesis Norman Osborn. There's promise in this idea, as Doctor Octopus is among the best
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  villains, and Insomniac painted a compelling rendition of him in the first
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  . However, his enduring legacy in the game series might actually work to his detriment in
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3

  Doc Ock's Appearance in Marvel's Spider-Man Is Hard to Top
 </h3>
 <p>
  Otto Octavius' return in
  <em>
   Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  may come as a welcome surprise for fans of the first game, as his character development and climactic boss battle made for a gripping and entertaining narrative back in 2018. His descent from Peter Parker's mentor into a mad scientist seeking revenge was complex and nuanced, culminating in a visually spectacular battle thousands of feet in the sky—an appropriate venue for a
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  showdown. But if Doc Ock is coming back, Insomniac will be faced with the issue of how to top this battle, not just from the perspective of gameplay and spectacle, but also in terms of narrative context.

 <p>
  Octavius is among Marvel's most famous villains, mostly due to how he manages to affect Spider-Man's civilian life. His depiction in
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  is no different: the fate of the entire city, including Peter's Aunt May, hinges on the final fight with Doc Ock, which lends the mission a strong sense of weight and urgency. It could be difficult to recapture this in
  <em>
   Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  without it feeling contrived or stale. Then, there's the fight itself, which could also feel like retreading old ground if Insomniac isn't careful.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  There are definitely interesting routes that
  <em>
   Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  could take with Doc Ock, a
  <em>
   Superior Spider-Man
  </em>
  adaptation being among the most compelling. In the
  <em>
   Superior Spider-Man
  </em>
  comic book story, Otto Octavius takes over Peter Parker's body, striving to become a better version of the hero while dealing out a wrathful and ruthless brand of justice. In the source material, Peter Parker is essentially dead, but the last vestiges of his consciousness still exist, fighting for control of his own mind.

 <p>
  This is a very out-there and wacky story premise, although it has quite a bit in common with Peter's relationship with the Symbiote, at least on the surface. This could lead to a retreading of
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  's symbiote conflict, especially the climactic battle between Peter and Miles. Thus, adapting
  <em>
   Superior Spider-Man
  </em>
  may not allow Insomniac to completely sidestep the issue of recycling narrative concepts and gameplay beats.

 <p>
  Having said all that,
  <em>
   Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  's implementation of Doc Ock isn't destined to be overshadowed by the villain's first appearance. Insomniac's best bet may be to fully lean into the alluded partnership between Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius, playing with this relationship and allowing it to bear interesting narrative and gameplay fruit. If the game borrows from
  <em>
   Superior Spider-Man
  </em>
  , it could still stand apart from
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  by focusing more on the struggle for Peter's body and the character development of Otto, rather than putting too much emphasis on bombastic fights or one-dimensional conflicts.

  One of the most astounding things about gaming is the way it can bring in players of varying backgrounds, even those with seemingly overwhelming hurdles to overcome on the road to pressing start. For the blind, a good accessibility option makes the difference between playing and not. That’s something
  <strong>
   <em>
    Aground
   </em>
  </strong>
  developer Whitethorn is keenly aware of.

  Game Rant’s Joshua Duckworth was able to sit down with Whitethorn’s CEO Matthew White to discuss what it means to players with such limitations to be able to join in on the fun thanks to a little extra feature here and there.

  How Whitethorn Games is Pushing For Accessibility Changes
 </h2>
 <p>
  Gamers without vision issues may be surprised that blind people play video games frequently. Part of that stems from a misconception that “blindness” means a total lack of sight instead of including people with debilitatingly low visual acuity (in the United States, people with vision worse than 20/200 non-correctable are classified as “blind,” for instance). Another factor often overlooked is the way accessibility features can overcome even the most daunting barriers when used well, which is exactly what Whitethorn prides itself on.
 </p>

 <p>
  And progress on those features is coming from the indie scene, says White. As CEO of a small studio committed to expanding the accessibility features seen across the industry, White is in a position to know. He pointed to this year’s Access-Ability Summer Showcase as evidence of the dedication of small teams.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We've seen some awesome things from tiny little places. [The Access-Ability Showcase] a few weeks ago was an excellent example of indies doing full blind support, full deaf support, like American Sign Language, like stuff that really you would not catch the triple-linear enterprise currently doing, but I think it's moving in the right way. And I think the louder we are about it, I hope that that continues.

 <p>
  That isn’t to say that only the little studios are having big impacts. Lauded for its accessibility options,
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  has made such a big difference that SightlessKombat, a blind player, was able to tackle the game in 2022, receiving only minimal support from another player in solving the game’s puzzles. Naughty Dog did such a good job with accessibility features in
  <em>
   The Last of Us 2
  </em>
  in 2020 that the game brought a disability advocate to tears. The introduction of the Osteo Striga in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , with its honing ammo, overjoyed a legally blind player. The list goes on, and hopefully it will only grown longer.

  Of course, gamers are an innovative lot, and so are people living with long-term challenges like blindness. For example,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  ' accessibility options aren’t the most expansive, yet a crew came together to help the same SightlessKombat sail the high seas and sink skeletons all the same. And as White pointed out, vision issues aren’t limited to the kind of extreme low-vision many associate with blindness.

  <p>
   Blindness is a profound example, but we have ways to detect issues in players while they're playing … Even if you consider something as mundane as nearsightedness, most people don't have to pay money to use their eyes–so it is very much a disability in that way. So we just have to be a little more gentle with what we think accessibility needs. Even if it does “ make the game easier ,” I still want to enjoy the game.

 <p>
  Additionally, things like dyslexia and color blindness can cause issues for gamers, and are fairly common conditions. Certain fonts and color patterns can help mitigate those issues for players, but those lead to a challenge for developers–disability is as diverse as any other facet of humanity, and not everything can be so neatly resolved.

  A Chronic Condition for the Gaming Industry
 </h2>
 <p>
  As a result of the wide range of hurdles that may prevent gamers from enjoying video games, and the fact that developers have only so much money to put into their games, there’s a balancing act developers have to consider. There simply aren’t solutions for every issue a gamer may face yet, as accessibility is an ever-evolving notion in the gaming industry, and where each game connects to the concept is different.

 <p>
  This is something that, as an indie developer, White understands. There are limitations in the form of time, resources, and expertise. That doesn’t, however, forgive inaction in his mind.

  <p>
   I understand the financial rationale, if you're a tiny indie studio, and it's like “Let's do full colorblind mode,” like, okay, that might be some money, right? Especially in this economy … Unfortunately, it would be impossible to hit every single person, so it's really trying to do as much as possible with as little as possible, which is kind of the indie mantra to begin with. We want everybody to do this.

 <p>
  To that end, not only does Whitethorn walk the walk, but it also talks the talk. White makes APIs and toolkits developed by the studio available for others, and explained his process of using a dedicated accessibility specialist early in the development process to help remove common hurdles gamers face early in the prototyping phase. He also directed developers’ attention to the tools offered by platforms themselves, encouraging other studios to take advantage of these resources to better outfit their games with features that can bring more gamers in.

  That, in turn, is good business, White argues. It certainly has been for Whitethorn, which he says regularly receives praise from players excited to have been able to approach their games, echoing the kinds of experiences

  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  , and

  It's all about being more accommodating and meeting customers where they are. It's nothing bizarre, it's that humans are different. They're diverse, they have different needs, and we want to accommodate them. By being a good business person and selling to customers what they want. But as far as I'm concerned, it's really just responding to market needs. I think that would be very important, right? If I can sell good things that improve the industry that make people happy, and then allow people to feel like they're welcome.

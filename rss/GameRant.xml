   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </em>
  </strong>
  has long been a cornerstone of the MMORPG genre for years, boasting a passionate community and intricate endgame content. Among its most dedicated players are raiders, who tackle the game's hardest challenges in pursuit of prestige and glory. The release of the Futures Rewritten (Ultimate) raid in Patch 7.11 reignited excitement within the community, but it also sparked controversy due to allegations of cheating during the unofficial Race to World First.

  Echo Esports and MogTalk, prominent groups in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  community, hosted a broadcast showcasing top teams competing to be the first to clear Futures Rewritten (Ultimate). While the event aimed to celebrate the ingenuity and dedication of raiders, it was marred by accusations against the team GRIND, a member of which apparently used third-party tools, which led to disqualification. This situation has brought to light complex issues about competition, the game's rules, and the broader implications for the community.

  Futures Rewritten (Ultimate) builds upon the legacy of the Eden raid series from the Shadowbringers expansion, offering players a grueling five-phase gauntlet featuring reimagined encounters with notable bosses like Fatebreaker and the Oracle of Darkness. As with previous Ultimate raids, it pushed players to their limits, demanding precision, coordination, and adaptability.

  However, the raid's timing stirred additional debate. Released near Thanksgiving, it inadvertently clashed with holiday plans for many North American players. This scheduling difficulty added another layer of complexity to the competitive atmosphere, with some questioning whether it disadvantaged players unable to dedicate full-time attention to the event.

  Final Fantasy 14 Third-Party Plugins and Their Complicated History
 </h3>
 <p>
  The use of third-party plugins has long been a contentious topic in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  . While Square Enix strictly prohibits such tools under its terms of service, many players continue to use them for cosmetic enhancements, accessibility features, or minor quality-of-life improvements. In competitive contexts, however, these tools can provide an unfair advantage, as evidenced by the GRIND scandal.

 <p>
  This is not the first time plugins have disrupted
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's raiding scene. Similar controversies occurred during the Omega Protocol (Ultimate) and Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate) races in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Footage of top teams using illicit mods to secure clears tarnished the achievements of legitimate competitors and fueled broader debates about the ethics of plugin use.

 <p>
  The larger concern is the impact on the game's vibrant modding communities, such as
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  LGBTQIA+ players who use mods for self-expression and character customization. Speech bubble adjustments, furniture placement aids, and gender-affirming visual tweaks are examples of harmless plugins that enrich the game experience for many. However, high-profile cheating incidents risk casting a shadow over the entire community, potentially prompting harsher enforcement from Square Enix.

 <p>
  In response to repeated controversies, game director Naoki Yoshida, affectionately known as Yoshi-P, has expressed his frustration. In an interview with RPGSite, Yoshi-P acknowledged the difficulty of addressing the issue, saying:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":722} -->
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "I think I have the strongest desire to have an officially sanctioned world-first race, yet whenever we find out that players have been relying on a 3rd-party add-on it's heartbreaking at the same time. So that begs the question, why don't we officially sanction a raid race, so we can shut out those activities that break our Terms of Use? However, no matter how we analyze the problem, we can't find a solution to completely shut those tools out."
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1181} -->

  Yoshi-P's comments highlight the complexity of balancing competitive integrity with community engagement. While an officially sanctioned race could deter cheating, implementing it without unintentionally alienating players or overpolicing harmless mods remains a significant challenge.

  What This Means for Final Fantasy 14's Future
 </h3>
 <p>
  The controversy surrounding Futures Rewritten (Ultimate) underscores broader tensions in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's community. Ultimate raids, while niche, represent the pinnacle of player skill and dedication, making controversies like these particularly damaging. If Square Enix cannot find a resolution, the integrity of future races and the goodwill of its raiding community could be at risk.

 <p>
  At the same time, the ongoing debate about plugins emphasizes the need for clear and nuanced policies. While enforcing bans on third-party tools is important for competitive fairness, it is equally crucial to avoid penalizing players who use them for personal or creative reasons. Maintaining this balance will be critical to preserving the game's inclusive and collaborative spirit. It is also another example of how
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  must continue to address controversies such as the recently added hairstyle.

  As the dust settles on the Futures Rewritten controversy, players continue to speculate about possible solutions, from stricter monitoring to mandatory live streaming for competitors. While no perfect answer exists, one thing is clear: the passion and dedication of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's raiding community remains as strong as ever.

      <title>How Indiana Jones and The Great Circle Differs From Tomb Raider, Uncharted</title>

  When it comes to adventure games, two names often come up in comparison:
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  . Now, MachineGames'
  <strong>
   <em>
    Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
   </em>
  </strong>
  looks to take the stage with a style similar to
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  , which has naturally caused onlookers to draw comparisons between it and the franchises it seems to have been inspired by.

  Both the
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  franchises have set the bar for action-packed storytelling, but in an interview with Game Rant, MachineGames' executive producer Jerk Gustafsson revealed how
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  is carving its own path. While Gustafsson acknowledged the influence of games like
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  , he hinted at some bold choices that set
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  apart in ways players might not expect.

  How Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Compares to Tomb Raider and Uncharted
 </h2>
 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  continues to build anticipation, comparisons to other action-adventure franchises like
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  have been inevitable. What's interesting about
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  , however, is that they both owe part of their own inspiration to the
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  IP. Now,
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  is being compared to them when, if the game is as authentic as MachineGames says it will be, those comparisons should probably be going in the opposite direction.

 <p>
  That being said, Gustafsson was quick to recognize the impact that
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  have had on the world of gaming, not denying their influence on
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  . When asked about whether anything from
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  served as inspiration for
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  , as well as what might set it apart from those franchises, Gustafsson replied,

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   These are both a fantastic series of games, and it’s hard not to be influenced by the quality and execution of any titles coming out of those developers. There are definitely a few things that set us apart though; not only the obvious first-person perspective, but our non-linear structure that is more grounded in player movement and combat, as well as the overall pacing of the game. Those things differ quite a lot.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  have certainly set a high standard for adventure games, MachineGames isn't simply looking to replicate what others have done. The developer is approaching
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and t he Great Circle
  </em>
  with a bold mindset, focused on offering a distinct gameplay experience that reflects the unique essence of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  . From its first-person perspective to its non-linear progression, the game promises to deliver a fresh take on the classic formula. These changes, however, don’t come without risk, and MachineGames is fully aware that it is stepping into new territory, hoping to redefine what an
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  adventure can be. Gustafsson concluded,

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It will be very interesting to see how players will react to them and experience the MachineGames version of an Indiana Jones adventure. Also, a bit scary but we all want to bring something new to the table, and we shouldn’t shy away from doing that, even if there are some unknowns attached to it.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  prepares to immerse players in a fresh take on Indy's adventures, MachineGames is embracing the challenge of offering something new while remaining true to the spirit of the iconic character. While the comparisons to
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  are understandable, the developer is confident that its game's first-person perspective, non-linear structure, and unique pacing will set it apart from its spiritual predecessors. Though venturing into uncharted territory often comes with uncertainty, MachineGames' excitement is palpable as they look forward to seeing how players will experience their vision for an
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  gaming adventure.

  2024 is another fantastic year for video games. Nintendo released a brand-new game starring Princess Peach;
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  finally got a sequel; the next part of the acclaimed
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  remake came out;
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  is getting another open-world adventure, which just scratches the surface. We should expect many more
  <strong>
   2024 video game release dates
  </strong>
  as more presentations happen, like the next State of Play, Nintendo Direct, and all the other online streams.

  So, for the gamers who would like to plan their gaming sessions ahead of time, here's a list of the major
  <strong>
   video games coming out in 2024
  </strong>
  . We'll try to keep this article updated every week or so with any changes, such as delays, cancellations, and new announcements from the big publishers.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We'll list each month below and then have a 2024 TBA list at the bottom. The TBA section will have the
   <strong>
    2024 video games
   </strong>
   that we don't have confirmed dates yet for but are still planned for release in the new year.

  If you're new to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Snap
   </em>
  </strong>
  , building solid decks can be a bit overwhelming at first. But don’t worry—the game’s initial roster of Series One cards is both easy to use and powerful enough to help you win matches. Most Pool One cards can be unlocked after about 15–20 hours of gameplay. Fortunately, these cards are more than enough to get you to Infinite or, at the very least, help you earn enough Cubes to progress faster and unlock better cards.

  This beginner-friendly guide offers several early-game decks that use only Pool One and Starter cards. The goal is to help free-to-play
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  players get as much value as paid players without needing to unlock the Season Pass or Series Five cards.

   : Marvel Snap’s constant OTAs have been shaking up the metagame in higher ranks, but the early-game META remains largely unchanged since Pool One cards rarely receive major nerfs or upgrades. Regardless, we’ve updated this guide with the latest information and introduced a discard archetype deck for beginners to experiment with early on. Discard is a fun and powerful archetype in higher ranks, with plenty of potential once you unlock better cards from higher pools.

  Devil Dinosaur is one of the top early-game cards to unlock in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  . This powerful card enables you to build two end-game powerhouses by leveraging the cards in your hand. To create
  <strong>
   an effective beginner Devil Dinosaur deck
  </strong>
  , use the following lineup: Devil Dinosaur, Moon Girl, White Queen, Mister Fantastic, Sentinel, Cable, Mantis, Iron Man, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Nightcrawler, and Medusa.

 <p>
  The core strategy is to use Moon Girl to duplicate your hand, allowing you to play two Devil Dinosaurs, each gaining +2 Power for every card in your hand. (Cable, Mantis, Sentinel, and White Queen help maximize the impact of Devil Dino by keeping your hand full.)

 <p>
  If you don't draw Devil Dinosaur with Moon Girl, Iron Man can be a strong backup, doubling your Power on the board and helping secure victory.

 <p>
  One of the best beginner decks in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  is
  <strong>
   the Spectrum-Onslaught Ongoing lineup
  </strong>
  . To recreate this setup, team up Spectrum and Onslaught with Hawkeye, Kazar, Klaw, Squirrel Girl, Rocket Raccoon, The Punisher, White Queen, and Iron Man.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  This deck dominates early matches because of its
  <strong>
   "wide" late-game-win strategy
  </strong>
  . In the early rounds, players focus on spreading their reach by placing one-Cost and Ongoing cards on the board. Later, they buff these drops with Power boosters like Spectrum or Kazar.

 <p>
  By the time the opponent recognizes the deck’s real potential,
  <strong>
   it will be too late for them to react
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  An ideal beginner deck for all players is a KaZoo lineup with Kazar. To assemble this combination, players will need the following cards: Ant-Man, Korg, Angela, Wolfsbane, Kazar, Squirrel Girl, Nightcrawler, Forge, Mister Sinister, Captain America, Blue Marvel, and Onslaught.

 <p>
  In this deck, the goal is to buff low-Cost, low-Power cards like Angela and Wolfsbane using cheap options such as Nightcrawler and Squirrel Girl.

 <p>
  A consistent deck for Series 1 cards is an Ongoing lineup utilizing Ant-Man and Namor’s abilities. To recreate this setup, players will need to team up the mentioned cards with Nightcrawler, Armor, Colossus, Iron Man, Spectrum, Lizard, Klaw, Mister Fantastic, The Punisher, and Captain America.

 <p>
  This is a buff-oriented deck relying on Klaw, Iron Man, Mister Fantastic, and The Punisher’s extra Power surge while protecting the board with Armor and Colossus. Also, Spectrum is specifically beneficial in this lineup, as she was buffed during the October OTA patch.

 <p>
  Since early decks must be easy to play, an On Reveal lineup with Elektra and Odin is a perfect starter. To reassemble this combination, players will need to utilize Nightcrawler, Rocket Racoon, Ironheart, Enchantress, Spider-Woman, Medusa, Mister Sinister, Wolfsbane, White Tiger, and Odin.

 <p>
  The last card, Odin, plays a significant role in this deck as he duplicates the On Reveal effect of all cards in his lane. Using this synergy, players can get two seven-Power Tigers, multiply Ironheart buffs, quadruple the effect of Iron Man, or destroy more enemy cards.

 <p>
  A reliable beginner move deck with Pool One cards is a Heimdall-Iron First lineup. Players can recreate this setup by teaming up the two movement heroes (Heimdall and Iron Fist) with Hawkeye, Chavez, Nightcrawler, Kraven, Forge, Bishop, Odin, Doctor Strange, Professor X, and Multiple Man.

 <p>
  The goal of this deck is to fool the enemy into focusing on the mid and right lanes, while the player will shift Power at the last minute to the left side of the board using Heimdall. If this strategy proves useless, they can drop Odin to trigger On Reveal effects on the board and hopefully buff the team with Multiple Man copies and Kraven and Bishop’s passive gains.

  Building a discard deck using only Series 1 cards is quite a challenge, but this
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  deck brings you close to a solid discard lineup. To replicate it, pair Apocalypse and Lady Sif with these cards: Blade, Yondu, Wolverine, Namor, Nova, Carnage, Armor, Sword Master, Rocket Raccoon, and Strong Guy.

 <p>
  As you can see, the lineup includes two cards from the destroy archetype (Carnage and Nova). These cards aren’t your main win conditions but provide utility. Use them to clear a lane, boost your side of the board, or throw off your opponent. They also serve as flex options, so if you have access to cards from higher pools, feel free to swap them in.

  When assembling a beginner's deck with early

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Go tall, not wide
   </strong>
   . Focus on winning only two locations. Some decks—like the Spectrum-Onslaught lineup—tend to dominate all three locations. While this strategy may prove worthy in some cases, it puts the player at the risk of losing two locations. If fans want to have a working beginner deck, go tall. Place the main powerhouses in only two promising lanes.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Exploit booster cards
   </strong>
   . Starter and Pool One cards are mostly boost-oriented options. Instead of aiming for complicated archetypes, put together a team of buff-oriented characters that can win the match regardless of other RNGs, such as location effects.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Avoid RNG-based Archetypes
   </strong>
   . Discard, control, and ramp are risky archetypes for beginner
   <em>
    Marvel Snap
   </em>
   fans. Instead of these synergies, utilize simpler strategies like destroy and move.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Experiment with the Deck Builder
   </strong>
   . Add core cards to the Deck Builder and let it complete the lineup. While the automatic deck filler is not guaranteed to produce reliable outcomes, it can give an idea of what cards go well with a player's favorite Series One characters.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Build around win conditions
   </strong>
   . Have one or two six-Cost powerhouses with significant end-game effects. Spectrum, Onslaught, Heimdall, and Destroyer are some examples. These cards surprise an opponent in the final round—minimizing the chances of retreats for them.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  If players want to get their hands on the Ranker's Shogun 'Brella then they must
  <strong>
   achieve at least 50 points during a Ranked Cup during the course of Chapter 6 Season 1
  </strong>
  . Points in Ranked Cups can be earned through survival time against other players in a Ranked Battle Royale match, and by eliminating other players. The better the performance, the more points players will cash in on when the match is over, but these must be done in Ranked Cups.

  There will be Battle Royale Ranked Cups that will run each weekend throughout the entire Season, and players can access Divisional Cups on Wednesdays and Thursdays. For those who want to go beyond just the default Bronze Rank, they can access the Bronze and Silver Ranked Cups, hosted by Epic Games for players to achieve Gold Rank, and go even further beyond.

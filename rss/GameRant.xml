  Hopefully,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  will rise to become one of the best BioWare games after its highly anticipated release almost a decade after the last entry to the franchise.
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  ’s marketing materials have had a somewhat mixed reception so far, with some fans criticizing the game’s art style and action-focused gameplay, while others are excited about the new companions and the long-awaited continuation of the story started in
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  .

  An almost overwhelming amount of information has been released regarding
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  in recent weeks, including a huge reveal of the upcoming project's Zombies mode that was shown to fans on August 8. Of course, a lot of information about the title also came out during its worldwide reveal following the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, although this largely focused on the characters and core mechanics of the game's campaign mode.

 <p>
  That said, there's still more to learn about the multiplayer experience of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , and it seems that this will finally happen during the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  NEXT presentation on August 28. Some very important elements of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's multiplayer have already been confirmed by Treyarch, however, such as the return of the franchise's iconic Theater Mode in the upcoming game. Long-time fans of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  will know just how exciting it is to see the return of Theater Mode, and if Treyarch implements it correctly, then
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  could have a sense of community involvement and competition that it most certainly needs.

  Theater Mode was first introduced to the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  franchise with 2010's
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  , allowing players to re-watch their most recent games from a range of angles and player perspectives. In a time before widespread console DVR capabilities, this allowed players to capture, save, and upload their most hilarious or impressive
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  moments, making Theater Mode a staple mechanic of the 2010 release.

 <p>
  Following the popularity of Theater Mode, the mechanic would go on to appear throughout the
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  franchise as well as the original
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3.
  </em>
  Treyarch recently confirmed that Theater Mode will also be present in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  when it launches on October 25. While instant clip-recording is now a staple of modern consoles and PC platforms to an extent, there is still a definite use for Theater Mode, with the ability to track things like cross-map throwing knives being just one of them.

 <p>
  The main potential utility of Theater Mode in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is the way it could create a sense of community in the game, with Theater Mode hopefully coming with a hub where players can upload and showcase their most attention-grabbing clips and screenshots. If this is implemented in the right way, then the most popular clips could rise to the forefront of the Theater Mode hub through a trending tab, allowing the
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  community to directly influence which clips are considered to be the best of the best.

  Theater Mode Could Become a Key Part of Black Ops 6's Content Cycle
 </h3>
 <p>
  Treyarch could then hold monthly or even weekly competitions that reward the most popular clips for that time period, perhaps giving the creators of these clips rewards in the way of unique cosmetics or
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  Points. If Treyarch makes these potential rewards attractive enough, then
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  could just be home to the most popular version of Theater Mode that the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  franchise has ever seen.

 <p>
  It is no secret that
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  's sense of community has waned in recent years thanks to things like the reduced necessity of game chat. Treyarch has been presented with a golden opportunity to really lean into a feature that has the game's playerbase as its lifeblood. By giving power to the players in creating clips and deciding which ones are the most impressive across both multiplayer and Zombies,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Theater Mode could see the franchise's community flourish in a way that has not been seen for some time.

  Warhorse Studios has given a big update on its upcoming
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  RPG, revealing its delayed release date, and letting fans know what to expect from the game at Gamescom next week.
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  was originally slated to come out sometime later this year as one of 2024's largest RPG releases, but its release date was recently leaked online, pointing toward a delay to next year.

 <p>
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  was Warhorse Studios' very first game, which released in 2018 to largely positive reception from RPG fans. The narrative-driven medieval RPG was praised for its commitment to historical accuracy, putting players in the Kingdom of Bohemia and featuring satisfying and grounded first-person melee combat.
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  looks to continue the story of the first game with a variety of gameplay improvements, new features, and more.

  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2

  has finally divulged its release date, though some fans may be disappointed. In a two-minute video posted to Twitter, Warhorse Studios announced that
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  has been delayed to 2025, and will be released on February 11, a few days off from the release anniversary of the first game. Warhorse also confirmed that it'll have a huge presence at this upcoming Gamescom, with a new

  Considering the heavy hitters that are set to release this Fall, like
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Metaphor: Re-Fantazio
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Greedfall 2
  </em>
  's early access, and others, moving such a big RPG like
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  out of the way to next year is surely a relief for RPG fans who will likely have their plates full this Fall season.
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's February 11 release date puts it just one week ahead of the release of Obsidian Entertainment's highly anticipated fantasy RPG
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  on February 18. It'll be interesting to see which title RPG fans gravitate towards. While both are first-person fantasy RPGs, they each offer different experiences, as
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  features heavy fantasy elements, while
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  is strictly medieval. In terms of direct competition,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's availability on Xbox Game Pass will free up many RPG fans to also purchase
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  seems to be mostly Hobbit-centric, there's still a possibility that it will feature cameos from other
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  races, such as Elves and Dwarves. There's also one entity from the saga
  <em>
  </em>
  that would be an awesome addition to the game: the mighty Ent.

  In
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
  </em>
  , Merry and Pippin get separated from the Fellowship and find themselves in the protection of Treebeard and the Ents, which are tree-like creatures. It's an interesting subplot that showcases wholesome conversations between the Hobbits and the Ents, which later leads to the tree creatures helping the Fellowship to attack and destroy the forces of Isengard.

  With
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  already simulating what life is like for a Hobbit, it would be interesting to see content inspired by memorable events in
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , such as interactions with the Ents. If
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  allowed players to interact with the Ents, it would mean opening up other regions of Middle-earth, so the Hobbit could venture out to Fangorn Forest and other areas where the Ents reside.

  It would be interesting to see if
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  will let players venture off to other regions in Middle-earth, especially the lesser-known ones. Hobbits are known to be friendly and adventurous, so this would be a great way to showcase these qualities. Plus, they could discover other quests and mini-games beyond Bywater and also meet and befriend interesting characters. Perhaps the Ents can task the Hobbits with helping take care of the forest and the creatures that live in them to maintain a sense of harmony. Even without a travel option, it's still possible for
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  to incorporate Ents through mini-games, conversations between Hobbits, and books that further expand the game's universe.

  Most cozy farming and life sims are limited to one location, as they follow the protagonists' flourishing life and the positive domino effect on the surrounding villagers. In
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  , it seems like the game might stick to exploring Bywater for farming materials, food, and cooking ingredients to improve the main Hobbit's living experience. However, there's a real opportunity for
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  to allow inter-region exploration to add more variety to crops, dishes, and more.

 <p>
  This is already a feature that games like
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  have adopted. It's been teased before that
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  will one day allow players to go island hopping, where they can encounter new people and items to bring home to their farm. The feature isn't out yet, but the closest that players have gotten is the ability to live and thrive in the Merfolk Kingdom, as they can unlock the ability to cultivate a farm and take care of sea creatures underwater, and players can carry the items to the surface as consumables and gifts.

  Middle-earth is a vast world with different kinds of people, making it possible to have more cozy games based on
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  . But
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  can get the ball rolling with regions like Fanghorn Forest to give players another perspective on Hobbit life and adventure.

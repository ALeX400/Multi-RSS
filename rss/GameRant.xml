  The Greater Jeweller's Orb can be used to add a fourth link to a skill gem in
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  . Players wanting to flesh out their endgame builds will want to prioritize obtaining this currency to socket additional support gems on their skills, which can be a huge upgrade in DPS and survivability.

  Unfortunately, the Greater Jeweller's Orb and Perfect Jeweller's Orb (5-link item) are exceedingly rare drops, even for players mapping in the endgame consistently. Luckily, there are ways to stack the odds in your favor. Here's how.

    Greater Jeweller's Orb
   </span>
  </span>
  <strong>
   is an extremely rare drop from random monsters in
   <em>
    Path of Exile 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , meaning it can technically drop from any monsters you kill, even in the campaign. However, the drop rate is so low that the only realistic way to reliably farm for this item is in the very late endgame in Tier 10+ maps.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Breaches are the absolute best way to farm for the Greater Jeweller's Orb
  </strong>
  (among other items) because of the sheer number of monsters you can kill in a very small window. Using a build with great wave-clear is not required for this strategy, but it does make it more efficient. Secondly, the rarity of the Waystones you are using matter a lot in determining the possible drops from a map. And finally, always make sure to use any
  <strong>
   Precursor Tablets
  </strong>
  you have on the nearby Towers in order to increase the drop rate and quantity of dropped items. Here's an overview of the best Greater Jeweller's Orb farming setup in
  <em>
   PoE 2

 <p>
  Local Knowledge is an early node you can path towards in the Atlas tree of
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  , which is often misunderstood. While it does not increase your drop rate directly,
  <strong>
   it shifts the weighting of drops so that you get more Socket Currency drops (+40%) if you're in a Grass biome
  </strong>
  .

  all count as Socket Currency, which makes it much more likely that you'll get one of these to drop if you have the Local Knowledge node activated in your Atlas tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a double-edged sword, however, because Local Knowledge also makes it so that Desert Biomes drop more Baryas and Ultimatums (not desirable if you've completed your Ascendancy) and Mountains Biomes drop more Gold (very bad). To ensure you do not inadvertently shoot yourself in the foot, make sure to respec out of Local Knowledge whenever you're doing a map that's not a Grass, Forest, or Swamp biome, or better yet, only spec into Local Knowledge when you know you're in a map ripe for the picking. Here are all the Grass biome maps where you can farm Greater Jeweller's Orbs:

 <p>
  The second way, and by far the more reliable one, is to
  <strong>
   directly trade for a Greater Jeweller's Orb on
   <em>
    Path of Exile 2's
   </em>
   trading website
  </strong>
  or in-game currency exchange. Using the currency exchange is better in the sense that there is no possibility of getting scammed, it's more convenient, and you get an accurate sense for what the item is actually worth. However, the trading website has the potential of being the cheaper option as players often have Greater Jeweller's Orbs listed for cheaper on there, though you may have to do some digging.
 </p>
 <p>
  To use the Currency Exchange,
  <strong>
   talk to Alva after reaching Act 3 Cruel
  </strong>
  and select the relevant options. In the
  <strong>
   'I Want'
  </strong>
  section, punch in Greater Jeweller's Orb, and in the
  <strong>
   'I Have'
  </strong>
  section, put in Exalted Orb/Divine Orb. This will automatically show you the current going rate for this transaction. Put in an order either for exactly the asking price or slightly higher than the market rate (if the price is in decimals) in order to get the item immediately. You can also go lower, but there won't be many takers.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan is planning to recreate the game's world within
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , and has already shared their rendition of the player's farm. The
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  reimagining is clever, and gives a hint as to what the game could look like if it had been developed with a different style.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  fans are a dedicated bunch, with many not only consistently playing the game after hundreds of hours, but also building charming tributes to the title. There are few sights more recognizable to players than the
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  farm, which is left to the player after their grandfather passes away. That farm, in its dilapidated state, is what this player has now shared.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reddit user FriendStatus4642 uploaded images of their design and is looking for input from the community as they work on creating the entirety of the game's map within
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . So far, their effort to recreate the farm is impressive. The player's farmhouse, mushroom cave, and even broken-down greenhouse are all present, but it's the little details that make this build stand out. FriendStatus4642 has included things one would expect to see around their home in
  <em>
   Stardew
  </em>
  , like the shipping bin, mailbox, and even the wooden planks that the farmer's pet bowl is placed on. In this instance, they've even included a cat sitting alongside its bowl, making it look like a morning in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  when one's pet is waiting for their water dish to be filled.

 <p>
  The majority of people responding to the post have been extremely positive, with many hoping that once the project is complete, FriendStatus4642 will share it so that they can experience
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  in the 3D blocky environment of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  for themselves. FriendStatus4642 commented, saying that after everything is done, they want to integrate an existing
  <em>
   Stardew Valley Minecraft
  </em>
  mod so that players can have as close to the full
  <em>
   Stardew
  </em>
  experience as possible while exploring the world.

  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  have been combined in the past by fans, and it doesn't come as much of a surprise. Part of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's appeal is the ability to build whatever a player wants, and while the gameplay of the two games differ, many
  <em>
   Stardew
  </em>
  fans are also
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players, and vice versa. Both games give the player a surprising amount of freedom. While
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  drops players into the world and lets them choose what to do, both games have enough appeal and are open-ended enough that many players have spent upwards of a thousand hours in the games. It will be interesting to see how FriendStatus4642's project progresses and further brings the two worlds together.

The event takes place on January 25 from 2 pm to 5 pm local time, and during this period Ralts will appear in the wild more often, with trainers having the chance of finding a shiny one.

  , with Feeling Pokemon appearing for the first time on Community Day in August 2019. This is yet another of the activities confirmed by the developers for January, which includes the return of Shadow Ho-Oh to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  on an upcoming Shadow Day. Players are also awaiting details of the Lunar New Year, a seasonal event that has been taking place since 2018.

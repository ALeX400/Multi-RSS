  An
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has discovered that healing shrimp in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC can give rewards such as cookbooks.
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  fans have been trying to figure out what to do with shrimp for a while now, and while many have tried a number of items to heal them, it is only possible to do it with a specific item.

  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has a plethora of secrets that urge players to think out of the box to uncover them. Despite the numerous hidden aspects that players have discovered over the years, FromSoftware recently revealed that
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  still has an undiscovered secret. With the release of the new
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC players are looking for more of these Easter eggs hidden by the developers, and it seems like a shrimp is hiding one.

  In a new tweet user EepyLee Prophet reveals an interesting discovery they made with respect to the shrimp in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC. Apparently, the shrimp in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC can be used to get items such as cookbooks. However, there is a specific way in which they need to be healed. While players have been trying an array of healing items to revive the shrimp, it is only possible with a specific item. Players need to use

   Warming Stone

  in
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  to heal the shrimp. Once they have healed them, they need to rest at a Site of Grace and then come back to get the items.

  In order to get Warming Stones, players can simply find them while exploring the Lands Between. One can find them on the way to Stormhill Castle or near the Castle Morne Rampart Site of Grace in the Weeping Peninsula. However, there is an easier way to get the item as it can also be crafted using

  . Considering these items respawn on resting, players should be able to farm a lot of these pretty quickly. Not to forget, Warming Stones are an extremely useful item that can heal allies and summons in

      <title>How to Change NAT Type on Xbox Consoles</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  NAT Type is like your Xbox’s doorway to connect to the internet to send or receive data. When this doorway is set to restrict, multiplayer games and online services might malfunction. This issue is known as a restricted or moderate NAT Type. (The ideal NAT Type is open as it does not interfere with multiplayer games’ connectivity methods.)

  You can check your NAT Type by going into the Network Settings on your Xbox. It’s shown under the network name and details. You can also activate the “Test NAT Type” option to allow your console to double-check this setting.

  The quickest way to change the NAT Type on Xbox is to set back IP, DNS, and Alternate Port Selection to automatic. If that doesn’t work, you can also toggle on QoS, DSCP, and WMM from the Advanced Settings in the Network Settings. It’s also worth clearing the console’s Alternate Mac Address and restarting it to open the NAT Type.

  Unplug both your Xbox and the internet router for a couple of minutes. This will help power cycle the console and router, fixing any minor issues with the NAT Type. It would also be a good idea to connect the console to the router via a cable rather than wireless.

      offers more of what made
      <em>
       Elden Ring
      </em>
      great, with new content and a large map to explore. The DLC introduces new bosses, some familiar fights, and others completely new. Here are some key takeaways about the bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree:
     </li>
     <li>
      Exploration is a major part of
      <em>
       Elden Ring,

      and

      Bosses are a central part of the Soulsborne games, and
      <em>
       Shadow of the Erdtree
      </em>
      introduces even more, testing players' abilities.

 <p>
  To no one's surprise,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  has taken the world by storm, offering more of what made
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  so great in the first place, while adding a ton of new content. Obviously, a major part of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is the exploration factor, and
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  continues it, with a large new map to explore and new enemies to battle.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is a Soulsborne game created by FromSoftware, bosses are a central part of the game, with many examples players can encounter.
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  introduces even more bosses; some are familiar fights, and others are completely new. As the
  <strong>
   Gravesite Plain
  </strong>
  is the first area players will explore, there are many bosses to battle in that area, most of which will test the players' preconception of how powerful they themselves are.

  Given Mohg has an influence on both Miquella's story and getting to the DLC, it would make sense for blood-aligned enemies to appear in the new area.
  <strong>
   Chief Bloodfiend
  </strong>
  is a boss in this new area, one that is a bit tanky, but still relatively simple.

 <p>
  He only executes a couple of attack patterns, and can cast blood incantations, not making for the most exciting of fights. Even then, the camera can be unreliable in this fight, not providing the best view of the boss, especially due to how tall he is. However, the Chief isn't the most difficult battle, so players shouldn't have as much trouble taking him out compared to the other bosses in the Gravesite Plain.

  is one such encounter, and is found in the Dragon's Pit. He has some basic attack patterns with his weapon, as well as an Ash of War that can deal heavy damage. Aside from that, he can also utilize Dragon Communion incantations such as Dragonmaw and Magma Breath. However, he doesn't have a crazy number of attacks, so his boss fight is quite simple.

  As is often the case with Tarnished enemies, they don't have much of an involved moveset. The
  <strong>
   Red Bear
  </strong>
  follows this logic, with some unique attacks, but ones that he will often repeat immediately after using them.

 <p>
  He can deal big damage, but given his use of a fist weapon, it is easy to evade his attacks. However, he does possess a new incantation, the Roar of Rugalea, which can deal more damage to players than his melee attacks, and given it is an AoE spell, dodging it can also be tricky.

 <p>
  Dragons have always been a major part of FromSoft's Soulsborne games, and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  was no different. Multiple dragon bosses were found throughout The Lands Between, some more important than others, and each relating to the various elemental damage types in the game.

 <p>
  Of these, there was never a dragon that utilized Ghostflame, but
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  fixes that. The
  <strong>
   Ghostflame Dragon
  </strong>
  is very similar to the regular dragon bosses found in the base game, with various physical and breath attacks, yet this time it uses ghostflame. There are some new unique attacks, such as when it breathes ghostflame into its own body for an AoE, but it is mostly the same as the dragons fought previously.

  Normally, FromSoft's larger bosses tend to be on the easier side, either because of their moveset or because they are a gimmick fight. The
  <strong>
   Furnace Golems
  </strong>
  are also a simple fight once their patterns are learned, with only a few attacks to their name.

 <p>
  They usually stomp the ground and cause fire to spread everywhere, with additional attacks involving their arms and fire projectiles. If caught in these attacks, they can cause massive damage to the player, but can also be easily avoided. The highlight of these fights is the spectacle; battling against a giant fire construct that explodes the surrounding area. It makes for great moments, even if the gameplay isn't too involved.

  Throughout the base game of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , the demi-humans weren't too big of a challenge, and were quite easy to defeat.
  <strong>
   Demi-Human Swordmaster Onze
  </strong>
  flips the narrative; this is a boss that is extremely fast and deadly.

 <p>
  Appearing as the boss for the Belurat Gaol, Onze uses a bunch of fast attacks that can easily defeat the player. Onze's basic attacks are already fast, but his Ash of War attacks are even deadlier, with moves that seem straight out of the Carian Combo Warriors mod. Onze even has a Vergil-like Judgment Cut, making for a boss that looks unassuming, but can be a challenge for some players.

  Aside from the first Furnace Golem, the
  <strong>
   Blackgaol Knight
  </strong>
  will most likely be the first boss players encounter in the DLC, and specifically, the first with a dedicated boss health bar. Despite his appearance as a tarnished enemy, the Blackgaol Knight can be a tough encounter, dealing massive damage that can catch players off guard.

  His attacks aren't too complex, consisting of basic slashes with his sword, but his Ash of War can kill anyone witnessing it for the first time, especially with the follow-up move he can do. The fight is simply challenging due to the damage he is able to dish out, combined with the player's ability to not deal as much damage as they would expect, given the DLC's new leveling system.

 <p>
  A large criticism of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  was the optional dungeon content scattered throughout The Lands Between. Many players felt that they were all extremely similar, with simple bosses and repetitive layouts.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Death Knight
  </strong>
  is a subversion of such criticisms, and is a challenging fight that gives players a reason to do the side dungeons. Despite the name, the Death Knight doesn't utilize deathblight, a relief to many. Instead, the Death Knight uses lightning abilities in addition to axe attacks. His deadliest attack is a grab, which can heal the Death Knight by a significant amount. However, the knight can be backstabbed, so the fight isn't too unfair.

  As the first major boss that players will most likely fight, the
  <strong>
   Divine Beast Dancing Lion
  </strong>
  sets the stage for the difficulty of the bosses in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . The boss is incredibly fast and agile, with numerous elemental and ranged attacks that make it a tough battle.

 <p>
  It can be frustrating given its less-than-stellar attack telegraphs, but the spectacle of the fight will blow players away. With incredible music and a fantastic boss design, players won't find any negatives on that front, even if they will have to learn the attack patterns more so than other major bosses.

  FromSoft are known for reusing past assets, especially in DLCs, and
  <strong>
   Rellana, Twin Moon Knight
  </strong>
  might be the biggest example of this. Her appearance obviously brings forth memories of Pontiff Sulyvah from
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  , but she also has elements of Malenia in her moveset.

 <p>
  Rellana is a fast boss. Like, crazy fast, with an insane number of combos that seem to never end. She also has a ranged attack, and a second phase that ups the difficulty even further. Yet, despite all of this, she is still an engaging fight, with players trading blows with her when they can, making for a difficult fight. She further demonstrates how challenging the DLC will be, with her defeat opening up the way to Scadu Altus, where more bosses await.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has spotted a Titan Guardian that looks like Optimus Prime from the
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  franchise. Throughout
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  ’s solar system, gamers can collect hundreds of pieces of armor, giving them a vast variety of options when it comes to customizing their characters.

 <p>
  The Final Shape expansion was released on June 4 and finally brought the Guardians face-to-face with The Witness, who had been teased throughout
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  ’s previous expansions. While many are getting to grips with the new weapons that were added with The Final Shape, one player has decided to lead the charge against The Witness with a character based on one of Hasbro’s most iconic heroes.

 <p>
  As spotted by redastray23643 on Reddit, one Guardian has used Optimus Prime as inspiration for their Titan build. The original poster came across the leader of the Autobots in the returning Cathedral of Scars Gambit map, and the character does bear a striking resemblance to Optimus thanks to a clever use of the in-game shaders and carefully selected armor pieces.

  Replies to the post have been largely positive, with most players impressed that someone has managed to create a character that looks like Optimus Prime. At the time of writing, fans in the r/DestinyFashion subreddit are trying to identify the equipment and shaders used for the build. One fan suggests that the colors are crucible glory for the head and chest, with another suggesting that most of the armament comes from the Festival of the Lost event held in 2022.

  Sadly for fans, there are no official plans to bring
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Destiny 2,
  </em>
  but it is not outside the realms of possibility. Bungie is no stranger to introducing popular franchises into the first-person MMO, most recently items from the world of
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  released into
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . The numerous items included an Eye Tyrant Beholder Ghost Shell, Bigby's Fist Finisher, and a Nat-20 Emote, which could be picked up from the in-game store.

 <p>
  Since the release of The Final Shape expansion, Bungie has seen an uptick in player numbers as gamers set out to take on The Witness. While some have felt that the Titan class could have been given more attention, both with the new Prismatic subclass and in general, Bungie has promised further balances to the Titan class will be made in a future update. While there is no current timescale on Titan changes, the speed at which Bungie has been updating
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  could suggest that an update will arrive sooner rather than later. In the meantime, players can keep making fashion statements like this Optimus Prime-themed Titan did.

	<strong>
	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is the new gacha game released by Kuro Games, the creators behind the successful
	<em>
	 Punishing: Gray Raven,
	</em>
	otherwise known as
	<em>
	 PGR
	</em>
	.
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	is an open-world game with a lot of fun characters (with more on the way) and a fascinating combat system that utilizes quick swaps between characters, dodging, and parrying.

	A new player can easily be overwhelmed, as there is so much to do from the get-go. Therefore, some help might be needed. There are several things a new player should prioritize in this game to help with their progression. These are not compulsory events, but rather areas beginners should focus on when exploring
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves.

	Its perfectly natural to boot up an open-world game and then take in all the beauty the in-game world has to offer. Unfortunately, it might not be the most efficient path forward, and could potentially lead the player to go around in circles.

	In
	<em>
	 Wuthering
	</em>
	<em>
	 Waves
	</em>
	, it is advisable for the player to tackle the main story quest first and progress the story as far as they can. With each step the player takes in the story, there are a lot of rewards that help with progression and early game content. The player can access the quest tab on the menu screen. Here, the main quest will always be the one on top, making it easy to figure out what to do next.

	Combat in
	<em>
	 Wuthering
	</em>
	<em>
	 Waves
	</em>
	is a lot of fun, and now there is an incentive to take on as many fights as possible. Defeated foes (non-humanoid ones) have a chance of dropping something called an Echo, which can be equipped and used in combat.

	The player will get Echoes of different rarities, ranging from Green (the lowest) to Gold (the highest). Each unique enemy defeated increases the player's Data Bank level. The higher the player takes their Data Bank level, the more likely they are to get rare Echo drops. So, the player is advised to kill everything in sight, even enemies that they have defeated before, as they too come in different rarities.

	There are a limited number of playable characters in
	<em>
	 Wuthering
	</em>
	<em>
	 Waves
	</em>
	at the moment, though more are sure to come as the game progresses. This means that players can easily find themselves with a decent number of fun characters to level up early on. However, it is advised that the player pick one major damage dealer who they will level.

 <p>
	In the early game, resources tend to be scarce. If a player spreads themselves too thin, they might find that their account is not as strong as it could be. Thankfully,
	<em>
	 Wuthering
	</em>
	<em>
	 Waves
	</em>
	gave a free five-star a few days after the gameâ€™s launch, and a guaranteed five-star after 80 pulls. This gives players a good idea of the character theyâ€™d like to focus on and set materials aside to level them up.

	For one, a lot of items and ores found in the overworld are useful for crafting items, including four-star weapons. Other items can be used for cooking, which has huge benefits. Both the crafting and cooking aspects of the game have proficiency levels, which offer rewards the higher the player goes.

	Gacha games are all about getting new, shiny characters building efficient teams to enjoy the game with. There's always a temptation to start pulling banners as soon as one starts playing, but it's advisable to take a beat before diving in headfirst. There are two types of currency for pulling characters, the Lustrous Tide and Radiant Tide. The former is for standard banner characters, while the latter is for featured characters. The weapons banner also has its own specialized currency. Just by playing the game in its infancy, players are likely to get as many as two five-star characters both of whom are on the standard banner.

	For this reason, it is advisable to save your Astrites, which are used to obtain green and gold, for a character the player actually wants. There are more fun characters on the way, possibly including Scar, who seems to be a fan favourite already. It's good to take time and enjoy the game, wait for announcements of future characters that might catch the eye, before committing to a character and pulling their banner.

 <p>
	A creative
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Pokemon
	 </strong>
	</em>
	fan has illustrated a pair of charming designs depicting human versions of Floette. This includes Floette's standard Red Flower form as well as its Eternal Flower form from
	<em>
	 Pokemon X and Y
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	Floette is a bit interesting in that the Pokemon has several standard forms, as well as one unobtainable form. Floette has forms based on the type of flower it's holding, giving it Red, Yellow, Orange, Blue, and White forms inherently, while the Eternal Flower form of Floette is unobtainable in the games and unique.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	fan and illustrator jimbojims0 shared their design of a pair of human forms for Floette. This type of fanart is also referred to as Gijinka, which jimbojims0 used in their description. Floette's Red Flower form has become a young girl with pigtails, with little green sprigs standing up on top of her head. She wears a green dress covered in flowers, and has leaf-like winged shoes that emulate the spade-shaped tail the Pokemon normally has.

 <p>
	The Eternal Flower human Floette has a similar design, but her color palette has shifted to dark blues, black, and red, with her flower also changing shape and color. Instead of the puffy sleeves the Red Flower Floette wears, this one wears lacy arm coverings and stockings and wears armor covering her arms and hands. The overall design looks a bit gothic, and is an interesting tribute to a rare Pokemon.

 <p>
	Although jimbojims0 says that this art is a work in progress, fans already seem to be enthusiastic about the designs. It's not jimbojims0's first attempt at Gijinka, as they note that they're an aspiring concept artist and have more art to share on their Instagram page. It would be interesting to see how the artist would portray the remaining forms of Floette, and what their final designs end up looking like.

	Floette and the Pokemon Series
 </h2>
 <p>
	While Pokemon trainers can find standard forms of Floette in nearly all the main series games that have launched since it joined the franchise, the Eternal Form is completely unique. This particular Pokemon starred in
	<em>
	 Pokemon X and Y
	</em>
	's story that's also become one of
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	's biggest memes. While standard Floette is interesting on its own for having several forms, adding further work to the player's quest to "Catch 'em all," Eternal Floette is one of the few instances of a Pokemon to be featured in a game that can't be added to the player's party in any shape or form.

 <p>
	It was early spring in 1994 when EA first introduced to the gaming world one of the most iconic racing franchises,
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Need for Speed
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. Today, the
	<em>
	 Need for Speed
	</em>
	franchise spans over twenty games and even one film adaptation that did moderately well at the box office. But, one core feature that keeps gamers returning to the franchise is the ability to fine-tune and customize their vehicle. And with every new
	<em>
	 NFS
	</em>
	game released, players have even more freedom in designing their favorite cars.

 <p>
	But,
	<em>
	 Need for Speed
	</em>
	<em>
	</em>
	has become
	<em>
	</em>
	more than a simple race game since the most recent games include Off-road, Drag, Drift, and even "Runner" (running away from the police) type races. Without any doubt, the most challenging races to complete are the off-road ones, especially in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Need for Speed: Payback
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. Over forty Off-road vehicles are available for players to use in
	<em>
	 NFS: Payback
	</em>
	, making it a lot more challenging to know which one is
	<strong>
	 best suited for off-road races
	</strong>
	.

	 <strong>
		Updated May 31, 2024 by Ritwik Mitra:
	 </strong>
	 Need for Speed: Payback may not be the best title in the series, but players still appreciated what this game tried to achieve. Featuring a high-stakes story mode and three protagonists who drove in cars that encompassed different styles of gameplay, Payback's insistence on coercing players to have six cars in their garage for each type of race could be slightly annoying to deal with.

 <p>
	However, this was a small price to pay for the title's tight and engaging gameplay. Players who want to become kings of off-road racing will be glad to know that there are several cars that players can use to make things easier for themselves.

	There are many derelict vehicles present in
	<em>
	 NFS: Payback
	</em>
	that are worth finding, with players having to use vague visual clues to find these parts in the game world. It gives players another excuse to rev their engines and explore the title's open landscape, with one of the derelict vehicles being a powerful 1965 Ford Mustang.

 <p>
	Hearing this car's engine purr after making an effort to find this vehicle's parts makes for a great time, and it's even more fitting that this vehicle is nigh-perfect for off-road racing. Zooming through the game's sandy and grassy tracks and leaving their opponents behind makes for a great time that players can't get enough of, and understandably so.

 <p>
	The BMW M3 Evolution II E30 made its debut in the
	<em>
	 Need for Speed
	</em>
	franchise in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed (2015)
	</em>
	and since then has appeared in two other NFS games (
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Payback
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Heat
	</em>
	). And while this BMW M3 was made for Drift races in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Heat
	</em>
	, it took a different role in
	<em>
	 NFS Payback
	</em>
	since it excelled in Runner, Drift, and Off-road races.

 <p>
	But, players will want to use the BMW M3 Evolution II E30 as an Off-road car since it has excellent Landing (4.4) and Airtime (3.8). On top of that, players unlock this vehicle early on in the game after completing the Same Crew, New Wheels mission in Chapter 1: "Ignition." Fans who want to make the most out of this Off-road speed demon will want to use the Americana Performance Cards.

	Players who want to unlock a reliable off-road vehicle as soon as possible will be glad to hear that the Ford Mustang Boss 302 can be obtained in the first chapter itself. This reduces a lot of the headaches most players would experience from trying to obtain this vehicle otherwise.

 <p>
	The engine purrs like a beast and the car feels smooth to drive. Of course, players will have to invest a lot in upgrades to stand a chance against racers in tougher courses, but this is a small price to pay for a car that can be obtained cheaply compared to some of the other vehicles in the game.

	This Muscle car fan favorite first made it into the NFS spotlight in a spin-off called
	<em>
	 Motor City Online
	</em>
	in 2001, which essentially was
	<em>
	 Need for Speed
	</em>
	but in an online setting. In
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Carbon
	</em>
	, the 1969 Dodge Charger took the role of a Police car wrecker due to its muscle car aspect, but in later games, it was more of a Drag-type car. Fortunately, the 1969 Dodge Charger in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Payback
	</em>
	is a decent Off-road car.

 <p>
	Its Top Speed is quite impressive for an Off-road car, reaching up to 143 without any Performance Cards. Because of that, this American muscle car can also participate in SpeedX races, but players should make sure they have the best Performance Cards (which function like Ultimate Parts from the
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Heat
	</em>
	) before attempting these races.

	It's funny how a luxury SUV that people can splurge on in real life to drive their family around can somehow be customized to the extent that it becomes one of the best off-road vehicles in the game. This is precisely what makes this car so magical to drive around in, with players loving the idea of using this vehicle to zoom past their opponents in competitive off-road races.

	It's unlocked in Chapter 4, with players purchasing this vehicle for a pretty penny that is made worthwhile with its performance. A few upgrades are all it takes for this vehicle to become one of the best cars players can use to obliterate their opponents in any off-road race.

	Long-time NFS fans will likely remember driving a Volkswagen Beetle in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed 2
	</em>
	after inputting the cheat code "bug" into the chat box. But, the Volkswagen Beetle would become a mainstay in the NFS series appearing in four other games, including
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Payback
	</em>
	. And while its initial stats may seem like nothing special, the fact that it's a Derelict makes it top-tier.

 <p>
	And that's because Derelicts can reach higher stats than regular cars, meaning players will be able to reach 399 with relative ease. However, obtaining Derelicts is no easy task and involves locating five Derelicts parts of the car the player wants. These parts are scattered around the map but can be located through various Clues.

	When people think of Off-road cars, they usually picture a Land Rover Defender 110 or a Ford F-150 Raptor, and while these Off-road cars may be decent, they're nothing compared to the Porsche 911 Carrera RSR 2.8 (which is also amazing in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Heat
	</em>
	<em>
	 )
	</em>
	. For starters, this speedster can reach the Top Speed of 174 while Off-road, which is already remarkable. On top of that, players can use the Outlaw Performance Cars to boost their Speed and Nitrous rating even further.

 <p>
	But, players will need to save up quite a bit for this Off-road monster since it costs $160,950 to purchase, aside from completing Chapter 4. So, the fastest way to earn cash fast in
	<em>
	 NFS Payback
	</em>
	is by completing SpeedX races, as they usually have short racetracks that can be finished in less than four minutes.

	Perhaps one of the few cars from the 1950s, the Chevrolet Bel Air makes its second appearance in the
	<em>
	 NFS
	</em>
	franchise (the first time was in
	<em>
	 Motor City)
	</em>
	as an Off-road powerhouse. This old-timey car has one of the highest Airtime (4.6) and Landing (4.5) stats in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Payback
	</em>
	, making it the top pick for players looking to tackle the end-game content. But, as with the Volkswagen Beetle, players must locate all five Derelict Parts if they want to ride this beauty.

	Undoubtedly, the best Off-road car to use in

	 Need for Speed: Payback
	</em>
	is the Porsche Panamera Turbo, even though it's far from being a proper "off-road" vehicle. Not only does the Porsche Panamera Turbo have one of the highest Top Speed in the game (190), but it also has 5.1 Airtime and 4.2 Landing, which is leagues ahead of other Off-road cars.

Players can obtain this car early in their playthrough after completing two questlines in Chapter 4: "Open Skies."

 <p>
	Respawn Entertainment has announced significant changes to the Ranked Rewards system in
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Apex Legends
	 </strong>
	</em>
	' Season 21.
	<em>
	 Apex Legends
	</em>
	, a leading title in the battle royale genre, has consistently evolved since its release in 2019. Developed by Respawn Entertainment, the game has gathered a dedicated player base with its fast-paced gameplay and unique character abilities. Over the years, the developers have made numerous adjustments to maintain balance and keep the game engaging for both casual and competitive players.

 <p>
	Electronic Arts (EA) recently disclosed that
	<em>
	 Apex Legends
	</em>
	has generated $3.4 billion in net bookings since its launch. This success is attributed to the gameâ€™s accessibility, tactical depth, and regular updates.
	<em>
	 Apex Legends
	</em>
	, now in its 21st season, continues to draw over 300,000 players daily, solidifying its position in the free-to-play gaming space. The gameâ€™s ability to evolve and introduce new features has kept its community engaged, despite facing challenges such as balancing gameplay and addressing player feedback on issues like cheating and rewards.

 <p>
	The latest change focuses on the Ranked mode, a crucial aspect of the game that determines players' standings based on their performance across seasons. Respawn Entertainment announced via Twitter that the Ranked Rewards system in
	<em>
	 Apex Legends
	</em>
	will revert to a previous model. In Season 21, players who achieve the same rank in both splits of the season will receive an animated badge, while those with differing ranks will receive a static badge based on their higher split rank. This change aims to make both splits equally valuable for players. The decision came after extensive community feedback, highlighting the need for more meaningful rewards and a fairer distribution system.

 <p>
	This is not the first time that the devs changed a feature based on player feedback. In a significant update during Season 19,
	<em>
	 Apex Legends
	</em>
	revised its Promotional Trials to make ranking up more achievable up to the Diamond rank. This change required players to secure fewer top 5 finishes, aiming to improve matchmaking by ensuring skill-appropriate advancement. Despite the adjustments, the community's response was mixed. Many players advocated for the removal of Promotional Trials entirely, which led to the feature getting removed from
	<em>
	 Apex
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	With consistent updates and new content, the gameplay dynamics are also evolving. The recent discovery of a powerful new tactic involving
	<em>
	 Apex Legends
	</em>
	' characters Alter and Crypto shows the dynamic nature of the gameplay. The innovative strategy, combining Cryptoâ€™s EMP with Alterâ€™s portal abilities, demonstrates how new characters can significantly impact the gameâ€™s meta. This evolution of tactics keeps the competitive scene fresh and forces players to continually adapt.

	The introduction of Alter also brings a deeper narrative connection to existing characters like Horizon in

	<strong>
	 Britain
	</strong>
	has been at the forefront of gaming since the industry's early days. While it may not produce games on the scale of Japan or the US, Britain's contribution is significant. Household names such as
	<strong>
	</strong>
	<em>
	 Grand Theft Auto
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Tomb Raider
	</em>
	began their legacies in the UK, cementing the country in video game history.

 <p>
	While Britain is certainly known for its long tradition of horror movies, dating back to the classic Hammer Horror days, it is not as well known for its
	<strong>
	 horror video games
	</strong>
	. However, these rare titles show the quality and ingenuity that British video game developers possess. Some of these games have pushed both the technology and the narrative form of video games, becoming genre classics. British developers have continually produced groundbreaking, engaging, and sometimes terrifying video games that millions enjoy worldwide, changing the gaming landscape in the process.

	is a survival horror game set in 1898 on the fictional island of Sker. The game follows Thomas Evans, who is invited to the island by his lover to help her uncover the strange secrets of her family. Welsh folklore was a primary inspiration for the story, which revolves around a secret cult known as The Quiet Ones.

	Like many classic survival horror games,
	<em>
	 Maid of Sker
	</em>
	uses the
	<em>
	 Resident Evil
	</em>
	typewriter-style of game saving. Players will need to search the hotel to find scattered gramophones to save the game. Stealth is a big part of the game as well. With no combat to be found, players need to sneak or distract enemies to progress, while uncovering secrets that reveal more of the family's dark history. The game received mixed reviews on release, but is a solid horror title that fans of the genre will enjoy.

	One of the most controversial games of the early 2000s,
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Manhunt
	 </em>
	</strong>
	was developed by Rockstar, the same team behind the
	<em>
	 Grand Theft Auto
	</em>
	series. The game follows a death row inmate who is forced to create a series of snuff films to earn his freedom. The game was notable for pushing gaming standards with its gritty, ultra-violent gameplay.
	<em>
	 Manhunt
	</em>
	incorporates several genres, including survival horror, stealth, and action into its mechanics.

 <p>
	Due to its extreme content, the game was banned in several countries. It was even implicated in a real-life murder, a case which was ultimately rejected by the authorities. While not a commercial success,
	<em>
	 Manhunt
	</em>
	gained a significant cult following worldwide and spawned a sequel in 2007.

	 <em>
		Monstrum
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is a challenging indie survival horror game that takes the genre to new immersive levels. Players are placed in procedurally-generated levels and hunted by different monsters. Each monster has unique behaviors that players will need to learn and overcome. In addition, death is permanent in
	<em>
	 Monstrum
	</em>
	, meaning players must start again with a new level and new monster type every time they die.

	an immersive and tense game that fans of survival horror will love.

	One of the leading developers of British horror games is Supermassive Games. Known for their interactive story-driven titles, they have created a unique style of gameplay that blends player choice and cinematic narrative.
	<strong>

	Highly influenced by teen slasher movies,
	<em>
	 The Quarry
	</em>
	tells an engaging story that uses common cinematic horror tropes to immerse players in a gruesome narrative. Player choice matters in the game, with each decision leading to a possible character death. No two playthroughs are the same, and multiple endings are possible.
	<em>
	 The Quarry
	</em>
	is a fun horror experience that can be played solo or with friends.

	While Supermassive Games is maybe most known for
	<strong>
	 <em>
		The Dark Pictures Anthology
	 </em>
	</strong>
	series, their breakout hit was
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Until Dawn
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. In this interactive horror game, players take control of a group of young adults who are hunted and killed throughout the night while staying in a remote cabin.

	<em>
	 Until Dawn
	</em>
	was the first major narrative-focused game that Supermassive released, and it set the standard for their subsequent titles. The game uses a butterfly effect system, where players' choices change the outcome of who lives and who dies. Hollywood actors, such as Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere, feature prominently in the game, heightening its cinematic feel. The game was a success on release and has now become a horror classic, with a full remake announced in early 2024.

	In
	<em>
	 Alien: Isolation
	</em>
	, the Xenomorph cannot be killed, and is actively hunting the player. Make too much noise, or stand in plain sight, and the Alien will come running. This simple mechanic creates constant tension within the game, forcing the player to use stealth and evasion tactics to survive. While the story is a little overlong, the game is a masterclass in horror. The developers of
	<em>
	 Alien: Isolation
	</em>
	faithfully recreated the design and sound of the classic 1979 movie. This gives the game a level of immediate familiarity for fans of the series.
	<em>
	 Alien: Isolation
	</em>
	is widely considered one of the best survival horror games on the market, and continues to be popular among its many fans.

 <p>
	This psychological action horror game puts players into a dark ancient history of gods and monsters, inspired by Norse and Celtic culture. Players control Senua, a Pict warrior on a mission to save her murdered loverâ€™s soul from hell. The game uses its narrative as a metaphor for the central characterâ€™s psychosis, as she faces off against monsters, the voices in her head (which she considers a curse), and an entity known as the Darkness.

 <p>
	The game was critically praised on release for its depiction of mental health. The developers worked closely with specialists, and those suffering from the condition, to accurately depict psychosis, and achieved some incredibly effective results. The game would go on to win several awards and spawn a sequel in 2024.

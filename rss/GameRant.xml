  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </strong>
  </em>
  player discovered an Easter egg within the game that gives a small throwback to Dumbledore in previous
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  games. With a wealth of previous
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  content that
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  has built itself on, there is no surprise that players are still finding callbacks to previous details from past games, books, and movies.

 <p>
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is filled with tons of tiny little details from the world of
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  . Since the developers behind the open-world RPG are huge
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  fans themselves, it is not surprising that players are continuing to find new Easter eggs in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  over a year after its release. With a ton of
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  content for it to call back to, Easter eggs within the game range from minute details in the books to fan-favorite movie scenes. It also appears that
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  contains throwbacks to previous
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  games, especially with the Easter egg this player found.

  Reddit user AdoraLovegood recently found a Dumbledore Easter egg in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  that calls back to previous
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  games. The player found that within the Hogwarts castle, a phoenix appears on the walls where Dumbledore's office used to be in older
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  games. The player shared a screenshot from
  <em>
   Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  an action-adventure game based on the film of the same name, next to a screenshot from
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  . These photos showed exactly where Dumbledore's office was in the previous game and where the phoenix is in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Many fans thought the Easter egg was a cool touch and commented on how many secrets are hidden within
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  . One player even mentioned how
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  draws a lot of inspiration from previous
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  games, as some of the player's movements, location design, and even sound effects remain incredibly similar to those from older titles. This trend of callbacks to earlier entries in the franchise seems to be continuing with the next generation of games, as
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  includes a PS1 Hagrid cosmetic in the game.

  The
  <strong>
   Steam Deck
  </strong>
  is a nifty device from Valve that allows players to game on the go. Though the machine is compact, it's quite powerful, and it has been able to handle many modern games. Gamers can check a game's playability by looking for the "Verified" seal of approval.

 <p>
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5

  is currently unsupported, and many players complain that it is troublesome on the Steam Deck. This is an unfortunate situation, as being able to play
  <em>
   GTA 5

  on a portable device could equal a stream of sales for Rockstar. If the studio wants to kill two birds with one stone, however, it should ensure this mistake isn't repeated with
  <em>
   GTA 6

  .

  The Deck is proof that dynamite comes in small packages. The tiny device has time and time again shown its ability to handle some demanding games, including those in the open-world genre.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is a great game to play on the device for players looking for some tough action, while
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  is a delight for fans of the zombie subgenre.

  When playing open-world games on the Deck, sometimes sacrifices have to be made. For example, the graphical settings may have to be turned down, or gamers may have to resort to playing at 30fps. However, in many cases, the sacrifice can be worth it, and most games manage to retain their beauty on the Deck's screen.

 <p>
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  has the potential to be a great Verified Steam Deck game, but Rockstar hasn't optimized the game enough for the handheld. One of the biggest problems complained about on ProtonDB is the fact that
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  is inaccessible on the Deck due to the anti-cheat software being used. With a little tweaking, this could be changed, and the game could finally earn the "Verified" status, something that has the potential to be a financial boon for Rockstar.

  If Rockstar wanted a Verified version of
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  on the Deck, it should have acted fast. Currently, fans are looking ahead and eagerly awaiting
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  . Consequently, gamers may not pay much attention if the 2013 game suddenly gets Verified. To avoid this problem,
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  should be Verified on day one.

  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is slated for a 2025 release date, though it's only been announced for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. This isn't too much of a surprise, as Rockstar has a habit of releasing games on consoles first before focusing on the PC ports. This was the case with
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  , and gamers waited roughly two years before the PC version was rolled out. This means that gamers probably won't be playing
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  on the Steam Deck when it initially launches, regardless of whether it's Verified or not.

 <p>
  Rockstar has always had high sales numbers to show, and the studio will most likely be looking to make another record-breaking game with
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  . Having the game Verified on the Steam Deck could help the game rack up sales, as the device has a large install base. The Steam Deck and
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  could be a match made in heaven if Rockstar goes through the trouble of optimizing the game for the device.

 <p>
  The Deck has been around for a few years, but it still manages to thrive in the modern gaming landscape. Having
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  Verified on the Deck would be proof that the handheld still has plenty of life left in it, and there's no need for a Steam Deck 2 just yet.

  The Know Your Enemy Challenge tasks players with defending China from Genghis Khan's Mongolia, and sees players take the role of Wu Zetian to work with Yongle and Qin Shi Huang to defend against Mongolia. The Know Your Enemy Challenge has a unique setup and play style that rewards a different kind of strategy than a typical game of
  <em>
   Civilization 6.

 <p>
  A great
  <strong>
   first choice of Governor is Magnus,
  </strong>
  who can allow the player to build Settlers without spending any Population in the city where he's stationed. This is a massive help during the Know Your Enemy challenge since there aren't that many turns and Population is a precious resource. He can also boost the Growth Rate of the city where he's stationed, so it's a great way to pump out Settlers and keep the population growing.

 <p>
  Another good choice is Victor, whose abilities are good bonuses to military and defense - one of his promotions can even prevent a city from being put into the Siege condition. Other Governors are more situational, but Magnus and Victor are great choices for this challenge.

  <strong>
   Expansion in
   <em>
    Civilization
   </em>
   games is always a must,
  </strong>
  but in this challenge particularly, it's more necessary than ever. The friendly AIs will expand, and quite quickly too. Because the friendly AIs start quite close to the player, their expansion can block off players who are slow to expand, directly impacting the player's ability to defend against Genghis Khan.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Wu Zetian's Leader Bonus is heavily targeted to espionage
  </strong>
  and effective use of spies, so it makes sense to use this bonus during the challenge. The player starts with a Spy who can be used to great effect, whether they choose to
  <strong>
   steal Gold, damage enemy cities' Production capabilities,
  </strong>
  or reduce Loyalty. Successful operations will grant powerful promotions to the Spy unit, which makes subsequent spy operations even more successful and safe to carry out.

 <p>
  Although the World Congress can be safely ignored a lot of the time in games of
  <em>
   Civilization 6,
  </em>
  in the Know Your Enemy challenge, it can be extremely useful. Because Genghis Khan is the sole aggressor, any opportunity to pass resolutions targeting his ability to trade, or to pass resolutions affecting his Grievance generation and so on, are really good ones to take.

 <p>
  It can also be very
  <strong>
   worth using the Special Resolutions
  </strong>
  that pop up, especially if Genghis manages to take an allied city. This can grant a powerful situation with bonuses for players attacking Genghis Khan, which can really speed up conquest.

  Polish developer 11 Bit Studios'
  <em>
   <strong>
    Frostpunk 2

  is so successful that it has already managed to recoup its production and marketing costs through sales alone.

  Powered by Unreal Engine 5,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  is the sequel to 11 Bit Studios' acclaimed city-building survival game from 2018. The new release improves upon many aspects of its predecessor, offering players an even more challenging and complex experience that still takes place in the middle of a global volcanic winter. Data provided by SteamDB shows that
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  has passed the original game's player stats, so it comes as no surprise that the title has also outperformed its predecessor in terms of sales.

  In another Twitter post, 11 Bit Studios acknowledged that
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  did not push boundaries, but the developer assured fans that it would continue to improve its latest survival experience through future patches. Hotfix 1.0.2, the most recent update for the game, went live on September 24 with various fixes and optimization improvements. One of the resolved issues caused buildings in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  that were from different district categories to appear in the wrong tab. The next patch for the game will address issues related to audio performance and the DirectX 12 API.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Tekken 8
   </em>
  </strong>
  confirmed that Heihachi Mishima, the iconic villain of the series, will be playable starting on October 1 for those who purchased the Player Character Year 1 Pass.
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  players looking to play as Heihachi separately from the character pass will have to wait until October 4 Eastern time to take up the mantle of the Mishima Clan patriarch.

 <p>
  During the Evo 2024 tournament in Las Vegas,
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  producer Katsuhiro Harada shocked the world by revealing that Heihachi Mishima survived a fateful encounter at the end of
  <em>
   Tekken 7
  </em>
  . The climactic battle between Heihachi and his son, Kazuya Mishima, resulted in the latter tossing his father into a pit of lava atop an active volcano. After the fight, Harada and other
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  fans claimed that the leader of the Mishima Clan was completely dead. However, Heihachi's time in the grave was short-lived, as he was confirmed to return in
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  as the Autumn 2024 fighter of the Playable Character Year 1 Pass.

 <p>
  Thankfully,
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  players will not have to wait too much longer to play as the series' beloved villain. Starting October 1,
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  Playable Character Year 1 Pass holders will have early access to Heihachi Mishima as a playable fighter following a content update.
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  players who did not purchase the character pass will only have to wait a few days to play as Heihachi, as his official release as a DLC fighter begins October 4. The arrival of Heihachi Mishima in
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  was revealed in a gameplay trailer that showed the fan-favorite nemesis in action against various
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  characters. Unsurprisingly, the banter between Heihachi and his son made light of their previous encounter, with Heihachi remarking that it would take more than a pool of lava to stop him.

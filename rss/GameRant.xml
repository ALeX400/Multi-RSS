   <em>
    Path of Exile
   </em>
  </strong>
  has just announced its upcoming Settlers of Kalguur expansion and its associated challenge league where players will be entrusted with developing the coastal city of Kingsmarch. Of course, Settlers of Kalguur is also introducing an absolutely massive number of balance changes, a comprehensive rework to melee combat, an overhaul of the Gladiator class, and the addition of a new Warden class.

  Ahead of its announcement, Game Rant was given an early look at
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  's Settlers of Kalguur expansion and spoke with game directors Mark Roberts and Jonathan Rogers about some of its key features. In particular, they weighed in on what their ultimate goals were regarding the city management system, and the challenges involved in making this unusual league mechanic feel right in a fast-paced game like
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Roberts noted that one of the top priorities when developing the city management system was ensuring that it wasn't an annoyance in the first place. After all, gamers have certainly lamented about similar mechanics in other games when they begin to feel more like a chore instead of a welcome change of pace. GGG's approach was to ensure that players could queue up many tasks at once when they visit Kingsmarch so that they aren't pressured to constantly return.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   One thing that's really important that we had to keep an eye out for is that people don't want to feel like it's too annoying, especially in PoE which is a game that is very fast-paced, and so it was ultra important to make sure that you can queue up a lot of stuff to happen without having to go back and manage it constantly. So during the league, you're not going to be going back every five minutes and having to do stuff. We're making sure that's not the case. I think that was probably the main thing for PoE that we had to make sure of: that it's not annoying, and you can queue a lot of work.

 <p>
  Additionally, managing Kingsmarch appears to be a fairly quick affair. Players might build farms, but they won't have to individually harvest every crop like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . Players will make a few decisions, queue up the tasks they want to accomplish, and return in a few hours when it's time to reap the rewards.

 <p>
  Another important consideration for the GGG team was that they didn't want managing Kingsmarch to be a full-blown idle game. This is the other end of the spectrum, where an entire system is built and then promptly ignored by players once they find a way to automate it. Roberts says it was a difficult balancing act to figure out how much player engagement should translate into Kingsmarch's productivity. One part of the solution was requiring gold for most of Kingsmarch's functions, and this finite resource comes from playing the game.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The other thing, of course, is we don't add parallel systems that bypass playing the game. Gold is a requirement for everything. It's not like you can just leave your town running forever and ever and ever. You have to play in order to keep it running. I'd say one of the hardest things to get feeling right is how much should you have to play for in order to get enough gold for the town to run for how much time. Working out those assumptions and getting that feeling right has been a real challenge. I think we've been in a pretty good spot with it of course, but I'd say it was probably one of the harder things given that we hadn't interacted with real time mechanics like that before.

  Yet, like all Battle Passes, the Cursed Sails Pass isn't set to stay in the sun for long, and just like the Captain of the Flying Dutchman, they must return to the ghostly seas. Yet, hopefully unlike the Captain of the Flying Dutchman, the pass and its cosmetics can be seen at least more than once every 10 years.

  This means that players have just under 18 days from the release of the pass (July 19) to unlock the 22 rewards from the Premium Pass, and claim Jack's Ship, the Black Pearl, as a Glider. The cosmetic rewards from the Cursed Sails Pass all involve a deep history of

  When the Cursed Sails Pass leaves
  <em>
   Fortnite

  , it's highly unlikely that it will ever return. However, the cosmetics from the event pass, and especially Jack Sparrow, might make their way back to the Item Shop one day, at a far more expensive price of V-Bucks than the 1,000 that is asked for. Whilst nothing is confirmed, there is hope for those who missed out on Jack Sparrow, as Darth Maul has returned to the Item Shop after the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  mini-event pass, to which he was the Premium Track reward.

  Its next content drop will arrive in the form of the Version 2.4 update,
  <em>
   Finest Duel Under the Pristine Blue
  </em>
  , which has just received a global release date, July 31. U.S. players will technically get to play it a bit earlier, starting at 11pm ET on July 30, due to time zone differences. One of the novelties arriving as part of the
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  2.4 update is a new map called the Shackling Prison. Its addition will expand on the lore of Hanya and Xueyi, not least because the facility itself is run by their organization, the Ten-Lords Commission, also known as the Long Life Supervisory Authority.

  HoYoverse has described the Shackling Prison as the facility housing the most dangerous criminals in the realm, as well as the place where Hanya and Xueyi perform their duties as the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission. The entrance to this new area will be found beneath the waters of
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's Scalegorge Waterscape. Exploring the prison floors below the map's dispatch hub will see players clash with the Borisin, a humanoid species with wolf-like features that can hyper-heal and wield a shapeshifting ability called Moon Rage.

  crossover with
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works

  , Type-Moon and Ufotable's hit anime fantasy series from 2014. While the collaboration will presumably bring some
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night
  </em>

   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an RPG in three acts, with lots of players staying for an extended time in Act 1 just for the fun of creating new characters, exploring a new area, and recruiting exciting and varied Companions. This is where most storylines begin and last throughout the whole game, and how these main and side quests are completed (or not completed) determines how the rest of the protagonist's story unfolds.

  The
  <strong>
   side quests in Act 1 of
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  do more than just set up future events that will unfold later in the game. They provide diverting action, entertaining exposition, and introduce players to the friends that can be made along the way. Some of them also award decent gear, even for this level, while others can give a character new and useful abilities.

   </strong>
   Many of the awards for BG3 that are now crammed in Larian Studio's closet are for writing, and the quests are a big part of those accolades. Although the studio won't provide DLC content or a sequel, regular updates and maintenance will continue, regarding small details like gear, weapons, and even new companions. Though there is a lot to do throughout all three Acts, the first Act does a great job of setting the tone, especially thanks to the many side quests it provides.

  It's hard to resist a quest that involves the dying words of a holy man, a puzzle made of stained-glass, and a magical weapon imbued with the power of a god.

   The Blood of Lathander

  has all of the above, and fighting through the Crèche means the party will walk out with a lot of nice gear and loot, including
  <em>

  's best mace.

 <p>
  There are several ways to start and finish this quest. Players might get into the Monastery via the top floor, in which case, they'll find the stained-glass window puzzle first. Should they visit the Githyanki first, they'll find the secret passage with the two statues. If it's the latter, and they decide to take the mace without the Dawnmaster's Crest, this will trigger a trap that destroys the whole Monastery.

 <p>
  Saving the Owlbear Cub is really more about surviving the encounter with the Owlbear's angry mother, and the good news is that one way to do this is to ignore her completely. The Goblins take care of her eventually if the protagonist doesn't, which results in the Owlbear taking the chicken's place in the Goblin's sordid party game.

 <p>
  The Owlbear has to survive long enough to either escape the Goblins or survive long enough for the "victory party" that happens after either leading Minthara to the Druid Grove or destroying the Goblin Camp and their three leaders. Should the Owlbear live through both, he'll show up at the camp a few nights later and one more time, which will see players having to pass a check for either Animal Handling or Medicine to convince him to stay.

  Players will first start coming across clues about the Adamantine Forge when they encounter a Beholder in the Underdark. The mage that summoned it is carrying a special crystal that gamers can loot from his body, and it has some information about this mysterious place. The mage near the Sussar Bark waypoint is also carrying a cryptic note that has a clue regarding how to destroy Grym, its fearsome guardian. There are a few more clues in various places in the Underdark, most of them in or near Grymforge.

  The Druid Grove is one of the first places players will visit in Act 1, but not every adventurer strolls down to the beach on the southeastern side to find the Harpies. It's an easy quest to miss, and it doesn't start until players walk down to the beach and see a wayward Tiefling child huddled by the water.

  His name is Mirkon, and if players save him from the Harpies, he'll give them the password to the thieves' hideout, also known as the Dragon's Lair. If players have also saved Arabella, Mol will be happy to see Tav and the party, and will offer to Trade. He'll also provide another tempting side quest: Steal the Sacred Idol.

  to ask the Strange Ox about its secret plans. Then, players have to pass a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check to coax him into revealing more, which he won't anyway. He'll mention that he's going to Baldur's Gate, which was already obvious, before telling Tav to move along.

  This seems like it goes nowhere, but this is no ordinary ox, and he can make an appearance at the Last Light Inn within Act 2, where players can further press him for information about his true identity. Whilst this is indeed a curious case, and some players might want to draw a blade and force this strange creature out of hiding, it's perhaps best to let the events unfold naturally, rather than brutally murdering a potential would-be ally.

  To obtain Sussur bark in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , one can visit the Underdark, a dangerous and expansive area that will have players battling all sorts of enemies that could spell their demise, especially so early in their journey. It's best to take this on later in Act One, even if players can get there fairly easily through a few different ways, like finding the Zhentarim hideout. These brave smugglers are wise enough to have an elevator that takes them fairly close to the Sussur Tree and other dangerous Underdark oddities. The Sussur Tree is located in the northwestern corner of the Underdark and has a Waypoint close by.

 <p>
  Walk along the branch to tear the bark from the main trunk, and now, players simply need to travel to the abandoned village's forge and fan the flame to craft a weapon of their choice, all with unique masterwork properties thanks to the Sussur Bark. It's a useful weapon to have in the early-game thanks to its Silence potential, and it's quite rare since players can craft but one.

  Halsin's choice for a replacement was a poor one, and if players finish the Investigate Kagha Quest, they'll discover that the Rite of Thorns wasn't half of her evil plan. Characters keen on Sleight of Hand and sneaking can break into her chest and read her diary, which indicates she has some connection to a local Shadow Druid enclave.

  More hard evidence can be found in the Sunlit March, or the Putrid Swamp, if players have seen through the Hag's incantation. One should be prepared to move through some difficult terrain in the form of mud and water, but if the party makes it to the southwestern corner of the map, they can find the evidence to expose Kagha as someone manipulated by Shadow Druids or someone willing to commit to evils unspeakable.

  There are a few ways to find the cave where a few desperate Zhentarim smugglers are making their last stand against some marauding gnolls. Whether or not players come through the booby traps or walk in the front door, if Rugan survives, he'll invite them to the nearby Zhentarim hideout.

 <p>
  What's great about this side-quest is the variations it can have depending on how players deal with Rugan. If Tav accepts his invitation and doesn't try to get the shipment, the quest leads them to the hideout but ends there. It's also possible to con Rugan out of the shipment, or kill him, and carry the mysterious and expensive prize, but there's a reason that the smugglers have been warned not to open it.

  If the player decides to follow Rugan to the hideout and become an ally and trading partner of the Zhentarim, they'll likely meet Oskar. A painter of some renown from Baldur's Gate, famous for his work as well as the related gossip. Oskar has a rich patron who can compensate the main character if they invest a few thousand gold in his freedom.

  Players can pass a Charisma or Intimidation roll to bargain the price down somewhat, but it's always going to be high. He even asks for some extra money to help him get home, which players have the option of refusing. This quest continues into Act 3 at the Jannath Estate when the story concludes with a long chapter that includes poltergeists, possession, undead minions, and a Mummy Lord living by the docks.

  There are all kinds of mysteries waiting to be discovered in and beneath the Blighted Village, and the Necromancy of Thay is one of them. It's behind several locked doors, traps, and a magic mirror, so unless player characters have decent Sleight of Hand and Deception, it might not be worth it.

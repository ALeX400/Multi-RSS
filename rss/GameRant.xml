  An
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  player recently found a way to defeat Rellana without ever entering her arena.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is known for its difficult fights, and this DLC boss is no exception. However, this player found a way to cheese the fight without ever having to actually face the boss.

 <p>
  Finding exploits within
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  isn't new to the game's community. Various
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  boss fights have several ways to be cheesed or made easier, many of which can happen by accident to players. This is even true for DLC bosses, including a simple exploit that makes Rellana, one of the harder bosses in the early part of the Shadow of Erdtree DLC, easier to defeat. The wide variety of exploits in the game like this keeps players in search of new ways to simplify boss fights.

 <p>
  This is exactly the case with Twitter user Ziostorm, who found a completely risk-free way of defeating Rellana, one of the harder bosses in the early parts of the Shadow of Erdtree DLC. Ziostorm discovered that by standing at the rear fog wall by Highroad Cross, players can fire long-range spells into Rellana's arena. The spells still manage to hit her, dealing damage that can be seen on her health bar. Eventually, her health bar will hit zero and the fog gates will dissipate, allowing players to travel forward. Alongside this, players still earn the usual rewards from the fight, despite never actually entering Rellana's arena.

  Elden Ring DLC Bosses Have a Variety of Exploits For Players to Defeat Them
 </h2>
 <p>
  This isn't the first time that players have found a way to make the Rellana boss fight easier or skip it in its entirety. As with any FromSoftware game, there are plenty of alternate paths for players to take in order to progress through the game. In the case of Rellana, a shortcut to Scadu Altus allows players to skip over the boss fight entirely by bypassing Castle Ensis. Although some players prefer to play the game as intended, the variety of bugs, exploits, and secrets can still be exciting for others.

  The discovery of yet another way to cheese an
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  boss fight adds to the ever-growing list of exploits and secrets within the game. Whether it was intended or not, players of the Shadow of Erdtree DLC have another way to defeat Rellana and possibly skip a pretty difficult fight. Players who still wish to face the boss as intended can find plenty of ways to simplify the battle, including ways to counter one of Rellana's deadliest attacks. Regardless of the path taken, players have a variety of options when it comes to playing through the

  <strong>
   <em>
    Visions of Mana
   </em>
  </strong>
  may not be as big of a title as, say,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 12
  </em>
  , but it's still a notable release for Square Enix since it's the first mainline installment in the
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  franchise since 2006's
  <em>
   Dawn of Mana
  </em>
  on the PS2. Even though this beloved JRPG series has received new entries as recently as 2022, it's largely been relegated to spin-offs, remasters, and remakes for nearly two decades. As such,
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  serves as a revival of sorts for the long-running franchise.

  Barring any delays,
  <em>
   Visions of Mana

  is currently slated for release later this month, on August 29. As exciting as it is that it's coming out so soon, this upcoming JRPG may be launching at an inopportune time because its release window is quite packed; so much so, in fact, that the game could end up being overshadowed by some of the bigger titles launching during the second half of the month. If this does indeed happen, then instead of being a triumphant return for the
  <em>
   Man
  </em>
  a series,
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  could end up falling flat on its face sales-wise, regardless of its critical acclaim or lack thereof.

 <h3 id="the-second-half-of-august-is-stacked-when-it-comes-to-game-releases">
  The Second Half of August is Stacked When It Comes to Game Releases
 </h3>
 <p>
  When it comes to game releases, the last two weeks of August are shaping up to be some of the biggest stretches of the year yet. Roughly 9 days before the launch of
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  , for instance, the highly-anticipated action RPG
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is set to come out on August 20 for PlayStation 5 and PC, with an Xbox Series X/S version arriving at a later date. Meanwhile, on August 22, 2024,
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  , the next big expansion for Blizzard's long-running MMORPG
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  , will come out two days after
  <em>
   Wukong
  </em>
  in early access, whereas its full release is on August 26. As if that wasn't enough, Sony Interactive Entertainment's
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  is coming out a day later, on August 23, for both PS5 and PC.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":966} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Perhaps the most noteworthy release in the second half of August, though, is
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  , the upcoming sci-fi action title by Ubisoft subsidiary Massive Entertainment. Billed as the first open-world
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  game, this highly awaited title is shaping up to be one of Ubisoft's biggest and potentially most successful launches of the year, despite the somewhat mixed reception it has received from fans so far.
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  comes out on August 30, only a day after the release of
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  .

  Visions of Mana Might Fail to Meet Square Enix's Expectations if It Gets Overshadowed
 </h3>
 <p>
  None of the games set to release in the latter half of August fall under the same genre as
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  , so they may not appeal to the same audiences. However, this upcoming JRPG could easily end up being overlooked due to the conversation being dominated by some of the other heavy-hitters in the month, like
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  . This resulting in Square Enix being disappointed in
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  's sales wouldn't be all that surprising. After all, the Japanese publisher has often complained about its games failing to meet sales expectations, like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  . Just recently, for example, the firm stated that some of its blockbuster releases, like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  , both fell below its initial projections.

 <h3 id="a-slight-delay-could-benefit-visions-of-mana">
  A Slight Delay Could Benefit Visions of Mana
 </h3>
 <p>
  In order to lower its chances of underperforming, perhaps a late September or December release might be better for
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  , as those two periods are less crowded, at least in terms of major AAA titles. In fact, the only major games launching in the second half of September include
  <em>
   Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Greedfall 2
  </em>
  (in early access), and
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , among a handful of others. December, on the other hand, is devoid of big releases entirely at the time of writing. With how vacant they are compared to August, these two release windows could give
  <strong>
   <em>
    Visions of Mana
   </em>
  </strong>
  a lot more breathing room than the game currently has. A delay may upset some fans, but it could be just what
  <strong>
  </strong>
  the title needs in order to reach its maximum sales potential.

  The

  <em>

  is a great game, it should come as no surprise that the community is constantly churning out mods.

  When
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  was released back in early 2023, many longtime
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  fans were disappointed that the action RPG didn't include a quidditch minigame of some sort. It turned out, though, that this omission wasn't made without reason, as Warner Brothers announced in April of that year that the fictional sport was getting its own standalone game in the form of a competitive multiplayer title dubbed
  <strong>
   <em>
    Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This upcoming game may not share the same art style as
  <em>
   Hogwarts
  </em>
  <em>
   Legacy
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is catching the attention of many fans nonetheless, since it's the first quidditch-focused game of its kind since 2003's
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup
  </em>
  , which was released over 20 years ago.

  Given how immensely popular the franchise is, it wouldn't be surprising if the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  name alone is enough to turn
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  into a breakout hit. However, licensed games aren't necessarily guaranteed successes, as recent titles like
  <em>
   Marvel's Avengers
  </em>
  underperformed commercially, despite being attached to popular IPs in pop culture. The barrier to entry to
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is somewhat lower for PlayStation owners, since it'll be a day-one addition to the PlayStation Plus monthly games catalog in September. Charging $30 for this title may be a risky move, but this tactic of launching the game into PS Plus can make it work, just like it did for
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  back in the day.

  Rocket League Started Off as a Buy-To-Play Game on PS Plus, Like Quidditch Champions

 <p>
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  might be free-to-play today, but when the game first came out in mid-2015, it was actually a paid title, just like
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  . Indeed, the now-multiplatform vehicular sports game initially launched on PlayStation 4 and Windows with a $20 price tag attached to it. Sales of the multiplayer title exceeded developer Psyonic's expectations on both platforms. Perhaps what was most impressive, though, was
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  's success on PlayStation, where the game ended up becoming the most downloaded PS4 title of 2016, despite the game being a year old at that point. Much of this popularity on PlayStation could be attributed to the fact that it was a day-one release on PlayStation Plus.

  Compared to what Microsoft does with Xbox Game Pass, Sony typically doesn't add many day-and-date releases to its flagship gaming subscription service. On the contrary, the publisher has openly criticized the idea on multiple occasions, citing it as something that would disrupt the company's virtuous cycle of AAA releases and deteriorate their quality. Even still, Sony has put a decent smattering of titles on PS Plus day-one throughout the years, including recent releases like
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Tchia
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Meet Your Maker
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  It's important to note, though, that the overwhelming majority of these titles are indie games; even
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  itself started off as an indie game before being bought up by Epic Games in 2019. This makes
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  's day-and-date PS Plus release more significant, as it's one of the first AAA titles to launch on to the service day one, third-party or otherwise.

  Launching Day-One on PS Plus Could Turn Quidditch Champions Into a Massive Hit
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  launching on PS Plus could be just the kind of push the game may need in order to propel it into mainstream hit territory. This upcoming sports title may face stiff competition from free-to-play multiplayer releases like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  , and even
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  , but its PS Plus launch will likely give the game far more exposure than it may otherwise get, especially if it lives up to expectations. Ultimately, though,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
   </em>
  </strong>
  ' success largely hinges on its quality; if the game isn't up to snuff, then it could fail to catch on despite its day-one PS Plus release, like
  <em>
   Foamstars
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Destruction All-Stars
  </em>
  before it.

  Fans are learning tons of new details about
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  with the most recently released trailer. Announced as the next entry in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  series during a Nintendo Direct in mid-June, the new game is a dream come true for fans eager to see Princess Zelda as the main character. In
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , Princess Zelda must discover why rifts have begun appearing across Hyrule and where they are taking the inhabitants of the Kingdom, including Link.

 <p>
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  will feature unique gameplay never seen before in a
  <em>

  game. To solve most puzzles, defeat enemies, and traverse across Hyrule, Zelda will use an ability to create Echoes, which are replicas of objects found in the game's environment. It was previously believed that Echoes would be the main mechanic in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , but according to a new trailer, that's not all.

  Beyond the ability to create Echoes, Zelda will also be able to use Bind and Reverse Bond in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  . Bind forces an object or enemy to follow Zelda's movements, making it possible to drop creatures off cliffs, dig up treasure, or remove items blocking a pathway. Reverse Bond works the other way around, making Zelda follow the object or enemy's movements instead, allowing her to potentially fly or move faster. The possibilities are endless, especially if players combine Echoes with these abilities.

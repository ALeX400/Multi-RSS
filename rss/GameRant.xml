      <title>One Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Crossover is a Controversy Waiting to Happen</title>

 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  game to be released under Activision-Blizzard's new owner, Microsoft Gaming, so naturally, there were a lot of eyes on it leading up to its launch
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
  After years of disappointing releases, like 2023's
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  and 2021's
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Vanguard
  </em>
  , many gamers were growing tired of the annual
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  cycle, with some arguing that the series was becoming increasingly half-baked with each installment.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , however, managed to dispel this notion by delivering a complete, well-rounded package at launch. Not only did the game's campaign receive glowing reviews from critics, but its multiplayer and Zombies modes also garnered similar acclaim.

  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  may be one of the highest-rated
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  games of the last 10 years, but it, of course, isn't perfect. The multiplayer maps in the game are hit-or-miss in terms of quality, the skill-based matchmaking is likely to frustrate many, and the always-online requirement for the singleplayer campaign may dissuade some gamers from playing it. One aspect of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  that may also be the subject of criticism isn't a gameplay feature, but rather a crossover.
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  games tend to collaborate with all kinds of pop culture franchises, but
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  is crossing over with the American pizza chain Little Caesars, which could be a controversy waiting to happen.

  Gamers Who Buy Food at Little Caesars Can Get In-Game Rewards for Black Ops 6
 </h3>
 <p>
  In mid-October, Little Caesars and Activision announced that they were going to host a promotional campaign together to commemorate the then-upcoming launch of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . From October 21 to November 10, anyone who spends a minimum of $3.00 USD on food or beverages at a participating Little Caesars location in the United States, Canada, or Mexico will obtain a code that will grant them Little Caesars-themed cosmetics to use in
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  . Participants will either receive a unique operator skin, a calling card, an emblem, a charm, or an hour of double XP. All of these prizes are distributed randomly, so there's no guarantee that players will get the cosmetics that they want.

  will get the chance to earn up to 21,000 Call of Duty Points if they win the sweepstakes. That's more than $200 of in-game currency, so the lucky few participants who do win this prize will certainly get their money's worth.

  Activision Has Collaborated With Little Caesars in the Past
 </h3>
 <p>
  This Little Caesars and
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  promotional event isn't anything new. For the last couple of years, the American pizza chain has partnered up with Activision to give in-game rewards to
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  players who purchase products at select Little Caesars restaurants. In 2023, for instance, the two companies added a Little Caesars operator skin and some other cosmetics to
  <em>
   CoD: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  . This year, however, they're taking this partnership a step further by outright putting a Little Caesars storefront inside an early level in
  <em>
   CoD: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's campaign.

  The Little Caesars Ad in Black Ops 6's Campaign May Be Immersion-Breaking for Some
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is a $70 title, and it's filled to the brim with microtransactions, so Activision inserting what is effectively a Little Caesars advertisement into the game's campaign is likely to receive pushback from some portions of the
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  community. Seeing players run around with Little Caesars skins in a multiplayer match is one thing, but encountering a large Little Caesars sign during a mission from a singleplayer, narrative-driven
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  campaign is another. Explicit brand placement can be immersion-breaking for some gamers, no matter how small. While it's unlikely that Activision will change its ways, it would be great if the company avoids repeating what it has done with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  and stops putting ads in
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  campaigns going forward.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Brotato
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a simple yet surprisingly in-depth roguelite inspired by the all-time classic,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Vampire Survivors
   </strong>
  </em>
  . The game is set inside a small arena where the goal of the player is to survive as long as possible, finishing a run by beating a boss on wave 20.

  With a ridiculously large roster of characters, weapons, and items to choose from in each run,
  <em>
   Brotato
  </em>
  has a lot of replayability. After the addition of a co-op mode, the game has become more fun than ever before.

  In total,
  <strong>
   four players can play the multiplayer mode
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Brotato
  </em>
  , though this comes with some caveats. The game doesn't offer a true multiplayer experience, only allowing local co-op on its own. However, this doesn't mean your friends can't play with you — it just means you'll need to use
  <strong>
   Steam Remote Play
  </strong>
  to make it happen.

  The good thing about this is that the friends in question don't need to own the game; they can hop right into your game session. They will need a controller, as there isn't support for changing the controls in

  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  is buffing several underpowered racial abilities in Patch 11.0.7, including those of the Draenei, Worgen, and over half of the Allied Races. These buffs target many skills and passives that have fallen behind compared to other
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  racials, and will be added to the game as a part of the next content update for
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Recently,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  gave players a first look at Patch 11.0.7, the second content update to be released after
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  . The patch brings fans to the Siren Isle, a former Kul Tiran Azerite mine that hides mystery and treasure – both of which allied Arathi, Earthen, and Goblins and hostile pirates, Naga, and Vrykul hope to uncover.

 <p>
  This content update will bring tons of other changes to the game as well, including buffs to several racial abilities. According to the
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  Patch 11.0.7 Public Test Realm patch notes, these updates target underperforming active and passive abilities across nine different races in the hope of making them more viable. Draenei, Worgen, and over half the Allied Races in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  received these buffs: Lightforged Draenei and Void Elves for the Alliance, and Highmountain Tauren, Mag’har Orcs, Nightborne, Vulpera, and Zandalari Trolls for the Horde.

 <p>
  Some of these buffs, such as those for the Highmountain Tauren and Mag’har Orcs, are raw increases to the numerical values of the abilities. Others, like the Draenei and Zandalari Trolls, had their cooldowns adjusted, with the former’s being reduced, and the latter's being increased to compensate for other buffs to the reworked Regeneratin’ ability. The Void Elf’s Spacial Rift and Lightforged Draenei’s Light’s Judgement abilities also receive updates to their visuals to go with these changes.

 <p>
  These buffs aren't the only things coming to races in this new patch. Humans and Kul Tirans are getting Arathi ear customizations in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  Patch 11.0.7. What’s more, because the non-wolven form for Worgen uses the same character creation options as their Human cousins, the resident Werewolves of
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  will be able to use these pointed ear options as well.

 <p>
  Patch 11.0.7 does not have a release date yet, but fans have found evidence it could arrive sooner than one might have thought. Description text used for the patch splash screen was discovered referencing Winter Veil coming to the game "soon," implying the new
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  patch could be released as early as December 10. Players will have to wait for an official confirmation to find out when the update, along with these racial ability buffs, will hit the live servers.

      <title>Honkai: Star Rail Shouldn't Keep One Element on the Back Burner for Long</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The current patch is less than halfway through and fans are already planning their pulls for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  Version 2.7’s Sunday and Fugue. Both supports can fit excellently in hypercarry/follow-up and break comps. While both are exciting releases, their Element Types are quite common already. Sunday shares Imaginary with nine other characters, while Fugue currently shares Fire with 10.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  could stand to make its overall roster more diverse, and it should start with an Element that seems to be on the back burner for almost a year now.

 <p>
  When a character’s type matches an enemy’s weakness in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , they deal toughness damage to that opponent. When the player depletes an enemy’s toughness gauge, they deal an instance of weakness break damage, and delay that enemy’s action for at least one turn. Ally units also deal slightly more damage to an enemy who is weakness-broken. Some Elements also have special effects, like damage over time and further action delays. Therefore, it’s in the player’s best interest to invest in units with varied Types.

  The current count for Ice characters in
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  is only eight, tied with Lightning and trailing only Wind’s seven units. The game already gave Wind and Lightning some love with Feixiao and Moze. As such, it’s high time to do the same for Ice. There are plenty of great reasons to give this cool Element some well-deserved attention.

 <h3 id="ice-rsquo-s-limited-dps-units-are-sparse">
  Ice’s Limited DPS Units are Sparse
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ice has a few useful 4-stars like Pela and Herta. However, it lacks some good 5 stars, with the latest limited release being Ruan Mei in Version 1.6 almost a year ago. A new limited unit is long overdue for this Element Type, preferably a DPS, as Ice’s premiere damage dealer Jingliu has fallen off the meta recently. Newer Destruction characters like Firefly and Yunli can consistently do better damage than her with fewer trade-offs.

 <p>
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  has yet to release a support unit that perfectly synergizes with Jingliu, like Sparkle for Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae and Jiaoqiu for Acheron. If it has no plans to do so soon, it should add a successor to Jingliu with a new Ice DPS. Since there are already Hunt and Destruction characters in this Type, it only makes sense for the new damage dealer to follow the Path of Erudition. A 5-star Herta would fit this category perfectly.

  Ice’s Weakness Break Mechanic is One of the Best in the Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  The best ways to gain an advantage in turn-based roleplaying games like
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  are to get one’s characters to act as much as possible, delay the enemy’s actions as much as possible, or both. Ice characters are experts in the second category.

     Ice units freeze enemies after breaking their weakness. While an opponent is frozen, they can’t take any action for the duration of that turn. Upon thawing on their next turn, they'll receive additional ice damage, and they still can't act. However, their next turn will be advanced by 50%.

  It would be interesting to see more modern characters utilize this weakness break effect. A new Ice DPS could deal massive damage or gain resources like extra Energy when hitting Frozen opponents. The ability to extend an enemy’s Frozen state or reduce their speed when they thaw, like Welt’s slow mechanic, would also be interesting to see. Ice could even venture into damage over time (DOT) territory by introducing a frostbite mechanic. The possibilities are plenty for this Element, and it deserves to be back in the limelight. Perhaps
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 3.0 could bless Ice with some great new characters.

  Picking a good team on
  <strong>
   <em>
    eFootball 2025
   </em>
  </strong>
  is vital when players want to be dominant in online games. Whether it be against random players or friends, gamers will want to have the biggest advantage possible.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   eFootball 2025
  </em>
  has only a select few teams with licensing, some teams that may not be the ones that instantly come to mind are the best, so making a good selection isn't as straightforward as one may think.

  When Ruben Amorim took charge at Sporting CP as head coach, the team was completely revitalized. The popular Portuguese club managed to win the league trophy two consecutive times before Amorim transferred to Manchester United. However, he left a number of great talents at the club before leaving.

  Viktor Gyökeres is currently the shining star at Sporting CP and the team's best goal scorer. The young Swedish striker works best with the other talents in offensive and midfield lines, including Trincao, Pedro Goncalves, Nuno Santos, and Morita.

  While Lazio isn't exactly stacked in quality, they have some good players who are effective in
  <em>
   eFootball 2025.
  </em>
  When scanning through the Lazio squad, it is quite clear that they have two main players who will be most effective; Ciro Immobile and Luis Alberto. Immobile, their captain, is a lethal striker who will get many goals for Lazio.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Luis Alberto is his partner in crime, delivering great passes for assists and some sensational dribbling skills. Aside from these two players, Lazio has defensive players such as the experienced Alessio Romagnoli, Mattias Vecino in central defensive midfield, and wingers such as Felipe Anderson and Gustav Isaksen, who are all relatively solid players in their own regard.

  The favorite Turkish side, Galatasaray, has spent significantly in the past years to acquire some of the famous players from the top European teams, who used to be superstars. Mauro Icardi is the biggest name in Galatasaray, and he is still a solid striker who can benefit from the slightest of mistakes made by opposite defenders.

 <p>
  Serge Aurier, Lucas Torreira, Derris Mertens, Hakim Ziyech, and Wilfred Zaha are some of the other familiar names that used to play in the top European leagues not long ago. Combining these players with local talents like Akturkoglu gives Gala a strong squad with good players in almost every position. However, they lack a reliable goalkeeper.

  The work that Gian Piero Gasperini has put into Atalanta in previous years has been invaluable. Since the old Italian manager took charge as the club's head coach, he introduced new talents to the football with every new season.

 <p>
  Atalanta currently has at least a few growing talents in every part of the pitch, though the team still lacks a strong finisher at the level of Harry Kane or Lewandowski. That being said, Ademola Lookman is currently the shining star at Atalanta, and he is doing more than expected!

  Atalanta comes with a multitude of magnificent players in the defensive line, as well as some masterminds in the midfield area to create back-to-back chances for De Ketelaere and Lookman.

 <p>
  A team that has become a hot spot for ex-premier league players, most notably Chelsea players, AC Milan is quite a good team to use in
  <em>
   eFootball 2024.
  </em>
  With Rafael Leao, Mike Maignan, and Theo Hernandez, AC Milan have star players that could likely get into most teams in Europe. When using AC Milan in
  <em>
   eFootball
  </em>
  , Leao is likely the go-to player that players will use, with his pace and dribbling being his standout abilities.

 <p>
  However, these stars are dragged back slightly by the relatively mediocre midfield and defense. Players like Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Pulisic are decent players, who are good enough to make AC Milan useable, but there are far better, more rounded teams that are much more effective in
  <em>
   eFootball 2025
  </em>
  .

  With star players such as Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Marcus Rashford, Manchester United is one of the two licensed Premier League teams in
  <em>
   eFootball 2025.
  </em>
  Man United has on paper a strong team that can work well in
  <em>
   eFootball 2025
  </em>
  games. New signing Andre Onana is a nice addition to their defensive unit, which is probably their weakest area on the pitch. Despite this, they do have fast defenders like Diogo Dalot, which come in handy when coming up against quick attackers.

  Rasmus Hojlund at striker isn't bad, with solid all-around stats for a striker that make him useful, although there are teams with better strikers available. Rashford counters this slight weakness though, with his rapid pace, solid finishing stats, and high dribbling stats. Mason Mount is a player who has solid passing and dribbling, although most players will opt for Bruno Fernandes at the 10 position, with Alejandro Garnacho or Antony on the right side, leaving Mount as a good option off the bench.

 <p>
  A team that is extremely well-balanced all across the pitch, Inter Milan is a solid choice for players in
  <em>
   eFootball 2025.
  </em>
  Inter has captain Lautaro Martinez up front alongside new additions Marcus Thuram, offering a very pacey strike force. Wingbacks consisting of Denzel Dumfries and Federico Dimarco have the pace to get up the pitch and support the front two, along with Hakan Calhanoglu providing the creativity in midfield.

 <p>
  Nicolo Barrela has endless stamina and good defensive stats to cover the back line and allow Calhanoglu to push up the pitch, making Inter Milan a good counterattacking team. The three center-backs of Benjamin Pavard, Francesco Acerbi, and Alessandro Bastoni give Inter Milan a solid defense in front of Yann Sommer, who is a top-quality goalkeeper.

  One of the world's most famous teams, Barcelona once again has a squad that seems overloaded with quality. Barça has an influx of young talents coming through, with Gavi, Pedri, and Alejandro Balde just to name a few. These technically gifted players combine well with the skills of Fermin Lopez and Frenkie De Jong, along with the ruthless finishing of Robert Lewandowski.

  In net, Barcelona has Mac-Andre ter Stegen, who is once again one of the highest-rated goalkeepers around. He has solid defenders in front of him, with players such as Joules Kounde, Ronald Araujo, and Pau Cubarsi, who all have good pace and technical stats, making them versatile defenders who can do more than just defend.

 <p>
  After their close title race for the Premier League in the 2022/23 season, Arsenal have seen their team become much more usable in video games, with many Arsenal players getting big upgrades. Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard are two players who are now much more effective in
  <em>
   eFootball
  </em>
  , with high pace, passing, and dribbling stats.

 <p>
  William Saliba and newly acquired Jurrien Timber having lots of pace is helpful when defending against the quicker strikers. Declan Rice is a force in midfield that makes Arsenal a more rounded squad to use in
  <em>
   eFootball 2025
  </em>
  , with less reliance on their creative stars like Saka, Odegaard, and even Gabriel Martinelli.

  Despite losing Kylian Mbappe, Paris Saint-Germain still has some great players on the offensive third that could be a real threat to any defensive line in
  <em>
   eFootball 2025
  </em>
  . Ousmane Dembele on the right wing, along with Barcola on the left, create two rapid wide pistons that can transition the ball from defense to attack in no time, thanks to their significant speed.

 <p>
  PSG added Milan Skriniar to their squad this season, along with Lucas Hernandez, Marquinhos, and Achraf Hakimi, creating a very strong defense and a world-class goalkeeper in Gianluigi Donnarumma. Their midfield is their main weak point, with Manuel Ugarte and Vitinha still being fresh talents. However, they are still solid enough to support Barcola and Dembele.

  With the signing of Harry Kane, Bayern Munich has become an even more attractive team to use in
  <em>
   eFootball 2025.
  </em>
  With pacey wingers such as Leroy Sané, Kingsley Coman, and Serge Gnabry, players get an abundance of speed along with ruthless finishing in the form of Harry Kane. Jamal Musiala provides extra creativity from midfield, which when combined with the strength and defensive stability of Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka creates a very well-rounded midfield trio.

 <p>
  Bayern also upgraded their defense over the summer transfer window, with Alphonso Davies and Dayot Upamencano being supported by Kim Min-Jae from Napoli and Noussair Mazraoui from Ajax. This makes up a rapid defense that will be able to deal with any fast attackers, but also the slower breed of striker, as each defender has great strength and defensive capabilities.

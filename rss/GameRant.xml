      In Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, players can choose to use the original 2006 control scheme or a modernized one.
     </li>
     <li>
      The updated controls allow players to aim while moving, which makes surviving in a mall filled with zombies much easier.
     </li>
     <li>
      The updated game will also include auto-save functionality and will bring back the original licensed soundtrack.

 <p>
  The upcoming
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
   </em>
  </strong>
  will allow nostalgic players to use the classic control scheme from the 2006 original in addition to a more refined, modern one. Capcom announced that it would release an updated version of the first
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  game earlier this year, with
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  set to appear on consoles on September 19. For the uninitiated,
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  tells the story of Frank West, an investigative journalist trapped in a shopping mall filled with zombies who must fight to uncover the mystery behind the undead outbreak using any objects he can find.

 <p>
  In addition to upgraded graphics,
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  features numerous changes to the 2006 classic, many of which are meant to give players a smoother experience as they brave the horrors of the Willamette Parkview Mall. This includes an altered control scheme that allows players to aim while moving, along with auto-save functionality, which is welcome news for those who struggled with the original
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  ’s controls and strict mission time limits. Of course, some fans prefer the old game’s controls, and
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  is making sure they enjoy Frank West’s latest shopping trip to the fullest.

 <p>
  As reported by IGN,
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  will include a special setting in the Options menu that will allow players to choose between the original 2006 control scheme and the remaster’s updated one. By selecting the “Classic” setting, gamers will play through
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  like the original, lacking the ability to aim while moving and unable to reconfigure any button inputs as the new “Standard” option allows.

  So far, previews for
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  have praised its new control scheme as an improvement over the original setup, but there are still plenty of gamers who would rather stick with the controls of the 2006 cult classic. Luckily for these fans,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster

  is giving gamers the freedom to choose the control layout that is most comfortable while attempting to survive in a mall filled with the undead.

  The Mines are a staple feature of any classic farm sim RPG and are typically brimming with slimes to battle and valuable resources to discover. The Mines are an explorable area in NPC Studio's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Field of Mistria
   </strong>
  </em>
  , but you won't be able to visit them straight away. It turns out the Mines were closed for safety reasons after the town earthquake, and NPC Errol needs a bit of persuading to re-open them, especially when he claims he can hear strange noises from within. As a result, you'll need to do a bit of groundwork to
  <strong>
   unlock the Mines
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  as an adventurer helping to restore the earthquake-shaken town in various ways.

  Once you re-open the Mines in Fields of Mistria, you won't need to travel too far to find them, as they are handily located nearby for plenty of underground exploration and adventure. There are several locations and characters to become familiar with in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  when first getting started, so it can take a bit of time to get your bearings and find the Mines' exact location.

  In
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  , you can find the Mines in
  <strong>
   The Narrows
  </strong>
  , to the left of the Museum, as pictured above. Head
  <strong>
   past the Museum
  </strong>
  and across the
  <strong>
   stone bridge
  </strong>
  until you see a
  <strong>
   circular archway
  </strong>
  blocked with wooden panels. However, once you unlock the Mines, the blocked doorway clears, and you can step inside its dark cave-like entrance. However, you need to do a fair bit of legwork to reach this stage.

 <p>
  To unlock the Mines in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  , you need to raise the Town Rank to
  <strong>
   Level 10
  </strong>
  , which is also classed as
  <strong>
   Stone Star Rank
  </strong>
  in the game's Town Rank levels. You can expect to do this around
  <strong>
   Spring Day 13
  </strong>
  in the game's seasonal calendar. On speaking to Errol when you first visit the Museum in the
  <strong>
   Reopening the Mines quest
  </strong>
  , he agrees to re-open the Mines if you can help the town reach this level.

  When you reach Town Rank Level 10, you'll get a letter from Errol called
  <strong>
   Mistria's Town Rank
  </strong>
  asking you to meet him and Eiland at the entrance to the Mines in the
  <strong>
   Unlocking the Mines
  </strong>
  quest. In the letter, he also gifts you a bar of Copper Ingot as a reward. Head to the Mines to trigger a cutscene of Errol unlocking the Mines, enabling you to venture inside and start exploring after reading an optional Mines tutorial. Once inside the Mines, you can find resources like Clay, Peat, and Sod, plus encounter various types of monsters and beyond.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set to reveal some new information to players, as the hero shooter will be featured August 20 at Gamescom. The live event featuring

  As Marvel Comics' answer to the hero shooter genre,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  pits some of the most notable characters from the various Marvel franchises against one another in a 6v6 arena. From Spider-Man to Doctor Strange, some of the most popular heroes are featured on
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' roster. However, there are also characters who are fun deep cuts. The addition of Jeff the Land Shark was a big hit with many of the game's recent closed beta participants, promising a fun blend of lesser-known characters and household names. Now that the closed beta is over,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has its sights set on next week's Gamescom in Cologne, Germany.

  On August 20,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals

   will be featured in a special live event to inaugurate the beginning of Gamescom
  </strong>
  . The livestream, titled Opening Night Live, teases the reveal of new updates and heroes that are set to be featured in

  . The official announcement came from both the

  As of now, there is no official word on what these teased surprises will be. The
  <em>

  </em>
  roster has been growing since the game's announcement, and there are a lot of potential heroes that have yet to make their way into the game that could possibly be revealed. A recently leaked promotional image showcasing a Captain America design made its rounds on the internet, exciting many who had been awaiting his arrival. Despite the game's diverse roster, there are still other Avengers members missing, in addition to Captain America. Black Widow and Hawkeye have yet to be seen, but the Opening Night Live stream will hopefully reveal some of these characters.

  Since the initial announcement of the game,
  <em>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been revealed, promising players a more expansive gameplay experience than that of its predecessor. Released in 2021, the original
  <em>
   Chernobylite
  </em>
  was a first-person survival horror game set in the ruins of Chernobyl. It took inspiration from other Chernobyl-based titles such as
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
  </em>
  for its enemies and environment.

 <p>
  Developed and published by The Farm 51,
  <em>
   Chernobylite
  </em>
  blended survival horror elements into an action RPG, letting players loose in a 3D-scanned wasteland of Chernobyl's exclusion zone. Players took the role of Igor, an ex-employee of the former power plant who had returned to investigate the disappearance of his fiancée after 30 years. When players weren't navigating the ruined land and fighting for survival, they were constructing a base of operations and managing both resources and other characters. There are various companions in
  <em>
   Chernobylite
  </em>
  , and this marriage of RPG and horror elements was a hit with many fans, earning the title praise from countless players.

 <p>
  As reported by IGN,
  <em>
   Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone
  </em>
  promises fans more of what they loved from the first game. Players return to Chernobyl to follow a brand-new story, wherein players can explore the nuclear-ridden land in an open-world experience. To make things more interesting, players take on the role of a planewalker who has traveled to Chernobyl from a parallel world. Little is known about what the story of
  <em>
   Chernobylite 2
  </em>
  will entail, but it has been reported that players in
  <em>
   Chernobylite 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  won't have to navigate the wasteland alone, as online co-op will be available to play through the campaign with a friend. Between a new open-world look around Chernobyl and a co-op mode, The Farm 51 is looking to offer an expanded experience for fans of
  <em>
   Chernobylite
  </em>
  with this long-awaited sequel.

   <strong>
    Starfield
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an epic space exploration game that has players interacting with various factions as they uncover the secrets of the strange artifacts being found around the Settled Systems. The universe presented is massive, featuring over a thousand planets and moons to discover. It’s worthwhile to explore these worlds, as there are valuable resources to find.

 <p>
  <em>
   Starfield

  has the potential to be the next flagship IP for Bethesda. However, to reach the heights of the studio’s other franchises, it would be necessary for there to be a multiplayer offering. This should be done sooner rather than later, and Bethesda should strike while the iron is still hot.

  Bethesda's game is user-friendly overall, but there is so much to learn and uncover that players have worked together to find out about all
  <em>

  's secrets. This has led to the creation of an active community around the game.

 <p>
  The

 <p>
  With such an active community already present, it’s the perfect time to introduce multiplayer elements. Instead of just talking about the game on online forums, players could explore the Settled Systems together. This would do wonders for the longevity of the franchise, and it would make space exploration less of a lonely experience.

  Space battles are fun, but they are not as epic as they could be. They usually feature only a few
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  spaceships with players working on their own to thwart the enemies they are attacked by. In a multiplayer game, players could form fleets and work together to take on foes in either PvE or PvP. This would make space combat more exciting, allowing for larger, more spectacular battles.

  Multiplayer elements would also benefit the combat on the ground. Players could tackle quests together, encouraging them to plan their load-outs to synergize. For example, some players could focus on carrying the big weapons, while other players could be healers, carrying med packs for injured players.

  Bethesda Should Release a Multiplayer Starfield Game While the Time is Right
 </h3>
 <p>
  Currently, all eyes are on
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  . The game received a massive update that added a host of new features, giving longtime players a good reason to return to the Settled Systems. The
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  update includes a survival mode as well as more performance and visual modes.

 <p>
  Interest in the game is also high due to the upcoming Shattered Space DLC that will focus on House Va’Ruun. Not much is known about the DLC, but the trailer suggests that it will be embracing horror elements, which is an exciting prospect. There is still a while to wait before the DLC is released, but it is worth it because House Va’Ruun is one of the more interesting factions in Starfield.

 <p>
  With so much attention on
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , it would be the perfect time to release a multiplayer game. It would ensure the franchise has the largest player base possible. With this said, Bethesda shouldn’t rush things too much, or this could lead to a subpar release full of bugs and other issues. The studio has already experienced a disastrous launch with
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , and it would be a pity if history repeated itself.

 <p>
  Overall, it seems like a no-brainer for Bethesda to release a multiplayer
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  title. The universe presented can be a lonely one, even when players are accompanied by NPC companions. Multiplayer elements could keep gameplay fresh, though Bethesda should release such a game sooner rather than later, or else the hype for the franchise may die down too much.

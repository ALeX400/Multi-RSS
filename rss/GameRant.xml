  After several years of waiting, Kinetic Games' paranormal horror game
  <strong>
   <em>
    Phasmophobia
   </em>
  </strong>
  is officially set to launch on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles on October 29 alongside its annual Halloween event. While
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  's port to consoles alone is noteworthy enough, however, this year's Halloween event stands out for several reasons.

 <p>
  <em>

  's 2024 Halloween Special event brings along with it a new weather system with permanent potential and a community-oriented goal with worthwhile rewards to earn.

  Phasmophobia's 2024 Halloween Event Will Feature a New Weather System
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the most prominent features coming to
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  with its 2024 Halloween Special event is a new Blood Moon weather system. If players look up into the sky during the Halloween Event, peering through the rain, they should notice the blood-red moon coating the world on the ground in a thick crimson. Essentially,
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  's Blood Moon system puts a deep red filter on just about everything in the game, but its weather has some impact on the gameplay as well.

 <p>
  As the blood rain falls during
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  's Halloween event, ghosts will be empowered and stronger than they have ever been, thereby requiring players to move through each location and solve the puzzles within them as quickly and efficiently as possible.
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  's new Halloween-themed Blood Moon weather will be featured in four different locations within the game: Point Hope, Edgefield, Willow, and Grafton Farmhouse.

  Phasmophobia's 2024 Halloween Event Includes a Community-Oriented Goal for Players to Complete
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another significant addition coming to
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  with its 2024 Halloween event is a set of community-oriented goals, which is a first for the game and any events it has had previously. For the most part, these goals involve simply playing the game as normal, but there will also be Blood Moon Totems added to the game that players can photograph for extra progress toward community goals. The objectives for
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  's community-driven Halloween event are as follows:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":472} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Identify ghosts correctly
  </li>
  <li>
   Complete optional objectives
  </li>
  <li>
   Photograph any Totems in the area
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  As players complete these goals, they will add progress to three individual stages of completion, each stage offering players a different reward for their efforts. When one of these stages achieves 100% completion, players will begin making progress toward the next stage. Once a stage is complete, players will need to interact with the Blood Altar in the Warehouse, and their reward for that stage will be presented to them. The following are the stages for
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  's community-driven Halloween event and each stage's reward:

 <p>
  To complement
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  's Halloween Special in 2024, a new Event Board will be added to the base game. This board will allow players to track the community's progress during the event and their progress toward various previously hidden challenges in the game.
  <em>
   Phasmophobia
  </em>
  challenges that can be tracked include things like playing certain maps a set number of times, correctly identifying ghosts, and Apocalypse Challenges that require players to complete some of the game's most difficult tasks.

  The armies of Hell and their presence throughout the many regions and activities in Sanctuary make creating the perfect build to counter them a top priority in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Gear-wise, while you can purchase some weapons at the different vendors throughout Sanctuary in the early game, you will inevitably rely on drop chances and RNG to get the best weapons and armor in the game — Unique items.

 <p>
  While recent seasons have made Unique items more accessible by making them drop at lower difficulties, farming is still a big part of crafting the perfect character build, regardless of your class. Among the many Uniques, the Ring of Starless Skies remains one of the most powerful, albeit rare, Unique items you can find in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  thanks to its damage boost.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Updated October 23, 2024 by Marc Santos:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   The Vessel of Hatred expansion and subsequent Season of Hatred Rising update for Diablo 4 made Mythic Uniques much easier to acquire, either by changing where they drop, making more activities drop them, or flat out boosting their drop rates. While the Ring of Starless Skies is still going to be pretty rare compared to everything else in the game, players should now have an easier time getting one. We've updated this guide to account for the changes brought by the expansion and seasonal update.

  The Ring of Starless Skies can be

  after reaching the reworked Torment difficulty levels, which you can do by completing a T20 Pit run. Once you reach Torment 1, you'll have a small chance of getting Ring of Starless Skies and other Mythics from Nightmare Dungeons, Helltide chests, and World Bosses, to name a few.

  <em>

  Season 2 introduced
  <strong>
   ladder bosses
  </strong>
  , with each having a selection of Unique items from their corresponding loot tables. In the case of the Ring of Starless Skies, however, you will have to
  <strong>
   face Duriel, King of Maggots, and the Echo of Andariel
  </strong>
  . Both of these bosses can only be summoned in
  <strong>
   Torment 1 and above
  </strong>
  , but to do so, you will have to face other bosses to collect Duriel and Andariel's summoning materials. Here's the information you will need to summon and face them both:

  Kurast Undercity
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Undercity of Kurast is a time-based dungeon introduced in
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  . Here, players can use the Tributes and Bargains system in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  to target farm items. If you happen to get a
  <strong>
   Tribute of Ascendance
  </strong>
  , you can use it on the pyre next to the Undercity entrance to
  <strong>
   guaranteee several Uniques
  </strong>
  at the end of your run, with an
  <strong>
   increased chance to get Mythic Uniques
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  This is arguably the best way to get Mythic Uniques outside of doing bosses. However, you need to get that Tribute of Ascendance if you want maximize that Mythic Item drop rate. Tributes drop randomly from most endgame activities (Helltides, Nightmare Dungeons, and even Kurast Undercity runs).

  Take part regularly in endgame activities in hopes of getting the Ring of Starless Skies. Getting it from Duriel and Andariel will bring forth more drop chances, but take into account that collecting their summoning materials will take a bit of time, since you need to face other bosses and, therefore, collect even more summoning materials in

  The skill inheritance system in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  allows players to create powerful combinations by transferring abilities from one archetype to another, offering greater flexibility and strategy in combat. This mechanic enables the adaptation of skills to create builds that maximize each character's potential. By merging support skills with offensive options, it's possible to enhance both the team's resilience and damage output.

 <p>
  Mastering the best skills to inherit in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is essential for overcoming the most challenging obstacles, ensuring an advantage in battles against stronger enemies. Players can transfer healing abilities to high-damage characters, creating an ideal balance. This allows each party member to contribute uniquely in strategic combats.

  Players focused on optimizing builds should always consider including a character with First Aid in the party, one of the best skills to inherit in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , as it recovers a reasonable amount of HP for a low cost. Even if the amount is small, the low cost significantly compensates.

 <p>
  For example, the Knight itself does not consume much MP compared to other classes, making it a lifesaver in various situations during the game's dungeons. Another archetype that can benefit from this ability is the Brawler, whose main skills consume HP instead of MP, allowing them to take advantage of this magic.

  While Medica may not be the most potent HP recovery skill in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , it certainly offers the best cost-benefit ratio, healing a moderate amount for all allies when cast. This makes it one of the best skills to inherit in the game.

 <p>
  Other options like Medicall, though more effective in healing allies, have a cost four times higher in MP, which can be a significant drawback for builds focused on casting spells. Between the two options, Medica stands out by offering greater benefits at a much lower cost.

 <p>
  Players who enjoy testing the game's odds will find Steal to be one of the best abilities in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  and will undoubtedly want to inherit it for a character during the game. It gives the character the possibility to attempt to steal items from enemies, many of whom possess interesting items.

 <p>
  Another factor that can completely change the dynamic of this ability is a function added by Atlus that allows restarting the combat at any time. It's possible to reset a battle until the character gains access to the desired item, making Steal an even more useful skill throughout various moments in the game.

 <p>
  While abilities usually cost HP or MP to use, the Tycoon, an archetype from the Merchant lineage, shows that things can be a bit different by requiring money from players. Despite seeming like an unfair trade, Gold Rush is a skill worth inheriting in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio

 <p>
  Even though it consumes an important resource, if the protagonist is equipped with Merchant or Tycoon, it's possible to recover that money easily with the hero passive. Additionally, Almighty damage has no weaknesses, and the high critical chance makes it an excellent option against all the bosses in the game.

 <p>
  Making enemy attacks focus on a single character, instead of allowing them to use abilities that target all allies, is a consistent strategy during combats in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . Therefore, Knight's Proclamation is an extremely useful skill to inherit in the game.

 <p>
  This skill is useful throughout the game, although it works better in battles that are not against bosses. However, if a companion has resistance to a type of enemy attack, it's possible to control the battlefield and turn icons incredibly, making a difficult combat much simpler.

 <p>
  Commander is an archetype in the game that's difficult to apply in different compositions due to its unique and less offensive nature, but many abilities can be used in other builds, such as Marakukaja, which is excellent for support. The main function of this skill is to buff the allies' defense.

 <p>
  It's also a relatively easy skill to unlock, requiring players only to have access to the Commander to obtain it, making it simple for another archetype to inherit it. Given the flow of battle, having allies with increased defense is of great importance, especially against bosses that tend to cause a lot of damage.

 <p>
  In some of the most challenging encounters in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , enemies can apply debuffs that significantly weaken the party, reducing attacks, defenses, and accuracy. These penalties make battles much more complicated, requiring careful preparation to overcome them.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Dekunda emerges as an extremely powerful ability to neutralize these negative effects. By removing all debuffs from all allies, Dekunda restores the group's balance, ensuring characters maintain their full potential during combats. Having a member equipped with this spell is essential for confidently facing the game's toughest challenges.

 <p>
  Having an ally hit by an Ailment skill is a delicate situation, as that character becomes less effective in various ways and may be targeted by opponents for a quick elimination. Therefore, inheriting the Patra skill in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is fundamental, especially in compositions without a Healer.

 <p>
  This ability cures any ailment affecting a party ally. Due to its generalist aspect, it can sometimes be more useful than recovery items specific to certain situations. Additionally, many bosses can affect characters in this way, increasing Patra's utility even more.

  Having sufficient MP is a constant concern for players of

  , as a tough combat can deplete this resource and leave the party unprepared for upcoming challenges. Therefore, every opportunity to increase this value should be considered.

  Magic Font is a perfect passive skill that fits practically all builds in the game because it grants a 15% total increase in a character's MP, allowing many abilities to be used. Players unsure about which skill to inherit in
  <em>

  should prioritize this one.

 <p>
  If players opt to test builds that don't use a class like Wizard in the composition, it's important for other characters to fill the gap left regarding elemental damage. Therefore, equipping different spells from the Mage lineage is important, making players consider only one skill to inherit in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  This line of abilities is not as weak as the initial versions and doesn't consume as much MP as the more advanced versions, allowing players more freedom to exploit enemies' weaknesses and gain more turn icons. Additionally, it requires more grinding to access them, as Wizard is an evolution of Mage and not a base archetype in the game.

  Out of the numerous threats that will stand in your way of becoming the king and saving the land in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the Humans are undoubtedly among the more terrifying foes to contend with both from a visual and a combat standpoint. They are as tough as they are horrible to look at.

 <p>
  It should come as no surprise that the party will have to defeat all sorts of Humans during the course of the story as well as in the side quests. As you progress further, you will soon need to
  <strong>
   obtain the sacred Drakadios Lance
  </strong>
  hidden within the Dragon Temple to make more progress with Louis, and that means you will need to take down another Human in the form of
  <strong>
   Homo Flaemo
  </strong>
  .

  Before you can actually defeat this Human in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , it is likely that you have been contending with many of its echoes throughout the dungeon. They can be avoided, but defeating them comes with good rewards, and it gives you an idea of what to expect against the real thing.

 <p>
  Once you have restored the power to the elevators in the depths of the dungeon, you will need to take the II elevator to reach where Homo Flaemo is hiding. However, it is not ready to fight and will instead try to run away from the party. The only way to force it into an encounter is to trap it, which requires you to close all the gates located on this floor. There are three switches that are indicated on the map, and you will need to hit all three before the boss is trapped. Following that, chase after Homo Flaemo and get ready to fight,

 <p>
  Similar to its echoes, Homo Flaemo hits hard with AoE attacks that target the entire party with physical damage, so it is always smart to have both a tank and a support Archetype in the party. This means having a Knight or Magic Knight for the fight, as well as a Healer or Cleric. On the offensive side, the enemy is weak to electric attacks, so having a Wizard that can cast Kande and Kandera will certainly come in handy, together with more powerful Synthesis attacks with a Brawler or Pugilist.

 <p>
  Prioritize keeping everyone alive as much as possible, and use the additional Turn Icons gained from exploiting its weakness to electric attacks to use for Synthesis skills. While the boss does not have complicated mechanics to deal with, its ability to damage the entire party with one move can be quite dangerous for those who are unprepared. Beat the boss, and you will receive the Filleting Katana weapon along with the other valuable rewards, along with an open path deeper into the Dragon Temple.

  <strong>
   <em>
    WoW SoD
   </em>
   Phase 4
  </strong>
  , Lord Kazzak was finally introduced as a World Boss players could take on with a full-size Raid group. Lord Kazzak was infamous in vanilla
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  for being kited to Stormwind and wreaking havoc on every low-level Alliance players in the most popular starting city.

 <p>
  To get to Lord Kazzak,
  <em>
   WoW SoD
  </em>
  players should head to the Blasted Lands, to the Tainted Scar in the southwest of the region. On the world map, the Lord Kazzak instance portal location can be found almost directly to the west of the Dark Portal, on the border between the grey and red rocks of the Blasted Lands zone.

 <ul>
  <li>
   To get here as an
   <strong>
    Alliance
   </strong>
   player, simply take a flight path to Nethergarde Keep and head southwest. If you don't have this Flight Point, go to Westfall, then travel through Deadwind Pass to reach the Swamp of Sorrows, then head south through the border to Blasted Lands.
  </li>
  <li>
   To get here as a
   <strong>
    Horde
   </strong>
   player, you must fly to Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows, then head south to reach the Blasted Lands and continue to travel south until you reach the Dark Portal, then head west.

 <p>
  You should see the entrance to the Tainted Scar instance towering over the demonic landscape as you approach. You do not need to complete a Lord Kazzak attunement to enter and fight this world boss, but it is recommended to have at least 20 to 40 players in your Raid Group.

  Once your Raid is formed, progress into the instance portal and explore the area until you find, and defeat, three of his Elite servants.
  <strong>
   Defeat the Doomguard, Dreadlord, and Felguard
  </strong>
  roaming the Tainted Scar, then proceed southeast to
  <strong>
   find Lord Kazzak himself

 <p>
  The boss is tough, and having more people in your group can make things much easier â€“ if everyone can follow mechanics, that is. That's because the most important mechanic in the Lord Kazzak fight is to not die. As simple as that might seem, every time a player dies, Lord Kazzak heals for an enormous 70,000 HP.
 </p>

 <p>
  Additionally,
  <strong>
   the fight cannot last more than three minutes in total
  </strong>
  . If your Raid group exceeds this timer, Lord Kazzak will begin to sling Shadow Bolt Volley with practically every attack, decimating the Raid group in moments. This is also why it's essential to keep everyone alive â€“ fewer players means less overall damage being done to the boss, and now he has 70,000 extra HP to make things take even longer.
 </p>

 <p>
  It is essential that you take your
  <strong>
   Greater Shadow Protection potion
  </strong>
  before the fight, and keep some high-level Healing Potions on hand to help Healers keep everyone alive. Once the Raid gets to Lord Kazzak,
  <em>
   WoW SoD
  </em>
  players should
  <strong>
   let Tanks take aggro, then quickly get behind the boss
  </strong>
  to avoid being hit by his large-range Cleave or Shadow Bolt Volley attacks.

     <strong>
      Healers

     should also keep an eye out for players affected by the Mark of Kazzak debuff, and Dispel it as fast as possible. This saps Mana, and if the affected player reaches 0 Mana, they will explode and instantly kill any player around them without more than 6,000 HP.

 <p>
  If your group can keep the damage up, avoid being hit by Lord Kazzak's AoE attacks, and prevent any single Raid member from dying, Lord Kazzak becomes nothing more than a Tank-n-Spank. But if you fail these mechanics, it's game over, and you'll have to try again (and likely lose your World Buffs in the process).

  Depending on how many people are in your group, your chances to actually win any of these pieces of gear in your Raid change. If you take on Kazzak with just 20 players, you'll have way less competition when it comes to Lord Kazzak loot, but the fight will be much more difficult. With two weekly resets for all World Bosses, it's not too much of a hassle to go again if you don't get gear you want in a full 40-man group.

      <title>Why a Red Dead Revolver Sequel Could Benefit Rockstar More Than RDR3</title>

 <p>
  In the wake of the massively successful
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , gaming audiences are on the edge of their seats for information about another entry in the franchise. There's no shortage of fun ideas regarding what
  <em>
   RDR3
  </em>
  could look like, but Rockstar itself has been notably tight-lipped about the matter. The developer may discuss
  <em>
   RDR3
  </em>
  sometime after
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  launches, but for now, fans are in the dark.

 <p>
  One of the biggest challenges facing Rockstar when it comes to
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  is its narrative premise. Again, fans have speculated at length about what character could helm the next game, with Charles Smith and Sadie Adler being among audiences' favorites for the role. If these characters, or someone like Hosea if
  <em>
   RDR3
  </em>
  is another prequel, took over as protagonist, it would come with some notable pros and cons. Of course, the pros are that they are beloved and well-written characters with interesting stories to tell, but a game with one of them in the leading spot could stray too far from what
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  is about.

  The Problems With a Direct Sequel to Red Dead Redemption 2
 </h3>
 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  were to be another prequel, as some have suggested, then it runs the risk of retreading old ground and lessening the impact of both its story and the story of
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  . This is because players already know what is going to happen and to some extent know what has happened already, as much of
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  focuses on the Van der Linde Gang reflecting on their shared past. Sure, it would be nice to see familiar faces like Arthur or see how John and Abigail first fell in love, but this would be fan service more than strong, self-contained storytelling, and not a route Rockstar is likely to take.

 <p>
  Alternatively,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  could take place after the first game, and either follow Jack Marston or a member of
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  's supporting cast, like Sadie or Charles. However, this poses some issues as well since it would be set in the mid-1910s at the earliestâ€”a time period that is at odds with the Wild West culture. If the sequel followed Sadie or Charles after the events of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , then the series could start to feel like an anthology, losing the sense of cohesion that
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  have.

  The Benefits of Going Back to Red Dead Revolver
 </h3>
 <p>
  For the longest time,
  <em>
   Red Dead Revolver
  </em>
  has felt like an awkward precursor to the more mainstream and critically acclaimed
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  games. It's not exactly clear where the game falls in the
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  timeline, or if it's even canon; many fans have speculated that
  <em>
   Revolver
  </em>
  is meant to be a legend within the
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  universe, rather than an actual series of events. Leaning into this interpretation could yield great results for Rockstar.

 <p>
  With the
  <em>
   Red Dead
  </em>
  series in a bit of a bind with regard to its setting, maybe some spin-off title set in the '
  <em>
   Red Dead Revolver
  </em>
  universe' would make the most sense. Rockstar could essentially do the inverse of what it did with
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  : make a new
  <em>
   Red Dead Revolver
  </em>
  title a spiritual successor to the
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  games.

 <p>
  Leveraging the notion of
  <em>
   Revolver
  </em>
  existing in its own canon, Rockstar could make a completely unique and separate story that isn't tied to the events of the previous two games.
  <em>
   Red Dead Revolver 2
  </em>
  could build upon the narrative and gameplay foundations of the first
  <em>
   Red Dead Revolver
  </em>
  , free to experiment with different characters, plots, and mechanics, as it would only be tangentially connected to
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  .

  The world is once again at the mercy of alien invaders in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Earth Defense Force 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and it is up to players to save what little remains of humanity. Using a host of weapons across multiple character classes, you'll need to use your arsenal to dispatch a range of extraterrestrial creatures, including giant frogs, androids, and oversize ants.

  A big part of your success in cleansing the world of invaders is staying alive, which means players will need to maintain their health. One part of the game, however, that would seemingly contribute to this doesn't operate like other third-person shooters do. With that in mind, here is
  <strong>
   what you need to know about armor in
   <em>
    Earth Defense Force 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  and what it does.

 <p>
  Despite what the name suggests, armor does not actually protect players from incoming attacks from enemies. In most games of this genre, armor works as an initial protective barrier, which prevents any loss of health while it is active, but that's not the case in
  <em>
   Earth Defense Force 6
  </em>
  . Instead, a player's
  <strong>
   armor rating indicates the maximum amount of HP their character can have
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  This may confuse players who are new to
  <em>
   Earth Defense Force
  </em>
  , as this is not a common way that armor is utilized in a game of this nature. It is good to bear this in mind, as it essentially means you have half the amount of hit points that you might have expected to. If you are downed in a single-player mission, you'll lose the mission and some of the items you have collected along the way.

  While armor won't protect you from incoming projectiles, it can be improved to increase your overall HP on your next run. To increase your armor rating, you will need to
  <strong>
   collect red crates marked "ARMOR"
  </strong>
  while on your missions. These will be dropped by enemies after you have killed them, and are marked by green dots on the mini-map (along with health and weapons crates). Essentially, the key to getting better armor is to kill as many of these absolutely enormous enemies as you can.

 <p>
  It is worth noting, however, that
  <strong>
   the amount of armor you collect won't be added to your total until the next mission
  </strong>
  , so it is important to get as many crates as possible and successfully complete the mission. If you are downed and fail to complete it, then you will still receive some of your armor pick-ups, but there will be a penalty for losing.

  Among the many things that video games and movies have in common is that genres tend to boom and bust over time. Just as the Western dominated the 50s before dying off in the late 60s, some video game genres have come and gone, seeing their popularity fluctuate over the years. Sometimes it's due to changing market conditions, and other times it's due to overexposure.

 <p>
  Whatever the case may be, it's time for some of these genres to shine again. Whether it's the beautiful animation of cinematic platformers that games like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Another World
   </strong>
  </em>
  perfected or the silly brilliance of FMV games like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Phantasmagoria
   </em>
  </strong>
  , these genres have been quiet for too long and need a resurrection of sorts.

  Full-motion video games dominated the 1990s, thanks in large part to titles like
  <em>
   Phantasmagoria
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    The 7th Guest
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but issues with the price of technology and hardware limitations caused them to dwindle in popularity. While games like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Harvester
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a sinister exploration of the dark side of humanity, and the absurd
  <strong>
   <em>
    MTV's Club Dead
   </em>
  </strong>
  showcased the sillier side of this outrageous genre.

 <p>
  These days, true-to-form FMV games of the era are a rarity. It's a style of game that would do well today, as the underpowered hardware of the 90s doesn't factor in and the types of stories this unique genre could explore today would be outstanding to see. The mix of live actors and interactive gameplay is a compelling mash-up, and it could be a blast seeing some of the industry's most charismatic stars in a surge of FMV games.

  While 2D platformers in the style of
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  are alive and well, the puzzle platformer hasn't been so lucky. It's a shame, as older titles like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Lode Runner
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Lost Vikings
   </em>
  </strong>
  proved just how innovative this unique mix of puzzles and platforming can be. It's a genre that uses succinct game mechanics that influence movement and player progression, as evidenced by games like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Popeye
   </strong>
  </em>
  from 1982 and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Burger Time
   </strong>
  </em>
  the same year.

  It had a brief moment in the sun after the success of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fez
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Braid
   </strong>
  </em>
  in the 2010s, but games in this style haven't been heard from in a long time. The prospect of placing a player in a 2D environment, then tasking them with solving puzzles, and giving them unique traversal mechanics to do so is fascinating, as it all tends to be isolated to a single screen instead of a scrolling level. Recently, games like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker
   </strong>
  </em>
  have brought elements of the puzzle platformer into the modern era, but it's well past time for a more triumphant return.

  The six degrees of freedom shooter, colloquially known as 6DOF, saw some landmark releases in the form of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Descent
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Forsaken
   </em>
  </strong>
  in the late 1990s. While most games of the era limited control to three degrees, the ability to move forward, backward, up, and down, 6DOF games are arguably more immersive. It's a spectacular control scheme for a game, as granting access to the entirety of movement within any 3D environment is a blast to experience.

  These days, 6DOF shooters are a rarity, save for a remaster of
  <em>
   Forsaken
  </em>
  and an original title called
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overload
   </strong>
  </em>
  in 2018, while games like 2019's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Outer Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  incorporate the control scheme into its design. It's a perfect fit for contemporary times, as its potential for VR headsets feels unmatched. This free-flowing style of ship combat is deeply missed today, as it would be a perfect fit for not only original IPs but a
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Star Trek
  </em>
  game as well.

  Beginning in earnest in the 1960s and 70s, with one of the earliest examples being
  <strong>
   <em>
    Colossal Cave Adventure
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the text-based game truly started to find its voice with titles like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zork
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starcross
   </em>
  </strong>
  from developers Infocom. Later titles, like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Spider and Web
   </strong>
  </em>
  , as well as
  <em>
   <strong>
    Photopia
   </strong>
  </em>
  , solidified the genre even further, but it was unable to challenge the advent of visuals and was a difficult style of game to market to mass audiences.

 <p>
  It has seen some honest attempts at a revival recently, with standout titles like
  <strong>
   <em>
    A Dark Room
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a text-based web browser game about survival in a harsh world.
  <em>
   <strong>
    80 Days
   </strong>
  </em>
  , a 2014 adventure game developed by Inkle, also attempted to do its part by spicing up the visual component, but this niche genre is still in need of massive success to convince more developers to try their hand at it. As it stands, the text-adventure game remains one of the industry's long-lost missed opportunities.

  Born from the thrilling spectacle of Yu Suzuki's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Space Harrier
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the rail shooter mostly existed on the bleeding edge of the technology that powered it at any given time. Titles like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Star Fox 64
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Panzer Dragoon
   </em>
  </strong>
  utilized 3D technology in amazing ways by creating worlds that looked so unlike anything else in the industry. As time went on, the popularity of the rail shooter sharply declined, while incredible games like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles
   </strong>
  </em>
  came and went.

 <p>
  Recently, the rail shooter well has run dry and tends to show up occasionally on the indie scene as games like Ex-Zodiac, which draws strong influence from the original
  <em>
   <strong>
    Star Fox
   </strong>
  </em>
  . It's a genre that has been largely forgotten, with the last major release being 2013's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Crimson Dragon
   </strong>
  </em>
  . It's long overdue for a revival, as new technology would make this already spectacular style of game even more exciting.

  A lot of today's most popular games, including FromSoftware's unique breed of action RPGs and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shin Megami Tensei
   </em>
  </strong>
  from Atlus, have roots in the first-person dungeon crawler. Both of them started in these confines, as games like
  <em>
   <strong>
    King's Field
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Arx Fatalis
   </strong>
  </em>
  from Arkane were among some of the best that the genre had to offer.

 <p>
  It got a slight boost thanks to 2012's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Legend of Grimrock
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as well as its sequel in 2014. But in terms of being a widespread, mainstream genre, the dungeon crawler has been relegated to the cavernous hallways that its players explore. More recently, titles like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lunacid
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monomyth
   </em>
  </strong>
  have done their part to bring this unique style of RPG back to the forefront and it's time for a big-budget, AAA attempt at this classic genre.

  While the platform genre tends to focus on more traditional fiction settings, such as horror and fantasy, the cinematic platformer is built around realistic animation and more lifelike physics. It was codified by some of the industry's greatest games, including the sci-fi epic
  <em>
   <strong>
    Another World
   </strong>
  </em>
  and the seminal
  <strong>
   <em>
    Prince of Persia
   </em>
  </strong>
  from 1989. In recent times, the promise of more cinematic platformers seems to happen more than actual releases, as the troubled development of games like
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Last Night
   </em>
  </strong>
  has shown.

  Like so many of the industry's more forgotten genres, the cinematic platformer would benefit greatly from the advancements in hardware and technology. It's built on smooth, realistic animations and how those react to the stringent physics in place, something that modern games aspire to in many ways. Reviving this long-dormant genre is something that would do the industry a bit of good, as seeing more titles in the style of classics like

      <title>The Elder Scrolls Locations Other Than Hammerfell That TES 6's Trailer Could Be Teasing</title>

  It's been over six years since
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Elder Scrolls 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  was first announced back at E3 2018, and the lack of any information since has left the vast and varied landscape it depicted to still be a subject of speculation among fans to this day. Many recognized what appeared to resemble the province of Hammerfell within the teaser trailer, an area of Tamriel that has only begun to seem more likely in the wake of growing rumors. With the numerous zones of that world which also share many of the same traits, however, it's still possible that
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  won't feature the home of the Redguards as its main setting.

  Following the precedent set by Daggerfall taking place in the Iliac Bay between High Rock and Hammerfell, it's not out of the question that players could find themselves returning to what was once a mostly procedurally generated take on Tamriel. While both of these provinces haven't had a proper spotlight in a mainline title since the innovations of
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  , the greater environmental diversity of a place like High Rock alone could see it, or even a totally different place, as the chosen location for
  <em>
   TES6
  </em>
  instead of Hammerfell entirely.

  Bethesda's Potential Development Priorities

 <p>
  As a region specifically known for its deserts, it might be a somewhat odd decision for
  <em>
   TES6
  </em>
  's trailer to have revealed a section of Hammerfell which appears to be primarily composed of mountainous areas and a coast. There is diversity within the province that wouldn't be ignored, but many other key places in Tamriel are similarly associated with high peaks and proximity to the ocean. This could be signaling a return to the Iliac Bay or simply a look at an unseen area, but it's also true that Hammerfell for
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  may not even be a discussion at all if it wasn't for the influence of rumors.

 <p>
  It seems that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  took priority at Bethesda until its launch last year, and the studio has begun taking development on the next
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  seriously since then. Speculation has recently been fueled by the Pinterest board of a
  <em>
   TES6
  </em>
  developer hinting at Hammerfell design motifs being a focus of the concept art team, including styles of clothing and wildlife. Given what may be the early stages of this title's development, however, it's still too early to tell if this confirms the entirety of the province itself.

  Port regions are not an uncommon sight in Tamriel, and the coastal region shown off for
  <em>
   TES6
  </em>
  could be any number of places across several provinces. Not only is High Rock itself mostly surrounded by coasts that could all occupy this space, but the likes of Cyrodiil and
  <em>
   TES
  </em>
  ' unexplored Summerset Isles even have their own contenders for similar landscapes.

 <p>
  While it might seem redundant to repeat part of the setting of
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  , the active nature of the Gold Coast as an important place for trade and its potential to change with the timeline bear a lot of potential for a next-gen RPG. In contrast, an equally fitting place like the Summerset Isles, an isolated archipelago unexplored outside
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  's streamlined interpretation, could have far more narrative significance than any other location given the growing influence of the Thalmor.

  Apart from the regions that mostly closely resemble what was in

  's trailer, there are still several places it could be due to the vague nature of what was shown off. Considering the mix of features in the landscape, any of the following parts of Tamriel and beyond could make sense:

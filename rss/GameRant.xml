 <p>
  Building the perfect loadout in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  often starts with selecting the strongest primary weapons and perks, but secondary weapons are just as crucial for a balanced approach. These options aren't just back-up; they provide players with unique strategic advantages, especially in tight scenarios where primary weapons might just fall short.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":344} -->
 <p>
  With only one secondary slot to fill and six weapons to pick from (two of which being launchers), it's vital that players have the right gun equipped to best suit their playstyle. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, so understanding which situations might call for certain weapons can be the difference between winning and losing.

 <p>
  The powerhouse of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is without a doubt the HE-1 Launcher. This weapon excels at destruction and is best suited to blowing up enemy equipment and Scorestreaks. However, it's important to note that the launcher has no locking-on capabilities, so players will need to rely on their own manual aiming to have any chance of shooting an enemy UAV out of the sky.

 <p>
  Despite its explosive promise, it can be surprisingly weak against enemy targets, as a direct rocket is not guaranteed as a kill. Instead, players will need to use the launcher cleverly, such as in high traffic areas or enemy-secured portions of the map. Partner the secondary with an Assault Pack to re-fill on rockets occasionally, and the explosions should show no signs of slowing down.

  The starting pistol is as reliable as ever this year round, as the 9mm PM partners a high rate-of-fire with manageable recoil to produce a well-rounded secondary option. It's ideal for finishing off opponents or engaging in close-quarter combat when a primary weapon isn't immediately available, typically because it ran out of ammo mid-gunfight.

 <p>
  Its accuracy and ease-of-control allows players to confidently switch to the PM without sacrificing precision, though its damage-per-shot is slightly lower than other available sidearms. If relied on too heavily, players can easily get outgunned by stronger pistols and most primaries. Ultimately, it shines as a reliable secondary to get players out of a pinch, but it should be paired with a robust primary for the best results.

  A Scorestreak's worst nightmare is a homing missile, and with the CIGMA 2B equipped, players can rain on their enemy's parade with ease. Though it's more of a specialist weapon, the launcher suits those who like to focus on anti-vehicle and scorestreak operations. So long as players are careful during the locking-on process, they should face little resistance to destroying enemy aircraft.

 <p>
  Naturally, any loadout opting for a rocket launcher as its secondary requires players to rely heavily on their primary weapon during the majority of the match, as the rockets won't be as effective on the ground thanks to their slower draw and reload speed. It's definitely a situational pick, but it's incredibly consistent in what it does.

  Players looking for a nimble secondary should look no further than the Stryder .22 pistol; it's widely favored for its large magazine, which is ideal for rapid gunfights or multiple encounters in quick succession. High handling stats also make it easy to switch to and from, further adding to its dependability.

 <p>
  What it has in speed and handling it unfortunately lacks in firepower, which explains the higher magazine size. Quick, successive shots need to be landed on enemies to reliably kill them, but if players are facing foes directly with any other primary or secondary, it's highly likely they'll get outgunned. Ideally, this pistol is used to either finish enemies off or catch them by surprise when they think the player's out of bullets.

 <p>
  No other pistol offers as great a firepower than the GS45, and for that reason alone, it's one of the
  <strong>
   best secondary options in
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Black Ops 6
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  With such a quick time-to-kill, it'll only take a few shots for players to drop an enemy, though it needs to be at a reasonable distance, as the damage drops off fairly quickly.

 <p>
  Perhaps one of the best benefits to equipping a pistol is the added maneuverability players get. Partner this with the new omnimovement system, and players can zoom through maps at a blistering pace, all whilst taking shots with such a powerful sidearm.

  The Grekhova pistol is widely regarded as the
  <strong>
   best secondary weapon in
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , thanks to its fully automatic fire rate and impressive accuracy for such a fast-firing pistol. It's exceptional in close to mid-range encounters, and it can even outgun plenty of primary heavyhitters in the right circumstances.
 </p>

 <p>
  What truly sets it apart, though, is its accuracy. It experiences very little recoil, especially when it's partnered with a weighted stock, which can transform it into a surprisingly accurate hip-fired machine. The combination of speed and precision makes it a formidable choice for anyone with an aggressive playstyle, and if the right perks are partnered with it, then players can build a loadout ready to dominate any online lobby.

  What makes a good tank in a MOBA? A tank's job is to attract attention and attacks, commonly referred to as "drawing aggro", while making sure they are alive long enough for the rest of their team to be able to achieve their class' goals. Many people consider Tanks to be a leader of sorts since they are the ones to truly set the pace of an encounter. They sacrifice damage in exchange for a high health pool, and even those without a high health pool can get by with the help of a support unit.

 <p>
  <em>
   Eternal Return
  </em>
  is different when it's compared to other popular MOBAs since it has more in common with games like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  than it does with
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  . However, it is still a MOBA at its core, and the things that make tanks great in MOBAs are still very present in the best tanks of Eternal Return.

  When discussing the best characters in a competitive game, it is important to understand how a character's pick rate and win rate correlate with each other. Yes, Whip Mai is only picked less than 1% of the time, but when referring to the best characters in
  <em>
   Eternal Return,
  </em>
  there are only a few select characters that fit the description. In addition to that, all the tanks in this title have low pick rates. The better picks will have a much higher pick rate, relatively speaking, but the more people playing a certain character means there will be more players losing with them as well.

 <p>
  Those who dedicate the time to learning Mai have the advantage of game knowledge. Since she doesn't pop up much in a match, many players might not know what she does. She's a tank whose abilities scale with her defense stat and her skills have great synergies with each other, allowing her to increase her damage while also protecting her teammates with shields.

 <p>
  Estelle's tankiness comes from her health regeneration passive, whereas other tanks employ high defenses to mitigate damage. She opts instead to heal damage taken over time. Her second skill, "First Response", allows her to reduce the movement speed of enemies. It's good for tanks to be able to slow down advancing enemies, allowing their teammates to escape or provide more damage per second.

  Elena has a unique approach to the tank role, as she is primarily used to annoy her opponents. Her skills damage targets while increasing her defensive stats. Elena also is able to reduce the cooldown of her skills as she hits her opponents with them, allowing her to wear them down over time with her survivability.

  A good counter to tanks in MOBA games is crowd control. Alonso's passive skill makes him immune to immobilization effects for a brief moment and refreshes over time. While also being immune to crowd control, Alonso employs crowd control to take charge of the front line in encounters.

 <p>
  His magnetic abilities are not only fun to use but can easily disrupt teams making him a target players definitely want to take out quickly. This plays right into the fantasy of a tank player and, despite the increased attention from enemies, Alonso also has health sustain built into his kit, making him a solid all around.

  Lenox is a tank that's good against other tanks. Another good counter to tanks is true damage or damage that ignores a tank's resistances, and Lenox has true damage built into her ultimate skill.

 <p>
  On top of her built-in true damage, Lenox also gets access to shields and crowd control, making her a force to be reckoned with no matter who she is facing. Throwing in the ability to pull enemies closer or push them away from allies makes her a top-tier pick.

  Disruption is a common theme when looking at the best of the best when it comes to the tank class. Markus has a lot in common with other tanks. He's good at crowd control and staying alive but he also does those things better than other tanks without straying too much from being a tank.

 <p>
  He's even good with other tanks since his ultimate reduces the defense of enemies hit while slowing them as well. If Markus wants to engage, players will have to deal with him but unfortunately, he's good in one-on-one situations as well.

 <p>
  Darko is interesting when compared to the other tanks in the game because of his passive which allows him to steal enemy resistances from them. Being tanky is one thing, but being able to be tanky while reducing the tankiness of other players is a great ability to have. The rest of Darko's kit features the run-of-the-mill tank abilities, including slows and shielding.

 <p>
  However, the ability to steal 4% of an enemy's defense for 4 seconds upon hitting them just makes him that much better than other tanks.

  Garnet is a tank that gets stronger the more damage she takes. Tanks already want to be in the fray, taking as much damage as possible, so there's no surprise that she's top 2 in terms of tanks in
  <em>
   Eternal Return
  </em>
  . In a scenario where she is facing off against another tank, she should almost always win especially with her very strong ultimate skill, "Maiden's Embrace".

  This skill deals damage upon landing and marks them for 6 seconds. If the target's HP drops below 20% during this time, then the skill can be recast and the target is executed.

  The best tanks when it comes to MOBA titles are the ones that can also do a ton of damage.
  <em>
   Eternal Return
  </em>
  is no different, as Magnus is able to tank a lot of damage while dishing it right back out to his enemies. Every time he is hit with basic attacks his resistances increase and this stacking mechanic increases faster every time he lands a skill on an enemy.

 <p>
  Magnus gives the player a lot of room for skill expression so a lot of players pick him bringing his win rate down, but a good Magnus can be spotted a mile away and a great Magnus shines as the best tank in
  <em>
   Eternal Return
  </em>
  .

  To complete the Highest Bidder quest in
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  's Campaign, you'll first need to select the mission on the map that Sev will give you once you manage to take the photo of the senator. Next, you'll need to
  <strong>
   speak to Gabriel Armato
  </strong>
  , a fixer for New York's crime families who will
  <strong>
   give you a task to complete in exchange for Senator McKenna's retina photo
  </strong>

  Head to the location marked on the map and carefully enter through the yellow curtains – keep in mind that you'll be in a restricted area upon entering; if any guards spot you, you'll alert security. Enter the room, stealthily take down the enemy, and
  <strong>
   hack the action computer with the code 'MCKENNA.

  Next, head to the auction hall to find the clock. To do so, you'll need to take the path on the left as you enter and carefully make your way to the end without being spotted by the guard. Try to get into one of the yellow curtains to be able to take down the enemy without him seeing you. Alternatively, you can also take him down and hide him inside the curtains so that no one finds him.

  Once you reach the end, enter the curtains on your left, and as soon as you come out a few steps away, there will be the clock. Interact to find and access the code. To
  <strong>
   complete the code you will need to turn on the blacklight and find the fingerprints on the numbers
  </strong>
  . Here you will have to try the numbers marked to find the code – the colors and symbols will guide you to enter the correct one.
  <strong>
   Green
  </strong>
  means that the number is correct and is placed in the correct game,
  <strong>
   yellow

  means that the number is correct but is located somewhere else, and

  means that the number is not included in the sequence.

From here you will only have to go to the location marked on the map and carefully sneak until you reach the end of the hallway without being detected. Knock on the door of the room, enter, and take a photo of the senator's retina.

     <li>
      Defender characters in One Piece Bounty Rush aim to protect treasure and control the battlefield efficiently.
     </li>
     <li>
      The best defenders, like Garp, S-Snake, and Kaido, offer unique abilities to withstand attacks and secure victory for their team.
     </li>
     <li>
      Expertly playing defenders like Broggy, Marshall, and Olin involves strategic positioning, patient gameplay, and smart ability usage.

 <p>
  Protecting treasure and controlling the battlefield are the two main purposes of the defender characters in
  <strong>
   <em>
    One Piece Bounty Rush
   </em>
  </strong>
  . They must be able to absorb lots of damage and hold off attackers that are trying to capture another team's treasure. But holding such a strong position will take a lot of durability and smart play.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   best defenders in
   <em>
    One Piece Bounty Rush
   </em>
  </strong>
  include characters who can effectively control the treasure area while synergizing and complementing other classes on their team. Defender players will need to be patient and not move too much unless the situation requires it, being able to sacrifice their HP for the sake of the team's victory.

  Garp, Hero of the Navy, is specifically designed to deal with Captain-type enemies. Every time Garp attacks a Captain player, his damage is increased by 30%, and the Captain's defense is reduced by 30%. Garp also receives 30% less damage in the area close to the enemy's treasure, as well as from boosted enemies.

 <p>
  On top of that, Garp has a number of different defense mechanics that allow him to reduce pressure, such as 5% HP recovery after getting hit for 45% of his max HP, as well as boost to his Stagger and Knockback resistances.

  When Sengoku uses his second skill, it creates a special trait area, where he and his allies can enter and recover 25% of their HP. Also, while staying in this trait area, all defense stats are increased by 30%. This makes Sengoku an excellent healer for any team, especially taking into account that each time his team loses a treasure, his speed of movement gains a 20% bonus.

  Sengoku is also immune to the Stagger effect when being downed, while his Shockwave ability can inflict AOE Stun and Knockback effects on enemies.

  Each time Broggy performs a Perfect Guard, his HP is recovered by 30%, and his cooldown times are reduced by 50%. This, in addition to his gargantuan HP pool, makes Broggy a truly formidable tank who can absorb a massive amount of damage for his team.

  Additionally, if Broggy gets attacked by an enemy with a lower HP than that of his own, then he recovers 3% of his HP. If his HP is above the 50% threshold, he can ignore the enemies and refill the treasure gauge anyway.

  Zephyr has special synergy with Power User enemies, allowing him to deal an extra 30% damage to them. If he receives any type of upgrade, all the incoming damage he receives will be reduced by 50%, and all negative status effects will be nullified. More so, if Zephyr performs a successful knockback on an enemy, he restores 15% of his HP.

  One of the coolest things about Zephyr is that he automatically reduces cooldown times by 5% every time he's being attacked. This effect also applies each time he's being downed.

  S-Snake has a surprisingly high attack stat for a defender class, but her biggest selling point is the ability to instantly travel to her team's furthest treasure. This allows her to immediately react to any threat that poses her team's victory, allowing her to refill the treasure gauge despite the presence of the enemies.

 <p>
  S-Snake also deals extra damage to Runner enemies while using her Love-Love Mellow skill. This attack ignores all damage reduction boosts on enemies and makes her temporarily invincible.

  Marshall has a unique Black Vortex skill, which not only taunts enemies, luring them to his position, but also increases his damage against Power Users by 30% and restricts the enemies from dodging his attacks. This pirate is also completely immune to the Sleep status effect, which makes him practically unstoppable.

 <p>
  Besides that, Marshall players should focus on dealing with as many knockouts as possible, as in that case, he reduces his cooldown times by 30% and recovers his HP by 15%.

  The Battle of Monsters on Onigashima version of Olin, one of the Big Moms, is a multi-class character who can be either a defender or a runner, depending on the circumstances. As a defender, Olin's best trait is the ability to increase the treasure gauge by 50%, making it harder for enemies to claim her team's treasure.

 <p>
  Olin's Heavenly Bon-Bons skill allows her to reduce the speed of the enemy's movement, further complicating the task of capturing her team's treasure. On top of that, she can debuff the enemy's dodging ability and cooldown mechanics.

  When Edward's team's treasure is being captured, he can pull off a powerful AOE attack with a Tremor status effect. This skill is so powerful that it pretty much ignores all enemy defense stats, effectively removing all opponents from his team's treasure. Similarly, he can apply the Out Of My Way skill to protect enemy treasure that's been captured by his team.

  In
  <em>
   One Piece Bounty Rush
  </em>
  , Kaido, also referred to as The Strongest Creature Alive, is incredibly strong and possesses the greatest attack power of any defense character. He obtains a large boost to his attacks and double charges, making him particularly effective against the Kozuki Clan enemies.

 <p>
  If Kaido enters a treasure area, all enemies attempting to do the same will be automatically set on fire. However, it's important to note that he may lose as much as 30% of his speed of movement when using this skill.

 <p>
  The Gear Five version of Luffy has access to all three classes in the game, including defender, attacker, and runner. But he's best only as a defender due to his ability to reduce incoming damage by 30% and gain status effect resistances when staying in the treasure area.

 <p>
  But most importantly, he has not two skills, like most other characters, but three, including Gum-Gum Giant, which is an even larger version of his gun. His most powerful skill is Gum-Gum Lightning, which applies Shock to all affected enemies and ignores any and all obstacles, which makes Luffy Gear Five an unstoppable force in
  <em>
   One Piece Bounty Rush
  </em>
  .

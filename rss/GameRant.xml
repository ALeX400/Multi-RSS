  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  has released a new Halloween-themed update, adding new spooky skins for some Pals, fixing a variety of bugs, and increasing the text chat character limit in multiplayer mode. This Halloween update brings a scary atmosphere to
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  , letting players celebrate the spooky season with their favorite Pals.

 <p>
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  launched as an early access title in January 2024 and immediately caught players’ attention with its promise of creature-catching mechanics mixed with survival elements like crafting, farming, and combat.
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  was dubbed “
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  with guns” as players can capture creatures named Pal and equip them with various weapons, make them work in factories, or even turn them into food. Despite the controversy regarding its resemblance with
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  was a commercial success reaching over two million concurrent players on Steam, making it the second-highest played game of all time on the platform at the time.

 <p>
  The new
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  Halloween update brings four Halloween skins that all players can grab for free, fixes various bugs, and increases the text chat character limit in multiplayer mode. Players can claim Halloween Cattiva, Spectacled Katress, Pirate Pengullet, and Halloween Croajiro for free upon starting
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  , as long as they have at least one corresponding Pal. The bug fixes aim to improve the game’s performance and add various quality-of-life improvements so that players can keep on capturing and exploiting Pals without experiencing game crashes.

 <p>
  Following this announcement on social media, players have expressed their enthusiasm about the spooky Pal skins and hoped for additional cosmetics elements in future updates. Players can change the skin of their favorite Pals on
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  through the Pal Dressing Facility, which they can unlock with the Technology Menu right from level 1. By interacting with this Pal Dressing Facility, players can change the skins of Pals who are active in their party or those stored in their Pal box. While these new cosmetic elements bring themed elements for this Halloween, some players were more excited about the text chat character limit increase in multiplayer mode, letting them write longer messages to other players.

  Besides this update, developer Pocketpair mentioned its intention to expand

  ’s IP in the future, including an anime adaptation. While Pocketpair doesn’t have any plans for a sequel, the developer continues to bring new content updates to enhance
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  ’s gameplay. A mobile version of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is also in the works, being produced by Krafton's PUBG Studios, although the company hasn’t yet shared any official release date.

  has a few collectibles you can find in the form of Polaroids, which also give you a little background on the people and places near where you found them. There are a few to find in each chapter, with a total of five in Chapter 3.

 <p>
  They can be a bit tricky to find because of Max's new dimension-shifting powers, especially when the story continues without you finding them initially. Luckily, if you've missed any of them, you can go back to where you need to find them in the Chapter Select in the main menu. Each chapter is segmented into mini-chapters, too, so don't worry about needing to replay the whole thing if you're happy with your choices.

  After speaking to Yasmin, you'll find out that Vinh may know more about Maya. You'll need to speak to him while you're in the Living World, but you can only find this Polaroid while you're in the
  <strong>
   Dead World
  </strong>
  . Thankfully, you'll need to switch dimensions once you're done speaking with him anyway. He'll be super cagey about the whole thing, and you'll need to shift and find Diamond.

  Once you've entered the other dimension,
  <strong>
   head back into his office first

  . The Polaroid is lying on the

  where you had (or didn't have) a drink with him in a previous chapter. Once you're done, make sure to take a Snapshot of the hedgehog in the photo, which can be found lying on his desk.

  Like it's namesake, you'll be able to find the third Polaroid in Chapter 3 while you're investigating Lucas' office to find more information on Maya. After speaking to him in the Living World, you'll have to shift to the
  <strong>
   Dead World
  </strong>
  so you can investigate his office and find out why he's not super keen on talking about Maya. It's here that you'll be able to find this Polaroid.

  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  has just denied a recent rumor that employees at its Mario Club Co., Ltd subsidiary are being laid off. Layoffs have become an increasing occurrence throughout the game industry over the past year or so, with big-name studios and indie developers reportedly cutting down on their workforces due to low sales, corporate downsizing, or other reasons. For example, Velan Studios, which worked with Nintendo on
  <em>
   Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit
  </em>
  , sent layoff notices to about a third of its workers back in March following the cancelation of a major project.
  <em>
  </em>

 <p>
  This wasn't the only Nintendo-related company faced with news of layoffs, as it was claimed that Mario Club Co., Ltd. was letting go of roughly 150 of its 400 employees earlier this week. For the uninitiated, Mario Club Co., Ltd. is a game-testing and debugging team that has worked on many Nintendo games since
  <em>
   Dr. Mario
  </em>
  back in 1990, with some of its most recent projects including
  <em>
   Luigi's Mansion 2 HD
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Princess Peach: Showtime
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  However, it looks like these layoffs might not be happening after all. A Nintendo spokesperson recently provided a statement to Eurogamer debunking the claims of layoffs happening at Mario Club Co., Ltd. “We have confirmed with Mario Club Co., Ltd. that the rumoured information in the report is untrue,” the statement reads. The rumor in question originated from a Japanese publication named Leakpress (as translated by GoNintendo), which claimed that the layoffs were being done to remove employees who “cause trouble” and “drag their colleagues down.”

  The report that started these rumors also claimed that Nintendo would handle these supposed layoffs differently than Bandai Namco, which reportedly banished some of its Japanese staff to so-called “eviction rooms” with nothing to work on. This would basically pressure the employees in question to leave Bandai Namco on their own rather than be laid off, and sources claimed that roughly 100 have done so.

  has seen plenty of financial success thanks to the Nintendo Switch, and it seems like the Big N has a big year planned for 2025. The tentatively titled Switch 2 console is reportedly set to be revealed sometime before March, and highly-anticipated games like
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns HD
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition

  are launching right at the start of the year.

  FromSoftware's games are known for their obtuse and aloof storytelling methods, which makes
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  's relatively straightforward main quest design stick out like a sore thumb. As players make their way through the expansion's central narrative, they are met with a series of notes left behind by either Miquella or by his followers, ushering them in the correct direction. Make no mistake, this doesn't make
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  "easy" by any means, nor does it detract from the sense of mystery that is paramount in FromSoftware's RPGs, but it is a notable change from the disconnected and lonesome storytelling methods of its predecessors. It's actually somewhat beneficial for
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , but it's maybe not a trend FromSoftware should double-down on.

  Shadow of the Erdtree's More Obvious Storytelling Shouldn't Be Exceeded
 </h3>
 <p>
  Though several of
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  's side quests maintain FromSoftware's typical approach to narrative structure and delivery, the hand-holding of the main questline is hard to ignore. In some ways, this is a great change of pace from other FromSoftware stories, sacrificing a bit of enigma at the altar of playability and engagement. In other words, while obfuscation and mystery have come to define FromSoftware's stories, these strengths can sometimes come at the cost of pacing and narrative clarity, making it hard for some to enjoy the plot;
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  seeks to achieve a better balance.

 <p>
  This is admirable, and a nice contrast to
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  's painful combat difficulty, but it's not hard to see how a similar philosophy could undermine future FromSoftware games. For example, if a
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  sequel were to be released (God willing), and it included notes, text logs, or other abject exposition pointing players in the right direction, it would undermine its emphasis on cosmic horror. Players would be less likely to get lost, yes, but reducing or eliminating the risk of confusion would detract from what makes games like
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  so iconic and impossible to emulate.

  FromSoftware May Not Want to Throw Out Shadow of the Erdtree's Storytelling Methods Entirely
 </h3>
 <p>
  The aforementioned downsides of more hand-holding are described under the assumption that FromSoftware would take the narrative structure of
  <em>
   SotE
  </em>
  further in future entries, but as it stands, the DLC's compromise works rather well. Indeed, its deft touch and gentle guidance could actually enhance other FromSoftware games, if implemented correctly.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1011} -->

 <p>
  FromSoftware's games, while often featuring incredible world-building and lore, are usually lacking in the story department, at least in the traditional sense. Characters, organizations, and civilizations with fascinating, brilliantly conceived backstories abound in these games, but the same cannot be said for emotionally moving, tense, consistently engaging narratives. Oftentimes, the bulk of FromSoftware stories occur off-screen or in the past, with the player taking on a role more akin to an archaeologist or researcher than an active participant.

 <p>
  So, although FromSoftware may want to be conservative in its use of
  <em>
   SoTE
  </em>
  -like storytelling methods, such methods don't have to be shelved definitively. There are benefits to FromSoftware leveraging more linear narrative techniques, so long as the essence of mystery is maintained, lest the developer lose a touch of its identity.

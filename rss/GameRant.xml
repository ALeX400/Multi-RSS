  As you can guess, the Zeus Rod is located in Atlantis in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  . Therefore, your first goal is the underwater kingdom. To get there, you need to find the Mysterious Pirates in the Grand Reef and complete a small quest for them. This way, you can get the Heart Of Zeus needed to teleport to Atlantis. And then, you can find the Zeus Rod by completing the Zeus Trial in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  .

  Finding the Zeus Temple is quite simple, as players just need to go down the corridor past the huge statue of Zeus. At the end of the corridor, you will see a portal that will lead you to the Zeus Trial. It is important to note that this challenge has a time limit, namely 5 minutes. But despite this, you should not rush, as this time is quite enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, to get to the Zeus Rod in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  , you must solve 2 puzzles in the Zeus Trial. In the left room, you will find another Zeus statue that will randomly face you or turn away. Like the red light, green light game, you just need to stand still while the statue is facing you. This way, you need to get to the end of the room and find the first 4 digits of the code.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the right room, you will find a longer puzzle with platforms hovering over lava. Unfortunately, the only way to check whether the platform will fall or not is to jump on it. In other words, you will have to rely only on luck.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the room, you will find the second part of the code. Enter it using a pad at the main doors to solve the Zeus Trial. After that, you can enter the next room and purchase the coveted Zeus Rod for 1,700,000C$ in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  .

 <h3 id="zeus-rod-stats">

 <p>
  Overall, the Zeus Rod is inferior in stats to most late-game rods in
  <em>

  . However, due to its passive ability, it is a good choice for farming money.

However, there is a 5% chance that such fish can burn and get a Charred mutation, which reduces the value of the catch by half.

    Balatro

  <em>
  </em>
  relies heavily on RNG, even by the standards of roguelikes. That is to say, completing a successful run depends in no small part on dumb luck. The increasingly wide variety of power-ups available for players also means that drawing the right ones becomes increasingly rare as the game progresses and more items are unlocked. On the flip side, those late-game additions enable more complex strategies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Three things are important to remember when planning a new strategy: using Planets to upgrade poker hands, buying the right Tarots to edit the deck in favorable ways, and, above all else, being able to adapt when a newer, better strategy appears. Because
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  relies so much on chance, choosing a strategy before the start of a run can be a death sentence. The same goes for strategies decided early in a run: pivoting to a superior strategy mid-run is a common move in
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  , one that is often necessary to win.

   Balatro appears to be going from strength to strength, with the addictive indie game picking up a number of impressive accolades at the Game Awards late last year, and more and more players trying the game, only to realize how truly great it is. It's true that strategies are consistently important throughout Balatro, and that changing strategy regularly, depending on what hand is dealt, is often the key to success, so this article has been updated to reflect some more important considerations when choosing a strategy.

 <p>
  All Flushes isn’t quite the best strategy in the game, but it’s an easy way to build a strong deck. It’s also a hard strategy to get wrong, especially if a player starts with the Checkered deck or if they find a Smeared Joker soon into the run. The Smeared Joker is the more advisable choice, as it can benefit from every suit-related Joker in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strategy is as follows: acquire a Smeared Joker, start with the Checkered Deck (one of the best decks in the game), or change the deck, as much as possible, into one suit. Then, get the appropriate Jokers for the most common suits in the deck. For example, a deck focused on Spades should use the Arrowhead and the Wrathful Joker.

 <p>
  This is a strategy that values adaptability over anything else, and it rests on a simple fact that many
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  beginners might not know. The Jokers that give Chips and Mult when a hand contains a Pair or a Three of a Kind also work with larger hands: a Full House will also count as a Pair and a Three of a Kind, as will a Four of a Kind.
 </p>
 <p>
  A potential problem with this strategy is that it requires quite a few specific Jokers to work properly. Besides the fact that those Joker slots could be better used, there is no guarantee that the cards mentioned before will spawn at all. And without them, this strategy isn’t all that strong.

 <p>
  Despite its name, the All-Face Cards strategy doesn’t rely on gathering lots and lots of face cards. Instead, by using the Pareidolia Joker, players can treat every card in their deck as if it were a face card. This doesn’t do anything on its own, but it allows other Jokers to be applied to the entire deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the best Jockers to play with Pareidolia are the Scary Face, which adds 30 Chips to the value of every face card, and the similar Smiley Face, which adds a +4 Mult. If players have Pareidolia, and every card is also triggered by the additional Scary Face and Smiley Face jokers, any deck can quickly become seriously powerful. Many cards are triggered by playing or discarding a face card, but Sock and Buskin might be the best for this strategy. This card simply activates every face card twice during scoring, triggering each face-related Joker twice.

 <p>
  Beginner players of
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  are likely unaware of the importance of joker order, but this can come in very handy when trying to beat large blinds. In particular, players should make sure that their + chips jokers and + mult cards are placed before their x mult jokers in order to maximize their success.
 </p>
 <p>
  What this means is, placing jokers like Popcorn, which increases the round by +20 mult, to the left of the arrangement of jokers, so that more powerful cards like Acrobat, which awards x3 mult in the final hand of the round, can sit to the right. This works because joker cards are scored from left to right, so the accumulated mult score can then be multiplied to a much bigger number.

 <p>
  The Shortcut is one of the best Jokers in
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  and could be considered one of the most broken elements of any roguelike deck-builder. It’s so unbelievably good that a player could build an entire strategy around it, as many already have. Shortcut is so good that it’s worth pivoting away from a different strategy and onto a Straight focused on the moment this card becomes available.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Shortcut makes building a Straight way easier than before by allowing the player to skip one rank in between each card. It’s obvious how this makes scoring a hand much easier, but it’s even better when paired with Four Fingers, which allows Flushes and Straights to be made of just four cards, putting a Straight Flush strategy within reach. Of course, buying the right Planets is also vital, as it’s the only way to reliably boost the Straight Poker Hand.

 <p>
  As players gain experience with
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  , they will quickly come to realize the importance of their jokers working together for a common strategy. This is why it's important not to start with a strategy, but to develop one as new jokers become available that can work well together. A lot of jokers in
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  are not that good on their own, but paired with others they can become virtually unstoppable.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, cards that retrigger played hands, like Mime or Dusk, work well with the iconic Blueprint joker, allowing the cards to be retriggered once again. Another example could be using Splash and Hiker together to quickly amp up the amount of chips players can earn in each round of the game.

 <p>
  The Ceremonial Dagger isn’t a particularly great Joker, but it can become one under the right circumstances. There are two main circumstances: if the player has lots and lots of money or if they find the Egg Joker early in the run. The Ceremonial Dagger is one of many Jokers that improve during the run, but this one is special. Its Mult value improves by the resell value of the Joker to its right, which it destroys once the blind is selected. This strategy can be very dangerous and isn't very powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  One tactic for using the Ceremonial Dagger is to simply buy and destroy lots and lots of Jokers. To do this effectively, getting a discount voucher is highly encouraged. The alternative is buying an Egg early on, waiting until its resell value (which grows by $3 with every passing round) reaches into the dozens, and then sacrificing it when necessary. Of course, those two strategies should ideally be used in tandem: acquiring an Egg early in the run and then feeding weaker Jokers to the Knife until the Egg is ready.

      <title>8 Handheld Games Better Than Their Console Counterparts</title>

 <p>
  When it comes to
  <strong>
   handheld gaming
  </strong>
  ports, players essentially expect an experience roughly on-par with, or a bit worse than, the home console or PC version. If the game is even
  <strong>
   close
  </strong>
  to being up to snuff on handheld, it's considered a win. Yet, there are a select
  <strong>
   few
  </strong>
  titles that manage to excel at least a bit beyond their bigger console sibling.

 <p>
  Handheld machines
  <strong>
   do
  </strong>
  have the added value of enabling quick gaming sessions on the go — which better suits smaller titles and minigames. There's also the factor of specialized tech, buttons, or other features fastened to certain handhelds, which home consoles may not be able to emulate. For one reason or another, these games play better or have unique appeals that the console/PC versions don't quite have.

  The
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  series was an absolute phenom in Japan for much of the 2000s, before finally taking hold in the West and being (at least partly) a success story there. It's easy to see why, with multi-layered open-world gameplay that beckons gamers to go monster hunting, crafting, and exploring — either solo or with friends — for hours on end.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first handheld iteration of this grind-heavy ARPG from Capcom remains among the strongest in the series. Being a 2006 release,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Freedom
  </em>
  was about the most robust, epic gaming experience for its time, and (aside perhaps from its visuals), it holds up today.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the PS2 version — essentially
  <em>
   Monster Hunter G —
  </em>
  is roughly as compelling and well-crafted, the handheld rendition edges it out. Not only does the marathon, grind-heavy gameplay lend itself to playing on the go, but it also brings some end game content and features (like offline acces to the Gathering Hall), adding countless hours to this already vast 42-hour campaign.

  The
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  series is renowned for its ability to frighten fans on a level new even
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  doesn't often reach, with its dark locales rife with creepy, grotesque monsters. In the case of
  <em>
   Shattered Memories
  </em>
  , it dials things back in terms of action and combat, and leans more on eerie vibes, exploration, and suspense.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, it draws from the franchise's roots, serving as a reimagining of the very first
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  . Added to this, the Wii version brings the ability to move around the protagonist Harry Mason's flashlight via motion control, as he searches desolate areas for his missing daughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, many fans swear by the more traditional PSP version, which is particularly impressive graphically. It also meshes well with the smaller, less-capable handheld, given
  <em>
   Shattered Memories
  </em>
  ' somewhat stripped-down nature and narrow focus.

  This amusing, colorful collage of rhythm microgames fits perfectly on 3DS, despite the flat visuals not exactly showing off its 3D ability. Its simple, to-the-point gameplay and family-friendly themes make it a great option for a quick lunch break, or as a distraction for the kids when on the road. Players may be asked to do anything from dancing in-time with their froggie dance troupe to taking quick snapshots of speeding cars in rhythmic fashion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game isn't a
  <strong>
   direct
  </strong>
  port, but rather, a hodgepodge of stages and games from the DS and Wii renditions of
  <em>
   Rhythm Heaven
  </em>
  . Between the slew of fun options — over 100 rhythm romps, to be precise — and the touchscreen functionality,
  <em>
   Megamix
  </em>
  is the definitive way to play this delightful music game.

 <p>
  Despite being the only title not directly made by Criterion Games,
  <em>
   Burnout Dominator
  </em>
  is a fan-favorite of this wild racing-meets-destruction franchise. The handheld version is loaded with thrilling racing content that sacrifices
  <strong>
   nothing
  </strong>
  from its PS2 counterpart.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there's a healthy dose of car-crashing, Crash Mode is missing this time, with more emphasis on other World Tour events, flashy skill points, and rocking one's boost meter for 'Burnouts'. A more classic
  <em>
   Burnout
  </em>
  approach is taken here, with some modern flair, added features, and several cool new cars. Several distinct game modes (like Eliminator and Maniac Mode) will have players finding it hard to put down their PSPs.

  Switch gamers were reminded of Retro's gripping reboot/sequel to the renowned platformer
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  , with a fleshed out and refined release in 2025. But while that version can also be considered "the definitive
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country"
  </em>
  , the 3DS game more than holds its own — despite being over a decade older.
 </p>
 <p>
  The experience is a delightful blend of retro and modern platforming, with staple
  <em>
   DKC
  </em>
  gameplay coupled with new challenges, characters, and some hazards that are just bananas. The use of 3D is subtle-yet-effective, and the controls feel more solid and straightforward, as this version lacks the tacked-on motion of the Wii original.

  There's a lot to love about this rich rendition of
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  — from the captivating narrative to the vibrant world of Erdrea to the deceptively deep, well-crafted battle system. The core
  <em>
   DQ11
  </em>
  boasts dozens of hours of imaginative JRPG gameplay alone. Meanwhile, the enhanced version called
  <em>
   S - Definitive Edition
  </em>
  , injects even more features and material.
 </p>
 <p>
  One neat addition is the ability to dial back the visuals to a classic early 90s 2D aesthetic. This makes for a terrific blend of modern and retro
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  , and fits especially well with the more classic handheld feel of 3DS. It's perhaps fitting that the robust
  <em>
   Definitive Edition
  </em>
  is actually
  <strong>
   based
  </strong>
  on the slightly more stylistic 3DS game, which, despite being squeezed into older hardware, is the best way to play this epic.

  There's a reason this 2010 classic
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  homage from Sega remains a draw after getting remastered in recent years. The swift, vibrant, and delightfully familiar gameplay simply holds up. The blue hedgehog's colorful side-scrolling journey has sped its way onto several platforms, though many find the DS edition is the way to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set in outer space, fans will find the experience "out-of-this-world" as they venture through several planets, each with six main stages and an intense boss fight. There are many elements and details to these sprawling levels, despite their 2D presentation. Additionally, the extra screen is helpful and adds a unique dynamic. It expands the field of view either above or below Sonic as he scurries onward, revealing a larger picture of the busy biome being traversed.

  Even though Nintendo triumphantly secured this ironic, alluring puzzler — once in the clutches of Russia —for handheld
  <strong>
   and
  </strong>
  home console, it's the Game Boy game people remember most. One need only pick up the brick-like device and play for a few minutes to understand why.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with its simplicity and grey-green (lack of) color scheme, the block-assembling bonanza is just pure, unadulterated fun; somehow even more charming than the NES romp. Of course, it also helps that this version brings multiplayer through a console-linking cable, while the (official) Nintendo version on home console does not.

  The main feature of the Firework Isles in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  is obviously the overwhelming presence of fireworks. Players can see beautiful fireworks show at night, ride a carriage that takes them to the sky for a more intense view of the show, or enjoy other nighttime activities such as dancing around a bonfire or riding a Whirl-A-Pony.

  However, all this doesn't fare with the highlight of the event, which is the
  <strong>
   grand fireworks show in
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The grand fireworks show is different than the normal fireworks, especially if players choose to ask a certain Sprite to recreate the completed show.

  The grand fireworks show in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  starts automatically
  <strong>
   after players complete the A Night of Fireworks quest
  </strong>
  , which is the last part of the mission between Scintilla, Opera, and Marques Jr. Therefore, it's necessary to experience the entire mission if players wish to watch the grand fireworks show in the Firework Isles.
  <strong>
   The show ends after that night, after which players must recreate it to replay it again
  </strong>
  .

  If players have done the mission but didn't take any pictures, don't worry as
  <strong>
   the grand fireworks show can be restarted by doing the Another Night of Fireworks quest in
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Speak to Scintilla by the Sizzle &amp; Spark Center Warp Spire, then hand in the following materials:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Bling x50,000
  </li>
  <li>
   Blastpollen x30
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Fast forward the time to nighttime if it's not already, then head back to the bridge to rewatch the remake of the grand fireworks show. Keep in mind that
  <strong>
   each recreation lasts for one night
  </strong>
  , so players should head to watch right after asking Scintilla. Otherwise, Stylists must submit the payment again for another recreation of the grand fireworks show.

  After the show starts, simply take a picture with it to complete the task that requires it. However, if players have issues such as the firework not restarting, then they can skip it. In the Strings of Time event, for instance, players have the liberty to skip three tasks while still being able to acquire all the rewards from the event.

  So many kids grew up playing
  <em>
   Crash Team Racing
  </em>
  on the original PlayStation, and Naughty Dog's project is still considered one of the all-time kart racing greats. In 2019, Activision published
  <em>
   Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled
  </em>
  , an expansive remaster/remake of the original that even includes characters and tracks from the less-loved sequels. While its post-release business practices garnered quite a bit of criticism, this package is still a pretty easy recommendation for anyone remotely interested in racers, especially since there just aren't all that many alternatives on Game Pass that can scratch a similar itch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Nitro-Fueled
  </em>
  completely retains
  <em>
   CTR
  </em>
  's Adventure mode, which challenges players to work their way through four areas with races and a boss, all en route to defeating Oxide and saving the world. Silly as the story is, this campaign is a lot of fun to play through, and this version even offers the option to swap racers rather than having to stick to a single character. Gameplay-wise,
  <em>
   CTR
  </em>
  is an absolute treat that emphasizes sliding and boosting, the latter of which is influenced by
  <em>
   Crash Nitro Kart
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Nitro-Fueled
  </em>
  has nothing inappropriate for children, at least in terms of gameplay. That said, the game can be quite challenging, even on the lowest difficulty.

  One of the definitive platforming franchises,
  <em>
   Spyro the Dragon
  </em>
  is beloved specifically due to Insomniac's PS1 trilogy. Now, more than two decades later, these titles are readily available to Xbox and PC users with a Game Pass subscription.
 </p>
 <p>
  Toys for Bob modernized these exploration-based classics to create a frequently gorgeous compilation dripping in child-like wonder, imagination, and Gnorcs. All three games are good at a minimum, and they build naturally upon each other, with both sequels introducing considerable mechanics that expand on the first entry's solid but simple foundations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its E10+ rating,
  <em>
   Spyro Reignited Trilogy
  </em>
  is generally an easy recommendation for children. Each story has a lighthearted tone that is perfectly suitable for all ages, even if they might occasionally include a wink for older players. While not devoid of challenge, none of the games are particularly difficult, although younger kids might need some help with a handful of missions that are more frustrating than anything else.

  <em>
   Katamari
  </em>
  epitomizes silliness in the best possible way. Driven by wacky characters with god-like powers, the games ultimately revolve around the son of the King of All Cosmos, and he is either usually aiding his father or trying to clean up his messes.
  <em>
   We Love Katamari
  </em>
  is arguably the best entry in the franchise, at least in the sense that it perfected the core formula introduced in its predecessor,
  <em>
   Katamari Damacy
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie
  </em>
  remasters the PS2 classic by mostly updating the visuals, which is already enough to warrant playing this absolute gem. In terms of new content, this version has some new levels centering around the King of All Cosmos' upbringing, but they are fairly brisk and minor experiences overall.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Katamari
  </em>
  is just perfect for kids. Putting aside all the ridiculous and hilarious characters, the roll-everything gameplay is immediately accessible and instantly rewarding. More importantly, the campaign delivers a strong sense of progression as the Prince's collections gradually grow more impressive, ensuring that players always feel like they are moving forward rather than just repeating the same stuff. Regardless of somebody's familiarity with the franchise,
  <em>
   We Love Katamari REROLL+ Royal Reverie
  </em>
  is an all-around delight that can put a smile on the faces of both children and adults.

  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  was arguably the first successful PlayStation mascot, with Naughty Dog's series being a staple of the PS1 era. However, the marsupial lost his way after that generation, and ultimately fell into the hands of Activision. In 2023, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, which added PlayStation's legendary mascot to the Xbox family. Long story short, Crash's PS1 trilogy can be played through Game Pass in the form of the
  <em>
   N. Sane Trilogy
  </em>
  . This is the strangest timeline.
 </p>
 <p>
  As interesting as the IP's history is, the only thing that ultimately matters is the quality of these games. The
  <em>
   N. Sane Trilogy
  </em>
  is generally fantastic, with each remake fine-tuning the original versions to create authentic experiences that feel both modern and nostalgic. Putting aside some gloriously over-the-top death scenes, all three titles should be fine for younger players who are taking their first steps into the world of gaming. While the remake sharpens a lot of the classic version's rough edges,
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  is still far and away the hardest entry in the trilogy, along with just being the most straightforward and (arguably) worst. Kids should start with the first game regardless, but if they find it a bit too difficult, there is no shame in jumping ahead to
  <em>
   Cortex Strikes Back
  </em>
  and even
  <em>
   Warped
  </em>

  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  is great for all ages, but it comes with something of a learning curve. Pugstorm's survival sandbox game takes a hands-off approach by dropping players into a procedurally generated map and telling them to have fun. At that point, players must dig, collect resources, and find their way through the darkness. They will fight enemies, take on a few bosses, and upgrade items. Most importantly, they will craft and build, setting up a base that will gradually liven up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything here is fine for children, except the somewhat directionless first few hours. Consequently, younger players might lose interest before
  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  hits its stride. If that does not happen, they might just find a game capable of consuming months of their lives.

  Most action RPGs are not particularly great picks for kids since they tend to tackle fairly mature subjects or are slightly too hard for younger players. However, exceptions exist, and
  <em>
   Dungeons of Hinterberg
  </em>
  is a pretty great 2024 example. The premise is simple: Luisa needs a break from work, so she heads to the Alps to take on the 20+ dungeons. When not hack and slashing her way through enemies, Luisa can be found relaxing at her hotel or simply exploring the beautiful biomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  While hardly shallow,
  <em>
   Dungeons of Hinterberg
  </em>
  's mechanics are straightforward, especially the combat. The same can be said for its structure, as the game allows players to mostly do their own thing and decide how they want to spend their days. With great visuals, fun exploration, enjoyable combat, and an addictive gameplay loop, this release is a great option for slightly older children.

  Moon Studios'
  <em>
   Ori
  </em>
  games were two of the best Metroidvanias of the 2010s, and time has done nothing to dull their shine. Both projects cast players as Ori, taking them to explore a relatively large side-scrolling world that is drenched in whimsy and fantasy.
  <em>
   Ori and the Blind Forest
  </em>
  consists almost exclusively of exploration, platforming, and puzzles, with combat being fairly weak and not encouraged in most situations.
  <em>
   Ori and the Will of the Wisps
  </em>
  introduces a more robust battle system than its predecessor, allowing for more spectacular boss battles. That said, the sequel is also primarily a platformer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Ori
  </em>
  games are kind of weird. On the one hand, they are perfectly fine for children, even if older players might appreciate their themes and emotional storytelling more. The gameplay is fairly straightforward and accessible, at least to the point that most kids will likely not struggle too much to get into the flow of things. However, the games can be challenging, even on the lower difficulty setting. While not excessively hard by Metroidvania standards,
  <em>
   Ori
  </em>
  has plenty of difficulty spikes throughout both of its campaigns.

  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  is such a pillar of the casual fighting industry that any similar project is immediately fighting an uphill battle to justify its existence, let alone challenge Nintendo's behemoth. Despite the crossover franchise being exclusive to another ecosystem, leaving room for companies to cater to Xbox users without having to directly compete against
  <em>
   SSB
  </em>
  , platform fighter games have generally struggled to take full advantage of that vacancy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
  </em>
  was not, frankly, one of the strongest entries in this peculiar subgenre, with the 2021 release lacking polish, replayvalue, or pageantry. It seemed destined to be forgotten. However, the unthinkable happened – Fairy Play released a sequel. And, even more unexpectedly,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2
  </em>
  improved considerably on its predecessor. While not fundamentally playing that differently from the first entry, the sequel balanced its character roster while adding flourishes that are not only fun to pull off in the middle of battles but also pay tribute to the source material. Along with multiplayer modes,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2
  </em>
  is also a viable single-player option thanks to a campaign with a silly but enjoyable story. While quite short and repetitive, the mode is perfect for something like Game Pass.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, this
  <strong>
   kids' game
  </strong>
  is mostly for Nickelodeon fans who will get a thrill from just trying out the characters on the roster. However, if a child just wants to play an accessible fighter with a few friends,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2
  </em>
  should get the job done.

  An exciting local or online co-op option on Game Pass,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is perfect for parents to play with their kids. On paper, nothing sounds more mundane than moving furniture, but, similar to something like
  <em>
   Overcooked!
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  transforms this tiring and frustrating part of life into a silly physics-based party game with an over-the-top presentation and story. This time around, movers will need to transfer houses' worth of items across parallel realities, a concept that presents plenty of interesting scenarios and visuals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although great for all ages,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  can be somewhat difficult. After all, this is effectively a puzzle game that challenges player(s) to decipher the best and most efficient route to carry each piece of furniture, all the while trying to work together rather than against each other.

  <em>
   Little Kitty, Big City
  </em>
  has a simple premise that is perfect for this type of game. Used to living the good life in a high-up apartment building, a black cat's world comes crashing down after they fall out of a window; now, they must eat fish, make a few friends, get petted by humans, and (hopefully) find their way back home. As they travel across the streets around their owner's apartment, the feline gets to solve a few puzzles while also taking on the occasional side quest to keep things interesting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Relaxing and charming,
  <em>
   Little Kitty, Big City
  </em>
  offers the ideal escape from reality for people of all ages. While not particularly deep mechanically or thematically, the game is relentlessly cute and warm.

  Even though they tend to have content suitable for all ages, restaurant sims focus so much on micromanagement that they can be overwhelming for young players. While not a complete exception,
  <em>
   Rolling Hills
  </em>
  is a bit more streamlined than most of the genre's entries, making it a better option for kids taking their first steps into this universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the cute visuals and wholesome setting combine to create a pretty relaxing and welcoming experience, one that offers some depth and challenge but does not go out of its way to punish players. If nothing else, children will likely enjoy the protagonist, a Sushi Bot with an adorable design and an affable personality.

  Many games try to represent childlike wonder, but few titles capture the feeling as perfectly as
  <em>
   Lil Gator Game
  </em>
  . The story is simple: a brother wants his older sister to play with him like they used to when they were younger. Consequently, he sets out to plan a game so amazing that she will have no choice but to hang out. The protagonist's drive might be relatable to a lot of kids who have watched their siblings mature before their eyes or who simply just enjoy creating make-believe scenarios.
  <em>
   Lil Gator Game
  </em>
  has a certain nostalgic air that might hit the mark with older players; however, it is perfect for children.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moving past the premise, this game plays out like a fairly typical adventure, with light platforming, puzzles, and exploration.
  <em>
   Lil Gator Game
  </em>
  is not particularly long, and it can easily be completed in one afternoon. That said, the world is quite open, making it a fun sandbox to mess around in.

  However, Survival Mode shouldn’t be overlooked either. Beyond the obvious thrill, it encourages creative problem-solving, and the mode's difficulty level can be customized to whatever degree of challenge is right and comfortable for the player.

  <em>
   Plants vs. Zombies
  </em>
  had a fairly active 2010s, but the franchise has yet to make an appearance in the current decade. While waiting for
  <em>
   Plants vs. Zombies 3
  </em>
  to become a reality, players (and children) can jump into the previous titles, most of which are on Xbox Game Pass. While
  <em>
   Battle for Neighborville
  </em>
  is the most recent project,
  <em>
   Garden Warfare 2
  </em>
  is generally regarded as the license's high point. Unlike the strategy-driven main titles, the
  <em>
   Garden Warfare
  </em>
  games are third-person shooters; that said, they still center around defending locations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Released in 2016,
  <em>
   Garden Warfare 2
  </em>
  was a visual treat at the time thanks to its animated character designs and colorful backdrops. Even all these years later, the game is still pleasing to the eyes. While not overly deep or complicated, the combat system is also pretty good and satisfying.
  <em>
   Garden Warfare 2
  </em>
  is built upon classes, with both Plants and Zombies having a small but versatile selection at their disposal. While prioritizing multiplayer, the title does allow most modes to be played solo, replacing other players with AI. There is even something resembling a story mode, although it is not especially great.

   TMNT: Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  is a throwback to classic beat 'em up arcade games from the '90s, and it does an impeccable job of modernizing this genre. Offering seven playable characters, each of which is uniquely defined,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  guides players through hard-hitting levels filled with references to old
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  stories and games.
 </p>
 <p>
  While certainly one of the better
  <strong>
   Game Pass games for kids
  </strong>
  , this title is quite difficult, and some of the campaign's later stages might be too much for younger players. That said, children are likely to have a blast controlling the Turtles as they take on the Foot Clan and other iconic villains from the franchise.

  <em>
   Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  is a middling platformer that garnered extra scrutiny since it launched alongside the Xbox One X.
  <em>
   New Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  takes 2017's release and greatly enhances it, crafting an experience that is superior in nearly every way. Along with packaging the levels from the DLC into the campaign,
  <em>
   New Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  adds camera control, fixing one of the biggest issues in the original version.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Xbox is not associated with platformers, and while there are a couple of genre classics on Game Pass,
  <em>
   New Super Lucky's Tale
  </em>
  is a fresh option that should not be overlooked. The game will likely impress both young children and older players who are fans of platformers.

  Game Pass has a lot of racing titles, and most of them are fine for younger players.
  <em>
   Forza Horizon
  </em>
  is probably the best overall option, but
  <em>
   Need for Speed
  </em>
  has plenty of representation as well, including
  <em>
   Hot Pursuit Remastered
  </em>
  for those who would rather focus on straight-up events rather than roaming an open-world. While the overall genre is easy to come by, Game Pass does not have all that many kart racers. If mascots or weapons are a must-have, the service has no games that fit the descriptor.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged
  </em>
  is the closest alternative, and the fact it is based on toys should enhance its appeal to youngsters. Even if someone has never owned a Hot Wheels in their life, this game is more than good enough to still be worth a try.
 </p>
 <p>
  Do not be discouraged by the fact this is a licensed project, as
  <em>
   Turbocharged
  </em>
  is polished, graphically impressive, and fine-tuned. The controls are nearly perfect, and it should only take a couple of races for a player to feel comfortable executing drifts, jumps, and boosts. While multiplayer might not be great for young players, the game has a single-player campaign built around a Saturday Morning Cartoon-style story. While not extremely long, it is fairly entertaining and showcases a variety of event types. Players will even start unlocking a few new cars, and
  <em>
   Turbocharged
  </em>
  has a lot of them.

  <em>
   SteamWorld
  </em>
  loves nothing more than to try new genres, and nearly always to great success. While it might not go down as the franchise’s masterpiece as it does not quite reach the same heights as
  <em>
   Dig
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Heist
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   SteamWorld Build
  </em>
  is nevertheless an impressive package. As the title suggests, the 2023 release is a city-builder, one that puts players in charge of a frontier town stuck on a planet that has seen better days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mechanically,
  <em>
   Build
  </em>
  primarily focuses on streamlining the genre’s traditional tropes, crafting an experience that caters to new (or young) players who might not be accustomed to city-builders. That’s not to say the game brings nothing fresh to the plate, as its setting and mining section are both unique, but it plays as expected.

  Players who have fond memories of the
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars
  </em>
  games will have an absolute blast with
  <em>
   The Skywalker Saga
  </em>
  , while young children can create some new memories with the license. This blockular, cartoony take on the modern trilogy features a wide cast of LEGO-fied characters in a fun and funny adventure across the galaxy. The combat is fun and the cooperative play means that kids and adults can play together through each mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are tons of things to unlock, and the humorous storyline is perfect for the whole family. The game is rated E10+ for its cartoon mischief and violence, but this
  <strong>
   Game Pass kids game
  </strong>
  is a rather wholesome adventure, especially for those who love the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  series.

  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  is the perfect game for kids and families alike, thanks to its cavalcade of recognizable characters and colorful visuals. Rated E for Everyone,
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  can be described as a mixture of
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Harvest Moon
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  . Players will be able to build their own Disney-esque areas, filling them with decorations, furniture, and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the ideal title for families to play together, and even grown-ups should get a kick out of the release, which features a wide array of classic and iconic Disney names.

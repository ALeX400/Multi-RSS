      Leon Kennedy has become a key figure in the Resident Evil franchise, making strong impressions on fans old and new.
     </li>
     <li>
      Leon's prominent roles in recent games and crossovers solidify his status as the new face of the franchise.
     </li>
     <li>
      It would therefore make sense for him to lead Resident Evil 9 and help define the future of the series.

 <p>
  Protagonists have always been some of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil
   </strong>
  </em>
  's strongest assets. While ferocious monsters and zombies are obviously very important for any horror story, having a strong cast of human survivors is arguably just as important. Fans need a central group of heroes that they can root for and inevitably feel sad about when they meet their untimely end.
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  has always done a decent job of getting players to connect with its protagonists, often building that connection through both story and gameplay.

 <p>
  In the survival horror genre, the player is given only a limited set of resources and is tasked with surviving whatever the game throws at them. In this high-pressure scenario, the player often ends up forming a close, almost symbiotic bond with their player-character, with their own survival instincts mirroring the character's. This is why so many
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  fans have such strong connections with the franchise's legacy characters, and there's one familiar face who's likely to keep coming back even more frequently than the rest.

  Leon Kennedy Has Become The Face of the Resident Evil Franchise
 </h3>
 <p>
  There have been some truly iconic
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  protagonists over the years, with Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine making a huge impact with the franchise's debut game, and characters like Claire Redfield and Ada Wong making strong impressions whenever they're on-screen. But in recent years, no
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  protagonist has been quite as prolific as Leon S. Kennedy.

 <p>
  Originally making his debut in 1998's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  , Leon Kennedy has appeared in various entries throughout the franchise's long history, but one of Leon's most important roles came in 2019 with the launch of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2 Remake
  </em>
  . While 2017's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  was a great return to form for the franchise after the poor reception to
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  , it was 2019's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2 Remake
  </em>
  that really restored the franchise to its former glory, and Leon Kennedy was right at the heart of it.

 <p>
  Earlier this year it was confirmed that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2 Remake
  </em>
  is now the best-selling game in franchise history, selling over 13.9 million copies. It seems safe to assume that this remake was many new fans' first foray into the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise, and as such, Leon Kennedy was probably the first protagonist many formed a connection with. This connection will have only grown deeper with the release of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4 Remake
  </em>
  last year, with Leon Kennedy getting the spotlight all to himself.

 <p>
  In the last few years, Leon Kennedy has also appeared in a few games outside the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise, featuring as a crossover character in games like
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . Though he isn't the only
  <em>
   RE
  </em>
  protagonist to appear in recent years, he's probably the most prolific when all is said and done, essentially becoming the new face of the franchise.

  If Resident Evil Is Bringing Back Mascots, Leon Kennedy Should Be First on the List
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the biggest rumors surrounding the upcoming
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  is that it will feature a handful of legacy character returns. If that turns out to be true, then it would make complete sense for Leon Kennedy to play a major role in the series' next entry, if not as the main playable character, then at least as a core part of the NPC cast. Leon Kennedy is the connective tissue that ties together veteran fans and newcomers, with the former group having loved the character for decades and the latter crowd enjoying his more recent depictions. It would make sense for Capcom to keep Leon at the heart of the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise moving forward.

   Finding just the right game to play with friends can be a little challenging. That one isn’t really into shooters, while another one wants nothing to do with survival titles. Not all new shiny AAA titles can capture the entire group’s attention, and that is where the indie scene shines in all its glory.

  gives players an unwieldy, awkward character to control and a collection of puzzles and physics to play with. And it is fun and games to experiment alone, but with added co-op, complete chaos ensues. And it is hilarious.

  Players can somewhat attack each other, use objects to mess with others, and use a whole array of other methods of throwing each other off of cliffs and buildings. Additionally, players can try to get themselves together and solve the many interesting puzzles that the game throws at them.

  Everything about this game is very simple. Simple controls, small, cute characters, and mostly straightforward puzzles. Push a button, get the key, and open the door. Simple. The devil lies in the number of players and the near-perfect coordination required for some of the puzzles.

  While this game can be played solo, it becomes an absolute rollercoaster in multiplayer. Stealth games can be quite punishing by themselves, challenging players to plan ahead, wait for just the right timing, and move with great precision. So what happens when it also requires coordination between up to four people?

 <p>
  Of course, that depends on the players, but chaos is all but guaranteed. The levels are big and open-ended, leaving many ways to approach the goal. With several characters, each with their own set of abilities, players can try different tactics and plans, until something inevitably goes wrong.

  High-octane gameplay might not be for everyone, and there are days when players just want to kick back, and enjoy a fun, chill time with each other. The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Prom

  series has been providing that, and much more, since the release of the first entry.

  This multiplayer visual novel takes its players on an interactive road trip. There are goofy adventures at every turn, and unique, well-written romance options. It can be quite the change of pace for some players, but it is a welcome and fresh perspective on what games could be.

   <em>
    Viscera Cleanup Detail
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes a rather boring premise — cleaning up — and turns it into a fun and chaotic game that can forge and destroy friendships. In the game, the players are tasked with cleaning up the scenes of a battle (presumably from a
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  -like shooter) by removing the debris and the aftermath of a battlefield.

 <p>
  While the idea is simple enough, the devil lies in the actual
  <em>
   cooperation
  </em>
  from players. While one player might be intensely trying to mop the floor, someone else might drop the bucket of goop onto the clean surface, ruining the entire progress, which some players might find…infuriating.

  As advertised! This lovely indie title brings the beloved mini golf to virtual space, allowing players everywhere to challenge each other in a series of different goal courses. As competitive as the idea already is, the game kicks it up a notch by adding unique mechanics like explosions, teleportations, shoving, and sabotage.

  This series offers a cooperative escape room experience, with elements of horror sprinkled throughout. Two players take the roles of explorers, solving different puzzles while relying on each other through communicating with radios. Players are playing in different locations, each with their own set of challenges and information.

 <p>
  Teamwork is key here, as the players need to cooperate by sharing their knowledge and working together to escape their difficult predicament. One should also practice patience, for those times that their partner fails to see the obvious clues on their side, and proceeds to accidentally kill their buddy on the radio.

  is definitely one kind of a game. From the fantastic art style to brutal boss fights and unforgiving levels, the packaged experience is like no other. Wrapped with a great soundtrack, the entire thing is an artistic treat. And what better way to experience it, than side by side with a gaming buddy?

  Players can try and complete the game’s many challenges together, bringing down ruthless bosses one by one. While the difficulty is nothing to sneeze at, with a bit of practice and a fair amount of patience, players can learn the ropes and excel at dodging, parrying, and attacking in no time.

  separates itself from similar zombie survival games by shifting the perspective and adding its unique system of perks, stats, and various mechanics that factor into one’s survival. With many backstories to choose from, players can make new and different characters every time, with their own skills and proficiencies.

  Surviving with friends is both a blessing and a curse, as there is more manpower, but the resources now have to be split among the crew. The game offers many tense and blood-clotting moments, where friends will be left with a choice: heroically help out their fellow survivors, or run away and hope no one finds out.

  While on paper more players should equal more helping hands and firepower, that also comes with needing more resources to feed and outfit everyone. Ultimately, players will need to carefully balance resource management with exploration and combat.

  builds on the very successful premise of the first game and improves almost every single aspect.

  The great cooking simulator is back! This sequel mostly keeps the familiar formula from the first installment but adds a few mechanics and aspects to spice things up. Players can now throw their held dishes, which really speeds up the entire process, but can also lead to disaster if used carelessly.

  With many new levels, ever-changing environments, and moving tables, chaos is almost inevitable. But should the players find their rhythm and coordination, the game feels very fun and rewarding. After all, it might not be that different from trying to cook with your friends in real life.

  A

  player became quite confused when they discovered unexpected contraband on their Kosatka submarine. The fan shared their discovery with other
  <em>

  players, hoping to find an answer behind the abnormal appearance.

  Submarines are one of the many kinds of vehicles that players can acquire in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . They are quite expensive, but provide players with numerous benefits. In addition to serving as a starting point for select missions, players can also use the sub to move to different parts of the map, house their submersible vehicles, and even target enemy players with the sub's guided missile system. It may be this last particular feature that led to this player finding something so odd on their ship.

  player Tomppari shared their finding with fellow fans on Reddit, jokingly accusing Pavel of having put the unexpected contraband there. The screenshot shows the sub's command center, where Pavel is keeping himself busy, but more importantly, two large pallets of weed are sitting in front of some of the control panels. Players can come across large amounts of drugs in the game like this, but generally they're found in a player's businesses, like the
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  nightclub or their weed farm. They're not supposed to appear in submarines under any normal circumstances.

  Why Did Contraband Appear on a GTA Online Player's Sub?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Fellow players were quite amused at the find, with several making jokes about Pavel having a side business, or deciding to use his cut of the profits the player earns on whatever he likes. One fan wondered at the practicality of getting a forklift to load up the pallets onto a submarine of all things. However, there's a likely reason for the presence of the contraband: PC cheaters. A player noted that the contraband stack is piled up right in front of the control panel the player would need to use in order to access the sub's guided missile system.

 <p>
  As fans pointed out, while the guided missiles are a great feature to have, they're not so much fun to be a target of. Some fans hate seeing submarines pop up on the map as much as others loathe the presence of the Oppressor MK 2, the armed flying bike that players use to wreak havoc from the sky on unsuspecting players. The theory goes that a PC modder or cheater spawned these contraband flats in the sub to block Tomppari from using their guided missiles. While it's ultimately a form of cheating, it's a relatively harmless way of preventing players from griefing others with a submarine.

  However, this does underscore an ongoing problem in

  . While steps have been taken to combat cheaters, both

  and
  <em>
   Red Dead Online

  have significant cheating problems. Some players use them to get their own character ahead, while others choose to make lives living hell for anyone else trying to enjoy the game. Comparatively, this particular cheater was seemingly just trying to keep the peace, but fans would nonetheless like to see the cheating issue resolved.

 <p>
  Sony has pushed an update to the official
  <strong>
   PlayStation App
  </strong>
  that makes tracking trophies much more convenient during gameplay. Prior to this update, PlayStation App users could only view the trophies they acquired from playing games on their consoles, but Sony has now added some neat functionality that trophy hunters will likely appreciate.
 </p>

 <p>
  The PlayStation App has been around since the PlayStation 4's launch in 2013, and Sony has made major strides to improve it over the years. In its current state, the app allows players to access the PlayStation Store and make purchases, manage their active PlayStation Plus subscription, catch up on PlayStation-related news, install games on their console (only if it's in rest mode), view their trophies, message their friends, look up other players, and much more. The app is regularly updated and occasionally adds new features, such as the PlayStation Stars loyalty program back in 2022.
 </p>

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Sony has also been making efforts to synergize functionality between the app and the console, with one of the best examples being the ability to share PS5 screenshots from the PlayStation App. Now, the recent 24.7.0 update for the PlayStation App on iOS and Android further harnesses this synergy to make trophy tracking easier for PS5 and PS4 players by somewhat offloading it to the app. Users who update the PlayStation App will be greeted with a landing page informing them of helpful shortcuts that will show up on the app whenever they are playing a game on their linked console.

 <p>
  These shortcuts will lead the user to activities like game tips and trophies on the PlayStation App itself, where they can then view their trophies as they play without having to back out of the game on their console. Since viewing trophy lists is a three-step process in the PS5's UI at the very least, this PlayStation App update adds a lot of convenience for trophy hunters, as they won't need to constantly exit the game screen on their PS4/PS5 to check trophy progress or minor requirements. Players can also use one of the shortcuts to accept multiplayer invites if the PlayStation App is open at the same time, further expanding Sony's recent emphasis on helpful multiplayer features for PS5 users.

 <p>
  Trophy hunting is an essential component of the PlayStation experience for many players, and it's encouraging to see that Sony recognizes it and endeavors to streamline the process. Previous PS5 updates added big quality-of-life changes for trophy hunters, and the PlayStation App's extended functionality should make trophy tracking even simpler now.

  The Nintendo Direct from June had a lot of great reveals in it like a new RPG in the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  franchise,
  <em>
   Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership
  </em>
  . Another big reveal was
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Not only was it a surprise to see Zelda as the star, but Nintendo announced its release date was imminent.

  More companies should adopt this strategy instead of revealing something years before its release. 2017’s teaser trailer for
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4
  </em>
  says hello. Now, there were a lot of things shown in the trailer for
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  . Let’s get into some of the more exciting confirmed features.

 <p>
  The biggest feature shown in the trailer is the overall gimmick of the game and one of the strangest in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  series. Zelda befriends a fairy named Tri who gives her the Tri Rod. With it, Zelda can create copies of objects in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  called Echoes.

 <p>
  With a simple tap of her Tri Rod, Zelda can copy objects like tables, boxes, and even trampolines. It seems like she can create an endless supply of them, so right now it is unknown if there is a hidden magic meter or a limit. As to how many Echoes there are in the game, even the producer, Eiji Aonuma, doesn’t know as he says in the trailer. It’s an interesting weapon to give Zelda instead of a sword like Link.

 <p>
  Zelda can not only make objects appear to solve puzzles by hopping on them, but she can use them in more creative ways. Having the direct ability to jump, as a side note, is a big deal for the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise too. Anyway, in the trailer, she can conjure an object that looks like the Spinner item from
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
  </em>
  . She stands on it and destroys enemies in her path.

  So, it is confirmed that Zelda can at least ride some objects in the game but whether there are more is a mystery. Besides riding atop objects, Zelda can hold some too. At one point she can be seen gliding in a volcano via a bird. In another instance, Zelda can be seen using a robotic Octorok-looking creature who shoots rocks at enemies.

 <p>
  As if creating Echoes wasn’t cool enough, Zelda can zap enemies with the Tri Rod too. In the trailer, it seems like enemies can sometimes leave an Echo behind as much as they can leave materials like Hearts or Rupees behind. Players can then harness monsters to send after others.

 <p>
  Nintendo is no stranger to making games wherein players catch monsters and unleash them onto enemies aka the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series. There are some strategies for this mechanic as well. Players can turn meat into an Echo to lure others away, like the Crows seen in the trailer. Once gathered, players can then make a trap via hungry plants to finish enemies like the Crows off in one fell swoop.

  It’s exciting to get another top-down
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game as it has been a while. Not counting
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  remake in 2019, the last new top-down entry was in 2015 via
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes
  </em>
  . The top-down perspective is classic but there is another cool angle shown in the trailer.

 <p>
  Zelda can go into 2D areas just like in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening
  </em>
  . She’s shown several times underwater and even once traversing a cave full of spiders. The game is set in Hyrule which looks like it has a diverse set of biomes from normal plains to dusty deserts to tropical jungles. The jungle setting even has rain so maybe the weather will play a big factor in exploration too which is exciting.

  Besides the Tri Rod, the other big gimmick in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is that rifts are opening up all over Hyrule. Link is sucked in but some NPCs fall victim too. It’s not shown how, but Zelda can be seen in the trailer within a rift, harvesting water.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":940} -->

 <p>
  She then uses that water on land to scale up a cliff. Later, fire is shown which can also be manipulated to burn a field of grass, so elements will play a role beyond the aforementioned rainy jungle. As for the rifts, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo uses these areas to engage players.

  This is a revelation not shown in the trailer but it has been revealed that Link will be playable. This news comes from the official ESRB website for
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom’s
  </em>
  rating. The direct quote is as follows: “As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies.” It's odd when the ESRB makes leaks like this unintentionally.

  Now is not the time for speculation as it is unknown how far this playtime with Link will extend. Will Link be playable just in that opening dungeon to defeat Ganon or can players try and escape the rift dimension as Link? Hopefully, Nintendo will leave this as a surprise and not show Link in any more trailers. It’s more fun going into a game to find a new hero playable kind of like how Solid Snake was replaced by Raiden in
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty
  </em>
  .

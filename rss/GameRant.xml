  In
  <em>
   Black Clover M
  </em>
  , as in most other similar games, you will need to go through a tutorial before you can redeem codes. It will take you about 20–30 minutes, but it will help you understand the game's mechanics and lore. Once you've done that, you'll eventually be able to redeem codes, which is a rather confusing process, so here's a quick guide to help you out:

  <li>
   It is located in the upper-left corner, so click on it to open a new menu.
  </li>
  <li>
   Here, you will need to copy the AID, which is located in the upper left part of the menu, right below your nickname. Click the button right next to your AID to copy it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Next, close the menu, and pay attention to the left side of the screen, there will be several icons in a column. Among them, find and interact with the one with the speaker to open the news menu.
  </li>
  <li>
   When you open the menu, you'll see a list with buttons on the left that have different labels. Among them, find the one that says Coupon Redemption and interact with it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Here, you will see a clickable link with blue text, click on it to go to the menu to redeem the code.
  </li>
  <li>
   Here, you will need to fill in several input fields:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Account ID (AID) field - paste the copied AID here.
    </li>
    <li>
     Redeem Code field - enter manually or copy and paste one of the codes mentioned above.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   When you are done, click the Confirm button below.

 </ul>

  The upcoming remake of the third entry in the series,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater
   </strong>
  </em>
  is shaping up to reignite the iconic Konami franchise with fresh updates to its 20-year-old systems. Being a seemingly faithful recreation of the original game has already earned it praise from excited fans, but one particular design change has been getting more attention recently.
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater
  </em>
  will be featuring two distinct camera perspectives, each with their own effect on difficulty. This might appear to be a simple tweak for convenience, but it might be implemented with enough nuance to dramatically extend replayability.

  Through being tied to allowing players to switch between the fixed Legacy Style and a more modern third-person New Style mode,
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Delta
  </em>
  's difficulty adjustments are set to offer novel challenges when switching between them. As a mechanical shift that transcends a mere quality-of-life improvement, the choice between these two views has the potential to breathe new life into
  <em>
   MGS3

  and beyond for years to come.

  Modifying the Fixed Camera of Metal Gear Solid Has Always Been a Balancing Act
 </h3>
 <p>
  The fixed camera angles of
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  have always been a part of the series’ identity, as the tension provided by the more top-down perspective of the original was core to its gameplay. When the more popular third-person camera was originally added to
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  ’s Subsistence edition, allowing players so much more immediate awareness greatly shifted the balance in favor of the player. The series has continued in this direction since, but the easier difficulty brought on by this kind of convenience has undermined the intended feeling of the series for some.

  MGS Delta’s Opposing Style Options Are Meant to Feel the Same
 </h3>
 <p>
  In an interview with Famitsu translated by VGC, creative producer Yuji Korekado spoke about dealing with the implications of the two camera styles on gameplay:

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":490} -->
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "...if we adjusted it to match the ‘New Style’, the ‘Legacy Style’ would become too difficult, so we decided to split the play style in two. The ‘Legacy Style’ is close to the difficulty level of the original version, and we are adjusting the ‘New Style’ from scratch.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":787} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":true,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":787,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":true,"countRemainingForInjection":113,"nextBlockCount":363,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":true,"nextCount":1150} -->

 <p>
  The changes to the New Style seem to have been made in order to preserve the core experience of the original title while still compromising with the kind of presentation modern audiences are used to. It’s therefore reasonable to expect
  <em>
   Delta
  </em>
  to be more consistently difficult than
  <em>
   Subsistence
  </em>
  , a re-release whose updates could trivialize the game’s challenge.

  How MGS Delta Could Essentially Serve as Two Games in One
 </h3>
 <p>
  By splitting its difficulties between two settings, the
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
  </em>
  remake's camera can offer what feels like two distinct experiences within one package. Legacy Style is set to honor the committal feel of the original title with as faithful of a recreation as it can achieve, but New Style's wider field of view, being balanced out by what will apparently be tougher enemy AI, will serve to keep the feeling of the two in line with each other.

  Future MGS Remakes Should Follow Suit

 <p>
  Assuming that the connection between dual camera angles and difficulty is successful, any remakes that follow
  <em>
   Delta
  </em>
  could also adopt this model to achieve similar longevity of their own. There are few better ways to maintain the soul of a dated original while adapting to current standards, a dynamic that Konami has been struggling with since
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes
  </em>
  . If the attention paid to
  <em>
   Delta
  </em>
  's changes becomes a standard, however, the entire series catalog could find an appealing middle ground between faithful and reimagined.

  Elmenta are a unique enemy type in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </em>
  </strong>
  that drop a bucket load of Reeve (Money) and Magla (MAG) when defeated. Reminiscent of wild Abra from the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, Elmenta deal no damage and have no offensive means. The only thing they will do if given half a chance is flee from battle.

  They're essentially walking bags of money that reward the player for passing a DPS check and smart decision-making. Encountering Elmenta during a playthrough is a rare occurrence, which makes them all the more valuable. Knowing which moves hurt them the most is key to taking them down in a timely manner. Here's how to do it.

  If engaged in direct battle,
  <strong>
   Elmenta will flee as soon as it's their turn to make a move.
  </strong>
  These special enemies do not have any means of attack and can only run away from battle. The only way to ensure an Elmenta does not run away before it is defeated is by stunning them or delaying their turn by any means possible. To stun them,
  <strong>
   attack them in the overworld to drain the yellow bar gauge
  </strong>
  in the overworld
  <strong>
  </strong>
  before engaging them in battle. This will cause the Elmenta to miss their first turn during battle.

  In the early game, the only way to delay the Elmenta's turn is by using the

  Phantasmal Doll can be bought from the magic shop in Grand Trad for 49,000 Reeve. The magic shop, Gloamhall, only opens at night. On higher difficulties, Elmenta, like all other enemies, take less damage from the player, making items like the Phantasmal Doll a necessity for bringing them down.

  Elmenta are rare spawns that can be encountered
  <strong>
   in dungeons or aboard the Gauntlet Runner
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . Each dungeon only has one variety of Elmenta, which depends on the level of the dungeon. Low-level dungeons like the Belega Corridor and Regalith Grand Cathedral spawn Blue Elmenta, mid-level dungeons spawn Red Elmenta, and high-level dungeons spawn Green Elmenta. The type of Elmenta that can be encountered on the Gauntlet Runner depends on the region the player is in.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Enemies periodically respawn inside a dungeon
  </strong>
  after the player leaves the immediate area. This is also true for Elmenta. It is technically possible to farm MAG and Reeve by repeatedly leaving and re-entering a dungeon and hunting for Elmenta.

  Chapter 5 Season 4, brings Halloween to the island with Fortnitemares 2024. This rendition of Fortnitemares may just be the biggest one yet, bringing with it exciting items like the Chainsaw, along with twisting many of the existing locations to fit the spooky season. Following the trend of previous Fortnitemares Events, players can also get their hands on an array of frightening cosmetic rewards.

  To obtain them, players need to hit XP milestones, with the Fortnitemares Quests being the best way to do so. These quests will test the player's skills in Battle Royale, Horde Rush, and even Rocket Racing. While some of these quests have players grabbing items like the Boom Billy and using them in combat, others instead require a bit of exploration. This is the case with the
  <strong>
   “Visit Locations with Ultima Carver Overgrowth”
  </strong>
  quest, which can be wrapped up in just a couple of games.

  To complete this quest, players will need to
  <strong>
   visit a total of three locations with Ultima Carver Overgrowth
  </strong>
  . The most obvious location that players may default to heading to is
  <strong>
   Brawler's Patch
  </strong>
  , formerly known as Brawler's Battleground, which is currently home to the Ultima Carver NPC boss himself. However, there are
  <strong>
   a total of six locations
  </strong>
  that players can head to, offering them quite a bit of freedom in which places they can pick. The locations where players can find Ultima Overgrowth are as follows:

 <p>
  For players looking for a more peaceful and uncontested location, Rebel's Roost and Sandy Steppes are great places to head to. Players can loot at either location beforehand, and then migrate over to the next nearest POI. Luckily,
  <strong>
   players do not necessarily need to visit all three locations within a single game
  </strong>
  . They can either land at each one in separate matches or make a beeline for all three in one game.

  Once players visit any three of these locations, the quest will be complete. For their efforts, players will be
  <strong>
   rewarded with 20,000 XP
  </strong>
  , along with also being a step closer to unlocking Fortnitemares rewards like the Horde's War Wheel Back Bling, the Fiendish Wand Pickaxe, and The Great Scarecrow Glider.

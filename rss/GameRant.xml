      David Soliani departed Ubisoft after 25 years, leaving behind the successful Mario + Rabbids series he helped create.
     </li>

      Despite initial skepticism, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle became a hit, winning accolades and becoming one of the top-rated Mario games.

      The latest installment, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, faced sales challenges but ultimately sold 3 million copies by January 2024.

 <p>
  Veteran game developer Davide Soliani, the creative director of the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario + Rabbid
   </strong>
  </em>
  games, has parted ways with Ubisoft after working with the company for more than 25 years. The series' latest game,
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope
  </em>
  , was released for the Switch in late 2022.

 <p>
  A unique crossover between clashing Nintendo and Ubisoft franchises, the first
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids
  </em>
  game, 2017's
  <em>
   Kingdom Battle
  </em>
  , was the brainchild of Ubisoft Milan creative director Davide Soliani and Ubisoft brand producer Xavier Manzanares. While the project was initially met with some negativity,
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle
  </em>
  bagged accolades from the likes of The Game Awards, and it is now one of the highest-rated
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games on the Switch.
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids
  </em>
  continued to find some success with
  <em>
   Sparks of Hope
  </em>
  , but the series will now have to enter uncharted waters following the recent departure of its longtime franchise head.

  In a post on Twitter, Soliani explained that he left Ubisoft to embark on a new adventure, but the
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids
  </em>
  creator noted that he could not disclose more information regarding his plans moving forward. Both Soliani and Ubisoft Milan still wish to make gamers have fun, scream with delight, and dream, the studio said in a series of posts.

  Soliani stayed at Ubisoft for 25 years, 11 of which were spent on the
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids
  </em>
  series. He was known by many in the gaming community for being the face of a heartwarming moment at E3 2017 that involved the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto. The memorable scene spawned the Don't Cry Ubisoft Man meme, which Soliani and the Ubisoft Milan team often joked about, the studio revealed.

 <p>
  Prior to leaving Ubisoft, Soliani worked on the third and final DLC for
  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope
  </em>
  that was released last August,
  <em>
   Rayman in the Phantom Show
  </em>
  . The expansion prominently features the titular protagonist of Ubisoft's
  <em>
   Rayman
  </em>
  series, and the
  <em>
   Sparks of Hope
  </em>
  DLC hides a secret message that only players who fully complete it can read, Soliani said.

  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope
  </em>
  was one of the best-selling retail games in Japan at the time of its launch, but Ubisoft claimed at the start of 2023 that the title underperformed in terms of sales. The sequel has managed to mount a comeback, with
  <em>
   Sparks of Hope
  </em>
  having sold 3 million copies as of January 2024, according to reports. In comparison, series producer Cristina Nava claimed in the past that the first
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario + Rabbids
   </strong>
  </em>
  game attracted more than 10 million players.

  It's been confirmed that the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shadows of the Damned
   </em>
  </strong>
  remaster, aka
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered
  </em>
  , is launching for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X on October 31. The original
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  was released in 2011. Developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by EA, the game was unfortunately not a commercial success.

 <p>
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  reviews were strong, but the game struggled commercially. Even so, the game developed a dedicated fanbase who point to it as one of the better third-person shooter games of the PS3 and Xbox 360 era. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  was delisted a few years back, making it very difficult for those interested in playing it to experience the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  -inspired shooter game.

  Luckily,
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned

  is getting remastered, and now we know exactly when the new version of the game will be available. As announced in a new trailer,
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered
  </em>
  is launching on October 31, aka Halloween. The trailer doesn't really highlight what's new in the remastered version of the game, but we know from previous announcements that it includes new costumes and a New Game Plus mode. Fans can also expect improved visuals and performance thanks to the beefier hardware it's releasing on.

  While the
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered
  </em>
  release date trailer doesn't focus much on what's new in the remaster, it does take the time to spotlight the various creative minds behind the game. Suda51 is mentioned, as is Shinji Mikami and various other people that worked on the game. For those that have never played
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  , knowing the creative minds behind the game could be a selling point. Suda51 is known for making all kinds of bizarre and experimental games, while Shinji Mikami is the creator of the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise, and in fact, directed
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  's greatest inspiration.

 <p>
  For those unfamiliar with the game,
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  is an over-the-top third-person shooter about demon hunter Garcia Hotspur exploring hellish lands in search of his kidnapped girlfriend. Hotspur comes equipped with his talking gun/motorcycle Johnson, which comes in handy when fighting the seemingly endless wave of monsters that Hotspur encounters on his adventure. The game was noted for its story and sense of humor, not to mention its unique enemy designs. Here's hoping this new version of
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  will be able to find a greater audience than the original release did.

  It’s been just over a year since
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon Forbidden West
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s Burning Shores DLC expansion was released and details on
  <em>
   Horizon 3
  </em>
  are still sparse. While Burning Shores suggests that Aloy may travel eastward into the remnants of mainland United States to look for 21st-century-era weapons to destroy Nemesis, the exact plotline and setting of
  <em>
   Horizon 3
  </em>
  remains unknown.

 <p>
  Despite these possible leads, Aloy is likely to encounter new tribes in the next mainline
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  game. With these new tribes, fans may have to begrudgingly repeat story beats from both
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Zero Dawn
  </em>
  . Story beats that relate to the ever-useful, augmented reality device, the Focus.

 <p>
  The small, triangle-shaped Focus was first introduced in
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  when Aloy discovered one as a young girl in an ancient ruin. With a Focus, people can communicate from far distances and display videos, maps, or digital objects via holograms. In a sense, Focuses are smart devices allowing people to access troves of data. However, players often use the Focus to scan and analyze various machines to learn about their functions, strengths, and weaknesses in order to effectively take them down. Focuses can further be used to track machines’ routine paths and unknown audio sources.

  In terms of the Focus’ in-universe lore, the Focus was developed by the 21st century tech company Faro Automated Solutions, the company owned by Ted Faro and the same company that would go on to cause the Faro Plague that destroyed all life on Earth. While the Focus was a common civilian device in the 21st century, the Focus is now an uncommon device found among the post-apocalyptic tribes 1,000 years later. This was due to the informational APOLLO subroutine of the GAIA AI being deleted by Faro so as to prevent the devastating mistakes humanity made from happening again. Originally, APOLLO was designed to give newly birthed humans Focuses to help develop the new world.

  Focus-Use Among Tribes

  Oftentimes, the Focus would only be utilized by ruin scavengers who found them. However, some tribes discovered hidden troves of Focus devices which helped them develop their societies further than others. This was the case with the far western Quen Empire who accessed larger, older, less efficient versions of the Focus that were more akin to a headset. Sylens additionally repaired several Focuses for the Carja rebel faction, the Eclipse, though these would later be neutralized by Aloy in
  <em>
   Horizon: Zero Dawn
  </em>
  .

  If players have the Burning Shores DLC installed, a datapoint labeled "Aloy This is For You" can be found. It details how Erend is heading back to the Claim and Meridian to recruit and prepare people for the eventual fight with the Nemesis AI. Here, Erend mentions that he gathered a bunch of Focuses and plans on giving them to old friends and potential new allies in order to better comprehend the fight ahead of them. If parts of
  <em>
   Horizon 3
  </em>
  take place in the Claim or Meridian, it may have Aloy teach new or old characters such as Sun-King Avad, Vanasha, and Teb to use the Focus and prepare nearby tribes for attack.

 <p>
  New tribes and companions will likely be encountered in
  <em>
   Horizon 3
  </em>
  , probably causing players to teach new companions how to use the Focus just as Aloy did with Erend, Kotallo, and Zo in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon Forbidden West
   </em>
  </strong>
  . If there are 21st-century war facilities still relatively intact eastward, some tribes may reside in them but be unable to access their weapons without the use of a Focus. This could be a way Aloy earns these tribes’ respect and loyalty, especially if they perceive Aloy as a Living Ancestor just as the Quen did. While teaching old and new followers how to use a Focus may be repetitive, it may serve as a critical turning point in combating Nemesis.

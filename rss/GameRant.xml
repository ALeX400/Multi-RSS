  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise doesn't need much to coerce gamers into buying new entries in the massive
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros.
  </em>
  series. However, Nintendo is also unafraid to try something new to entice even more people, utilizing different gimmicks to attract players and help the game stand out in the franchise's long history.

 <p>
  Gimmicks can come in many forms, from a certain gameplay mechanic being a vital component to simply how the game looks and sounds. These things can drastically change how a person perceives a game and, in a number of cases, help elevate the Mario games to cement their place in the series.

  Since the beginning, collecting coins has been a satisfying thing to do in Mario games, playing to the inherent but innocent greed that all humans have. That's where
  <em>
   <strong>
    New Super Mario Bros. 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  shined on the Nintendo 3DS, utilizing the sound effects and the visual of the coin counter rising as the player collects dozens and sometimes hundreds of coins every level.

 <p>
  From the golden color scheme to power-ups that reward players with even more coins, New Super Mario Bros. 2 is all about the coins while providing a fun adventure. It was considered charming gaming that did more innovation for the New Super Mario Bros. series of games than any other, becoming a cherished Mario sequel that many feel deserves a remaster on the Switch.

  Before remasters and remakes were commonplace, Nintendo was ahead of its time when they took four Mario games on the N.E.S. and remade them on the S.N.E.S. in the form of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario Bros. All-Stars
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Not only did the games look prettier, but even the music was given a 16-bit enhancement without removing what fans loved about the games.

  Over the years,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario Sunshine
   </em>
  </strong>
  has become infamous for being a divisive game on the Nintendo GameCube. It was due to the introduction of the F.L.U.D.D., a backpack invented by Professor E. Gadd, who made Luigi's ghostbusting Poltergust pack from the
  <em>
   Luigi's Mansion
  </em>
  games. It allows Mario to fight the caustic ink plaguing Isle Delfino and have new traversal abilities.

 <p>
  As a result of the F.L.U.D.D., some appreciated that Nintendo embraced the gimmick so heavily in
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  , while others felt that it was invasive to the Mario experience. However, that doesn't stop it from creating a unique Mario adventure, allowing Mario to shoot water, hover, spin jump, and more using the F.L.U.D.D., for better or worse.

  Most sequels would only introduce one new playable character, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario Bros. 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  went above that and introduced two with Toad and Peach. This was the game that cemented that Princess Peach could float, Toad was a fast character, and its version of Luigi was able to jump higher than anybody else.

 <p>
  Unlike in the first game where Luigi was only for the second player,
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. 2
  </em>
  allows gamers to pick any of the four characters at the beginning of every stage. It was a way to experiment and see which character could work for the entire game or perhaps better for certain levels. This concept would later return in S
  <em>
   uper Mario 3D World
  </em>
  .

  Most people love to see heroes getting a cute pet sidekick and that was the case when
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario World
   </em>
  </strong>
  introduced the lovable dinosaur named Yoshi. In the jump to the S.N.E.S., not only could the player choose between Mario and Luigi at any time, but they could ride Yoshi, who could run fast, eat enemies, and jump to high areas to help the brothers progress.

 <p>
  Yoshi became the selling point of
  <em>
   Super Mario World
  </em>
  , from being featured in all advertisements to being in the official box art. Fans loved the character so much that the Yoshis became a crucial part of Mario lore, later being revealed to be the loving creatures that saved Mario and Luigi when they were infants.

  With
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  being a revolutionary title that is still loved over twenty years later, the 2005 remake on the Nintendo DS could have been a 1:1 port and most would have appreciated it. However,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario 64 DS
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a total remake that adds new levels to enjoy as four characters instead of one.

 <p>
  Mario is present, but he, Luigi, and Wario are captured at first. Yoshi is the first playable character and the others have to be unlocked, each with a unique ability they bring to the traversal. This gimmick of four characters led to
  <em>
   Super Mario 64 DS
  </em>
  becoming a bestseller for the handheld console.

  While Mario is more known for being a sidescroller, the 3D games are just as beloved and that is all thanks to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario 64
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It not only revolutionized Mario games but laid the foundation for 3D platformers in general that populated the late 90s and early 2000s.

 <p>
  In 1996, it was considered to be mind-blowing to move freely in a 3D environment like Peach's castle in
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  . That was just the beginning, because inside the castle walls was just the hub to access a plethora of other 3D levels, utilizing more traversal mechanics that seem basic today, but back then on the Nintendo 64, it was unlike anything else, and it changed Mario games forever.

  When
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario Odyssey
   </strong>
  </em>
  introduced the sentient hat known as Cappy, some were concerned it would be another F.L.U.D.D. situation, but that was not the case. Instead of removing anything from Mario, Cappy simply adds to Mario, being more of an extension of what fans already enjoyed about 3D Mario controls.

 <p>
  Cappy allowed Mario to extend his jumps, acting as another spring-like platform, and it gave Mario the power to possess any enemy or movable object in the massive worlds. These not only allowed for new ways of solving puzzles to gather the new moon collectibles but also allowed players to experiment with new kinds of combat and traversal, unlike Mario in nearly every way.

  A common complaint in recent years was that Mario games have become stagnant in terms of their visuals, with characters and enemies looking the same in nearly every game.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario Bros. Wonder
   </strong>
  </em>
  feels like a direct response to that, as it not only introduced a new voice for Mario and Luigi, but everything got a new art style that is far more expressive and full of personality.

 <p>
  The new Flower Kingdom and all its different regions are visually distinct, playing on familiar tropes while still having their twist on them. With many familiar Mario universe characters to play as,
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  also introduces a badge system that allows any character to have any single ability of the player's choice, adding more customization than ever before.

  Many expected the

   <em>
    Bowser's Fury

  </strong>
  campaign to be nothing but a mod of the
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World

  On top of the open world aspect,
  <em>
   Bowser's Fury
  </em>
  earns its title thanks to its unique NPC mechanic of having Bowser transformed into a giant monster that drops from the sky sporadically to attack Mario for a few minutes. Fury Bowser not only adds tension, but certain things can only be done while he is attacking, making for puzzling situations and forcing proper timing for certain Cat Shines.

  Nintendo could have easily just tried ripping off

  or some other sci-fi franchise and put Mario at the center, but
  <strong>
   <em>

  is known for being an imaginative entry on the Nintendo Wii. It mixes so much fantasy with sci-fi, creating so much wonder and spectacle to keep the player engaged with beautiful visuals, new characters like Rosalina, and a heartwarming musical score.

  The cosmic theme of
  <em>
   Super Mario Galaxy

  also affects the gameplay, with Mario running around alien planets and getting new gravity-based traversal puzzles. Fans loved
  <em>

  y so much that it is one of the few times a Mario game got a direct sequel in the same style, with
  <em>

 <p>
  A live service battle royale game based on developer Rebellion Developments'
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sniper Elite
   </em>
  </strong>
  series has reportedly been canceled. The game was originally announced in August 2024 as a multiplayer-focused spin-off of the
  <em>
   Sniper Elite
  </em>
  titles.

 <p>
  Once regarded as a lower-budget "copycat" series that latched onto the trend of World War 2-based games,
  <em>
   Sniper Elite
  </em>
  first debuted in 2005, telling the fictionalized story of an American sniper operating behind Nazi lines. Later
  <em>
   Sniper Elite
  </em>
  titles visited other theaters of the war and adopted additional mechanics to critical and popular acclaim and cementing the franchise's place in the upper tiers of the best stealth shooter games. The
  <em>
   Sniper Elite
  </em>
  series also became famous for its particular focus on sniping, with the implementation of gruesome "X-ray" kills that show bullets entering the heads, torsos, limbs, and even private parts of enemies, depending on where the player aims. The series has even managed its own horror-based spin-off in the form of the
  <em>
   Zombie Army
  </em>
  games, pitting expert marksmen against undead hordes.

  Unfortunately for Rebellion, its plan to expand the series into the persistent multiplayer space with a game codenamed "Project Archipelago" appears to have been canceled. According to a report by Insider Gaming, Project Archipelago is no longer moving forward, despite its announcement being less than four months old. The game was also known as "Sniper Island" and intended to be a multiplayer
  <em>
   Sniper Elite
  </em>
  Battle Royale title pitting teams of players against each other.

 <p>
  According to the report, the reason behind the cancelation of Project Archipelago isn't related to development troubles, but rather to a loss of funding from Tencent, which was bankrolling the project. In meetings, Rebellion staff implied that the fate of
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  , the Sony-published multiplayer hero shooter, influenced Tencent's decision to pull funding from Project Archipelago.
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  was a major project for PlayStation Studios, but was considered a failure soon after it debuted. The game was shut down less than two weeks after launching, and its developer, Firewalk Studios, was shuttered at the end of October 2024.

 <p>
  While the apparent loss of Project Archipelago is unfortunate, it does not appear to have affected current staff at Rebellion Developments. The studio has other titles in development, including the next mainline single-player title in the
  <em>
   Sniper Elite
  </em>
  series.
  <em>
   Sniper Elite: Resistance
  </em>
  launches in January 2025 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles and PC, and promises to take the series to France in World War 2, starring a new protagonist that works with the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation.

 <p>
  Across JRPGs of all subgenres, whether high fantasy epics or urban fantasy adventures, the party is what defines how memorable the central cast of characters is. If players don't feel attached to the people or creatures they're utilizing in battle, then there won't be any connection or spark in the story, and things will fall very flat, very fast. Leveling up these characters is the core component of many games, where part of the appeal is discovering what skills they have available to utilize.
 </p>

 <p>
  But an issue that certain JRPGs run into when a player gets comfortable with a certain party of characters is that other characters will often be left to the wayside. Oftentimes, especially in hard boss battles, having a full host of characters that are leveled up and ready to fight is vital, and it can be time-consuming training and grinding every character individually to a high level. These JRPGs work around that with interesting EXP share systems that keep the whole party relatively even in power. Rankings in this list are determined by how effectively and efficiently experience is shared among party members, and then other QoL or novelty factors to break ties among games that share experience in a similar way.

  The iconic
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  was the game that helped define what the series is today, beyond a mere spin-off of the long-standing
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  series. The game stands today as the first slightly rough but all-around loved title in the great trilogy of 'modern'
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games, and this was in no small part due to the slick and stylish combat that helped make the series stand out from its contemporaries and origins.

 <p>
  Experience is shared across all party members evenly regardless of contribution to the fight. This means a tactic for leveling up lower-level characters is to have them fight in smaller groups, so the experience is parceled out in larger chunks. The system can remain obscure, however, as sometimes hidden factors or things like level disparity will make a character gain or lose a percentage of that XP after it's been divided among the party.

  <em>
   Legend of Dragoon
  </em>
  is a fantastic title that has a mature story, similar in terms of its aesthetic and themes to later
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  titles and builds upon this story with some top-notch JRPG combat. The combination of party members and how they synergize together is vital to pulling off powerful combos and maximizing the player's damage output.

 <p>
  Exp is shared among party members in an efficient and fair way. Active party members receive exp, rostered party members receive half that amount, and knocked-out party members receive none. This way, the party still continues to grow with Dart and whoever is on the front lines, but players who have favorite characters are still able to watch them grow faster.

 <p>
  One of the more major changes that has come with newer Pokemon titles like
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  is the baked-in experience share that automatically rewards creatures in the party with diminished xp compared to the Pokemon that landed the final blow, similar to other entries on this list. Many players prefer the challenge of older titles, where experience could be shared with one, or at most two Pokemon not engaged in battle.

 <p>
  <em>
   X and Y
  </em>
  found a middle ground between the two, as the experience share is now a key item that can be toggled on or off at will, providing experience to all the party or, for those looking for a challenge, none of the party besides those who actively engaged in battle.

 <p>
  One thing that many players will note about
  <em>
   Three Houses
  </em>
  - especially those new to the series or SRPG genre, is that experience is hard to come by. It's not simply given out in a lump after battles but has to be earned individually by characters.

 <p>
  Assigning an adjutant to characters means a student not actively in the battle takes on a support role for the active character, increasing their utility while also getting a percentage of the experience. This is an incredibly novel and interesting way to share experience.

  Among one of the hardest
  <em>

  </em>
  titles available to date,
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei Vengeance
  </em>
  does not hold players' hands, and people will be looking to maximize the experience that their demons are getting. Luckily, this title has an incredibly intuitive system for sharing experience. Rostered demons get diminished experience compared to demons who saw battle, which is standard fare among this list's entries.

 <p>
  However, there are miracles that can be taken that enhance the default percentage of experience gained by demons on the roster - and players who put time into acquiring these miracles are rewarded with a more cohesive party.

  . While

  reaches a broader audience, it remains one of the most brutal settings in sci-fi history. The Imperium of Mankind spans the galaxy, on over a million worlds. The trillions of humans living under the Imperium exist in the most oppressive and draconian society imaginable.

  Most Imperial citizens live tedious, harsh lives filled with backbreaking work, with little hope for improvement or advancement. However, in the 41st millennium, some fates are even worse. The Imperium has some truly horrific punishments waiting for heretics or malcontents, while the xenos races or followers of Chaos seek to corrupt, maim, or worse.

  In
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  , for humanity, the Imperium’s rule is absolute. A million worlds, containing trillions of people, all working for the continued existence of the Imperium and the God-Emperor. While some worlds enjoy more freedom than others, all must pay their imperial tithes. In a galaxy where human life is considered disposable, this payment often comes in the form of people.

  For those who exhibit psyker abilities, the Black Ships are inevitably their fate. If a Psyker shows great potential, they are then trained to become Sanctioned Psykers and will be put to work for the Imperium, living short, violent lives that often end horrifically. However, for many people who have only a little warp ability, their fates are far shorter. From the Black Ships, these people will be herded back to Terra and taken to the Imperial Palace. Here, in one horrific moment, their bodies and souls will be sacrificed to the Emperor. A thousand people each day are taken for this purpose, so the Emperor may live another day to maintain the astronomican.

  Long before the Emperor unified Terra and founded the Imperium of Man, humanity developed to a technological peak known as the Golden Age. This pinnacle of human achievement would come crashing down when the artificial beings, known as Men of Iron, started a devastating war against their human creators.

 <p>
  Because of this war, AI is strictly outlawed in the modern
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  setting. This has led to gruesome advances in human augmentation. For those who have fallen to the very bottom of society or have failed in their duties, their bodies and minds can be repurposed and turned into servitors. Augmented with robotics and lobotomized, these lost souls are a large part of the Imperium’s workforce. These former people are now simply tools used for manual labor around the vast dystopian future that is
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  .

  Lucius the Eternal is one of the most renowned and feared Chaos Space Marines in the galaxy. A member of the Emperor’s Children, Lucius was obsessed with becoming the greatest swordsman ever to live. As the legion descended into decadence and depravity, Lucius followed. He would ritually scar himself upon victory, transforming his body into a labyrinth of pain.

 <p>
  While he was considered one of the greatest duelists, he would eventually lose to Commander Cyrius. However, this would not be the end, as Lucius was a champion of Slaanesh. The Chaos god would bestow a terrible curse on anyone who found pride in victory over Lucius. Commander Cyrius was the first, as his body developed scars, his hair fell out, and his skin grew paler. Eventually, Lucius the Eternal fully emerged, with the face of Commander Cyrius left screaming upon Lucius’s armor.

  The Warp is a dimension outside normal space where all living energies flow. It is filled with daemonic entities, shifting currents, and violent warp storms. The Gods of Chaos live in the warp. It’s where their power is the greatest, and their Realms of Chaos can be found. For humanity, the warp is a necessary evil. Traveling through the Warp shortens the spaces between the stars and allows the Imperium to function on a galactic level.

 <p>
  To protect spaceships from the dangers of the Warp, ships are fitted with Gellar Fields. However, as with all technology, these can fail. When this happens, the people onboard are exposed to the full power of the warp. This leaves them open, at best, to madness or death and, at worst, to daemonic possession or extreme mutation.

  The ruling religion for humanity, the Ecclesiarchy, is one of the most powerful and influential factions within the Imperium. The zealotry of the God-Emperor’s faithful is praised as it is feared. For heretics who seek redemption or those who have failed in their duties and gotten people killed, the severe punishment is the Penitent Engine.

  These large walking death machines are commonly used by the sisters of the Adepta Sororitas as heavy infantry when waging war. The condemned are hard-wired into the machine using neural connections and powerful chemicals implanted in their brains and spines. They’re placed into a constant frenzy, spurred on by the need to find forgiveness. Exposed for the world to see the Penitents march into war in an attempt to find death. These sorry souls are a living reminder to all to stay on the righteous path of the Emperor.

  Of all Nurgle’s numerous creations, his greatest disease is Nurgle’s Rot. This most virulent of afflictions is a scourge on the galaxy and can spread through populations extremely quickly. While the Chaos God of Decay spends many hours brewing his various infections, none is more feared than The Rot. The disease is essentially incurable, as its victims exhibit countless symptoms that affect not only the body but the soul.

  Nurgle’s Rot is an unnatural disease infused with warp energy. Those infected do not die quickly but suffer as their bodies become bloated, rotting carcasses that eventually sprout horns and a single eye. Their body and soul transform from a once mortal human to one of Nurgle’s foot soldiers, a Plaguebearer. These monsters are mindless drones who have fully embraced Nurgle’s gift and are now eternal slaves to his will.

  During the Fall, when the Chaos God, Slaanesh, came into existence, the ancient Aeldari empire was destroyed. However, the Drukhari were saved from oblivion due to their location in the Webway, in the dark city of Commorragh. However, they did not fully escape Slaanesh. To save themselves from She Who Thirsts, the Drukhari must feed their souls with pain and suffering.

 <p>
  The Drukhari are not a warlike race; they do not care for empire or land. Their society is built on pain. To be taken by the Drukhari is a fate worse than death. After thousands of years, they have become adept at prolonging pain. The malicious Haemonculi may even keep their victims alive indefinitely, subjecting them to all manner of unimaginable experiments. Dying quickly is a luxury in Commorragh that few victims get to experience.

  Few fates in
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  achieve the horror of the Daemonculaba. This sadistic and morbid project was created by the Iron Warriors legion after they stole uncorrupted gene seed from the Imperial Fists. The goal was to create new Chaos Marines for the heretic legion.

  The Iron Warriors took captured women and turned them into mutated human incubators. A young male would then be placed into the womb to transform into a Chaos Marine. These young men would emerge from the tortured women alive but without any skin. However, some would also be mutated by the process and be cast aside. The males who survived the process unaltered were given new skin from the flayed bodies of slaves. They would then join the ranks of the Iron Warriors in the ongoing war against the Imperium. The Daemonculaba project was eventually destroyed by the Ultramarine Captain Uriel Ventris.

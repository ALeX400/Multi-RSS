  To progress through
  <strong>
   <em>
    Enotria: The Last Song
   </em>
  </strong>
  story without any bosses or enemies giving you trouble, you have to understand the game’s Elements and Status Effect. There are four different Elements with each one of them having an advantage over the other, creating balanced combat mechanics.

  Not only that, but Elements apply debuffs on enemies, which further helps clear their areas faster. They’re not only debuffs as each Status Effect offers a negative and a positive effect.

 <h3 id="dizzy">
  Dizzy
 </h3>
 <p>
  You trigger Dizzy on enemies when you hit them with weapons infused with Vis. While it increases their damage, it also notably reduces their defense, which opens a window to deal as much damage as possible. You can also trigger Dizzy on yourself by using a specific Item. During that time,
  <strong>
   you also have your damage increased alongside your Stamina regenerating much faster
  </strong>
  . On the other hand, you also
  <strong>
   suffer from the defense reduction
  </strong>
  that comes with the Dizzy Effects Status in
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  .

 <h3 id="wicked">
  Wicked
 </h3>
 <p>
  You trigger Wicked on enemies when your attacks and thrown items deal Fatuo damage. During that state, enemies’ Elemental damage is enhanced. However,
  <strong>
   your hits also heal you
  </strong>
  , which creates a situation where aggressiveness is more favorable. If you’re looking to maximize your Elemental damage, then use an item that inflicts Wicked on your character. This method is super effective as long the enemy is not hitting you, or they’ll also regain HP and that will make them harder to take down.

 <h3 id="radiant">
  Radiant
 </h3>
 <p>
  You trigger Radiant on enemies when you hit them with items and weapons infused with Gratia. When you trigger Radiant, enemies start recovering HP over time. However, once you land a hit on them, they’ll explode and cause massive damage. If you’re near the explosion, it will knock you back from the impact. You can also trigger Radiant on yourself,
  <strong>
   which will also heal you over time
  </strong>
  . But, as not everything is perfect,
  <strong>
   once you get hit, you’ll trigger an explosion
  </strong>
  that will hurt you and any enemy around you.

 <h3 id="sick">
  Sick
 </h3>
 <p>
  You trigger Sick when you keep hitting enemies with items and weapons infused with Malanno. During the duration when enemies are Sick, they constantly lose HP like Poison in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Triggering Sick on your character turns them into a walking killing machine.
  <strong>
   Your character will start dealing damage over time to any enemy close to them
  </strong>
  .

  Within the early days of the
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5
  </strong>
  , there has been a lot of talk about the variety of features it has and what it lacks. Notably, one of the biggest complaints coming out of the gate from PlayStation fans is the lack of viable storage options provided to players thus far.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The system has about 825 gigabytes available on its SSD. Of course, this doesn't mean that players will have all 825 GB to use. Players will only have a maximum of 667 GB available to them and must buy a compatible NVMe SSD hard drive if they want more space. This isn't possible for everyone, so it's important to look at the
  <strong>
   biggest file sizes for PS5 games
  </strong>
  to see what players should prioritize.

    Updated September 15, 2024, by Gerardo Molina:
   </strong>
   While new solutions for the ongoing PlayStation 5 storage problem have become available over the years since it was released, others have unfortunately arisen. Most additional storage methods for the PlayStation 5 are still very expensive, and even if players manage to afford them, installing them can be challenging and might endanger the console's warranty if things aren't done correctly. That, combined with the fact that games are getting increasingly larger in file size, makes for a complicated situation for both Sony and PS5 owners.

   <em>
    Horizon Forbidden West

  </strong>
  is the much-awaited sequel to Aloy's first adventure. Just like its predecessor, it came out around the worst time possible when another genre-defining game was making its debut.

  Still,
  <em>
   Forbidden West
  </em>
  is a fun game to get into, even if the title itself isn't all that innovative. It's clear to see why this game requires close to 100 GB of free space on the PS5, with its amazing graphics and high-quality textures needing this much space to shine on the hardware.

  When it comes to

That said, its whopping 105 GB still represents 15% of the console's total usable storage capacity (667.2 GB), meaning that players can only install another five games of a similar size without a memory expansion solution, which is very inconvenient.

  In terms of
  <strong>
   PS5 game sizes
  </strong>
  , there is always an iterative sports title that makes the list as these tend to be packed with content. One of the biggest sports titles on the PS5 right now, purely by file size, is
  <strong>
   <em>
    F1 2021
   </em>

  Bungie was recently acquired by Sony to work on multiplayer games on multiple platforms, but before that point, they have been working on and continuing to release expansions for their multiplayer looter shooter

  The MMO offers three classes for players to choose from as they serve as heroes defending the Last City. Along with many cooperative and competitive modes,
  <em>
   Destiny 2's
  </em>
  many expansions have given players hours of content to continue the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  storyline. It is likely this reason why the game is sitting at 139.8 GB on PS5.

  Speaking of open-world games, no company has embraced the genre harder than Ubisoft has. One of the biggest open-worlds the company has ever published comes in the latest entry of their biggest franchise:
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Valhalla
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The game takes place in the 870s. Players take control of Eivor, a Viking who is setting up their England and who becomes involved in the rivalry between the Templar Order and the Assassin Brotherhood.
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Valhalla
  </em>
  has a massive world with plenty of activities to take part in, which may be why the game needs 140.4 GB to install and enjoy.

  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order

  was an excellent game that players could enjoy quite a bit once they looked past its many bugs at launch. The sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Jedi: Survivor
   </em>
  </strong>
  , ran poorly on PCs, but the console versions were relatively stable at the time of release.

 <p>
  The game takes up a lot of space but justifies this by showing just how much of a step up the title is from a visual standpoint.
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor

  's legacy may be tarnished because of a horrid PC port, but players invested in Cal Kestis' journey will love the story's continuation and its fun action set-pieces.

  While not living up to the level that many players thought the game was going to be,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </strong>
  </em>
  did deliver a large world that takes up plenty of space on the PS5 drive at 159.6 GB. The latest game from CD Projekt Red,
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  takes place in a futuristic civilization set in the universe inspired by the tabletop role-playing game of a similar name.

  The game is yet another open world as there are various regions for the player to explore. While there is a main quest to focus on, there are various side activities that help keep the game interesting as well. Players can choose from a variety of different roles and approaches that can help tailor their experience to something unique to them.

  Considering it is a genre that is meant to hook players for a ridiculous amount of hours, it is unsurprising that an MMORPG would be on a list of PS5 game sizes. What is surprising is that only one of these games made the list, which is
  <em>

  </em>
  .

  Initially released in 2014, this spin-off entry of a beloved Bethesda property puts players on the continent of Tamriel. It lets them experience storylines that have some ties to the worlds and characters that they interacted with in previous entries of the series. As of the time of this writing,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  sits at 168 GB, but this will change with future updates.

  <em>
   Marvel's Avengers

  is an action-adventure game that has a central campaign that can be played with more than one player. However, the content that has been added over the years included story expansions for Kate Bishop, Black Panther, Spider-Man, and more. Future updates may still be coming for those who own the game, so it's good to have more space available.

  There have only been a handful of completely new games released by PlayStation Studios since the launch of the new console, but only
  <strong>
   <em>
    Gran Turismo 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  makes the biggest PS5 game file size list. Once again developed by Polyphony Digital, the newest entry in the classic racing franchise brings a next-generation take on its celebration of vehicles.

  <em>

  brings back many of the features that made its previous entries so enticing, but it also includes a lot of upgrades such as ray-tracing and DualSense support that take advantage of the controller's technology. Those who want to dive into the game will need to have 196.8 GB free on their storage space.

  This is likely due to the number of game modes the installment has, as well as taking into account the game's upgraded graphics. The game currently clocks in at a whopping 312.6 GB minimum, which makes this the biggest game on PS5, even after many games have been released since then.

  As per a new leak, the popular Hacienda map from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 4
  </em>
  could be featured in the upcoming Avalon map for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Warzone
   </strong>
  </em>
  . So far, the developers have not revealed when Avalon will be coming to
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  or even confirmed its existence, but the assets found by the community over the past few months strongly suggest that it is in development.

  In a new tweet,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  leaker Realityuk_ revealed that a fan-favorite map could be coming to
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  . The tweet features an alleged overhead view of the Avalon map in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  and showcases the Hacienda estate from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 4
  </em>
  . The media in the tweet has been taken down due to a copyright strike, consolidating the leak's credibility. That being said, players can find the leaked screenshot over on the CoDCompetitive subreddit.

  Fans are already quite excited about the return of the map, with many even stating that they would get back to
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  to experience the iconic
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 4
  </em>
  map. Some are even requesting for more maps to be added, with the likes of Frequency, Firing Range, and Fringe being some of the popular choices. However, it is crucial to note that from the looks of the picture, the map still appears quite incomplete, so it is quite possible that the rumored late 2025 release date for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone's
  </em>
  Avalon map might not be that reliable after all.

  Some fans are still quite skeptical about whether Hacienda will actually make a return, but in fact, it doesn't seem quite far-fetched. This is because leakers had previously suggested that Hacienda will be making a comeback in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  itself as a remastered map alongside some more popular maps like Dig, WMD, Yemen, and others. For now,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  fans are awaiting the return of Verdansk which is confirmed to be returning in Spring 2025.

  Automated Wiring is one of the required Project Assembly parts that players must craft to complete Phase 2 of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Satisfactory
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Things get tricky, however, once you realize that, similar to Smart Plating, Automated Wiring can't be crafted manually. Instead, you'll need to set up a fully automated system in the Assembler to get your hands on this essential resource.

  Automated Wiring can
  <strong>
   only be crafted by the Assembler
  </strong>
  . That means Pioneers won't be able to craft it manually on the workbench. Instead, they must build an automated manufacturing system via the Assembler to get their hands on it. The recipe to craft Automated Wiring is unlocked once pioneers reach Tier 4 Milestone 3, called
  <strong>
   Basic Steel Production
  </strong>
  .

  You'll need three key resources to craft Automated Wiring:
  <strong>
   Iron Ore
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Copper Ore
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Coal
  </strong>
  . Copper Ore is used to produce Wire, which is the only ingredient that you’ll need to craft
  <strong>
   Cable
  </strong>
  . Iron Ore and Coal can be turned into
  <strong>
   Steel Ingot
  </strong>
  , which is used to make
  <strong>
   Steel Pipe
  </strong>
  . You'll then have to feed it into an Assembler along with
  <strong>
   Wire
  </strong>
  to make a
  <strong>
   Stator
  </strong>
  .

  There are plenty of ways you can set up an efficient Automated Wiring production system in

 <ul>
  <li>
   Place three storage containers and fill them up with Iron Ore, Copper Ore, and Coal.
  </li>
  <li>
   Build a Smelter and connect it to the Storage Container with Copper Ore using a Conveyor Belt. Set the Smelter to produce Copper Ingots.
  </li>
  <li>
   Build a Constructor in front of the Smelter, connect the two buildings using a belt, and feed the Copper Ingots into the Smelter to craft Wire.
  </li>
  <li>
   From the Constructor, build a belt and attach it to a Conveyor Splitter. From one end of the Splitter, build another belt and feed it into a second Constructor. Set the second Constructor to produce Cable.
  </li>
  <li>
   Send the Cable to one of the Assembler's input ports. Now, you need to ensure the supply of Stators.
  </li>
  <li>
   Build a Foundry and supply it with Iron Ore and Coal from your Storage Container to craft Steel Ingots.
  </li>
  <li>
   Send the Steel Ingots to a Constructor and select the Steel Pipe recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
   Build a secondary Assembler and send the Steel Pipe to one end of the Assembler.
  </li>
  <li>
   Send the wires from the Conveyor Splitter you built earlier to the second Assembler. It now has the resources to craft Stators.
  </li>
  <li>
   Send the Stators to the final Assembler in the chain and set it to craft Automated Wiring.

    Fields of Mistria

  is an incredible spiritual successor to the farming simulator RPGs that were released in the late 90s, with this early access game already hooking players with its adorable art style, interesting characters, and even better story of helping a town after an earthquake. Like many old-school farming simulator titles, players won't be able to get everything done in a single day due to each activity eating into their stamina bar.

  However, players can make their energy last longer by cooking various interesting recipes in a kitchen like that found inside the Inn, where each recipe can replenish a fair amount of health and stamina. With such an assortment of drinks, meals, and snacks to create, these are by far the best food items in

 <p>
  Trail Mix is one of the simplest recipes a player will learn early into the exploration of
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria,
  </em>
  by using two ingredients that players can get their hands on in abundance while exploring in this farming simulator.

 <p>
  As long as the player has enough time to spend in the inn creating Trail Mix, this easy foraging snack is one of many great starting stamina replenishes that players will want to take a fair amount into the Mines with them so that they can likely make it to deeper levels.

  While wild berries are something players are likely to get early in the game, Berries, and Cream, unlike Trail Mix, is something a player will likely be creating during the mid-game of their playtime with
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria.
  </em>
  Berries and Cream is a recipe players will likely create due to the profit from selling this delicious dessert being a minor profit on the base selling price of milk.

 <p>
  While this isn't something that makes a major profit, it's still a great way for those who are trying to make some extra Tessarae and want another reason for keeping cows other than the story of the game and their cuteness.

  Returning to food items that players will be using early into the playthrough, especially during the Spring, Sliced Turnip is another great choice for players looking for a crop they can make in abundance and then use afterward to create a decent meal to replenish their stamina or health.

  As Spring's quickest and cheapest crop to grow, players can create many fields of turnips so they can create an abundance of Sliced Turnip, which will likely be the one meal players rely on once they have finally unlocked the Mines in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria.

  When the season finally changes to summer in Fields of Mistria, players will also be unable to grow any more turnips. However, all is not lost as summer sees the player able to forage for a new food source, that being coconuts.

 <p>
  Once the player has sold a coconut, they will receive the recipe to make Coconut Milk; a refreshing drink made for the summer heat, in their mailbox the next day. Giving players the same amount of stamina and health as Sliced Turnips do, this is a perfect replacement which also doesn't require the player to purchase their own seeds.

  As mentioned, cooking crops is a great way to earn an extra bit of profit. This becomes an even better idea when growing crops like corn in the summer, which takes 5 days to grow and then regrows every 3 days in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria.
  </em>

 <p>
  By then cooking this corn into Grilled Corn, players can make an additional profit of 10 Tessarae, as long as they have the time in the day to cook their entire field's worth of corn. This is also another great stamina food source due to each Grilled Corn also giving the player 24 health and stamina, which is an extra boost compared to the Coconut Milk.

  Tea is one of many incredibly useful crops that can be grown during the summer once the player has upgraded the General Store. With tea being brewed into an assortment of different types of teas, one of the most common and easiest to brew is a simple Green Tea.

  With the final product giving players the same amount of stamina and health as replenished by Grilled Corn, some players may question how it is better to be created than Grilled Corn. Besides being a great way to get stamina back, Green Tea also sells for more than Grilled Corn and makes a great gift for befriending the likes of Josephine and Valen too.

  Some of the best meals to be made in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  are those that use the ingredients found while exploring, instead of the crops that have been planted for profit. That's why unlocking recipes like the Deep Sea Soup is so perfect for any player hoping to spend their days mining for various artifacts and minerals within the Mines.

 <p>
  Deep Sea Soup makes the most of the different items that can be foraged within the Tide Caverns area of the Mines and then replenishes an incredible amount of stamina and health while giving the player a reason for keeping them after donating one of each ingredient to the Museum.

  Out of all the available recipes in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  , by far one of the best that players should create once they have all the ingredients available is the Summer Salad. This recipe is perfect for players who have had a focus on growing the various crops in summer and keeping a hold of at least two or three of each crop to make a few of these salads.

 <p>
  Besides replenishing a large amount of stamina and health, the Summer Salad also sells for 450 Tessarae, meaning overall, players make a 65 Tessarae profit from selling this salad instead of the ingredients separately. However, this is likely to be a beginner recipe for players due to requiring a higher cooking skill.

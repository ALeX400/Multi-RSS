  Players love RPGs that place a major emphasis on their characters and let them form a meaningful connection with a lovable gang of adventures who put everything on the line to save the world from a massive threat. The stories of these games are driven by these characters, with their struggles and motivations tying in with the main narrative to make for a compelling story that fans can't get enough of.

 <p>
  Most players won't mind that these games don't have an open world with a ton of busy work. The idea of playing through a fairly linear game with memorable personalities is more alluring in the eyes of many. As long as the game features great pacing and meaningful character development, people will have no issues with a lack of a sandbox. In fact, this may be downright appreciated in the eyes of many.

  BioWare is a studio known for being one of the biggest players in the Western RPG sphere, with a litany of classic games making it clear why fans love this developer despite a less-than-stellar track record in recent times. When BioWare was at the top of its game, fans were treated to some of the best character-driven role-playing experiences they could get their hands on, with
  <em>
   Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  being one of their most celebrated and popular games by a country mile.

 <p>
  The fact that many people consider this title to be the greatest
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  ever game is lofty praise that proves why
  <em>
   Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  has such a loyal fanbase. Each and every character players can recruit has a compelling story and is relevant to the plot in some manner, especially when it comes to Bastila Shan, one of the greatest BioWare companions of all time.

  From the moment players leave Midgar and experience a flashback detailing Nibelheim's incineration at the hands of Sephiroth, players are given a glimpse of Cloud's unreliable narration and Tifa's growing doubts. Every character gets their moment to shine in the game, with Barret's confrontation against Dyne and the massive sidequest where Yuffie steals the party's materia in Wutai being major story highlights in a memorable game. However, the dynamic between the protagonist and the main villain is what makes
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  tick and adds a ton of weight to a major revelation later on that completely flips the script.

  One of the greatest classic CRPGs of all time with incredible writing that is still compelling to this day, it's easy to see why fans can't get enough of
  <em>
   Planescape: Torment
  </em>
  to this day. The central plot revolves around the protagonist and his journey to regain the memory of his past lives and the mystery surrounding his immortality. It's an intriguing setup that is further enhanced with a unique world and immersive writing, with combat taking a backseat to the game's brilliant story.

 <p>
  Throughout the Nameless One's journey, he is joined by people he has interacted with or influenced in his past lives, further adding to the rich and layered narrative of this series. It's a generational CRPG that fans should check out as long as they're willing to look past its dated design.

  <em>
   Persona 5 Royal
  </em>
  is one of the greatest JRPGs players can get their hands on. This enhanced version of Atlus' stylistic game is oozing with charm and lets players control the Phantom Thieves who gain the power to summon Personas in the Mind Palaces of other heinous adults to change their minds. As one would expect, the main characters and the antagonists serve as the beating heart of this narrative, with their motivations and complexities shaping the conflicts that arise.

 <p>
  Most Mind Palaces build on a villain's personality to make for intriguing dungeons that players will love to infiltrate. While the game's focus on godlike beings and the like — an endgame trope almost every JRPG relies on — can take away from its character-driven narrative at times, the bulk of
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  is carried by these colorful personalities who are a joy to witness on-screen every single time their personality gets a chance to flourish.

  The idea of a sports RPG is quite odd, making it clear why
  <em>
   Pyre
  </em>
  is one of the most unique games in this genre fans can get their hands on. Players control a group of exiles seeking their freedom by completing Rites and emerging as the victorious team, following which one party member is chosen to leave the group and escape this purgatory to resume a normal life. Given how players form a connection with these exiles from both a narrative and gameplay standpoint, it's easy to see why these choices are far from easy.

  What makes
  <em>
   Pyre
  </em>
  such an intriguing character-driven narrative is that the members of opposing teams also have likable motivations of their own, to the point where players won't mind losing or throwing games as long as a worthy character gets their chance to escape. The tough choices that must be made in this game help
  <em>
   Pyre
  </em>
  stand out as a unique character-driven RPG that players should check out, even if the execution of its gameplay may not be the smoothest.

 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hades 2
   </em>
   's Olympic Update
  </strong>
  brought with it a huge amount of new content, including a new weapon, and several new upgrades and incantations. Along with these new items come multiple new materials that players will need to locate and stockpile. One of the more important items is
  <strong>
   Adamant,
  </strong>
  a new ore that has multiple important applications.

 <p>
  Looking through the new crafting, upgrade, and incantation recipes, players will discover that
  <strong>
   Adamant
  </strong>
  will be needed in fairly large quantities. Many of the most useful new items call for it. This guide will show players exactly where they can
  <strong>
   find Adamant in
   <em>
    Hades 2
   </em>
   ,
  </strong>
  and how they can use it to improve Melinoe's chances for success.

  To
  <strong>
   find Adaman
  </strong>
  t, players will first need to download the
  <strong>
   Olympic Update
  </strong>
  , and make their way through the City of Ephyra and the Rift of Thessaly in
  <em>
   Hades 2'
  </em>
  s surface region. Completing these areas will grant Melinoe access to
  <em>
   Hades 2's
  </em>
  new region,
  <strong>
   Mount Olympus.

  It is there that players will be able to find

 <p>
  While there is no way to guarantee which chamber will contain Adamant, having the
  <strong>
   Crescent Pick prioritized
  </strong>
  gives you the best chance of finding it in at least one. In our playthrough, we found at least one chamber with Adamant in five consecutive surface runs with the pick. Remember that every Adamant deposit you find will now give you
  <strong>
   three individual units
  </strong>
  of the reagent.

  <strong>
   Adamant
  </strong>
  is used in multiple recipes in
  <em>
   Hades 2,
  </em>
  across a wide variety of systems. The
  <strong>
   Olympic Update
  </strong>
  introduced the
  <strong>
   Black Coat,
   <em>
    Hades 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  's final
  <strong>
   Nocturnal Armament.
  </strong>
  Returning players who download the update will find the weapon available to craft, requiring two Adamant to do so. The following upgrades and incantations will also require Adamant:

      <title>Diablo 4 Vessel Of Hatred: Best Mercenaries To Hire, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The mercenaries are a hotly debated feature added in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  '
  <strong>
   <em>
    s Vessel of Hatred

  </strong>
  expansion. While an early bug meant that mercenary skill trees weren't appearing for some players, that's now been ironed out. With access to these trees, players have found plenty of reasons to bring along
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's new support characters.

 <p>
  To unlock mercenaries, players need to fight through the
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  campaign until they gain access to the mercenary den. Then, the player can hire a mercenary to set as a primary. That mercenary will follow and support the player with active skills, passives and perks while they're soloing.

 <p>
  Players can also hire a secondary mercenary, and these work a little differently. Players assign one of the mercenary's active skills to be triggered when certain conditions are met. For example, when the player triggers an active skill themselves. This happens both in solo and co-op play. There are four mercenaries in total, and each holds benefits for different play styles.

 <p>
  Aldkin's Field of Languish can be used to good effect for survivability, but he's not as good at it as Raheir. Some players may prefer to use him as a secondary mercenary to avoid the curse mechanic. Wave of Flames can also help damage-over-time builds to squeeze out a little more damage for solo leveling.

  Varyana is a strong choice for a primary mercenary for any melee-focused player. The extra attack speed plus her DPS alone make her an excellent choice for solo players, but is especially effective if melee DPS is the build focus.

  Raheir is probably the best all-round mercenary, and can compliment the survivability of any class or build. Going down his Shield Charge skill tree and taking the Bastion skill and Valiance buffs can be lifesavers in the endgame, and his taunt abilities might tempt some glass cannon ranged builds, too.

      <title>5 Most Unusual Dragon Ball Games</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Given how popular the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Ball
   </strong>
  </em>
  IP is, it's no surprise that several developers have tried their hardest to make competent games based on this franchise. The results have been a mixed bag, but players love the idea of playing action RPGs, fighting games, and anything else along the same lines that lets players control their favorite
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  characters in larger-than-life battles.

 <p>
  However, given the sheer number of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games on the market, it's only a given that some of these titles can be rather odd and don't seem like a great fit for the series. In some instances, these games end up surprising players with their fun gameplay — or serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they fail to wow the masses and end up being hated and forgotten in the grand scheme of things.

  Players love
  <em>
   The Legacy of Goku 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Buu's Fury
  </em>
  , considering them to be some of the best action RPGs featuring beloved
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  characters. However, the same love isn't afforded to the first game in the series, and players who checked this game out of curiosity know exactly why this is the case.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  is a series about power fantasies where Goku and the other characters engage in death-defying battles that are incredible to behold. However,
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legacy of Goku
   </strong>
  </em>
  disgraces this selling point with one of the worst introductions in video game history.

 <p>
  Goku must punch numerous snakes outside his house to gain a few levels if they don't want to be devoured by a single wolf, and even that not may be enough. This potentially makes this incarnation of Goku the weakest he's ever been, which is highly unusual. There's no reason why a version of Goku at the start of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  's timeline is weaker than Kid Goku, who could've taken out massive dinosaurs without any problems — let alone lowly wolves. Thankfully, the modest success of this game led to the sequels boasting a higher budget, letting them improve the art style and gameplay in spades.

  A lot of things come to mind when players talk about an action-packed
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game, but the last thing that comes to mind is a title that focuses on battles with cards. This is precisely what makes
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Ball Z: Harukanaru Densetsu
   </strong>
  </em>
  one of the most unique titles in the series, and it helps that the presentation of this title is good enough for players to buy into this gameplay loop. Players control numerous characters across familiar
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  stories, collecting cards that aid them in movement and battle.

 <p>
  It's a surprisingly fun RPG that doesn't take too long for players to get the hang of how things work. The sprite work is amazing and does a great job of making the player's attacks feel amazing to unleash. Improving one's guard and using damage cards with high numbers is imperative to attain victory, and players will love the faithful take on the story of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z —
  </em>
  including a fair bit of filler to pad things out without being too egregious.

  While turn-based JRPGs can be a joy to play through, not all IPs can necessarily benefit from this combat loop. This is a complaint that players would have when it comes to
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  too, so it's impressive to see how much fun
  <strong>
   <em>
    Attack of the Saiyans
   </em>
  </strong>
  is. It's arguably one of the better
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games that players can check out — as long as they don't mind controlling characters who aren't relevant in the series' modern run, like Yamcha and Tien.

  It's a puzzling game to recommend, but fans who don't mind playing one of the more experimental
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games around will love what
  <em>
   Attack of the Saiyans
  </em>
  brings to the table. There's enough to the combat to keep players engaged for the majority of its run, with players reaching the end of its story after the Saiyan Saga is completed.

  The Kinect was pushed as the next big thing in motion gaming, and this was true to an extent. However, its applications were pretty limited at the time, and what made things worse were games that billed themselves as fully-fledged experiences despite having a barebones gameplay loop. This is precisely why people couldn't help but lambast
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball Z: For Kinect
   </em>
  </strong>
  , labeling it as a shameless cash grab — and rightfully so.

  People were kidding themselves if they thought that this game made them feel like a Z Fighter trying to save the world. All they did was pose and punch the air as the cinematics made it seem like they were controlling a fighter battling for their life. It's one of the weirdest
  <em>

  games of all time, serving as a laughingstock in the eyes of many and an example of how bad a

  When people think of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games, the last thing they expect is to control a civilian on the run from a diabolical villain. So, it's easy to see why
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Ball: The Breakers
   </strong>
  </em>
  deserves the moniker of being the weirdest
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game players can get their hands on. There's no rhyme or reason as to why this game exists, even if some people may find it interesting to try and outsmart an iconic villain from the series who is hunting them down around a massive map.

 <p>
  Players can find ways to stun a villain who is hunting them down, finding a safe spot to hide, or sneaking around to gather the Dragon Balls to give them the means to fight back against the Raider who's out for their blood. It's an odd idea for a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game that's a hard sell, but superfans can still check this game out to either feel like a victim or a heinous villain as they hunt down innocent civilians and snuff their lives out in a flash.

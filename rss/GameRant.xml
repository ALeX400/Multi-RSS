      <title>Martial Arts Tycoon Dev Talks Core Gameplay Loop, Brazilian Game Market, and More</title>

  If any mixed martial arts fans have wished for a tycoon game, they're in luck. Good Dog Studios CEO and creative director Chance Glasco noticed the lack of a tycoon martial arts game (one focused on a gym, not just a fighter) following his experiences in Brazil and overall love for jiu-jitsu. In a world with pressure washer, lawnmower, and hospital simulators, Glasco thought it was time to let gamers run their own jiu-jitsu gym.

  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  Including working on
  <em>
   Medal of Honor: Allied Assault
  </em>
  , it was about 13 years of working on first-person shooters. I worked on World War 2 games for longer than America was in World War 2. I just burned out. Even if you changed up the setting, I was like, “I want to do something different” and I made a lot of trips to Brazil as a guest speaker. I was kind of the developer voice for Infinity Ward. When it came to the end of the project, they'd send me out to do interviews with various media people in Europe and in Brazil, so I already had some friends here.

 <p>
  I knew I wanted to live in another country. I just basically got the hell out of the country and disappeared for a bit. When I finally quit, I quit after the whole Respawn splitting drama and Activision getting sued. I was like, "I'm done. This is just too much. I'm just going to go to Rio, hopefully the relationship thing works out, train in some jiu-jitsu, relax, go to the beach, and recover from AAA games." I did a little bit of consulting, and we started a VR start-up for a bit.

 <p>
  We went back to Orlando. We started the VR company right when VR was about to bust, but we also closed the company a few months before COVID. We kind of started the company at the wrong time and we ended the company at the wrong time because VR conferences would have probably gotten a lot more investment as soon as COVID started out. Anyway, I was consulting for games and ended up co-founding the company with one of my clients I had. As game developers, we often have some game ideas in our back pocket while we're working on other games, like games you want to make.

 <p>
  I thought maybe it was time to make a martial arts tycoon game because there was a lawnmower simulator. How many people are like, “Oh man, if someone would just make a lawn mower simulating game or pressure washing simulator." Or even hospitals, how many fans of hospitals are there? But you can make a successful hospital-type game.

  There’s close to over 600 million people who watch MMA. Why haven't you seen a game where you manage a martial arts academy?
  <em>
   Punch Club
  </em>
  was almost that, but you're managing a fighter. You're not managing an academy like a bunch of fighters. It just seemed like the right time. For our core team, most of them came from AAA and are other people who are burnt out from it. When you work on something like
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  , you have an artist that's just making rocks all day or something, and they're ready to do something fresh, like some variety. With my experience living in Brazil, my love for jiu-jitsu, and the lack of a tycoon martial arts game, I was like, this should happen. That's more or less how that transition happened.

  : Yeah, I'm a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council. They're a really big think tank out of Washington, D.C. I got connected with them through the president of Full Sail University. I went to Full Sail in Orlando, and I'm working with their climate resilience organization, which is the Adrienne Arscht Foundation Resilience Center. We go by Arscht-Rock for short. Instead of focusing on mitigation of climate where we're trying to stop global warming and climate change, where we realize we're already kind of screwed, we focus on things to keep people safe

 <p>
  We're seeing record-breaking heat every year in the south of Brazil and flooding that affected something like half a million people. We've always had climate affecting humans so what can we do through games to actually keep people safer from climate? We work with developers, we do workshops. In the past, we've done some grants to basically help get some of these topics in the game. For instance, in
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon
  </em>
  <em>
   Brazil
  </em>
  , we have a daily temperature and that's based on the average temperature of Rio.

  Occasionally you can have a heat wave and depending on the intensity of the heat wave, you have to do things to protect your NPCs. You might have to add some fans, make sure they have water to drink, add something to block the sun, you know, some coverings from the sun to keep their simulated body temperature and something that keeps them happy. Otherwise, they risk injuries which would be heat stroke and exhaustion. If someone has heat exhaustion, maybe they're out for two weeks and can’t train. If they have heat stroke, maybe they're out for a couple of weeks and can't train. Heat stroke can actually affect their attributes and now their agility is lower. The only way you can fix that is through rehab.

  We try to make gamers knowledgeable of the risks of heat. In this case, in the future, we'd like to add something like Dengue fever. When it rains and you don't clean up the puddles, you have a risk of mosquitoes. Those mosquitoes can carry Dengue. If the mosquito bites one of your fighters, they might be out for three months and that's going to affect your bottom line.

  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  Yeah, I mean, we're not screaming it at you. It's just something that we put in there and it fits. It’s also a very culturally grounded game. If you have seen the movie
  <em>
   City of God
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Elite Squad
  </em>
  , most media exposure people outside of Brazil gets makes them have a very horrible idea of Brazilians. They just got a big favela, and in the favela, it's all drug dealers and police killings. Sure, maybe there's truth to that, right, but the vast majority of people in these communities are good people just trying to make it. I'm hoping with this game, because you start with very little money, that we're kind of addressing some of the stereotypes. Favelas are more diverse than most people expect. Not everyone’s a drug dealer, and there are a lot of good people with a very strong sense of community. We’re just kind of trying to address some of those stereotypes through the game. Even in
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  , you're in a favela, and it's just full of drug traffickers that you're killing. I probably didn't help contributing to that stereotype too much.

 <p>
  Every NPC is procedurally generated. They have a life path, which is like their history. These life paths can basically influence their character traits. For instance, if you have someone that has a life path where they grew up with drug-addicted parents, there's a higher chance that they're going to have some kind of drug-related character trait that's going to affect them negatively. But you're training jiu-jitsu martial arts, and it helps these characters potentially improve these character traits and hopefully get rid of some of the negative character traits. Or, you might make some bad choices that could actually give them a negative character trait.

 <p>
  An example of this character trait could be a bully. A bully might be strong and athletic, so they have a bonus to athleticism and strength, but maybe they have like a 20% higher chance of injuring another NPC when they train with him. So, you're like, do I want this guy to join? I want some strong fighters, but he's going to hurt some of my other characters and now they can't train for a while because they're injured.

  We start with a more or less empty rooftop. You have some starting money, and you start purchasing some equipment like a thrown-together front desk that is made of beer crates. Some people start walking up to your gym. They're like, “Hey, I'm interested in training jiu-jitsu,” you're going to accept them or deny them, they pay a little money upfront, they pay a little each time they show up. As you gain more money, you will be able to upgrade your equipment, you create your own classes. You can drag these blocks of time into like a full hour or hour and a half block and create your own class. You're scheduling these classes, you're creating them, you're showing them from the training, and you're getting XP in different areas with the risk of being injured and stuff like that too.

  You're trying to manage that risk over time. There might be an opportunity for them to be in a jiu-jitsu tournament or maybe they run into their bully at school. This kid who joined the gym that was getting bullied now, you get to see how that unfolds. Does he beat his bully's ass? You get to see that play out with a little bit of influence, but for the most part, you're seeing how all those choices unfold. As these things occur and they go well, you're building a reputation, which allows you to open more gyms and start earning more money. To summarize, people sign up, you train them, they fight, and they make money throughout all this. You're investing back in your gym, more or less similar to a lot of tycoon games except there’s a combat phase.

  If I'm going to portray Brazil, I'm going to portray it a lot better if I've actually lived here. Even with me, who's lived in Brazil for over three years in total, I'm still not going to have the whole picture. All of my friends are Brazilian, and in Rio, I have a couple of best friends. One works for the city and the other lives in the same developed community that is depicted in the game, so I get to see different perspectives from different people, different walks of life.

  I think, when you're touching on the favela-related stuff, when you're talking about more of what happens within those communities, we're going to show the difficulties that those people face living there. We're not going to dive into politics, it's just going to create division and everything, but we want people to understand what are some of the struggles that those communities deal with. In addition, something worth mentioning is that, after working on
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  , making the biggest game ever is not necessarily what makes me tick anymore. Yeah, we're going to make a great game. It's fun. It sells a lot of copies. But for me, I want something that's more impactful.

  We did a little test where we raised $3,000 to buy Kimonos for kids and social projects. Last year I went to four social projects and gave out Kimonos to these different projects. I thought we could go much bigger than this. For probably $25,000 or so, we could actually build a jiu-jitsu academy in one of these communities, so one of my biggest goals in this game is for our community to actually make some donations and they can see some kind of impact that they've done. We're not just going to these communities, taking photos, talking to people leaving, and being like, “Look, I'm in a game.” That's something that really motivates me to make this game successful because, for that to be successful, the game needs to be successful.

 <p>
  <strong>
   A
  </strong>
  : For me, my mindset, I don't think I'm making a "game for impact." I think I'm making a game, and as human beings, we should always try to impact things in positive ways. I wouldn't label it as that. It's just that we can't rely on the government to fix all our problems and this problem requires money, s if you're in a position in an industry where there's money involved, you can find some way to give back.

 <p>
  Right now, the whole games for impact thing is a trend, right? There's like having diversity in your game and there's having diversity in your game because you actually have diverse friends at a diverse level. Some people have diversity in their game, but they live in a little bubble. They just go out and hunt for that rather than naturally interacting and networking with a diverse set of people, if that makes sense. For me, it's important to not treat it like some kind of person saving the world, just be a good human, just be a good person.

  For me, the biggest thing this year is that we have a Gamescom. I've been living in Brazil for a while now and the problem with gaming events in Brazil - I mean, they're huge, they attract so many people - but journalists came to BIG Festival from Latin America and none of that media gets outside of South America. Having the Gamescom LATAM label gives it the international attention that the Brazilian market deserves.

 <p>
  80% of Brazilians play games across all genders in the population, right? Brazil is Number 5 in games consumption on the planet, something like that, right? It's interesting for this market to have international exposure. And there's so much talent in game development here, but they don't necessarily have the availability of investment that the United States or Europe has, right? Brazil as a gaming market is completely overlooked. You just look at numbers, and you're like, why aren't game studios not taking their time to get out in Brazil? You're going to receive so much more love here, at a gaming event, than anywhere else on the planet.

  You have 230 million people here and like 190 million of them play games. With the internet and gaming, people are learning from playing games in English. Things are looking up here, and they just passed some legislation that recognizes games as a cultural activity. Before it was just under software, so now they're eligible for grants from the government, tax breaks, and stuff like that.

  are highly eccentric in their own way. From the wolf-man Lycaon to the bear-man Ben, it's hard not to get intrigued by their unique personas. Among the eccentric figures, there's Grace Howard.

  Grace may seem like a normal human, but she has a passionate interest in building things and how things work. Therefore, it's no surprise that her fighting style is less destructive and more obtrusive. Here's how players can
  <strong>
   build Grace in
   <em>
    ZZZ
   </em>
  </strong>
  and make her an annoying Agent for Ethereals to fight against.

  Grace is an Electric-Anomaly character in
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  , so
  <strong>
   she focuses on inflicting Shock on the enemy
  </strong>
  . Her playstyle revolves around her Zap stacks, which she uses to increase Electric Anomaly Buildup.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":196} -->
 <p>
  To gain Zap stacks, players simply have to deal Physical DMG with Basic or Dash attacks.
  <strong>
   The number of Zap stacks can be seen under Grace's health bar
  </strong>
  when she's the active character. After having enough Zap stacks, using Special Attack or EX Special Attack will consume all stacks,
  <strong>
   increasing the accumulated Electric Anomaly Buildup
  </strong>
  .

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":541} -->
 <p>
  On top of that, Grace’s additional ability, which activates when the squad consists of characters with the same Attribute or Faction,
  <strong>
   increases Shock DMG when she hits an enemy with her EX Special Attack
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  In short, to play Grace in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , you must
  <strong>
   alternate between Basic Attack and Special Attack (when Zap stack is full) to quickly build up Shock
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The best W-Engine for Grace in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  is the
  <strong>
   Fusion Compiler
  </strong>
  . Its sub-stat boosts PEN Ratio, and passive greatly increases Anomaly Proficiency (up to 75 in Phase 1). It also unconditionally increases ATK.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":457} -->
 <p>
  Tip: Anomaly Proficiency, ATK, Electric DMG, and PEN are all great stats to have since they affect Shock DMG. Typically, the ranking is as such:
  <strong>
   Anomaly Proficiency &gt; ATK% = Electric DMG &gt; PEN%
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  For A-Rank W-Engine, players can consider
  <strong>
   Weeping Gemini
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Rainforest Gourmet
  </strong>
  . Rainforest Gourmet’s sub-stat increases Anomaly Proficiency, and its passive boosts ATK based on Energy consumed. Considering Grace would use her EX Special Attack often, the Energy consumption passive fits her nicely.
  <strong>
   Electro-Lip Gloss
  </strong>
  is also great for maximizing Grace's Anomaly Proficiency.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1046} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Another good option is
  <strong>
   Roaring Ride
  </strong>
  . The sub-stat gives ATK instead of Anomaly Proficiency, but it has a decent passive. When EX Special Attack hits, the passive randomly increases ATK, Anomaly Proficiency, or Anomaly Buildup Rate. However, although the effect is random, all of them can exist at once as they can trigger once every 0.3s. Each effect lasts for 5s, and the same effect can't stack, but if you trigger the same buff, the duration resets. This weapon can be excellent if players are lucky enough to trigger different buffs.

 <p>
  Other viable alternatives are B-Rank
  <strong>
   [Magnetic Storm] Bravo
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   [Magnetic Storm] Charlie
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  As an Anomaly character,
  <strong>
   4pc Freedom Blues
  </strong>
  is great to make Grace more effective at triggering Shock. The 4-piece effect is especially great since EX Special Attack is a part of her combo.
  <strong>
   4pc Thunder Metal
  </strong>
  is also viable, but considering the 4-piece effect requires an enemy to be Shocked, it's better for Grace to use Freedom Blues and equip Thunder Metal on another character.

 <p>
  For the 2pc set, the best options are Hormone Punk for ATK or Thunder Metal for Electric DMG; the two are equally good, so use the one with the better sub-stat. You can consider Puffer Electro for PEN if the other two are unavailable. Of course, you can also use Freedom Blues if you use 4pc Thunder Metal.

 <p>
  For Grace’s Drive Discs, you’d want Anomaly Proficiency and Anomaly Mastery along with ATK, Electric DMG, and PEN.

      Overwatch 2 continues to draw inspiration from popular IPs, following previous collaborations with One-Punch Man, Cowboy Bebop, and Porsche.

      However, the Ultrawatch-themed Battle Pass hints at a missed opportunity for a Power Rangers crossover, as both that franchise and Transformers are owned by Hasbro. Seeing it only take inspiration from one Hasbro brand while properly crossing over with another in the same season is odd.

  Since releasing back in October 2022,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  has found itself at the heart of quite a few controversies, both big and small. Right out the gate,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  made some controversial decisions regarding its new free-to-play model, choosing to lock new heroes behind its Battle Pass. Then
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's promised PvE story mode was slowly killed with a thousand small cuts. But despite all that,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  has managed to retain a sizable fan-base, and occasionally Blizzard does make some decisions in their best interest.

 <p>
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's Season 10 Battle Pass was a rare example of Blizzard getting something right with its community, unlocking all heroes for free, and implementing a new way to earn previously released Mythic skins. Though it's certainly not without its issues,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 11 is another solid update, though there does seem to be one major missed opportunity with its latest Battle Pass. Specifically, it feels like it could have had an official Transformers crossover instead of the unofficial one it ended up with.

  Next up is
  <em>
   Transformers

  , and while no official details are currently known, there's no shortage of fun possibilities for this
  <em>

  crossover, with Bastion, Ramattra, and D.Va all being natural fits for a
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  -themed skin. It seems likely that Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Megatron will all be represented in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  collaboration, with them being the most recognizable characters in the franchise. But there's always a chance players could see some lesser-known
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  in the upcoming
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  crossover, such as Barricade, Blackout, Ratchet, and Jazz. Along with some exclusive skins based on the IP, fans can probably expect to see some in-game challenges themed around
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  that'll reward them with other cosmetics like sprays and player icons.

  Overwatch 2 Season 11's Battle Pass Could Have Been Home To a Power Rangers Crossover
 </h3>
 <p>
  While fans have high hopes for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  crossover, it does feel like there's a big missed opportunity this season.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 11's Battle Pass has an 'Ultrawatch' theme, where some of the game's roster is given new outfits that look as though they've been heavily inspired by 90s shows like
  <em>
   Power Rangers
  </em>
  . Ana, Wrecking Ball, Cassidy, Reaper, and Sojourn are all given new skins that turn them into
  <em>
   Power Rangers
  </em>
  -like heroes, while Roadhog and Zenyatta are given Kaiju skins akin to the monsters that the Power Rangers would fight in their Megazord. But by far the most obvious reference to
  <em>
   Power Rangers
  </em>
  is
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 11's Ashe skin, which turns her into a 'Calamity Empress' who looks strikingly similar to Rita Repulsa.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 11's Battle Pass seemingly taking a great deal of inspiration from
  <em>
   Power Rangers
  </em>
  , it would have made a lot of sense for this season's collaboration to be a
  <em>
   Power Rangers
  </em>
  one. This feels even more strange given the fact that
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Power Rangers
  </em>
  are both owned by Hasbro, meaning that a collaboration with
  <em>
   Power Rangers
  </em>
  would presumably have been just as easy to obtain.

  Over a year after the release of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the game stands as one of the most successful video game adaptations that the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  franchise has ever seen. The title offered a level of detail, exploration, and freedom that was a perfect match for the magic of the wider franchise, and it is no surprise that many fans are looking toward a potential sequel to the game.

 <p>
  Thanks to the commercial success of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , a sequel seems extremely likely, with a spate of rumors and leaks suggesting such a project is already in the works. Despite the detail that was present in the original
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , there were many defining elements of Hogwarts and
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  that were not present in the game, and these provide a sequel with the perfect opportunity to finally deliver on them. Of all the absent features in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , the magical sport Quidditch was one of the most glaring, and a sequel should definitely introduce this if it decides to bring a multiplayer element to the franchise.

  <em>

  prided itself on transferring the mystery and awe of the famous magical school to the gaming medium, with players having free rein to explore and socialize within the school itself and its surrounding areas. With the school's houses, classes, and intricate secrets being fully available to the player, it seemed that
  <em>

  Quidditch is one of the most recognizable elements of the wider
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  franchise, being a fictional sport that takes place on brooms in the sky, with there being a variety of roles and ways to score points. Allowing the player to make a name for themselves through Quidditch seemed like a logical experience that would be included in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , but the sport is sadly completely unavailable to players.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Legacy
  </em>
  narratively justifies the absence of the sport due to a severe player injury, a sequel to the game should go out of its way to finally deliver on including the sport. It is clear that a
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  would need to make some sweeping changes to stand out from its predecessor, and the inclusion of multiplayer capabilities would be an absolute game-changer for the project. Not only would multiplayer allow players to socialize and tackle the game's narrative cooperatively, but it would allow them to face-off against one another through Quidditch matchmaking.

  Of course, the lack of Quidditch in
  <em>

  </em>
  may have also been down to the upcoming release of
  <em>

  , which is a cartoon-styled multiplayer title fully dedicated to online Quidditch gameplay. Including a comprehensive Quidditch experience in

 <p>
  It has been confirmed that
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  will allow players to choose from different positions such as Chaser, Keeper, Beater, and Seeker. As well as being able to control the entire team, it seems clear that
  <em>
   Champions
  </em>
  is going to be a much more comprehensive portrayal of Quidditch than what
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  could realistically portray, but this could work to the benefit of a sequel.

  To allow
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  to still shine,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  could simply allow fans to only play in the famous Seeker role, with this often being seen as the most exciting and important Quidditch position. Players in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  could then play against each other in 1v1 matches as opposing Seekers, creating tense gameplay that scratches that Quidditch itch without stepping too much on the toes of the upcoming
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  .

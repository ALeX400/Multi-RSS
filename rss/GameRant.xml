   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is set to launch with three main experiences: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. In the
  <strong>
   Campaign
  </strong>
  mode, fans can expect to
  <strong>
   dive into a spy-thriller blockbuster adventure
  </strong>
  , joining Frank Woods and his team as they are hunted by the military machine that created them. Players will experience a variety of missions in the Campaign, each taking them to a diverse array of locations. Unfortunately, the
  <strong>
   Campaign will not have an early-access period
  </strong>
  , making its official debut alongside Multiplayer and Zombies on the launch date of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

  .

  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  also propels players into an action-packed
  <strong>
   Multiplayer
  </strong>
  mode, featuring a
  <strong>
   revised movement system known as Omnimovement
  </strong>
  . Players can expect to swiftly sprint and dive across
  <strong>
   16 maps â€” 12 designed for 6v6 and 4 Strike Maps.
  </strong>
  Much like previous
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Multiplayer experiences, fans can battle it out in a variety of game modes like Team Deathmatch and Domination while
  <strong>
   utilizing an arsenal of 12 confirmed weapons
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   Classic Prestige
  </strong>
  makes a triumphant return, along with Wildcards to enhance every player's loadout.

  The landscape of massive games, with huge set pieces and exciting action, can be overwhelming for any player looking for a more serene and thoughtful experience. Thankfully, there are plenty of introspective and emotional games out there to please fans of any genre. Many games leave the player in isolated circumstances or slowly discovering narratives that are emotional and hidden.

 <p>
  Others emphasize choice and player agency itself, or the cozy and light nature of gaming as a medium. These introspective titles are often calm and take their time but can also be some of the strongest experiences in modern gaming. These are some of the best introspective titles for fans of slow-paced, thoughtful gaming.

  Plunging into the forests of Wyoming,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Firewatch
   </em>
  </strong>
  sees players taking on the role of a man who has fled from his previous life to become a lonely watchman. Sitting in complete isolation and watching over the vast expanse of nature, his only contact with the outside world comes in the form of radio conversations with his boss, Delilah.

 <p>
  These moments of connection will become focal points for the player, with the silent exploration in between giving fans time to think about where they have come from and the nature of their own relationships. With a strange mystery to uncover, and gameplay that focuses inward as well as on the exploration of the somber landscapes, any fans of slower games will adore

  One of the strangest premises for a video game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Waking
   </em>
  </strong>
  sees players using their feelings and thoughts as weapons. Players are invited to treat the whole game as something between a therapy session and a meditation as they fight against their negative self-perception and use weapons named after the traits they see as most positive in themselves.

 <p>
  While the combat is exciting and tense, the dreamworld that must be traversed in between each encounter uses surrealism to provide a weird and wonderful exploration experience. With the emotional aspect of summoning loved ones and beloved animals to assist players, it is easy to see why this thoughtful game has proven so popular.

  Exploring a huge manor while she attempts to piece together the disparate threads of her family history, players of
  <strong>
   <em>

  will reveal more and more of what became of the Finch family through the eyes of Edith herself.

 <p>
  The game is separated into the stories of different family members, each of which takes on a different style but comes to a similar tragic end. Every story will come together to form a portrait of a family that struggles to free itself from the shadow of mortality in a game that asks players to truly think about the story that they experience.

  Similarly to
  <em>
   What Remains Of Edith Finch

  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Gone Home
   </em>
  </strong>
  lets players into an abandoned home, initially appearing to be quite a spooky setting. On a stormy night, the player returns home only to find the house empty. Fans must find a way to let themselves in, where they will find scattered clues about what has been going on with their family.

 <p>
  At first, these binned letters and notes squirreled away in cupboards will paint a fractured picture of what happened in the home, but as players continue through simple puzzles and get to know the familiar halls the story that will come into focus is a romance. The coming-of-age love story is an excellent treat for those players who can trust the slower pace and the more ambient storytelling.

      <title>The Best PS5 Games That Can Be Run At 4K &amp; 60 FPS</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/ps5-games-4k-60-fps/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  For gamers on the fence about whether a 4K TV is worth the investment, the
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5
  </strong>
  readily answers the question. The PS5 includes an expected upgrade in graphics processing. This means that games have a new opportunity to reach frame rates and resolutions that beefy gaming PCs struggled with just five years ago.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":319} -->

 <p>
  With the PS5 also able to offer ray tracing to make games even more beautiful than ever, it's tempting many gamers to upgrade their setups. Those who are worried there aren't enough good games out there to make the transition worth it will find that there are several fantastic titles, both remakes and new releases, that can run at full capacity on the PS5.

  <em>
   <strong>
    PS5 4K and 60FPS games
   </strong>
   should become more common moving forward, at least for those who (eventually) upgrade to the PS5 Pro. However, the base console can still hit those standards on occasion.

  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  represents the PS5 at its absolute best, demonstrating beautiful graphics alongside a fixed 60FPS performance that nearly never shifts from that benchmark. Sure, Team Asobi did not create a massive open-world or aim for an incredibly realistic art style, but the developer still put together an expansive campaign with constantly gorgeous (and diverse) environments, lively NPCs, and complex gameplay.

 <p>
  While seemingly using a dynamic resolution,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  remains pretty close to 4K constantly, which is impressive when matched with the fluid gameplay. As far as modern 3D platformers are concerned, this 2024 release is about as great as the genre can be, and it set a new standard on how to optimize a game for the PS5.

  Capcom's legendary fighting franchise is back in full force.
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  rights so many of its predecessor's wrongs, not least of which is the inclusion of a lengthy single-player mode known as World Tour. Players get to create a fighter and take them on an educational and fan-service-heavy journey, one that highlights
  <em>
   SF6
  </em>
  's genre-best combat, stylish visuals, and smooth gameplay.

 <p>
  As good as World Tour is, the mode is still largely a companion piece to
  <em>

  's multiplayer, which takes the form of the Battle Hub. Here, players can take part in ranked matches, watch other people fight, or even play classic Capcom games like

  Mintrocket's
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  has enjoyed a surprisingly long shelf-life, largely thanks to its release schedule. In October 2022, the project launched into Steam's early access, putting it on the map. In June 2023,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  made its full PC debut, garnering universal acclaim for its humor and unique blend of mechanics. In October 2023, the game resurfaced thanks to its Switch port, and the hybrid console proved to be a great fit for the indie title. Finally, in April 2024,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  launched on PS5 and PS4, introducing itself to a whole new audience. Furthermore, it was added to PS Plus Extra immediately, making it available to potentially millions of PlayStation players. Every time obscurity beckons, a new port brings it back into the limelight.

 <p>
  None of this would have amounted to anything if
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  was bad or even mediocre. No, the game is simply too good to be forgotten and deserves to be experienced by as broad of a community as possible. So, what did Mintrocket create? Well,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is quite a unique beast, despite taking pages from plenty of popular genres. The story follows Dave as he opens a sushi restaurant with a few friends. Besides actively running the store at night, Dave is in charge of catching fish, a process that involves exploring the Blue Hole. These segments make up the meat of the game, but they are hardly the only mechanics.
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is almost too ambitious and varied at times, especially once players are given access to a farm to manage. Even though the gameplay loop threatens to become exhausting after a while and the story is hit-and-miss (not counting some really fun cutscenes), the core appeal of diving into the great unknown in search of exotic fishes never subsides.

  BlueTwelve Studio's
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  garnered quite a bit of hype prior to its release, and the cyberpunk project managed to live up to the hype. As suggested by its title, this game casts players as a cat that finds their way into a city run by robots and androids. To make it back to its home, the adorable feline goes on an adventure filled with puzzles, platforming, and some combat.

 <p>
  While quite short in terms of length,
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  makes up for it through beautiful and detailed locations that come filled with NPCs that have their own stories to tell. The gameplay is also pretty decent, and the campaign shakes things up frequently enough to ensure none of the mechanics overstay their welcome.
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  runs smoothly on the PS5, reaching both 60 FPS and a 4K resolution.

  Considering its reveal garnered a very mixed response,
  <em>
   Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown
  </em>
  managed to prove the doubters wrong. A notable departure from the franchise's 3D era, the spin-off is a 2.5D Metroidvania that expertly blends combat, platforming, puzzles, and exploration. Offering a relatively lengthy campaign that tells a pretty good story,
  <em>
   The Lost Crown
  </em>
  features fantastic and satisfying gameplay that starts brilliantly and somehow only improves from there.

 <p>
  Now, visually, the game is nothing too amazing. Just to be clear,
  <em>
   The Lost Crown
  </em>
  is not unpleasant on the eyes either, but it does not push modern consoles to their limits either. Consequently, the title running at 4K and 60 FPS on the PS5 was to be expected; however, Ubisoft Montpellier succeeded in taking things a step further by achieving 4K and 120 FPS on both Sony and Microsoft's latest systems.

  Originally released on the PS4,
  <em>
   Persona 5 Royal
  </em>
  is also available natively on the PS5. In the grand scheme of things, the fact Sony's console can run a 3-year-old JRPG at 4K and 60 FPS is not particularly impressive; however, that does not take anything away from the fact that
  <em>
   P5R
  </em>
  looks and performs great. At this point, Atlus' game is one of the most stylish projects across three PlayStation generations, and its anime visuals will undoubtedly stand the test of time.

 <p>
  As an improved frame rate does not have a significant impact on turn-based combat, the 4K jump is far more important in the case of
  <em>
   P5R
  </em>
  . Aesthetically, the JRPG has never looked better and cooler than it does on current-generation hardware (and PC).

  Originally an Xbox console exclusive,
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  eventually made its way to the PS5 in March 2024, garnering a very similar reception as its original release. Unfortunately, Microsoft shut down Tango Gameworks shortly after this port's arrival, turning
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  into the developer's unexpected swan song. A stark departure from Tango's previous projects that leaned into horror territory, this title opts for a completely different tone and gameplay style. Set in a cyberpunk-ish world, players step into the shoes of Chai, a guy who volunteers to be a corporation's guinea pig in pursuit of his dream to become a rockstar.

  Obviously, things head south very quickly, and he finds himself saddled with a robotic arm and embedded with a music player that blasts songs right into the protagonist's skull. Marked to be eradicated by the corporation and inadvertently aligning himself with a rebel group, Chai goes on a rhythm-based adventure where he must hack and slash his way through hundreds of robots while performing some impressive platforming.

  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  is an absolute treat in nearly every area. While not photo-realistic, the vibrant visuals lend themselves to energetic gameplay and comedic cutscenes. The soundtrack is unsurprisingly incredible and blends seamlessly with the combat. Rather than punishing players for failing to move with the beat,
  <em>
   Hi-Fi RUsh

  simply opts to reward them for doing so, granting stronger attacks and more impressive leaps.

  Gearbox's
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  spin-off finds Tiny Tina staging another game of Bunkers &amp; Badasses, a twist on the
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  formula. As the Fatemaker, players have to repel the revival of the Dragon Lord, a quest that delivers quite a few laughs and epic moments.
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  is not a huge departure from the mainline entries, but it does incorporate some traditional RPG concepts along with envisioning a classic fantasy world as the setting for the adventure.

  On the PS5, players can either set the game to performance or resolution mode. The latter offers a dynamic 4K resolution and 60 FPS; meanwhile, the former drops the resolution to 1080p but doubles the FPS. As 120 FPS is noticeable in a first-person shooter, performance mode is definitely worth trying, although resolution mode delivers the best of both worlds.

  Although perhaps not the most graphically intensive game,
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  is nevertheless gorgeous. The JRPG uses an HD-2D art style that allows for lavish backdrops and detailed character designs, and the visuals have a timeless quality to them since they harbor back to the genre's classic '90s output. While
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  looks fine on every system, even the Switch and PS4, the game is a sight to behold on the PS5 (and PC, if a system's components allow it).

 <p>
  The occasional frame rate dip notwithstanding, Square Enix's JRPG offers native 4K and 60 FPS on Sony's current console. The graphics are as crisp as they can be, while gameplay is generally smooth; furthermore, the PS5 iteration also comes with other (standard) benefits like DualSense implementation and short load times.

  Blizzard's
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  was undoubtedly one of the biggest releases of 2023, and the game is stacked to the brim with content; however, it is also not an especially demanding game on a technical level, at least compared to other AAA titles. Running at 4K and 60fps, the action RPG looks and plays great on the PS5, especially since the game builds on its predecessor's strong console controls.

 <p>
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has a reasonably lengthy campaign that tasks players with stopping Lilith from paving the way to hell. Narratively, the game does not offer too many surprises, and the side-quests are largely forgettable as well. Ultimately, the story is just there to keep people busy until they reach the endgame, which is when the real
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  experience begins. At this point, the game unshackles players, all the while significantly raising the challenge.

  MiHoYo's free-to-play action RPG made its way to the PS5 in April 2021, bringing 4K resolution and 60 FPS with it.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  took the world by storm when it debuted in 2020; the game offers an expansive open-world in the form of Teyvat, a gacha system that gives players the chance to pull one of a plethora of playable characters, and a constantly evolving storyline.

 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  isn't quite as visually impressive as most high-end PS5 games, however, the RPG's stylized graphics are charming and vibrant. The character designs are also top-notch, as are the animations used in battles.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is an impressive game considering it can be played for free, and it is not going anywhere anytime soon.

  Considering
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  debuted on the Nintendo Switch, it should have been a given that Capcom's PS5 and Xbox Series X/S ports would be able to handle 4K and 60 FPS. However, the publisher went a step further by adding a Graphics Mode that aims for a higher resolution than 4K, although this does come at the expense of a locked frame rate.

  Featuring smaller areas than

  <em>

  Both modes are pleasing to the eye, but Resolution Mode does a decent job of maintaining 60 FPS in most situations. The performance might just dip during the campaign's more hectic moments. If someone owns a 4K TV, they should try
  <em>

  </em>
  's Resolution Mode to see for themselves if the performances work for them. If they decide that the extra pixels aren't worth uneven frames, Performance Mode will always be there.

  Arkane Studios'
  <em>
   Deathloop
  </em>
  is
  <em>
   Groundhog Day
  </em>
  with guns. An assassin has to take out eight targets in 24 hours, a process that proves to be anything but simple. Luckily (or unluckily, depending on someone's perspective), Colt keeps on reliving the day, allowing him to accumulate information as he seeks to perform a perfect run.

  New, successful IPs should be celebrated, particularly when it comes to ambitious RPGs. Bandai Namco's
  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus

  can't compare to the likes of
  <em>

  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus

  runs very well on the PS5.

  Arc System Works is among the best developers in the fighting game genre, even if the majority of the studio's franchises can be overwhelming for newcomers.
  <em>

  succeeds in reducing the license's entry barrier while retaining the tight and punishing combat system that has defined the series since its inception.

  It might have taken a while but Capcom finally released the

   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  game that fans deserve. Originally debuting in March 2019 for the PS4, Xbox One, and PC,
  <em>
   Devil May Cry 5
  </em>
  went next-gen with its
  <em>
   Special Edition
  </em>
  , a version that includes Vergil as a playable option.

 <p>
  Permitting ray tracing is disabled,
  <em>

 <p>
  A 2D roguelike running at 4K and 60 FPS on the PS5 is the bare minimum Sony's console should be able to deliver, but that does not mean
  <em>
   Rogue Legacy 2
  </em>
  is not worth highlighting. After all, Cellar Door Games' sequel is comfortably among the best action titles of the last few years, and it is a particularly easy recommendation for people interested in Metroidvanias. Building on its predecessor's extremely solid foundations, the sequel expands on the formula in ways that make it a considerable improvement, and that is not a criticism of the original
  <em>
   Rogue Legacy
  </em>
  .

  At the beginning of a playthrough, players pick a class and head out on a quest that will take them to a few distinct areas. Obviously, they will fight enemies, find loot, upgrade their skills, and eventually die; rather than restart from scratch, failure results in the birth of the next generation, and players get to pick from three random classes that come with their own quirks and strengths. This system constantly shakes up the core gameplay, ensuring boredom never sets in.

  is an ambitious entry to a long-running series. The

  <em>
   Valhalla

  is no different, bringing its feudal frontier to life as players explore and conquer the English countryside in the shoes of ninth-century Norse invaders.

  Like with other titles, gaming on the PS5 is a favorable prospect. Even with its graphical boost, the PS5 handily keeps up with

  demands and ensures that the player experience is as seamless as it is immersive.

  Charming and gorgeous,
  <em>
   Tunic
  </em>
  might be the best isometric action game on the PS5, and it is the closest thing the console has to a classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  adventure. Cast as a fox, players work their way through a beautiful but dangerous world that is structured similarly to a Metroidvania, in the sense that special abilities might need to be used to access certain areas. In terms of gameplay,
  <em>
   Tunic
  </em>
  has quite an involved combat system that takes a few hints from Souls-likes.

 <p>
  Visually, this is far from the most taxing project on Sony's modern system, so it is not all that surprising that
  <em>
   Tunic
  </em>
  manages to offer 4K and 60fps on the PS5. That said, the game's cartoonish graphics match its tone and story, and they should age gracefully over the coming decades.

  Technically,
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  was playable for more than a year on the PS5 before it started to take advantage of the system's potential; however, in March 2022, Respawn released the next-gen update and brought the multiplayer first-person shooter up to speed. Since then, PS5 owners have been able to play the game at 4K resolution and 60 FPS, which makes a world of difference for this type of release. At this point, anyone remotely interested in EA's free-to-play shooter has likely already made the plunge, and while not without its ups and downs,
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  has largely succeeded in keeping a consistent fan base.

 <p>
  Battle royale games are a dime-a-dozen, but
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  sets itself apart through its polished gameplay, squad-based matches, and incorporation of hero shooter ideas. Even more than four years after its original debut,
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  is still a lot of fun to play, and the title runs beautifully on current-generation systems. If someone is looking for a first-person shooter and is not sure what to try, they can do much worse than Respawn's successful project.

   <strong>
    Resident Evil

  might be one of the most celebrated gaming franchises, but it is not known for emotional depth. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Still, some bits of narrative gold seep through the cheesy dialog and absurd plots every now and again.

  The remake of the first game, inititally a GameCube exclusive, is a beautifully refined and perfected version of the classic survival horror formula. It not only improves gameplay, but it adds important narrative elements and expands the story of the mansion itself. Lisa Trevor is George Trevor's daughter, the architect of the mansion.

 <p>
  Journal entries detail the brutal experimentation the family went through at the hands of Umbrella. The grammar and spelling is so deformed in this quote because Lisa, just a young girl at that time, was undergoing a particularly heinous transmogrification. Players eventually have to put Lisa Trevor out of her misery, making this quote even more heartbreaking.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  remake adds some real quality to its writing and acting. It is nothing Oscar-worthy, but it is a dramatic improvement by the series' standards. During Claire's playthrough, she has to find a cure for Sherry Birkin's infection. Sherry's mother, Annette, is there with her but, unfortunately, is bitten.

 <p>
  As Sherry recovers, Annette apologizes to her daughter with her dying breath. Sherry is not even allowed sufficient time to mourn her own mother's passing, since the lab underneath the Raccoon City Police Department is on a countdown to destruction. As young as she is, Sherry understands this, gives her mother a goodbye kiss on the cheek, and leaves with Claire.

  Claire works with Steve Burnside throughout most of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Code: Veronica

  </strong>
  to escape the Ashford's island facility. Unfortunately, Steve is infected with the T-Veronica Virus. Steve turns into a giant green monster, and Claire runs away as he tries to control himself. Thankfully, Steve manages not to injure Claire and reverts to his human form.

  The two then have a brief moment together where he confesses his love for her just as he is about to pass away. It is easy to look at Steve's love for Claire as some spontaneous feelings sparked by the traumatic events around them, but it does not make the death confession any less romantic.

  There's a lot to be said about Ethan Winters, but one can say he does not love his family. From
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  all the way through to the
  <em>
   Shadows of Rose
  </em>
  DLC, all he does is protect and save his loved ones. Though he was thought to be dead by the end of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil Village
   </em>
  </strong>
  , some hints of his consciousness living on are there, and the DLC chapter confirms this.

 <p>
  He and Rose are finally able to share a moment together right as Eva is defeated. Ethan reiterates his love for his daughter and even apologizes for her having to saving him, but Rose assures him that she is happy to have this face-to-face after all these years.

  Sheva Alomar has only appeared in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 5
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  The game at least gives players her motivation for joining the BSAA. When she was just a kid, her parents died as a result of Umbrella's bioweapon experiments. Just like Chris is motivated by Jill Valentine's apparent death, so too is Sheva brought to her vocation by a need for justice and revenge.

  As any story about vengeance goes, completing the act does not actually make one feel better or bring closure. At least Sheva is using her motivation for something positive like ridding the world of bioweapons. All the same, it is sad to think that Sheva is only where she is now because of an unspeakable tragedy.

  Brad Vickers is not in
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  , but it is possible to see his lifeless body by following a select series of steps. A journal players can find in the N64 version gives him more characterization than
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  , where he actually shows up and is killed by Nemesis.

  The nostalgia for home in a dire situation is something many can relate to. Did Brad appreciate those flowers when he saw them with his own eyes?

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  has addressed a big elephant in the room and confirmed that Mimikyu will not debut at this year's Halloween event. The
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Pokedex has progressed over the years by adding the critters introduced over nine generations, and their variants. Still, the absence of some pocket monsters is felt.

 <p>
  One of the most notable omissions in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  is Mimikyu, a critter with one of the scariest origin stories. Featured in Gen 7, the Ghost/Fairy-type hides under an old rag that resembles a Pikachu, and no one knows its true appearance. The mystery is so great that stories say that seeing the pocket monster's real face can cause a terrible illness or death. Despite its being a Pokemon with really creepy origins, Mimikyu has become a much-loved name among fans and
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players, who have unfortunately received some bad news.

 <p>
  It has been confirmed that Mimikyu won't debut in this year's Halloween event in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . As reported by Dot Esports, at a press conference, senior product manager Kathy Woo revealed that there are no plans to add Mimikyu to the augmented reality game, despite requests from
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players. When asked, Woo said she couldn't share much about the monster, although she expressed interest in its debut. She did express, however, her hopes that Morpeko will be the first of more Pokemon with in-battle changes to be introduced to the game.

  Back in August, Niantic confirmed the addition of Morpeko to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , bringing a unique mechanic to the game. The critter featured in Gen 8 can switch between Full Belly Mode, where it's an Electric-type, and Hangry Mode, becoming a Dark-type. Mimikyu's gimmick is similar, with Disguised Form being when its costume is in place. If it is hit by an attack, it changes to Busted Form, with its neck tilted to the side and no longer resembling a Pikachu. The opponent responsible for damaging the disguise is the target of great resentment from the pocket monster, who will do anything to get revenge.

 <p>
  While the community continues to wait for Mimikyu's debut in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , the scary season looks promising for trainers. Research Day on October 19 gave trainers the chance to catch Yamask and Galarian Yamask. The first part of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's Halloween event will run from October 22 to 28, marking Morpeko's debut. And while not yet announced, the second part of the Halloween event is expected to run from October 28 and end on November 3.

  Solder almost felt like the main villain in the story of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  as a good chunk of early gameplay is focused on tracking him down. However, to the players' surprise, they locate Solder early on to finally confront him about the blunder, whether he betrayed Skiff in the beginning or not.

  After a brief struggle, you'll be presented with a choice to either

  </strong>
  . Even though the repercussions of your choice won't be immediately apparent, they have a big impact on the story down the line.

  Players will be able to confront Solder at the
  <strong>
   end of the "Behind Seven Seals" main mission
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  . You'll get to this point after asking about Solder around Zalissya, finding Squint, and retrieving Ward Sensors. Lastly, players must decide whether to
  <strong>
   hand over the Sensors to either Captain Zotov or Richter before infiltrating the Sphere.
  </strong>

 <p>
  No matter the choices you made before, it will ultimately lead to a confrontation with Solder that will have players choose whether to shoot Solder or knock him out. This is a timed choice, and players will need to make up their minds quickly. Shooting Solder might seem like the obvious thing to do, considering his scam in the beginning. However, he did explain that his job entails only marking anomalies on the map, and the intel mix-up in the beginning wasn't intentional.

 <p>
  So it's up to the players to either believe his words and spare him or simply shoot him up. Regardless, here are the

  So, keeping the fact that Solder didn't intentionally sell Skiff the wrong coordinates and that he plays a somewhat major role down the line,
  <strong>
   it's recommended to simply Knock Solder out in
   <em>
    Stalker 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . However, the decision is totally up to the players, as hardcore fans might be willing to experience both outcomes in multiple playthroughs.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Towers of Aghasba

  is proving to be quite a complex game for a survival builder, with lots of activities to complete and dozens of resources to gather before players can reach the end game. And
  <em>
   <strong>
    Leather
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of those scarce products that players might be wondering where to find. So, if players have reached this guide, they probably wondered how and where Leather is obtained in the game.

  To get Leather in Towers Of Aghasba, players will need to use the Tailor station. But to unlock this workbench, they have to complete a series of quests first. Here's what players need to do to get the Tailor Station:

  <li>
   Repair the Lutoro Bridge.

  <li>
   Reach Midhaven and Talk to the Forest God.
  </li>
  <li>
   Plant the Tropical Ecosystem King Seed.
  </li>
  <li>
   Start the Great Midhaven Restoration Project by talking to Ajit.
  </li>
  <li>
   Build the Lumbermill in Midhaven.

   Build the Alchemist.

   Finally, unlock the Tailor and build it using Hide, Tree Bark, and Resin.

 <p>
  Now players will get access to several things, starting with
  <strong>
   Leather crafting
  </strong>
  . Players can craft leather using
  <strong>
   2x ropes, 3x hides, and 1x resin
  </strong>
  , yielding 2 units of leather.

 <p>
  Hide can be obtained by hunting most animals around Template and Tropical Ecosystem, but watch out for Amity expenditure since it drops really fast without notice.
  <strong>
   Resin
  </strong>
  can be obtained by Resin Fir Trees, and Resin Pools, which pop up in Template Ecosystem.

 <p>
  There's a slight chance to get Resin from regular trees every time players chop them down. Remember that using makeshift Stone tools will have less chances than using superior tools like the Iron Hatchet, for example.
  <strong>
   Rope
  </strong>
  is the easiest to obtain, and it is hand-crafted using 2xFiber. Fiber is picked nearly all around the islands from Weeds, Bushes, and most Plants.

   <em>

  </strong>
  has announced that Necrozma and its fusions will return in a new Raid Day on December 14. This will be one of the first events of the next
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  season, giving players the chance to get some strong Pokemon that Niantic added this year.

 <p>
  Necrozma appeared for the first time during Pokemon GO Fest 2024 as a Special Research reward for players of the in-person events and in raids for trainers around the world. But that wasn't the only big news, as the devs confirmed the debut of Necrozma fusions in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , with Dusk Mane and Dawn Wings Necrozma becoming available during the GO Fest. And now, devs have big news related to them.

 <p>
  Necrozma and its fusions will return to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  on the upcoming Raid Day on December 14 from 2 pm to 5 pm local time. Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma will appear more frequently in raids, and defeating them will give trainers a chance to catch Necrozma. From December 13-14, from 5 pm to 8 pm PST, the Remote Raid Pass limit will be 20, and players will receive up to five additional Raid Passes by spinning PokeStops. For $5, a ticket will be available, allowing them to get more Raid Passes, XP, Stardust, and a chance to earn Candy XL. The game's online store will sell an Ultra Box for $4.99 with an event ticket and a Premium Battle Pass.

  With the return of the Legendary Pokemon of Alola and its fusions, the previous mechanics will also be back.

There will be no energy or candy cost to undo the fusions. Each fusion will have an Adventure Effect, with Sunsteel Strike (Dusk Mane Nerozma) attracting daytime Pokemon, and Moongeist Bean (Dawn Wings Necrozma) attracting nighttime critters.

  's Dual Destiny season. One of the main novelties is the return of Hoopa, something

   Pokemon GO

  had previously teased, with the Mythical Pokemon returning to the game after its debut in 2021. During the new season, which ends in March 2025, trainers will see the debuts of Sinistea and Polteageist, new Shadow Raids, and more.

  And while players eagerly eliminate the Lords of Hell as they wait for a Halls of Torment upgrade, they may want to make sure their characters are suitably upgraded with the right Blessings. Among must-haves for players are Blessings that boost their overall Health, the damage they deal on crit, and having a better chance of proccing a status effect when hitting foes.

  While this might seem a bit “small” for players, the added Health guarantees that players can take a lot more damage from enemies - a useful buff to have in higher levels where mobs and bosses can often take down players in just a few hits. Players gearing up for tanky builds could use Health Capacity as one of their defensive priorities. However, it’s not advisable to get Health Capacity at the onset, as players could use more buffs to their DPS given the game’s action-heavy nature.

  Fans who want to boost their damage potential should consider boosting their overall DPS with
  <strong>
   Crit Bonus
  </strong>
  , which increases by +6% per rank. This particular upgrade in
  <em>
   Halls of Torment
  </em>
  is a must-have for more damage-oriented players whose builds bank on building up as much firepower as possible throughout their playthrough.

 <p>
  Of course, Crit Bonus only works insofar as players can actually proc the crit in the first place, making Crit Bonus a viable tool to use only with crit-oriented builds. This Blessing works nicely with Crit Chance and Base Crit Chance - provided players manage to get their character up to a decent enough attack stat.

  While gameplay in
  <em>
   Halls of Torment
  </em>
  emphasizes how players can enjoy just duking it out against the forces of hell with attacks that build their DPS in the CRPG, other tactical players may appreciate punishing foes with a wide array of effects - Affliction, Burn, Curse, Fragile, Frost, Slow, Spark, or Stun. While players may consider focusing on dishing as much damage as they can with these elemental, debuff, and special effects, the
  <strong>
   Effect on Hit Chance
  </strong>
  Blessing combines the debilitating punishments of these effects with the sheer devastation of ordinary hits.

 <p>
  Players who want to make the most out of their heavy-hitting
  <em>
   Halls of Torment
  </em>
  setups will likely want a build that gives them more bang for their buck - literally. When taken in the context of most action-heavy titles, Attack Speed should be the way to go to maximize damage - especially when this stat is almost always set up to help players score more attacks in a shorter amount of time. However,
  <em>
   Halls of Torment
  </em>
  upends this gameplay concept with
  <strong>
   Multistrike
  </strong>
  , a Blessing that gives +6% Multistrike per rank.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1063} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  This Blessing essentially taps into the game’s Multistrike mechanic. Whereas Attack Speed allows players to score more hits in a limited amount of time, Multistrike increases the number of hits players can do with a single strike. Objectively speaking, Multistrike can get the most out of a certain timeframe for players, with the Blessing being compatible with Attack Speed in that a character can use the latter stat to get more Multistrikes in within a shorter amount of time.

  When it comes to a bullet hell game like
  <em>
   Halls of Torment
  </em>
  , it’s important for players to know how to position their characters to avoid being overwhelmed. With the Movement Speed Blessing, dodging enemy hordes and retreating to safe ground temporarily can bridge the gap between life and death.

 <p>
  Players get a
  <strong>
   permanent 6% boost to their base movement speed
  </strong>
  each time they upgrade a level of Movement Speed. Unlike other Blessings, Movement Speed
  <strong>
   doesn’t have any prerequisites.
  </strong>
  This means players can choose Movement Speed as one of the immediate upgradeable Blessings as soon as they head to the Shrine.

  In bullet hell games, lack of DPS can spell trouble in the long term when facing mobs, similar to an MMO. However, the Damage Blessing can grant enormous advantages to damage-reliant characters like the Swordsman, who can’t always depend on attack range and size.

  With each upgrade of Damage, players get a
  <strong>
   10% boost in overall attack damage dealt to enemies
  </strong>
  . This boost can circumvent the lack of range, as killing enemies with bigger numbers gives players more room to redirect attacks to other opponents, who are ordinarily unreachable. To unlock this Blessing, a Swordsman needs to
  <strong>
   complete the “Strong Arms” quest
  </strong>
  within “Story: Path of the Sword,” which requires them to secure the Strength 4 trait in a single run.

  Being a bullet hell game,
  <em>
   Halls of Torment

  players must strategically time their attacks to ensure they hit a lot of opponents in a single strike. With Attack Speed, players can get a much-needed boost in attack speed to strike enemies before they hit them in a manner similar to timing Charged Attacks in

  Each upgrade in Attack Speed grants a

  Granted, even melee characters like the Swordsman have a longer cone-shaped attack range in
  <em>
   Halls of Torment
  </em>
  . Thanks to the Attack Range Blessing, melee-reliant classes like the Swordsman can hit more with every strike. Meanwhile, the likes of the Ranger and the Exterminator can attack bosses and elites before they pose a threat to players.

  Each level in Attack Range adds a
  <strong>
   permanent 8% boost to all attacks and abilities

  that the players release on enemies. When combined with a boosted attack area or projectile size, this allows players to hit more opponents at a distance with just a few strikes. This Blessing

 <p>
  Attacks and abilities in
  <em>
   Halls of Torment
  </em>
  can come in a wide variety of forms that affect enemies in different ways, similar to weapon choices in RPGs. With Area/Projectile Size, a player’s base attacks can reach more enemies.

 <p>
  Whenever players purchase Area/Projectile Size as an upgrade, they get an
  <strong>
   8% boost to the size of their projectiles and AOE attacks.
  </strong>
  This can have a huge impact on the way players establish their playthroughs since the increased size of attacks means spreading more damage across multiple foes and being able to kill them much faster.

  In
  <em>
   Halls of Torment,
  </em>
  characters have a range where items immediately go to them. With Pickup Range, players get a
  <strong>
   20% boost to their base pickup range
  </strong>
  , meaning they don’t need to get as close to loot before it gets dragged into their inventory.

 <p>
  Although this doesn’t necessarily boost a player’s overall stats, Pickup Range gives players the advantage of getting life-saving items when overwhelmed with foes. Instead of going neck-deep into enemy territory to get loot, the increased Pickup Range can allow players to benefit from much-needed drops even at a distance.

  When gameplay proves dangerous, players can simply run away and recover health slowly before diving in for another round of smiting. With the Health Regeneration Blessing, players can boost their odds of survival with stronger passive regen.

  The Health Regeneration Blessing
  <strong>
   boosts health regen by +0.15/s for each level up
  </strong>
  . This means maxing out Health Regeneration gives players a permanent +0.75/s boost. This can be a big deal in the long term, considering a tanky character like the Swordsman can have 500 Max HP. Unlocking this Blessing is simple, as players simply need to
  <strong>
   unlock the “Thirsty” Milestone
  </strong>
  . To achieve this, players need to consume 10 Health Potions as any character.

 <p>
  When players manage to kill one lord in their
  <em>
   Halls of Torment
  </em>
  playthrough, the game grants them the Milestones (Survivor 1) achievement. This unlocks the Revives Blessing which, when purchased, will
  <strong>
   allow players to revive once whenever they visit the Halls.
  </strong>
  Since each upgrade increases the revive opportunities by one, the upgrade’s maximum will allow players
  <em>
  </em>
  to revive twice in each gameplay session.

 <p>
  This opportunity to revive allows players to get much further in a playthrough. Considering the game’s increasingly difficult levels the longer players stay in the Halls, the option to continue gameplay after accidents or being overwhelmed by mobs can be more worthwhile compared to other buffs.

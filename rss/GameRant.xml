  Blizzard Entertainment has released patch 2.1.2 for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s second February 2025 update, which is now live for players to stress test and marvel over the various bug fixes to the base game and the
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  expansion.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ’s previous update was released on February 7, and it was a substantially smaller patch fixing an issue where colors could appear overly saturated on HDR displays and implementing various stability improvements.
 </p>
 <p>
  The online-only action RPG dungeon crawler was released in 2023 and serves as the fourth main installment in the
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  series. Players are tasked with navigating the world of Sanctuary where cultists have summoned the daughter of Mephisto, Lilith, and Wanderers can tailor their experience by choosing six different classes: Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, Sorcerer, or Spiritborn. The game received generally positive reviews and
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ’s 2024 expansion,
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  , is considered a top-ranking experience within the best
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  games list.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blizzard previously released the
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  update 2.1.2 patch notes a few days earlier, and the team noted that players’ feedback would be monitored during its release, and the patch notes would be updated with any further fixes. A newer update deployed a fix to the Season of Witchcraft gameplay, thwarting an issue where Twilight Warding caused players to deal damage to themselves. Additionally, it was noted this power would be re-enabled once the update went live.

  Diablo 4's February 2.1.2 Update Is Now Live
 </h2>
 <p>
  The patch was well received by the
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  community, with most keen to jump back into Season of Witchcraft, but a few players noted the Ring of Mendeln was still not fixed. Season 7 was released back in January and
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ’s Season of Witchcraft checked a major feature off Wanderers’ wish lists. While investigating the mystery surrounding who stole the Heads from the Tree of Whispers, players can also harness the new Eldritch, Psyche, and Growth &amp; Decay powers in season 7, hunt the Headrotten demon, and indulge fresh Whispers with the Tree offering an Ancestral Collection.

 <p>
  Despite
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  ’s successful release,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  fans were given some bad news recently when Blizzard confirmed the game’s second expansion wouldn’t be launching until 2026. The developer was on track to honor the plan to release content annually, but the team noted they were focusing on quality over rushed content, despite players’ disappointment over not receiving any new content in 2025. The decision does have its positive points, however, as it solidifies Blizzard’s commitment to avoid releasing half-baked products.

  There are plenty of monsters and other threats in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and while the game's skill-based action combat system will let you outsmart and outplay your opponents, you'll still need to upgrade your gear if you want to tackle challenges that lie deep within the Living Lands.

  Upgrading your gear in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  is a simple and straightforward process, but as with all other games that have such a mechanic, you'll need to gather a ton of upgrade materials. Getting resources in bulk is a little tricky, so here are a few quick tips on how to get more as quickly as possible.

  To start, there are five different types of upgrade materials in the game: ores, plants, pelts, wood, and Adra. These are further split into five different categories based on their quality (Common, Fine, Exceptional, etc). You can get materials by
  <strong>
   harvesting or looting them from the world, buying from merchants, or dismantling unwanted gear
  </strong>
  . All upgrade materials in the game include:

  The great thing about
  <em>
   Avowed

  is it gives players the option to mark resources on their minimap. This feature should be on by default, but if it's not, go to the UI tab in the Settings menu and check the options at the bottom of the list.

 <p>
  When looting, it's best to
  <strong>
   dismantle Common gear and sell anything that's Fine tier and beyond
  </strong>
  . Items that are Tier 2 and above sell for ludicrous amounts of money — you can use your earnings to buy upgrade materials and other goods.

  If you have an excess of materials, you can convert them into their higher-quality versions by visiting the upgrade bench in your party camp in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  . From there, select the Crafting tab, and you should be able to see all the materials you can make.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crafting feature will also let you
  <strong>
   downgrade materials
  </strong>
  , which is especially helpful if you want to change your build but don't have any other upgraded weapons and armor. All craftable materials will appear in the
  <strong>
   Downgrade tab
  </strong>
  of the crafting menu, so make sure to double-check if you have all the materials you need for upgrades.

  Microsoft's
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  is arguably gaming's definitive subscription service. Part of that reputation stems from the company's willingness to allow major exclusives to debut directly on Game Pass, along with a fairly impressive range of third-party Day One arrivals. However, something that cannot be underappreciated is the platform's variety, offering something for just about every preference or situation. Along with fantastic single-player options, many of the
  <strong>
   best Xbox co-op games
  </strong>
  are also on Game Pass.

  While not the first
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game to launch on Game Pass,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is the first Day One release, an absolutely huge deal. Sure, Activision's shooter was always going to be among 2024's best-selling projects and did not need the subscription service rub to find a community, but that does not reduce the appeal of this arrival. Putting aside the core audience that buys every entry,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Game Pass availability means that lapsed players who had grown tired of the series now have an easy excuse to jump back in, something that Treyarch has tried to take advantage of by incorporating a more traditional story campaign compared to some underwhelming recent entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although that mode is solely single-player,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is naturally designed around multiplayer, be it PvP or co-op. The classic multiplayer modes include options like Deathmatch, Kill Order, and Domination, and they largely revolve around 6v6 matches. Cooperation might not always be prioritized, but teams that work together generally win together. However,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's main co-op offering is Zombies, which is back and as good as ever. While
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  tried to shake up the core loop, its successor wisely opted to return to the formula that had proven successful for roughly a decade, playing mostly similar to
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  's Zombies. After picking one of the two available maps, four players have to survive waves of zombies while gradually unlocking new areas, weapons, and abilities. A few changes aside,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies mode seems set to go down as one of the franchise's better iterations, and hopefully, it will continue to improve over the coming months.

  Considering it had a fairly tepid launch,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  has blossomed into a fantastic multiplayer-driven project. Four players can team up to form a pirate crew and head out into the unknown in search of treasure, adventure, and maybe a Kraken. While solo explorers do exist, they will be at a disadvantage since
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  is intended with co-op and PvP in mind.
 </p>

  Even though more than five years have passed since the game's debut, Rare is still regularly producing updates that introduce fresh events and loot. There is almost always something new for a crew to discover in

  Originally known as
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown
  </em>
  before going through a substantial makeover, the
  <em>
   1986
  </em>
  variant is an addictive extraction shooter that challenges players to take part in hunts, all in the hope of gaining some mouthwatering loot. While the main goal is to take out a Bounty Hunt's main boss, hunters can also decide to just pick up smaller loot and get out of dodge, which is a valid option as permadeath is a thing, and losing a strong hunter can be painful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  can technically be played solo, with players just looking out for number one; however, the game generally prioritizes teams of two or three members. As a PvPvE game,
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  's greatest challenge is often the other players who are trying to score big, and hunting solo can be a sure-fire recipe for a spectacular loss.

  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  is a survival-building game with procedural generation, deep crafting, solid combat, and 8-player co-op. The latter was a staple part of the game during its early access run, all the way to its full release in August 2024, and co-op brings a new dimension to a title that has a lot of them. Putting multiplayer to the side for a second,
  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  is primarily marketed as a single-player experience, and most people will likely jump into a solo campaign long before they consider inviting somebody to come and take a look.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dropped into a dark and expansive world, players are told to "figure it out," a process that involves a lot of digging, resource gathering, and stumbling. Initially,
  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  can feel rather aimless, which would be an issue if the core mechanics were not strong from the start. Fortunately, crafting, combat, and building are immediately fun and, more importantly, improve as time goes by and players unlock more options or grow more confident.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  is addictive in the way that only certain indie survival-crafting games seem to be, and it is currently among that genre's best versions. The co-op is the icing on the cake that enhances the overall package, and it gives the game a more relaxing and cozy tone.

  Both
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  games are on Xbox Game Pass, and they are fantastic co-op experiences. The Soulslike genre is no stranger to multiplayer, but it tends to be a fairly small part of the overall package; however,
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  and its successor are exceptions. While solo is a viable option in both entries, the games are undeniably designed with co-op in mind, particularly the sequel. Although garnering criticism for some technical issues at launch, especially on PC,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is generally superior to its predecessor, and newcomers can just jump into the 2023 release without worrying too much about feeling lost.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is, essentially, a third-person shooter Soulslike, although melee weapons are also available. Still, the gameplay prioritizes ranged combat above everything else, and it is generally weighty and satisfying. At the start of a playthrough, players build a character and pick an archetype, which acts as a class. These options are all designed around specific roles, and most of them are intended to be complementary to each other. The only exception is Handler since that archetype is tailored for solo play.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using procedural-generation technology and featuring a wide assortment of worlds that each come with unique esthetics,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is ambitious and addictive.

  While not part of the series initially,
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  did start to implement co-op from the third entry.
  <em>
   Far Cry 4
  </em>
  was the first to allow two players to experience (most of) the campaign together, a formula that was improved, fine-tuned, and perfected by
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  . Although arguably more polarizing than its two immediate predecessors, the Montana-based entry is arguably the best co-op game in the franchise, along with just being of the better open-world options. Except for a handful of opening missions, players will be able to join forces for the entire campaign, although only the host's story progression will be saved. As long as the guest does not mind that fact, they should try out this title.
 </p>
 <p>
  A rare direct sequel,
  <em>
   Far Cry New Dawn
  </em>
  is not generally hailed as one of the best entries in Ubisoft's franchise, and the game is especially difficult to recommend to people who have not played
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  . While fun to see Hope County in a post-nuclear war climate, the map is very similar to the original game, and the setting is one of the most repetitive in the series. The story does not hit the same highs as its predecessor either, although the sibling villains are entertaining enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  For all its flaws,
  <em>
   Far Cry New Dawn
  </em>
  is still a great co-op experience, and its focus on shorter missions complements multiplayer well. While not recommendable as a standalone release,
  <em>
   New Dawn
  </em>
  is certainly worth playing as an extension of
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  .

  Although garnering largely positive reviews at launch,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  got a second lease on life when it debuted on Xbox Game Pass. The long-overdue sequel does not sound that impressive on paper, and if someone was not a big fan of the original, they might struggle to justify dropping cash to just have another opportunity to kill a few zombies in a good but seemingly not great game. However,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  just feels incredible to play, which is something that might not come across via gameplay footage or screenshots. Featuring a visceral gore system that makes dissecting the undead a deeply satisfying experience,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  focuses on getting the basics right, and it nails them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Primarily known for its single-player, the 2023 release is a fantastic solo option, and an argument could be made that new players should start with this mode before trying co-op. That said, Dambuster implemented the latter feature well, ensuring that both hosts and guests are on an even footing. Co-op becomes available early in the campaign too, so players won't have to wait long before they can play together. That said, players need to be on the same missions to join forces, otherwise, the person who is further along in the campaign will need to join as a guest and help their friends in their earlier quests.

  games, and they not only cover a wide spectrum of genres but also quality.
  <em>
   Darktide
  </em>
  is among the franchise's better releases in recent years, and its action-heavy gameplay should also satisfy non-fans who are just looking to shoot and dice their way through hordes of zombie-esque creatures. The game offers four playable classes, each of which feels wildly different to control. They all have their positives, and most players will likely find themselves gravitating to one or two of the characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Darktide
  </em>
  's 4-class setup obviously lends itself to co-op play, to the point of the game not launching with a solo mode. The campaign can get quite punishing at times, so party members will need to work together if they want to survive against the game's various bosses.

  Obsidian's resume speaks for itself, particularly when it comes to character-driven RPGs. However,
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  saw the developer step into uncharted territory known as the survival genre. After being shrunk down to miniature size, players find themselves walking beneath a lawn's leaves and cowering in the face of insects. Along with story-driven exploration with the goal of freedom, players will need to monitor and react to the behavior of the entities that make up this area's ecosystem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  works beautifully as a single-player adventure, but it also supports online co-op. In fact, Obsidian even allows people to create a Shared World that can be accessed without needing a host to be present. The game features four playable characters who interact with each other during co-op sessions, which enhances the multiplayer's immersion.

  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  took the gaming world by storm when it launched into early access (or Game Preview on Xbox) on January 19, 2024. On paper, an open-world survival game where players catch
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  -esque creatures and engage in third-person shooter action sounds like a recipe for both success and disaster. Surely, such an ambitious title cannot conceivably come together to create a cohesive whole; yet,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  kind of clicks. Now, it is important to remember that Pocket Pair is still working on this project, and the current version is not only subject to change but also has plenty of room to grow. Technical issues are also normal, although
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is not a broken mess either.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set on the Palpagos Islands,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  challenges players to survive and thrive. The former involves stocking up on necessities and building a base, while the latter requires exploring the impressive world in search of resources and Pals to catch. Monster-taming goes beyond battles as well, as Pals come with special abilities that allow them to be useful at bases or when traveling the map. While not the most complex survival project ever,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  's success lies in its clever incorporation of various genres and mechanics that are typically not associated with each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although suitable for solo adventurers,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is also designed with online co-op in mind, with players having the option to jump into 32-user servers or to team up with three of their friends. While its implementation comes with a few wrinkles that can be frustrating, this feature brings a whole new dimension to the experience that can help keep the gameplay loop engaging once players start to feel like they have seen almost everything currently in the game.

  Despite its age,
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  is firmly established as a cornerstone of the online co-op scene, and that does not seem likely to change anytime soon. At this point, Overkill's game does not need an introduction since it has been easily accessible for a very long time; still, if a group of friends is looking for an FPS game they can play together, they cannot do much better than this 2015 release.
 </p>
 <p>
  Basically, the gameplay loop revolves entirely around planning and executing heists. As part of a crew, players accept contracts and jump onto a map where they have a few avenues they can follow if they want to escape with their loot.
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  does a great job of shaking things up just enough so that each heist feels unique and emergent, a factor that is also enhanced by a skill tree system.

  Despite launching with enough issues to warrant a less-than-stellar initial reception, Funcom's
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  has shown impressive longevity. More than half a decade after its release, the survival game is still going relatively strong, amassing a dedicated fanbase that has kept it alive through positive word of mouth and a decent modding community on PC. A potential reason for its continual success is versatility –
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  can morph to suit someone's preferences. Want a single-player campaign with a fixed story that can be completed within 30 hours or so? Then,
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  should hit the mark, even if its plot is nothing too special. Want to see how long you can survive in a cutthroat hellscape when starting with basically nothing?
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  should be perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to multiplayer, Funcom allows for both PvE and PvP servers, and co-op is technically possible in both. That said, if a group of players mainly want to work together, they should go for a private server that does not allow PvP. Along with not being extremely popular, the latter can be frustrating when players who just want to build a base and explore have to constantly contend with raids. As a co-op survival game,
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  can be very fun, particularly when beginners get through the first few hours of a campaign.

  Saber Interactive's
  <em>
   World War Z
  </em>
  was decent when it launched in 2019 as a zombie-fueled third-person shooter with a heavy emphasis on co-op gameplay. Sticking somewhat close to
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  's blueprint while still innovating in a few key ways, the game offered a fun albeit uneven time, and it did lack longevity. Nowadays, the original title is difficult to recommend since it has been rendered moot by
  <em>
   Aftermath
  </em>
  , a definition version that comes with an expansion. Along with a plethora of fresh content like new stages and an eighth class,
  <em>
   World War Z
  </em>
  has also morphed into a more complete and satisfying overall package, one that can stand toe-to-toe with most modern online co-op shooters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Campaign-wise,
  <em>
   WWZ
  </em>
  does not hold too many surprises since it follows a fairly straightforward formula. Players pick from a few character classes and have to plow their way through a handful of episodes set in different locations. While the story is forgettable, a shame considering it is set in the same universe as a great novel, the action is consistently entertaining thanks to
  <em>
   WWZ
  </em>
  's impressively large and aggressive zombie hordes. The classes are well-defined and cover a wide range of gameplay styles, allowing players to pick their favorites and craft balanced teams.

  Hoxxes IV holds many riches and even more hazards. Working for the eponymous corporation, players are charged with diving into the alien planet's underground caverns to dig for resources, a process that tends to attract the attention of the aggressive and buggy locales. Thankfully, the playable dwarves are more than capable of defending themselves through an array of weapons and even a few skills.
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  is a co-op treat that can be played almost endlessly thanks to its procedurally generated levels, and the game offers one of the best demonstrations of that technology's potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before heading out into the depths, players can pick from
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  's four classes, all of whom serve specific roles that set them apart from their companions. As each dwarf can be leveled up independently, the game encourages users to swap them around as needed until they find a class they unquestionably prefer. While enjoyable in single-player,
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  improves immensely when experienced alongside a few friends. This goes beyond the idea that "multiplayer makes everything better" since the gameplay is obviously intended to be played in co-op. The classes work well in solo runs, but their full potential can only be unlocked by linking up with their fellow dwarves.

  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  has become a staple of not only single-player content but also co-op ones.
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  is no exception, offering up to four players the opportunity to form a party and go on hunts together. Obviously, this comes with a spike in difficulty for the battles, although the game is still among the easier entries in the franchise. Now, complete newcomers might want to start with the single-player village quests just to get a hand of things and learn the basic mechanics; while this content does not support multiplayer, it should take less than 10 hours to complete and essentially acts as a glorified tutorial. More importantly, all the quests in the hub can be played in co-op, and these missions are the real meat of the package.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  is all about fine-tuning builds to cater to a specific monster, and the incorporation of multiple party members provides more room for experimentation. In solo runs, targeting multiple monsters per expedition can be too time-consuming, but this is more feasible when a few hunters are working together.

  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  and co-op are synonymous, which made the fact that
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  launched without the feature inexcusable. Eventually, 343 added online co-op support to the campaign, although the developer also made the controversial decision to nix local co-op. Due to everything that has happened since its launch,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  cannot be described as an unbridled success for Xbox, but the game's triumphs should not be dismissed either.
 </p>
 <p>
  The campaign is ambitious, expansive, and, a blast to play through. Sure, it has some pacing issues and a rather rough ending, but the positives outweigh the negatives. The same can also be said for
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's online co-op, which has a few frustrating moments but is largely fantastic. Co-op works better during the campaign's linear missions than its open-world, but the latter is still enjoyable provided players stick relatively close to each other.

   The Quarry
  </em>
  adheres to Supermassive's "horror movies but playable" formula, casting players as camp counselors who find themselves in the middle of a slasher flick. The game pays clear homage to the genre's staples, crafting a slow but gripping story that emphasizes player choice and mystery. Although fun solo, these types of games are made for co-op, and Supermassive tends to provide different couch and online experiences.
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  is no exception.
 </p>
 <p>
  In local co-op,
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  assigns characters to players, allowing them to control their destinies and make decisions that could also impact other people. This mode is a blast and presents the game at its best. Online co-op opts for a different approach that has its positives but is also more polarizing. Rather than each player controlling one character, the host handles everything while everyone else watches along, sort of similar to a movie. When decisions need to be made, everyone gets a vote, enabling the group to decide as a unit. While resulting in tense situations when the vote is split, this method also means that most participants will not be doing anything for large stretches of the campaign. It is not for everyone.

  Hazelight's
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  support local co-op, but they are such seminal cooperative experiences that they still need to be highlighted. And, their online support is implemented well, so players who cannot play locally will not be missing out on much. Both titles must be played in co-op and tell stories specifically driven by two playable characters and their relationships.
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  follows two convicts as they try to escape from a maximum security prison, with the story not only covering their plan but also the aftermath. Vincent and Leo are fully-formed characters with well-defined backstories and personalities, and they play off each other brilliantly. The gameplay is entirely driven by co-op, requiring players to coordinate their actions to complete missions.
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  is not very hard or mechanically complex, but everything comes together to tell a captivating story.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  contains many of the same hallmarks as
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  , albeit with a wildly different tone. This time, players step in the shoes of parents who are on the verge of calling it quits; however, a supernatural intervention sees them confined to their daughters' dolls. If that is not strange enough, they end up going on a very bizarre and fantastical adventure, all the while trying to mend their relationship. With strong writing, adaptive gameplay, great visuals, and just plain old fun,
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  might be the
  <strong>
   best online co-op game on Game Pass
  </strong>

  Another project that supports local and online co-op,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is a great option for people who want to laugh, argue, and have fun. As the title suggests, the gameplay revolves around moving furniture, with players taking charge of a relocation company willing to cross dimensions to complete jobs. While the original game can get pretty silly, the sequel amps up the absurdity, offering a bizarre setting that embraces multiverse concepts. Excessive as that might sound for what is ultimately a pretty casual experience, it complements the story's comedic tone well.
 </p>
 <p>
  The core loop involves overcoming physics to ensure that many items arrive at their destination in one piece, which is easier said than done. Like all the best co-op releases,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is equally likely to ruin or strengthen friendships, and that potential frustration is part of the appeal. Also, this game needs to be played with a partner as solo runs are just nowhere near as entertaining.

  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has led a controversial life, but Blizzard's action RPG has come fairly far since its launch. That said, as a multiplayer option, the game has always been worthwhile. Couch co-op is arguably ideal, but the online version has its benefits, including allowing parties of four players rather than two. Friends can play through the campaign as a unit, progressing together along the way as long as they are at the same point in their respective runs (the host determines the quest point).
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its polarizing aspects,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is nevertheless built on an addictive combat-loot loop that can be hard to find in other games. Co-op allows and encourages parties to craft complementary characters, an element that is not part of single-player runs.

  2025 is still defined by (seemingly) endless possibilities. Over the coming months, plenty of projects will make their Xbox Game Pass debuts, some of which have been announced while others are still mysteries. Major releases like
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  should keep single-player fans busy for the immediate future, but people craving multiplayer experiences also have a few things to look forward to.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Commandos: Origins
   </em>
   – Expected to drop in April 2025,
   <em>
    Commandos: Origins
   </em>
   is the latest entry in Kalypso's real-time tactics franchise, which looks set to be a prequel. The mission-based campaign features six characters with unique abilities, and players will have freedom in how they can approach the challenges. The game will support 2-player co-op, both online and local.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Subnautica 2
   </em>
   – In a somewhat unexpected move,
   <em>
    Subnautica 2
   </em>
   will feature a multiplayer component, allowing up to four players to take on the story together. Like its predecessor, the sequel will likely focus on exploration, with the story taking place in a new world that mostly consists of water. The title will enter Game Preview at some point in 2025.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    33 Immortals
   </em>
   – Now, here is a unique co-op experience.
   <em>
    33 Immortals
   </em>
   lives up to its name by allowing 33 players to fight off waves of monsters in an action-roguelike setting. The gameplay should be chaotic.

 <p>
  The best way to farm Alchemy XP in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  is to brew
  <strong>
   Strong Marigold Decoctions
  </strong>
  . These potions are very easy to craft, and it takes about a minute to finish one batch of them. To brew strong variants of these potions, use this recipe and follow it perfectly:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Pour water in the cauldron, then lower it into the flame.
  </li>
  <li>
   Add 1 Nettle to the cauldron.
  </li>
  <li>
   Flip the sandglass.
  </li>
  <li>
   While the sandglass is turned, add two Marigold to the mortar.
  </li>
  <li>
   Raise the cauldron.
  </li>
  <li>
   Grind the Marigold.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pour the decoction into a phial.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Keep in mind that
  <strong>
   the amount of XP you get from brewing potions depends on the quality of your end product
  </strong>
  . Strong Marigold Decoctions give more XP compared to just brewing normal potions, and they take no time at all to craft. Keep repeating this recipe, and you'll max out your Alchemy skill eventually.

  Getting ingredients for Strong Marigold Decoctions is very easy, as both Marigold and Nettle grow right outside the Alchemy bench in the Troskowitz apothecary's property. There's a bunch of Marigold growing
  <strong>
   right outside the Alchemy station
  </strong>
  , and you can find tons of Nettle
  <strong>
   along the road just west of the Alchemy station's shed
  </strong>
  .

  You can increase the amount of XP you earn from brewing potions by getting
  <strong>
   Wonders of Nature
  </strong>
  , a perk under the Scholarship skill. You need to have at least a level 8 Scholarship skill to get that, however. If you want to level this skill up, find or buy some books and start reading about new things. Wonders of Nature gives you
  <strong>
   a 20% bonus to all XP earned for the Survival and Alchemy skills
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you reach level 16 in Alchemy, we strongly recommend brewing Henry's Fox potions. Take note that "Henry's" here refers to the quality of a potion — you can only make Henry-quality brews once you get the
  <strong>
   Secret of Secrets Alchemy perk
  </strong>
  . Drinking a Henry's Fox potion
  <strong>
   increases your XP gains by 50% for two days
  </strong>
  .

  Accessories play a big part in making character builds for

   There's a cave in the lower portion of the cliff wall

  , and you'll find Painter's Brush inside a chest there.
 </p>
 <p>
  The area surrounding the camp and cave are relatively safe. There should be no enemies roaming around, which is great considering how monsters in Wildwood are of Exceptional quality and above. You'll need gear of matching quality in order to be at your most effective. Otherwise, your attacks will deal less damage and possibly bounce off of targets.

  This is a straightforward accessory occupying your Amulet slot that
  <strong>
   increases your critical hit chance by 5%
  </strong>
  . This isn't much, but there are very few items in the game that increase your crit chance. This is especially useful for high-damage melee builds in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  , as you're going to need all the damage you can get to compensate for a lack of magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Painter's Brush is best paired with the
  <strong>
   Critical Strike
  </strong>
  passive from the Ranger skill tree. This gives you an additional crit chance of 25%, with an extra 3-9% based on what weapon you're using. If you want to build hard into critical strikes, take the
  <strong>
   Devastating Criticals
  </strong>
  skill from the Fighter Tree as well to maximize your crit damage.

  Painter's Brush is the only accessory in the game that provides a flat crit chance bonus. If you want to further increase your crit chance,
  <strong>
   you'll need to boost your Perception stat
  </strong>
  .

  After what has felt like an eternity of waiting,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has finally been revealed, though only through a cryptic teaser. The teaser hardly reveals anything outright, aside from some Eridian writing and the image of a mysterious face at the end of the trailer, which some fans initially deduced might be Handsome Jack — the main antagonist from
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  . Unfortunately, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford almost immediately laid those theories to rest, stating that the image shown in the trailer was not Handsome Jack but "something far more dangerous and sinister."

 <p>
  Despite
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  's presumed main antagonist not being Handsome Jack, the idea of it being far more dangerous and sinister than the iconic villain could be just what the series needs. The
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  franchise has now seen several main villains antagonizing its world and the Vault Hunters attempting to thwart their schemes, but the comedic antics of the most recent mainline installment's villains were highly controversial. As such,
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  returning to a villain whose goals and personality might mirror and even improve upon Handsome Jack's sounds promising.

  Borderlands 3's Villains Weren't Serious or Threatening Enough
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  is by no means a bad game and its initial reviews say that much, but it might just be the most divisive of any mainline
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game ever made. The
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  series has always been known for its over-the-top humor and exaggerated violence, so that's to be expected of a new installment. However,
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  arguably takes things a bit too far in that regard, even to the point that its villains, the Calypso Twins, aren't threatening enough to be taken seriously. Their personalities, along with their goals, don't make them anywhere near the villain that Handsome Jack is — of course, it could be argued that any villains following Handsome Jack were doomed from the start.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":957} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  In keeping with modern trends, as
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  has been known to do, the Calypso Twins are modeled after social media influencers like those that can be found on YouTube, Twitch, and Instagram. Their personalities are a bit overblown, to the point that their meme potential drastically outweighs the threat that they pose. They certainly have the charisma of Handsome Jack, as any decent social media influencer should, but they aren't quite dark or menacing enough to merit being simultaneously feared and respected, as Handsome Jack is. Finally, it quickly becomes painfully obvious in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  that the Calypso Twins are trying really hard to be another Handsome Jack, which only makes things worse.

  Borderlands 4's Dark Villain Might Make Up for Borderlands 3's Shortcomings
 </h3>
 <p>
  It's good news that
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  's villain sounds like a much bigger threat than Handsome Jack, as that might play a major role in the game's success. What
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  needs to ensure it doesn't do is try to recreate the second game's antagonist in some way. Regardless of how much the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  community has come to love Handsome Jack over the years, there is no justification for attempting to clone his personality and goals as
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  tried and failed to do. It is an endeavor that will likely always result in a failed outcome, so
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  needs to avoid it at all costs.

 <p>
  According to what is shown in the
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  teaser trailer, it could be that The Watcher is this installment's antagonist, who was originally revealed in 2014's
  <em>
   Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel
  </em>
  . At the very least, the teaser trailer has Eridian literally and figuratively written all over it, suggesting the alien race will play a significant role in
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  . If that is the case, it could be a very dark entry indeed, taking players deeper into the backstory of the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  franchise than they have ever been before.

Once it is over, fight the Apramana bat to claim its Spirit. This must be done before beating Yellowbrow.

      Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 has endured a small review-bombing campaign on Steam following its early access launch.
     </li>
     <li>
      Some Steam users have taken issues with the fact that the game stealth-installs Epic Online Services and has a rather comprehensive EULA requiring players to agree to personally identifiable data collection.
     </li>
     <li>
      Although Space Marine 2 hence debuted with a "Mixed" user review label on Steam, its ratings have already improved to "Mostly Positive" by September 7.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been the subject of a review-bombing campaign on Steam. While the effort initially managed to mess with the game's overall user rating on Valve's storefront,
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  has already largely recovered from it.

  The sequel to Relic Entertainment's 2011 third-person shooter is officially scheduled to hit the market on Monday, September 9. However, anyone who has pre-ordered one of the higher-tier editions of

  has been able to jump into the game since September 5.

  Space Marine 2 Review-Bombed Over Epic Online Services and Privacy Concerns
 </h2>
 <p>
  And while
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  was met with largely positive reviews from critics, its initial audience reception has been somewhat more polarizing. That's reflected in the fact that the game debuted with "Mixed" user ratings on Steam, as hundreds of early adopters decided to review it negatively on Valve's storefront due to its reliance on Epic Online Services and a rather exhaustive end-user license agreement (EULA) that raised some privacy concerns. On the subject of the former, some players have taken issue with the fact that
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  installs Epic Online Services without informing them about it. The framework itself is used by the shooter for offering cross-platform multiplayer.

 <p>
  Game Rant's review of
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's EULA suggests it is comparable to those attached to most other contemporary Saber Interactive titles, including
  <em>
   Teardown
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   SnowRunner
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Expeditions: A MudRunner Game
  </em>
  . While all of these mandate players to agree to some degree of personal data collection by publisher Focus Entertainment, none of their clauses are anything out of the ordinary compared to what the average multiplayer game requires these days. The information that players agree to have collected comprises their demographic data and in-game statistics.

  Space Marine 2 Steam Reviews Improved Following Early Access Launch
 </h3>
 <p>
  The shooter's overall Steam rating improved to "Mostly Positive" as of September 7. The game currently sits at a 76% player recommendation rate on the platform, meaning it's just four percentage points short of attaining the "Positive" review label. Looking at the contents of its latest negative user reviews, the backlash against the game's EULA and stealth installation of Epic Online Services has largely died down, with most of the current player criticism being directed at some newly discovered
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  bugs.

 <p>
  Meanwhile, the game's critical reception has been nothing short of stellar. This is reflected in its "Strong" OpenCritic rating, derived from an 89% reviewer recommendation rate and an aggregate score of 83.

  Despite starring a protagonist who has never filled that role in a mainline
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  installment,
  <strong>
   <em>
    T he Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  looks more and more like a classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game with every reveal, wearing its franchise connections on its sleeve with recurring characters, themes, and resources. One such recurring character who hasn't been seen in the franchise for two decades is now returning in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  to provide Zelda with some valuable items.

  The Business Scrub is a recurring side character in the
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  series, offering players important, albeit expensive, items they may need on their adventure. In
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , however, the Business Scrub runs the game's smoothie shops in its most distinguished role in nearly 26 years.

  Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's Business Scrub Hasn't Been Around Since Zelda: The Minish Cap
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's Business Scrub hasn't been seen in the series for twenty years, which means the most recent
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  installment it appeared in was
  <em>
   T he Minish Cap
  </em>
  . Its debut was in
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  , in which it appeared in vast numbers compared to other installments. After that, it appeared in
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  , though less in number than before, then once again in
  <em>
   Oracle of Seasons
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Oracle of Ages
  </em>
  . It's not the most prominent character in the franchise, but thanks to
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  's massive success and wide recognition as the best
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game ever made, the Business Scrub holds a special place in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  .

  Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's Business Scrub Runs Hyrule's Smoothie Shops
 </h3>
 <p>
  Despite being a recurring side character in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  , the Business Scrub hasn't always functioned the same way. On the one hand, it always plays a vendor role, offering Link various wares in exchange for rupees. However, the Business Scrub has often only been accessed by first pacifying it in battle. Beginning with its
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  debut, the Business Scrub would fire a Deku Nut at Link, which would then need to be deflected back at the Business Scrub. Once the Business Scrub was pacified, players could speak with the character to receive an exclusive deal on valuable merchandise.

  This trend continued in
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  , but changed with the release of
  <em>
   Oracle of Seasons
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Oracle of Ages
  </em>
  , where dealings with Business Scrubs were a bit more casual compared to previous iterations. Specifically, whereas
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  required players to defeat the Business Scrub before they were allowed to purchase wares from it,
  <em>
   Oracle of Seasons
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Oracle of Ages
  </em>
  removed that requirement entirely, letting players interact with them as they would a normal vendor immediately upon encountering them.

  While
  <em>
   The Minish Cap
  </em>
  once again required players to pacify the Business Scrubs before interacting with them, from the look of things,
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's version of the character seems to take things back to the days of
  <em>
   Oracle of Seasons
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Oracle of Ages
  </em>
  when Business Scrubs were strictly business. It appears Business Scrubs are truly only there to sell smoothies to Zelda in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  without needing to be pacified beforehand, though that's only according to what has been revealed so far.

  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is certainly not short on recurring characters and themes, just like any other game in the franchise. Even so, it's great to see the Business Scrub back in action, and this time, selling something it has never sold before that capitalizes on the success of
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  's cooking system.

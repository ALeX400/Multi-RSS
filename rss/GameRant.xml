  Players can cook up all sorts of dishes in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76.
   </em>
  </strong>
  From hearty meaty meals to healthy vegetarian delights, there is a dish for everyone. While some dishes are good for granting players certain stat boosts, others are really only useful during daily and weekly challenges.

  <strong>
   Swamp Tofu
  </strong>
  is a rather bland meal that doesn't do a lot for the player. For the most part, players will only cook Swamp Tofu when it's a part of a challenge. This dish can be a tricky one to make, as the key ingredient is a little hard to come by. This guide will go through all there is to know about Swamp Tofu.

 <p>
  The key ingredient in Swamp Tofu is
  <strong>
   Swamp Plant,
  </strong>
  and there are a few ways that players can get hold of them. The first way is by harvesting Strangler Bloom plants. These should not be confused with Strangler Pods; those are slightly different.

 <p>
  The best way of getting some Swamp Plants is to head to the swamp next to Dyer Chemical. This place is located in the Mire region. Strangler Bloom plants will only appear at night, and there are a total of 13 possible spawn points west of Dyer Chemical. These plants can be found clinging to trees growing in and around the water. They are hard to miss, as they emit a very noticeable glow.

 <p>
  It's worth noting that upon harvesting a Strangler Bloom Plant,
  <strong>
   you'll only have a 50% chance of receiving a Swamp Plant,
  </strong>
  so you may need to pick up a couple of Strangler Bloom plants to find the ingredients necessary.

 <p>
  Players also have a small chance of finding Swamp Tofu being sold by the scavenger trader as part of a random encounter. There is also the Communist Collectron Station that players can have at their CAMP, which has a tiny chance of producing some Swamp Tofu. However, the chances of this happening are very slim.

  Once you've got some Swamp Plants, you'll need to take it to a Cooking Station.
  <strong>
   Here you can cook up some Swamp Tofu for 1 Swamp Plans and 1 Wood Scrap.
  </strong>
  Typically, this dish is only crafted when the player needs to complete a challenge. The effects of Swamp Tofu are not particularly helpful. Players will receive some HP and a boost to their food bar, and that's it. Unlike many other food items in
  <em>
   Fallout 76,
  </em>
  Swamp Tofu doesn't give the player any special temporary boost.

 <p>
  If you don't want to run around finding Swamp Plants, then you can try your luck at Whitespring Station. Normally, a Swamp Tofu challenge involves the player selling Swamp Tofu to an NPC vendor, and the main vendor that players use is the robot in Whitespring Station. It may be worth checking the robot's inventory, just in case another player has recently sold some Swamp Tofu to the vendor.

  The stealth game genre is relatively broad, featuring everything from the hardcore stealth experiences of early entries in the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  series, to the action-stealth sandboxes of games such as
  <em>
   Metal Gear 5: The Phantom Pain
  </em>
  . While not all of these games focus on creating immersive experiences, many of them are often immersive thanks to tense, cinematic gameplay and open environments to explore.

 <p>
  Many games in the immersive-sim genre that heavily encourage stealth tend to be among the most immersive stealth games, thanks to their lack of hand-holding and variety of interconnected environments. There have been many immersive stealth games over the years, especially in the genre's early days, but both old and new games have been included for the sake of variety.

  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  is a lightweight immersive-sim that allows players to approach encounters in whichever way they see fit, be that in full stealth or with brutal violence. However, stealth is highly encouraged, as players that blitz through the game killing everyone in sight will find themselves with a bad ending. While this could be observed as a flaw in
  <em>
   Dishonored's
  </em>
  design, as it punishes combat-oriented players for playing how they wish to, it helps to make the stealth gameplay feel meaningful.

 <p>
  The variety of options and routes through each level, even in full stealth, allow
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  to provide an immersive stealth sandbox for players to experiment in. This, along with the well-crafted environments and richly detailed interiors, makes sneaking through each of
  <em>
   Dishonored's
  </em>
  distinctive Steampunk missions an immersive undertaking.

  Published by the prolific New Blood Interactive,
  <em>
   Gloomwood
  </em>
  combines elements of the survival-horror and immersive-sim genres to offer players a truly immersive stealth experience. As with many, if not all, immersive-sims, stealth in
  <em>
   Gloomwood
  </em>
  is not the only option. However, it is highly encouraged, as combat puts a drain on the player's resources and forces them to adapt quickly. This makes stealth arguably necessary, especially in some portions of the game. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Gloomwood's
  </em>
  <em>
   Thief
  </em>
  -inspired lighting mechanics make stealth an engaging and immersive activity.

  One of
  <em>
   Gloomwood's
  </em>
  greatest strengths, and arguably one of the key factors in its immersive atmosphere, is its level design. Each level is meticulously crafted, offering players unique routes through each area and constantly giving them landmarks to easily navigate. This, along with the subtle world-building, immersive sound design, and cinematic lighting, results in a game that's easy to get lost in.

  Released all the way back in 1998,
  <em>
   Thief: The Dark Project
  </em>
  is an old-school stealth game that won't be for everyone due to its rough edges. However, the attention to detail in its level design, expertly crafted difficulty, and innovative light and sound system arguably make
  <em>
   Thief: The Dark Project
  </em>
  one of the most immersive stealth games even by today's standards.

 <p>
  Players must be aware of their surroundings at all times, making use of the environment to avoid guards and complete their objectives. To do this, players are given a bow and several unique arrow types; moss arrows to reduce noise, water arrows to snuff out torches, and rope arrows to reach new locations, among others, make this bow a truly versatile tool for sneaking around.
  <em>
   Thief: The Dark Project
  </em>
  is also full of personality, particularly in its presentation and tongue-in-cheek voice acting.

  Arguably one of if not the best games in the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  series, and possibly one of the best stealth games ever made,
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory
  </em>
  is a surprisingly immersive stealth game despite its increasing age. Having been released all the way back in 2005,
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory
  </em>
  won't be up to scratch for players who want a modern experience with slick presentation, but the game's visuals and gameplay are shockingly smooth for a title that's nearly twenty years old at the time of writing.

 <p>
  The game's atmosphere is made immersive through cinematic lighting and a careful balance of light and dark environments that emphasize stealth at every corner. Unlike many modern stealth games, going loud in
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory
  </em>
  is generally less rewarding than attempting full stealth. This results in a hardcore stealth experience that fans of the genre are sure to love, but might turn away more casual players.

  A clever
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player celebrated the Marvel Cinematic Universe's latest blockbuster by creating two new costumes for the game, based on heroes Deadpool and Wolverine. Using the game's wide array of armor parts and color shaders, the player reincarnated the famous mutant pair as
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Titans.

  Deadpool and Wolverine are rapidly becoming some of Marvel's most-recognized characters, after the long chain of successful blockbuster film releases starring the characters in recent years. Wolverine has always been a popular Marvel hero and a longtime veteran of Marvel video game adaptations, but Deadpool has gotten additional attention thanks to actor Ryan Reynolds' performance as the "Merc with a Mouth." Now the two are getting a major publicity push thanks to Marvel's release of the
  <em>
   Deadpool and Wolverine
  </em>
  feature film, including character skin releases in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and promotions all across the commercial spectrum.

  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  is itself no stranger to cross-brand promotions. The game has hosted crossovers with brands like
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  , and more. Player iixVanquishxX chose to bring some of that
  <em>
   Deadpool and Wolverine
  </em>
  excitement into
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's universe using the game's versatile armor customization system. They created special customized costumes based on Deadpool and Wolverine, debuting them on the DestinyFashion subreddit.

  Deadpool's usual body-hugging suit comes across more like medieval armor thanks to the use of the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Knightly Noire Helm (colored red by the Charred Plumage shader), the metallic Augmented Auspice Ornament for the Synthoceps Exotic arms (reddened by the Carminica shader), and the
  <em>
   Witcher
  </em>
  Kaer Morhen Plate chest and the Photosuede Greaves legs colored with the Redjacked Shader. Deadpool's pouch-covered utility belt is replicated by the Thunderhead Mark class item. The heavily armed and armored appearance is also augmented by the presence of visible "eyes" on the helm, allowing the character a level of expressiveness uncommon to typical
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  Titan outfits, and appropriate for Deadpool and his outspoken personality.

  The Wolverine costume uses the Adamantine Rebirth ornament for the popular Loreley Splendor Exotic helm, colored blue-and-yellow with the Cargulo Bristle shader. The Lion's Might Gauntlets colored by Cargulo Bristle place attractive stripes on the character's arms, drawing attention and resembling some past Wolverine costumes. The
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  N7 Plate (with Solar Shrapnel shader) and the N7 Greaves (with the Dawning Welcome shader), allow a uniform yellow aesthetic that enhances the rest of the costume and evokes the "superhero spandex" look. The Pathfinder's Mark (colored by Dawning Welcome) provides a low-profile class item that doesn't offset the rest of the costume.

  Fans were quick to praise the Deadpool and Wolverine costumes. One commenter even called them "the best versions yet," owing to the multiple times players have attempted to recreate characters like Wolverine in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . One thanked iixVanquishxX for using a Titan to create the Wolverine costume, as the Strand Titan super is particularly suitable for players wanting to roleplay as Wolverine.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  has an interesting pet system. Players can capture
  <strong>
   deviants
  </strong>
  , which have three main functions: There are deviants that provide benefits within a player’s base, deviants that can help with crafting, and deviants that are combat companions.

 <p>
  Many of the deviants that a player can capture in this survival horror game have cute, almost cartoon-like designs. They also have somewhat comical animations, even the combat deviants. In contrast, some combat deviants, such as the Zeno-Purifier, have a highly detailed model. This has led players to criticize the consistency of game assets, pointing at the fact that summoning a cartoon pet in a realistic game world breaks immersion. Whether you are for or against cartoon pets in a game with otherwise realistic scenery, knowing which combat pets are best is crucial to success in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  .

  As combat deviants in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  go,
  <strong>
   Mini Fester
  </strong>
  is one of the most fun to use, simply because it is so comical when running around in combat. This deviant will attack multiple enemies by launching squirmy tentacles at them. This might sound strange, but it is quite effective.

 <p>
  Getting hold of the Mini Fester is a little more complicated than most deviants. The player will need to find a PvE Mist event. These are marked by a large purple ball on a stem, which can be seen at some distance. Once the player completes the Mist event successfully, they have a chance of receiving a Mini Fester as one of the rewards.

  One of the most enjoyable aspects of using deviants in combat when playing
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is that they all have such unique abilities.
  <strong>
   Mini Wonder
  </strong>
  is a purely defensive deviant that simply intercepts incoming bullets, keeping them away from the player. Note that it specifically deals with bullets; it won’t block melee attacks.

  Mini Wonder is pretty easy to get, as it is located within the Forsaken Monolith, which every player is sent to as part of the story arc. Therefore, most players will unlock this combat deviant at an appropriate stage in the game.

  This is another defensive combat deviant in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . It is extremely easy to get once the player has enough levels and decent gear to tackle the Sunbury School POI. There is a junkyard to the west of the school, and a quest available inside that rewards players with the
  <strong>
   Voodoo Doll
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The Voodoo Doll can be very useful in boss fights, because of its core mechanic. When the player takes incoming damage, there is a chance for the Voodoo Doll to reflect a portion of it back onto the enemy that dealt it. It's a simple ability, but can be very effective when the player is likely to take a large amoutn of damage at once.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Shattered Maiden
  </strong>
  combat deviant is quite unique in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . Even though this is a game that focuses on FPS combat, it doesn’t really go in-depth with special attacks that buff the player or debuff an enemy in some way. Shattered Maiden does apply debuffs though: It frightens and freezes enemies.

 <p>
  This deviant can only be acquired one way as well, which is another misnomer. The player has to complete a Refinery Pollution Point, and then has a chance of receiving the Shattered Maiden deviant as a reward.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Zeno-Purifier
  </strong>
  deviant is one of the best combat pets in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , only overshadowed by the Lonewolf’s Whisper deviant. Every player is assured of getting this deviant as long as they complete the “Of Mist And Mirage” phase of the Challenges system, which most players will do almost by accident.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Zeno-Purifier is great fun to use in combat. With its awesome samurai warrior model, it teleports to enemies and attacks them with its sword before teleporting to the next, and so on. If the player is lucky enough to loot a level 2 or level 3 Zeno-Purifier, it will become a must-have combat assistant.

  Every beginner to
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  has to go through a short tutorial experience. As part of this tutorial, they will be given the
  <strong>
   Butterfly’s Emissary
  </strong>
  deviant, and instructed on how to use an individual containment device to control it.

 <p>
  However, the Butterfly’s Emissary is actually a very good combat deviant, and can carry the player all the way to the endgame if they are not lucky enough to capture a better combat deviant in the meantime. The Butterfly’s Emissary simply attacks a target over and over, doing considerable damage before it runs out of energy. It's simple, but effective.

  The
  <strong>
   Lonewolf’s Whisper
  </strong>
  combat deviant is arguably the best of all the combat deviants available in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . It is pretty easy to acquire, as it is a possible spawn at the end of the Shadow Hound boss fight in the Monolith of Thirst. When summoned, multiple wolves come forth, attacking every enemy they can get to.

 <p>
  What makes this excellent combat deviant even better is that it is possible to farm the boss inside the Monolith of Thirst to try and get a better one. A level 4 Lonewolf’s Whisper is a truly outstanding combat companion that can carry the player a long way in the game.

  In the latter stages of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  , you need better weapons and equipment to take down high-level enemies and bosses. To accomplish this task, you must step out of your comfort zone and seek out rare resources for crafting superior gear.

 <p>
  One such item used to craft high-level gear is Automatic Parts. In order to get your hands on this resource, you'll need to enter high-level regions to collect scrap and hunt enemies. Though it might seem a little difficult at first, this guide will assist you in acquiring Automatic Parts.

  As mentioned above, Automatic Parts are valuable assets if you are planning to get better equipment during the later stages of the game. These resources can be gathered by
  <strong>
   disassembling scrap at your Disassembly Bench
  </strong>
  . Luckily, all the objects that produce Automatic Parts are
  <strong>
   abundant within the Red Sands Region
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  However, not every scrap item in the Red Sands region will produce Automatic Parts. To get this item, you will need to
  <strong>
   collect specific items
  </strong>
  within these regions. Some of these items include:

 <h3 id="blackfell-fallen-zone">
  Blackfell Fallen Zone
 </h3>
 <p>
  This area is your primary target due to its abundance of houses, enemies, and supermarkets filled with loot. The
  <strong>
   supermarket near the fuel station
  </strong>
  is particularly rich in valuable items. Besides the supermarket, you can also thoroughly search houses and residential streets for additional loot. Fully looting this zone can
  <strong>
   yield more than 30 Automatic Parts
  </strong>
  .

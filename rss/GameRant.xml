      <title>Red Dead Redemption 3: 8 Characters Who Need to Return</title>

 <p>
  While the main protagonist of a potential
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  could be anyone’s guess, and a character that audiences hadn’t even met in the previous games (like Arthur Morgan was in
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  ), there are some supporting characters who most certainly made their mark in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  that could make quite the impact on
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  (if it ever gets made).

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  featuring so many supporting characters, and some who deserved more time to shine, it’s a great opportunity for
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  to bring back these characters in a sequel setting, either before 1907 or after 1914, to bring about further complexity and story beats for the protagonist.

  After the fall of the Van der Linde gang, Trelawny most likely returned safely to his wife and two children in their humble home of Saint Denis. However, Trelawny isn’t exactly able to escape this life, and even after being shot at, beaten, and nearly killed for the gang, it’s likely that he’s ready to scam again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trelawny enjoys it, and he can’t stay away from the life he leads, even if he has such a good and innocent one at home. While he’s no killer, he is a thief and a scam artist, and it would be nice to see what antics he’s gotten himself into in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>

  After the death of Angelo Bronte, Guido Martelli stepped up to lead the mafia of Saint Denis, providing further organized crime and deeper funding of police pockets. Every official in Saint Denis is under the control of Guido Martelli, and a man that powerful surely holds grudges, especially against the Van der Linde gang and their remnants for the men they have killed in 1899.
 </p>
 <p>
  Introducing Guido Martelli as an antagonist is a nice way to showcase the corruptible powers of Saint Denis, and also give players a modern vendetta as the line between outlaw and crime syndicate further blurs in the dawning of the 20th century.

  Black Belle may have only featured as a famous gunslinger from a bygone era for one Stranger Mission, but she left quite the impression. Black Belle is a female gunslinger on the run from bounty hunters and lawmen, and her dangerous streak is only aided by her wild side, who lives the thrill of the Wild West, even if the Wild West is all but tamed at this point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a zany and excitable character like Black Belle in her final years could be fun to see what fight she has left in her at that point, and to showcase whether she’ll die as an outlaw, or as an old woman too frail to hold a rifle and ride a horse into the sunset.

  Reverand Swanson’s time with the Van der Linde gang was never a good time for him. While he enjoyed the people, the work and his vices were beyond corruptible, and made him forget his duties as a religious man devoted to God. Morphine and alcohol had a hold on Swanson like they were from the devil himself, so when he managed to break off his addiction, it was like a new chapter for the man.
 </p>
 <p>
  Swanson left the Van der Linde gang and became a minister in New York, so while it’s doubtful he’ll be seen again, especially in such an industrial city, there’s still a chance he could be sent across country on a train to meet a new outlaw that could use his religious guidance.

  Rains Fall has its story revolved around tragedy and mistreatment. His people were practically tortured mentally and physically by the U.S. Government, bullied off of their land with his wife and sons murdered in an unwinnable fight. Yet, Rains Fall is still alive, living to remember his son, Eagle Flies, and to protect what’s left of his people in Canada.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Rains Fall visits his son’s grave every year from Canada back to New Hanover, it would be nice to see him one day as the newest outlaw of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  comes into contact with him, learning of Rains Fall’s plight and understanding a few moral lessons.

  Sadie Adler’s life was robbed from her by the O’Driscolls when they destroyed her home and killed her husband, leaving her as a grieving and vengeful woman who now spends her days away from the Van der Linde gang as a ruthless bounty hunter who doesn’t so much care about bringing people to justice, but instead just loves the idea of wanting to die in a gunfight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sadie’s flaws and the sadness she carries can be felt with every bounty she brings in, and her death wish is something rather alarming that John Marston fails to notice. Perhaps if she meets another outlaw, or a potential bounty, she can get what she wants, or learns of something she never knew she wanted.

  Sister Calderon in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  actually appeared in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  as Mother Superior Calderon when John Marston visits Mexico. This character is one of the rare reoccurring characters between the games that isn’t part of the main gang, and as such, it seems only right that she gets to share more religious philosophy and care with the protagonist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mother Superior Calderon always knows what to say, and she helped to guide both John and Arthur on separate instances without ever corrupting their hearts into something all pure or all impure, which highlights her as an understanding ally.

  It would make the most sense for Jack Marston to be the protagonist of a
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  if the game were set after 1914, but considering the West was just about tamed by then, it seems unlikely a game would go that far in the timeline. However, there is a brief period between 1911 and 1914 of unexplored content for Jack Marston, but perhaps not as a protagonist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps Jack Marston could have his story told from a second-person perspective, where the character that players experience gets to see Jack’s story unfold, and this protagonist can interact with Jack and learn of the grief that shaped him into the outlaw that killed the retired Edgar Ross.

   <em>

  Zombies' Shattered Veil is shaping up to be one of the best maps yet, transporting players into a mysterious mansion where they can embark on a cryptic Easter Egg quest, battle relentless hordes of zombies, and face new threats. Additionally, long-time fans will also be thrilled to get their hands on returning Wonder Weapons, like the Ray Gun Mk II.

  While many players will focus on conquering the Shattered Veil's main quest, preparation is key. Side Easter Eggs offer shortcuts to boost Essence gain or unlock free Perks, while free power-ups provide valuable advantages in later rounds. Fortunately, like its predecessors,
  <strong>
   Shattered Veil contains multiple free power-ups
  </strong>
  for players to discover.

  The
  <strong>
   Bonus Points
  </strong>
  power-up is a little harder to find than the others. To get to it, players will need to head to the Grand Foyer and
  <strong>
   open up the East Foyer
  </strong>
  by heading up the staircase to the right of the Tyrannosaurus Rex statue. Here, if players
  <strong>
   look at the hole in the wall
  </strong>
  just above the staircase opposite the Stamin-Up Machine, they should see the Bonus Points power-up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooting the Bonus Points will spawn it at the player's location, allowing them to receive 500 Essence for free upon collection.

  Just like the Bonus Points power-up, a free
  <strong>
   Full Power
  </strong>
  is also hidden within a hole in a wall. Players can
  <strong>
   find the Full Power in the Study
  </strong>
  , the room just before the Elemental Pop Perk Machine. Inside the Study, there is an
  <strong>
   opening in the wall
  </strong>
  right next to the SWAT 5.56 wall buy. By
  <strong>

  </strong>

 <p>
  Shooting the Full Power will cause it to spawn at the player's location, instantly granting them full access to their Field Upgrade upon collection.

  The
  <strong>
   Double Points
  </strong>
  power-up is one of the most sought-after power-ups in the game. Players can
  <strong>
   find it on the West Balcony
  </strong>
  , just ahead of the Double Tap Perk Machine. By standing at the broken portion of the balcony and looking into the distance, they should be able to
  <strong>
   spot a log with the Double Points power-up propped up against it.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooting the Double Points will bring it to the player, granting double the amount of Essence earned for 30 seconds upon collection. Since the Double Points power-up is relatively close to the Bonus Points power-up, players can grab it first and then rush over to the Bonus Points to gain a free 1,000 Essence.

  </strong>
  If facing away from S.A.M., they can

      <title>The Sims 4: How To Stop Vladislaus Straud From Feeding on You</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Vladislaus Straud can be a real pain in a Sim's neck in
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  because he can circumvent common methods of keeping vampires out of a home. He can become such a pest that some Sims even miss out on work or other important events because
  <strong>
   they're too exhausted from his attacks
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Vladislaus is one of the major NPC Sims that came with the Vampires pack in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . He's a Master Vampire, which means he has a lot of traits that other in-game vampires don't. Unfortunately, these traits allow him
  <strong>
   to get around certain protective measures
  </strong>
  that typically work against most vampires. The good news is that there are still a few ways players can keep Vladislaus from feeding on their Sims.

 <p>
  Players will know when Vladislaus has taken an interest in their Sim. They'll receive a notification in the form of a speech bubble from Vlad. He typically welcomes newcomers a few days after they move in, and then compliments their neck.
  <strong>
   This is the first sign that Vlad intends to feed on that Sim
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Vlad typically appears at the Sim's home late at night. At first, he may just stand outside the Sim's door. In classic vampire lore, most vampires can't enter without permission. Vladislaus also needs permission,
  <strong>
   or at least makes it seem like he does
  </strong>
  .

   The first tactic players should use is to lock every door in the house and set it so that vampires can't use the door
  </strong>
  . To do this, players just need to click on each entry door and manually set it to restrict vampires. This will keep most vampires from entering the Sim's home, but there's one more step that players need to take to stop Vladislaus from feeding on Sims in
  <em>
   The Sims 4

 <p>
  Even if their Sim is sleeping, players must click on Vlad and tell him to leave. This will often keep Vlad from returning to the Sim's home.
  <strong>
   The real problem is if he's already fed on the Sim
  </strong>
  . The more that Vlad has fed on the Sim, the more power he has over them. It becomes a lot harder to get rid of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players notice that Vlad keeps coming back and still manages to get inside, then it's because he has a special trait that allows him to get past restricted doors. He'll typically teleport into a room or
  <strong>
   Mesmerize his victim from a window to get the Sim to come to him
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Thankfully, players can do a few other things if the first two methods don't work.

 <p>
  If the Sim has a bedroom on the first floor, they might have a problem with Vlad watching them through the window and Mesmerizing them that way. He can take control of an unsuspecting Sim and have them come outside, where he can then feed on them. The best way to ensure Vlad can't get access to a Sim while they're sleeping is to
  <strong>
   delete the windows
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  If Vlad can't see the Sim, then he can't use his Mesmerize power on them. Additionally, players can also build their stylish bedrooms on higher floors where Vlad can't easily see them. However, because of his ability to teleport,
  <strong>
   there's still a chance that he may get access to the Sim even with a higher window
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Now, whether Vladislaus Straud has fed on a Sim yet or not will determine just how much garlic a Sim needs to protect themselves against him.
  <strong>
   Sims who haven't had Vlad feed on them should make enough garlic wreaths and braids for each door in the house
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Sims will first need to know enough about vampires to make garlic beads. They'll need to start developing their
  <strong>
   Vampire Lore
  </strong>
  skills, which they can do by performing the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Reading Vampire Lore Books
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Researching Vampires on the Computer
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Talking to People About Vampires
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As they progress through the Vampire Lore skill tree,
  <strong>
   they'll unlock new crafting recipes
  </strong>
  . The ability to make protective charms out of garlic gets unlocked pretty early in the tree,
  <strong>
   and it's a pretty effective way to protect Sims against most vampires
  </strong>
  . Vladislaus is no mere ordinary vampire, however. So, players will need a lot of garlic braids and wreaths around entry points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can
  <strong>
   buy garlic seeds on the computer
  </strong>
  and plant them in a garden bed. After harvesting the garlic, players can interact with the mature garlic in their inventories and select the
  <strong>
   Make Garlic Object
  </strong>
  interaction. It takes about
  <strong>
   10 garlic bulbs to make a garlic wreath
  </strong>
  , so players will want to ensure they plant enough garlic seeds to have the right amount.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip" data-nosnippet="">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_26">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     Each garlic seed typically grows into around 10 garlic bulbs.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Place the wreaths or braids by every entry door to keep Vlad from approaching it. As a vampire, he should gain the
  <strong>
   Garlic Induced Irritation
  </strong>
  buff, which means he won't want to be around the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, if Vladislaus has already fed on the Sim,
  <strong>
   they will need extra protection
  </strong>
  . Vlad tells the Sims himself that since he's had a taste of their plasma, garlic isn't going to work on him very well.
  <strong>
   It's basically going to be a lot harder to ward him off
  </strong>
  .

 </div>
 <p>
  That said, there are still a few things that players can do, and the best part is that it doesn't involve downloading any vampire mods. The first is to add more garlic wreaths and braids. Besides putting them by the entry doors, players should also hang several garlic wreaths and braids by the door to the Sim's bedroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, players should keep lots of garlic bulbs in their Sim's inventory. Depending on how many are in the Sim's inventory, this also protects them and
  <strong>
   may be enough to ward off Vlad
  </strong>
  .

  One way Vladislaus often tricks Sims is through his Mesmerization power, which they are helpless to. Thankfully,
  <strong>
   if Sims keep studying Vampire Lore and leveling up their skills, they can learn the Vampire Resistance Cocktail
  </strong>
  . This powerful potion protects the Sim from influential spells like Mesmerize.
 </p>
 <p>
  Basically, Vlad will have a lot more trouble convincing Sims to come over to him. The bad news is that the Sim will have to make the cocktail each night since it doesn't last forever. However, considering that the Sim will become immune to Vlad's powers, it's a necessary tool for survival against him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like many other helpful drinks and cocktails, Players can make the Vampire Resistance Cocktail at any bar.
  <strong>
   It takes some wolfsbane to craft it, which players can easily purchase on the computer or through their phone. After making the cocktail, Sims should drink it just before they sleep at night to keep Vlad from Mesmerizing them outside
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Now, this particular strategy has been
  <strong>
   hit or miss
  </strong>
  with many players, but it's worth trying nonetheless. There are certain traits that players can apply to their lots that give them some sort of bonus, debuff, or challenge. One lot trait can be really effective in keeping Vlad, and anyone else, from showing up at a Sim's door.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Private Dwelling lot trait basically
  <strong>
   keeps visitors from stopping by at a Sim's lot
  </strong>
  . Some players have experienced having this trait active, which has kept Vlad from visiting their Sims. Others found that he could get around it,
  <strong>
   likely due to the same trait that lets him slip past restrictions on doors
  </strong>
  . Either way, activating it may keep Vlad from contacting the Sim initially.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </em>
  </strong>
  has undoubtedly risen to such popularity since its 2023 release that its most loyal fans are champing at the bit for a sequel. Thankfully, despite the fact that a sequel has yet to be officially and outright confirmed by Warner Bros. and Avalanche,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  has been financially successful enough that a sequel is all but guaranteed to be in development. With that in mind, it's worth considering how
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  might be able to improve upon its predecessor's formula, and one thing it might look at is implementing seasons and the holidays that accompany them.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the most magical and heartwarming aspects of the Wizarding World of
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  has always been its attention to seasonal detail, from cozy Christmas scenes in the Great Hall to the candle-lit pumpkins hovering during Halloween. This approach ultimately allowed the Wizarding World not only to feel alive but also to hit closer to home for readers and viewers of the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  books and films. However, in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , that seasonal rhythm was largely absent, as the castle and its surroundings remained consistent throughout the game, with minimal changes outside of story events. Now, if there's one area that
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  could improve upon, it's this one.

  's world feel more alive and in motion than the first game, and it would reflect the seasonal charm that fans of the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  books and movies are well acquainted with. The obvious way this could be implemented is by
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  tying these seasonal changes directly to its story and timeline, but there is another path it could take that might even be better.

  Warner Bros. was, at one point, reportedly pursuing a live-service model for its future games, with
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  expected to adopt that model as well. More recently, however, according to an article on comicbook.com, Warner Bros. has reevaluated that approach, meaning
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  may not be a live-service game after all. Even so, incorporating a regular holiday rotation in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  might allow Warner Bros. and Avalanche to experiment with live-service elements without making the sequel a full live-service game — just as games like
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Valhalla
  </em>
  have done in the past.

     One of the most magical and heartwarming aspects of the Wizarding World of
     <em>

     has always been its attention to seasonal detail, from cozy Christmas scenes in the Great Hall to the candle-lit pumpkins hovering during Halloween.

  Rather than simply incorporating a regular seasonal rotation into
  <em>

  </em>
  's world and story, Avalanche could have it directly influenced by real-life seasons and holidays. This would potentially increase the game's longevity, as players would revisit
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  during seasonal changes and major holidays, especially if there were special quests and items they could only obtain during those events. It would essentially be what
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  has done with its own holiday events, only in a non-live-service model instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Seasonal immersion is a chance for
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  to feel more connected to the real lives of its players, with the warmth and wonder that helped make the Wizarding World so beloved in the first place. Whether it's ultimately implemented through a story-driven timeline or tied to real-world holidays, a system such as this could add depth to
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  's atmosphere and world, potentially even bringing fans back to the game throughout each year.

  The price tag of the Nintendo Switch 2 is much more affordable in Japan, but there are some differences between this cheaper version and the default version. In early January 2025, Nintendo announced that a successor to the Switch would be coming with a first-look trailer, which showed how the console looked. However, players would have to wait nearly three months to learn more about the Switch 2. On April 2, Nintendo hosted the Switch 2 Direct, and millions of fans tuned in to find out every detail about the upcoming console.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the Switch 2 presentation, players eagerly awaited the price to be revealed. While exciting new titles, such as
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  , were shown in great detail, as well as upgrades to Switch 1 titles, like
  <em>
   Super
  </em>
  <em>
   Mario Party Jamboree
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , the price remained a mystery until after the presentation. As soon as the Switch 2 Direct ended, information on how much it would cost started popping up on the Nintendo website and local retailers in some countries. Most fans were shocked when they discovered that the Nintendo Switch 2 would cost $450 without any additional items or games.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   ¥49,980 / $340 for the Japan-exclusive version of the Switch 2
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  It seems that the $450 price tag is more or less the same in every country except for Japan. In Japan, players thinking of buying the Nintendo Switch 2 have the opportunity to get it for ¥49,980, which is around $340. The cheaper version of the Switch 2 is the same when it comes to hardware and specs, but it is only available in Japanese, and gamers cannot change its language. Additionally, it requires a Japanese account, and Nintendo Switch 2 online features cannot be used outside of that region. Gamers who live in Japan but don't speak the language can get the default version of the console, but it costs an additional ¥20,000, meaning it'll be available for about $430.

  While it may seem odd that Nintendo would reduce the price by $120 to add these restrictions, it also makes it clear that there is no reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 needs to be so expensive. There is no doubt that Nintendo has been making some strange decisions with the Nintendo Switch 2. Players were also appalled when they discovered that
  <em>
   Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour
  </em>
  would be sold for over $6 rather than given away as a free add-on, as it's a game that looks like a tech demo for the console.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the past, Nintendo had no issues giving players free games with their consoles, such as
  <em>
   Wii Sports
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   AR Games
  </em>
  , and this could've been the case this time around as well. Despite its low price tag, it's hard to believe that
  <em>
   Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour
  </em>
  will sell many copies, as it was not well-received by fans.

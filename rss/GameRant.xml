  Players who are used to playing
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  games know that the Monster Hunters in the game hunt the monsters. However, in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Stories,
   </strong>
  </em>
  players are able to take on the role of a Monster Rider, someone who lives alongside monsters. With the remake, players are able to hop back into this amazing world.

  As someone who works with monsters, players will be able to find Monster Eggs and raise their Monsties. They can also find Egg Fragments in the game, which will allow them to create Monster Eggs. After finding enough Monster Eggs, they will be able to add even more Monsties to their team. Here's a guide to using Egg Fragments.

  Egg Fragments are small fragments of Monster Eggs that can be put together to create Monster Eggs. Fragments can be used to slowly build up Monster Eggs at any time in the game, and then they can be hatched after they are put together.

  These fragments can be found all around the world as items on the ground. This means that players will want to check out the items scattered around anytime they run into them. If they find Egg Fragments, they will be able to create Monster Eggs and hatch new Monsties for their team. They can also be obtained from Network Battles, which are battles players can participate in via the network if they want to.

 <p>
  Egg Fragments aren't too difficult to use, but it can be challenging to build the egg and hatch it. In order to use them, players will need to find them and then go to one of the stables around the game. Here, they will be able to select their Egg Carton. From there, selecting the "Egg Fragment" option will pull up all the Egg Fragments the player has found throughout their game.

 <p>
  After navigating to this menu, players will need to find Egg Fragments that seem to match each other. This will allow them to slowly build a new egg that can be hatched. Once the egg is built, players will just need to select it in the "Hatch Egg" section. Depending on what the egg looks like, players may obtain a whole host of Monsties to add to their team this way.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared an impressive LEGO build of Magnemite. The fan showed off multiple images of the Magnemite and also provided detailed instructions on how fellow
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fanatics can create their own.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans and LEGO often go together, even though there are no official collaborations between the two brands.
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  has received Mega Bloks kits in the past, and other Nintendo properties like
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  have gotten LEGO releases. However, part of the charm and appeal of LEGOs has always been the ability to build whatever a user puts their mind to, and that includes plenty of Pokemon. Magnemite's appearance and colors make it a good choice for a custom LEGO creation like this one.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan eyemcantoeknees has shared their rendition of Magnemite in LEGOs. The build is extremely accurate to Magnemite's appearance, with the fan sharing images of it from multiple angles. The build would be impressive enough on its own, but eyemcantoeknees was also kind enough to share a schematic on how fellow fans can put together their own Magnemite LEGO creation.
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans will need a total of 54 individual LEGO pieces in order to create their own Magnemite. It's not too demanding, and the build doesn't look extremely difficult, especially with detailed instructions to follow.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon

  fans never stop finding unique ways to celebrate the legendary pocket monsters, and that includes in blocky form with LEGOs. May fans have shared
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  LEGO builds in the past, in varying levels of difficulty and size. However, not all fans have shared how they put their creations together like eyemcantoekneeshas. This is unfortunate, since some LEGO owners might want to put together their own versions of the creations.

 <p>
  This wouldn't be as big a problem if
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  released its own official LEGO collections. LEGO has collaborated with tons of different companies, game developers, and media properties to either make LEGO games or sets. Considering that Mega Bloks is considered to be a LEGO competitor, it seems unlikely that
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans will get their wish for themed LEGO sets so long as
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  is partnered with Mattel to make Mega Bloks.

 <p>
  Thankfully, there are many resources available for avid LEGO fans that provide detailed schematics like eyemcantoeknees'. While some fans hold out for an official
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  LEGO collaboration, players can at least use the blocks that exist to make their own creations.

 <p>
  With the release of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
   's
  </em>
  latest DLC,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  , many players have found themselves fighting new bosses and facing others that they've defeated in the past. The Lands Between is filled with all sorts of enemies that come in a variety of different shapes and sizes, and while many of them aren't gigantic, they can still be pretty dangerous.

 <p>
  While exploring the world of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and encountering its various boss fights, it's only natural that some players may begin to wonder how big the enemies can actually get. While pondering this thought, gamers may also begin to wonder what the
  <strong>
   smallest bosses
  </strong>
  in the game are, and there are quite a few to be encountered.

  This new boss, introduced in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC, is no joke. Similar to the Lion Guardians spread all over the Lands Between, this powerful creature with humanoid facial features is challenging and lightning-fast. Players who've already defeated the
  <strong>
   Divine Beast Dancing Lion
  </strong>
  can attest to this boss' high difficulty and swift moveset.

  is a force to be reckoned with. As the first obstacle within the Erdtree, he swings a powerful golden hammer that inflicts strong physical damage and can deliver wide AoE attacks. While he's not the toughest boss in the last stages of the game, players should still approach him with respect and caution.

Daughter of Radagon of the Golden Order and Queen Marika, she is one of the quickest-moving bosses in the game and has a frustrating healing ability that restores her Health whenever she manages to hit the Tarnished.

Among many things, Malenia is responsible for having unleashed the Scarlet Rot upon Caelid, leaving the area in the putrid state that players find it in. She's one of the bosses who drop the largest number of Runes upon defeat and has a stature of approximately 8 feet.

   Crucible Knight
  </span>
  enemies are widely spread across the Lands Between in
  <em>
   Elden RIng
  </em>
  . Typically, they can be found by entering Evergaols; however, they also inhabit other areas of the game, and sometimes, they can be accompanied by other knights, which makes defeating them a nearly impossible task. There's a total of 16 Crucible Knights in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , and each is more challenging than the last.

 <p>
  Players who wish to face them must learn their attack patterns to perfection, as they not only use their swords and shields to fight but also have access to a wide set of magical abilities that players will be rewarded with if they manage to defeat them. Standing at a "meager" 7.8 feet tall, Crucible Knights are one of the
  <strong>
   smallest boss types in
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  ; however, they pack a huge punch and have one of the most aggressive movesets in the game, leaving close to no attack windows for the Tarnished.

  seems to be a hybrid of a lion, a dragon, and some kind of massive bird. This boss has a relatively repetitive attack pattern, including lunges that are reminiscent of

  <em>
   Ringed City

  DLC final boss,
  <strong>
   Slave Knight Gael
  </strong>
  . That said, Leonine Misbegotten is considerably weaker than Gael and also seems to be smaller, "only" standing at 7.5 feet.

   Soldier of Godrick
  </span>
  is meant to be a tutorial fight for newcomers who've either never played
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  before or have never even touched a FromSoftware title. This boss is meant to be easy to dodge, parry, counter, and ultimately defeat. That said, for some reason, the Soldier of Godrick has also become a popular meme NPC, and several players and coders have taken it upon themselves to modify his stats and make him the strongest boss in the game.

 <p>
  The modified version of the Soldier of Godrick (affectionately nicknamed as "Rick, Soldier of God") takes no damage from even the strongest characters at level 713. This mighty soldier stands at approximately 7.2 feet tall, making him the
  <strong>
   smallest boss in

  <strong>
   Sony
  </strong>
  has announced that its long-running Rewards program will come to an end on December 31, 2024. First introduced in 2017 via the branded Sony and PlayStation credit cards, the Sony Rewards system allowed members to rack up points for purchases from the company's online storefront, which could then be redeemed for game discounts, gift cards, ancillary items, and so on.

 <p>
  Much like reward schemes from other companies, Sony Rewards grants a point for approximately one unit of supported currency spent, such as one dollar equating to one point. Members also had the option to apply for a Sony-branded credit card that accrued points from other eligible transactions. Back in 2021, Sony made a major change to the Rewards program, wherein it only allowed Sony or PlayStation credit card holders to earn points from purchases. The move was met with some criticism, and now, Sony is doing away with Rewards entirely.

 <p>
  An updated FAQ page on the official Sony Rewards website confirms that the company will be winding down operations for the Rewards website and mobile application on December 31, 2024. Members of the program have until then to redeem any leftover points and access their accounts, after which they will expire. Additionally, users can also submit bonus points and purchase credit request forms through the Sony Rewards app, but this can only be done up until July 21. Due to their similarities in nature, some may conflate Sony Rewards with 2022's PlayStation Stars loyalty program, but the latter is separate and will remain active.

  However, PlayStation Stars has been having major issues for some time now, as the service has been down since the beginning of PlayStation's Days of Play promotional period in early June. Sony has acknowledged the situation and claims to be actively working on rectifying the problem, but over two weeks later, PlayStation Stars has yet to go online again. Users still can't acquire new points or collectibles, which has been irksome for those who made several PlayStation Store purchases during Days of Play. PlayStation's customer support has reportedly reassured users that their points won't be lost, but many are still skeptical.

 <p>
  The closure of Sony Rewards may be disappointing to some of its users, but considering the scheme hasn't seen much improvement in recent years, the company may have made the decision to focus entirely on PlayStation Stars as its de facto loyalty program instead. With the service being down for over half a month, however, pressure mounts upon Sony to get it back online and allow members to cash in on PlayStation Stars' June rewards.

  fans can get the Nihon Hanzo Epic skin and the Letter on the Wind Kiriko spray for free as Twitch drops right now. These cosmetics are being given away from now through June 24 to commemorate the start of

  Recently,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  began its 11th season. Called Super Mega Ultrawatch, Season 11 comes with a
  <em>
   Power Rangers
  </em>
  -esque Battle Pass refresh, the new Runasapi Push map, and a crossover with
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  . As always,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 11 also brought hero balance changes, including a nerf to Roadhog and the return of Cassidy’s Flashbang.

 <p>
  To celebrate this new season,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is giving away some awesome cosmetics. Until midday on June 25, players can watch three hours of any
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  streamer on Twitch to earn the Letter on the Wind spray for Kiriko, and the Nihon Hanzo Epic skin for watching for four more hours after that. This skin is not always available for purchase with Overwatch Coins, so fans won’t want to miss out on this skin if they don’t have it yet.

   Attach one’s Battle.net and Twitch accounts, then watch any streamers in the

 <p>
  Nihon Hanzo was originally added in
  <em>
   Overwatch 1
  </em>
  during the 2021 Summer Games event. Players could earn the skin for free during the in-game event, though the skin was later made available for purchase for 1000 Overwatch Coins – a $10 value – in subsequent years and offers. Featuring a stunning red-and-white color scheme and an intricate ginkgo branch pattern embroidered into it, this Epic skin shows off Hanzo’s Japanese heritage in a simple-yet-elegant way. Meanwhile, the charming Letter on the Wind Kiriko spray is a brand-new cosmetic drawn by
  <em>
   OW2
  </em>
  fan Angela Ziegler, so fans should be sure to tune in on Twitch to make sure they get it.

 <p>
  Players who miss out on this first wave of Twitch Drops will have a second chance immediately after this campaign ends. From June 25 through June 30, players can get both of these cosmetics if they missed them on the first run. Additionally, they can pick up an icon drawn by Dani "OWGrandma" Ellis, that features an extra cute version of Rose Gold Mercy – a recolor of the popular
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  skin that returned this season – during this second Twitch drop campaign.

 <p>
  Not long after, the Summer Games return to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  on July 9. With both it and the Transformers collab starting on the same day, players should be sure to save their Overwatch Coins to pick up any of the other new and returning cosmetics they might want.

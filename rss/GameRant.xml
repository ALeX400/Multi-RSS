  Every
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  minigame has its own currency, and for Tundra Treasures, it’s pickaxe (or hammer) tokens. The more tokens you have, the more tiles you can break to uncover treasures. If you want to make it through all the levels and grab the grand prize, you’ll need a lot of them. In this article, we’ll go over the best ways to get more pickaxe tokens in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO.

  One of the best ways to get pickaxe tokens is by participating in the Fortune Expedition event and the Frosty Forts tournament, both of which are currently live. In the Fortune Expedition event, fans earn points by
  <strong>
   collecting pickups
  </strong>
  , and the Frosty Forts tournament requires fans to land on the
  <strong>
   Railroads
  </strong>
  . As you hit different milestones in these events, you’ll unlock rewards like sticker packs, dice, and most importantly, pickaxe tokens.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let’s take a quick look at all the milestones in the Fortune Expedition event that contain Pickaxes:

  If you are looking for an easy way to get pickaxe tokens, make sure to finish your Daily Quick Wins. These are small tasks that reset every day and usually involve things you’d do in the game anyway like rolling the dice five times or completing a Shutdown. Each completed task gives players a reward, and sometimes, that includes pickaxe tokens. These missions refresh daily, so don’t forget to check them and complete them for extra tokens.
 </p>

 <p>
  An effortless way to get more pickaxe tokens is by claiming free gifts from the shop. You will find the shop in the top-right corner of the screen. The game refreshes it every eight hours and they usually contain a mix of rewards, such as dice rolls, sticker packs, and pickaxe tokens.

  If you’ve played a digging event before, you pretty much know the drill. Once you enter the Tundra Treasures minigame, you’ll see a grid filled with blocks. Your goal is to break those blocks and find the treasures hidden underneath.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans will need Pickaxe tokens to do the digging, which they can earn in many different ways:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Compete in banner events and tournaments. At the moment, the Fortune Expedition event and Frosty Forts tournament are live. They have
   <strong>
    62 and 40 milestones
   </strong>
   , and many of them reward Pickaxe tokens.
  </li>
  <li>
   Complete your daily wins missions. These are super simple tasks like completing a Bank Heist or rolling three times. Finish them, and you’ll earn rewards like sticker packs, dice, and Pickaxe tokens.
  </li>
  <li>
   Claim your free rewards. They refresh every eight hours and often include Pickaxe tokens, along with other freebies.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once you’ve got some Pickaxe tokens, it’s time to start digging. At the top of your screen, you will see an image of the treasure you’re looking for. Your goal is to find all its pieces. Once you do, you’ll clear the level and move on to the next one. And yes, breaking each tile requires one pickaxe token.

  Mounts are an absolute necessity in open-world games, especially when the map is expansive and takes a large amount of time to traverse. They can come in the form of a creature of some sort or a vehicle and, in many cases, can even carry items for the player, which is essential when inventory space is limited.
 </p>
 <p>
  They don’t always have to be mindless, though, and they are sometimes brimming with personality. This can come in the form of direct communication with the player and the world around them, reacting to certain situations, or even pleasant animations that show character and awareness. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   most interesting mounts in open-world games
  </strong>
  .

  Most of the time in
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   horses
  </strong>
  are non-aggressive and docile creatures, merely following the instructions of the Dragonborn somewhat mindlessly. However, their personality does shine through at times, even when they are doing regular horse things at the various stables around the province.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever the Dragonborn takes a horse around on their quests, any present danger will force a reaction from the mount. Either they will flee out of fear, or they will stay and fight to the death, even pursuing hostiles who attempt to escape the battle. Some horses in the game are special, too, showing a bit more determination, such as Shadowmere and Arvak.

  The
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series is certainly no stranger to endearing and characterful mounts, which are often necessary for exploring the vast worlds on offer in the series.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </em>
  </strong>
  has tons of options when it comes to mounts, many of which can be obtained by completing specific quests, general grinding, or by purchasing them with real money.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of the acquisition methods, they really add life to this MMORPG, with some notable standouts including the Indigo Whale, Ceberus, and those lovable
  <strong>
   Chocobos
  </strong>
  , of course. Their lively animations and movements, along with the ability to sometimes assist players in battle, will really make players cherish these reliable and adorable creatures.

  Not everyone was completely satisfied with the open-world presented in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but the inclusion of Legendary Pokemon
  <strong>
   Miraidon
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Koraidon
  </strong>
  from the get-go was certainly a crowd-pleaser. Paldea is quite expansive. As such, the ability to mount these gentle giants is necessary for traversal, whether on land, in the sea, or the air.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite appearing somewhat cybernetic and draconic,
  <em>
   Pokemon Violet
  </em>
  ’s Miraidon is very intelligent, appearing to be wary of the player at first but gradually becoming more trusting and endearing. It’s quiet and calm but will absolutely give everything possible for the protagonist in battle.

  ponders these kinds of dilemmas. One such A.I. with its own distinct personality is the
  <strong>
   Delamain Cab No. 21
  </strong>
  , a reward for protagonist V at the end of the ‘Don’t Lose Your Mind’ quest.
 </p>
 <p>
  While its thoughts, opinions and conversations may differ depending on some player choices, there is often a bit of banter between the car and V that players can enjoy. While all of this may just be clever programming, the database entry for this spirited vehicle strongly hints that it is self-aware, suggesting that its vibrant and curious personality is a self-determined and conscious choice.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  adds a few extra features to the useful mounts, improving them greatly in both character and usefulness. Especially in the early game, horses are critical for navigating Hyrule's vast open spaces, and increasing their affection for Link is a wonderful experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  The horse’s abilities are measured from 0 to 5 stars by these statistics:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Strength – the amount of HP the horse has.
  </li>
  <li>
   Speed – the overall swiftness of the horse.
  </li>
  <li>
   Stamina – the number of times a horse can be spurred to go faster.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pull – newly added in
   <em>
    Tears of the Kingdom
   </em>
   , indicating their ability to tow objects.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These statistics can even be improved by Malanya near East Akkala Stable. Until their affection is full, horses may disobey and veer off course, and their individual temperaments may affect early interactions, depending on whether they are ‘Wild’ or ‘Gentle’ in nature.

  Very shy at first, especially around the other main characters, Ba’ul becomes more comfortable as the game goes on and starts expressing some opinions through Judith. It seems that Ba’ul has a thorough grasp on what is happening, offering insightful thoughts, potentially even more so than Judith, who is slightly impulsive, despite her usually rational and calm demeanor.

   Roach

  in
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

  is brimming with personality for a horse. Despite the mystery surrounding her apparent ability to teleport when Geralt whistles, she still displays normal traits, showcasing fear whenever danger is present or foraging for food and water while Geralt is busy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The noble steed will be visibly pleased if Geralt invests in the stable at his vineyard, Corvo Bianco, and her stamina will be significantly increased upon doing so. Geralt can communicate with Roach during the ‘Equine Phantoms’ quest in the
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  expansion while he is, admittedly, under the influence of drugs. But given the right circumstances, Roach can even complete the quest for him.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  has officially announced a new endgame mode coming in Version 2.1, which is expected to launch around mid-February.
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  fans have been asking for more challenging game modes for a while now, and it seems Kuro Games is finally answering their demands.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has been a few weeks since the release of Rinascita with Version 2.0, and the update has been quite popular among
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  fans. The update brought a new explorable nation, as well as two five-star Resonators, and while it recently began its second phase, players are already awaiting news about the next patch. Earlier in January,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  confirmed new playable characters for Version 2.1, but now developers have also revealed an exciting addition to the RPG.
 </p>
 <p>
  Through its official in-game notes,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  has revealed a new permanent game mode called "Whimpering Wastes" for Version 2.1. According to the developers, this endgame content will reset its challenges weekly. The reveal of Whimpering Waves comes after prominent leaker Sleep shared some details about the game mode. Per the leak, this endgame content consists of three stages, each with its own challenges and rewards. Only two stages reset periodically, though, and players claim up to 800 Astrites for completing them. Earlier leaks also revealed a different endgame mode debuting in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  that would work through a point system. If the rumors turn out to be true, farming for Astrites could become easier for players.

  Wuthering Waves Confirms New "Whimpering Wastes" Permanent Game Mode
 </h2>
 <p>
  To adjust this addition of Whimpering Waves, the game is rescheduling the duration of the next Tower of Adversity: Hazard Zone cycle to last from February 3 to March 3.
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  ' Tower of Adversity usually resets every 14 days, but the game has unexpectedly changed it to a full month. Upon the announcement, fans theorized that this decision might be permanent to balance with the weekly reset of the new game mode, but it is possible that the change could be temporary. Of course, players will have to wait for official confirmation from Kuro Games in the upcoming weeks.

 <p>
  There are high expectations for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  Version 2.1 and future updates. Players can expect more Rinascita characters like Zani to debut in later patches. Previous leaks teased the release of Rover's next element in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , which would be the first playable kit for the main character. In the meantime, players can still make the most out of Version 2.0 by pulling for Roccia or obtaining Sanhua's free skin.

  Doey is one of the most memorable characters in

Thankfully, there are tools available in the arena that will help you defeat Doey for good. However, it's going to be tricky.

  As soon as you enter the arena, Doey will start chasing you. Although
  <strong>
   Doey's fast movements are quite dangerous
  </strong>
  , you can work them to your advantage. Here's the best strategy you can use to beat Doey in
  <em>
   Poppy Playtime Chapter 4
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Keep a lookout for nitrogen canisters while running away from Doey. As soon as you spot one, quickly grab it as it falls down on the ground. Doey's body will automatically attach the canister to itself.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now, look for a saw machine that's active and ready to use (you can tell by its red glowing light). Run under the machine and quickly turn around to wait for Doey to get close.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once Doey's right under the machine, shoot a flare on the nitrogen canister to freeze Doey.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now you'll need to quickly grab the handle of the saw machine and pull it down on top of Doey.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The machine will grind up its solidified body, inflicting significant damage. However, you'll need to
  <strong>
   repeat this process three times
  </strong>
  to beat Doey completely in Poppy
  <em>
   Playtime Chapter 4
  </em>
  . Once the battle is over, it'll become a puddle of goo, but later try to attack players when they progress further into the area. However, that section is easy to deal with.

  Now that we've looked over the strategy for beating Doey in
  <em>
   Poppy Playtime Chapter 4
  </em>
  , let's check out what kind of attacks Doey has. However, every attack from Doey has a counter that will also be mentioned below.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Grab Attack
   </strong>
   : This is one of the most frequently used attacks by Doey. The tendrils in his mouth will launch at players and grab them. However, you can easily shoot at one of the faces inside Doey's mouth to release yourself from its grip.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Projectile Launch
   </strong>
   : Mid-battle, Doey will climb on top of the crane in the middle of the arena and shoot solidified clay as projectiles toward players. To easily dodge this, simply hide inside a cave nearby.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Barrage of Arms
   </strong>
   : If you're far away from Doey, it can push its arms inside the ground and spawn several at the players' location, damaging them with every hit. The best way to dodge this attack is by running around the arena.
  </li>
 </ul>

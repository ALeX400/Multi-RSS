	fans are sharing some of their biggest mistakes in the game, with stories that fellow players can probably relate with. The indie farming sim is a pretty laid-back game, but that doesn't mean that there isn't room for disaster.

	 Stardew Valley

	has been around since 2016, and in that time, millions of copies have been sold to fans looking for a relaxed and fun experience. While there's plenty for players to do in the title, they're allowed to take the game at their own pace, with no set limit on how long they can play for. Some players watch the years pass by in-game as they work towards reaching goals or simply customizing their farmland, but mistakes are bound to happen during that time.

	player Professional_Echo636 shared their experience of making a big mistake in the game, and wanted to know what other players had gone through. The OP explained that their accident came about while collecting a rare and valuable Dinosaur Egg. The egg was found in an artifact spot in the northern area of the map, right by the lake. The lake ended up being their downfall, as they dug up the Dinosaur Egg and it plopped right into the water before their farmer had a chance to scoop it up.

	Stardew Valley Players Lament Mistakes and Accidents
 </h2>
 <p>
	Fellow players were extremely sympathetic to the situation, and shared their biggest mistakes and accidents as Professional_Echo636 had asked. Several talked about accidentally bombing their own property by using Mega Bombs or other bombs while standing in areas with valuable items that were promptly destroyed. Others talked about how they'd accidentally given away items to villagers that they hadn't meant to. This not only meant losing potentially important items, but often getting a grumpy message from the villager in question due to it not being one of their favored items, adding insult to injury.

 <p>
	Another issue players sometimes face is losing valuable items in their inventory due to accidentally eating or cooking them. The former can usually be avoided with a little caution, as the game will ask if the player wants to eat an item from their hotbar before they actually do so. However, one player shared their chagrin that items in the inventory are prioritized over ingredients in the refrigerator. This led to one fan losing an Ostritch Egg, while another accidentally cooked their rare Crimsonfish.

 <p>
	Thankfully, there's a solution for most of these issues. Many players suggested that fans restart their day if something like this happens. Quitting out and restarting, or simply reloading the day's save, will restore the game back to the start of the day before the mistake was made.

Junk items are converted into their base scrap parts in settlement workshops. You can then use the scrapped material to build everything from turrets to Nuka Cola mixing machines.

	All these junk items can be found in the world while exploring. Shipments are bulk quantities of junk materials that you can acquire if you're not in the mood to go scavenging. Here is how to redeem shipments in your settlement.

	Shipments can be purchased from vendors throughout the Commonwealth. They can be very expensive, especially the larger shipments. Raise your charisma for better bartering. You can also wear certain clothing items and find the collectible Barter Bobblehead to improve trading prices. The most convenient vendor is Trashcan Carla, who regularly visits Sanctuary Hills and the nearby Drumlin Diner. Diamond City and Bunker Hill are the other two locations with traders who will regularly have the shipments you're looking for.

 <p>
	The twenty-second game in the
	<strong>
	</strong>
	<em>
	 Need for Speed
	</em>
	franchise has been released on current-generation consoles and has received high praise from fans of the genre as well as returning players for the new features and mechanics that have been introduced.
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Need for Speed Unbound
	 </em>
	</strong>
	hits the scene as another radical overhaul of the game's core structure adding new racing events, optional visual effects, and the ability to create a racing avatar.

 <p>
	However, the vehicle makes the racer, and players will need top-of-the-line cars to cut it in the competitive racing scene. Specifically, the drift events players will take part in will need vehicles that perform the best in that category. With this in mind, players will no doubt be looking for the best cars for drifting in

		Need for Speed Unbound

	.

	<em>
	 Almost two years after launch, Need for Speed Unbound stays true to its live-service promise and has received seven content updates (known as volumes) to date. The latest one, Vol. 7, is especially notable, as it focuses on drifting, introducing entirely new drift physics and dedicated drifting events available in online mode.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":266} -->
 <p>
	To start, players need to purchase a special performance part, Drift Pro Tires, which unlocks a new handling model for any car. Installing these tires prevents players from manually tweaking their grip/drift balance as seen previously, instead applying a universal drifting mechanic to every vehicle for participating in the Drift Pro Events. This means that it's not crucial which car you choose to install Drift Pro Tires on to enjoy the new handling model.

 <p>
	However, for players who prefer single-player career mode, the new Drift Pro mode and handling aren't available, making selecting a proper vehicle for regular drift events more difficult. To make things easier, players should keep an eye on car handling stats in the autoshow when purchasing a new car. Selecting a car with 20 to 40 percent drift should provide the best starting results for drift events, but they can additionally enhance the car's handling capabilities in the dedicated menu section as well.

	The
	<strong>
	 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS 350
	</strong>
	is a solid choice for any drift newcomer, providing an affordable and reliable foundation for turning this vehicle into a powerful drifting muscle setup. Starting in B class, this vehicle may lack the speed and acceleration needed for more extensive slides, but investing in its performance parts can help. This car has appeared in many
	<em>
	 NFS
	</em>
	titles and beyond, making it a classic choice for long-term racing enthusiasts.

	Alternatively, players can choose the Dodge Charger R/T as one of their first and most affordable drift rides in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	. This muscle car shares almost the same behavior on the road as the Camaro SS when properly tuned for drift events.

	Mitsubishi's line of vehicles is a mix of style and performance that is very popular in racing communities both in and out of the professional scene. In
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	, the
	<strong>
	 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X
	</strong>
	is an available vehicle priced at forty-eight thousand and sitting at B-tier with stock parts.

 <p>
	The Evolution X also comes with a strong base top speed of 157 mph and a five-second 0-60. With appropriate tuning, it can have a big impact on any drift track. Alternatively, players can choose an older model, the Lancer Evolution IX, which is almost as good for drifting as this newer iteration.

 <p>
	The
	<strong>
	 Ford Crown Victoria
	</strong>
	is a great vehicle from the motor to the muffler. Made famous as the stock car for most law enforcement agencies, these are vehicles that show up in real life and in the majority of racing games. The Crown Vic packs a massive amount of power, making it suitable for several setups.

 <p>
	Outfitting the Crown Vic for drifting doesn't take much, as its turning potential suits it from the start. At a base price of thirty thousand, it's worth a little elbow grease to pull out some top-notch abilities from the car. Note that at one point in career mode, players get a chance to win a pre-tuned variant of this car with a wide body kit and a unique livery. All they have to do from there is tweak this custom car's handling to optimize it for drifting.

	 BMW M3 Evolution
	</strong>
	<strong>
	 II
	</strong>
	is a rare sight to behold on the street but is more than capable of holding its own and turning corners with efficient and controlled drifts. This classic sports car is beloved by many racing enthusiasts, previously appearing in many other

	Dodge has a long history of racing both on official tracks and in street-level competitions. While not represented thoroughly in the drift scene, the
	<strong>
	 Dodge Challenger
	</strong>
	does have a presence, hitting curves across the asphalt and keeping pace with some of the top contenders in the sport.

 <p>
	With a top speed of over 180 miles per hour, the acceleration of the Challenger is more than enough to hit a turn with maximum velocity and keep a smooth glide with the right build. In truth, any modern powerful Dodge can be purchased instead of the Challenger (such as the Charger SRT Hellcat or SRT Viper), offering that same monster acceleration and muscle handling that are ideal for drifts.

	The
	<strong>
	 Honda S200
	</strong>
	is a great all-around vehicle with a powerful punch wrapped in a small package of pristine steel and acceleration. Thanks to its size, the Honda 2000 can have a big impact on the street in a number of events but can shine bright in drifting.

 <p>
	Able to hit a fast top speed, especially with the right parts equipped, the Honda 2000 can slide around a turn and get back on the straightaway at the driver's discretion. With a few performance upgrades, this could be one of the most productive vehicles for drifting in the A+ class, scoring wonderful amounts of prize points, especially on the narrow mountain peaks in countryside areas.

	BMW's line of vehicles is not well known for their racing capabilities. However, they are seen more often in drift competitions for their speed and control. The
	<strong>
	 BMW M4 Coupe
	</strong>
	has a sleek modern design similar to most modern cars, which sets it apart from other BMW vehicles.

 <p>
	In
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	, the M4 Coupe performs exceptionally in multiple events but will reach its full potential in the drift category. Having a top speed of 186 miles per hour, the M4 Coupe has superb handling and a 20 percent drift handling value that makes it perfect for hitting corners.

 <p>
	To maximize the number of points scored in drifting events in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	, players will need to optimize the amount of slide without losing control of their vehicle. A vehicle that can quickly rev up to top speed and fishtail on command is therefore ideal for such events, and players could do a lot worse than the
	<strong>
	 Buick Grand National GNX.
	</strong>

	The Grand National GNX is a tuned-up Grand National with more power than its predecessor. In the game, the GNX has a top speed of 185 miles per hour with a 20 percent drift value. With the acceleration of the GNX, drivers will reach the perfect speed right before hitting a corner, faster than most of the other great drifting cars in the game.

	The
	<strong>
	 Mazda RX-7
	</strong>
	is a well-known legend on the drift circuit. It is the former main car of drift star Youichi Imamura and is featured in the widely celebrated racing manga, Initial D. In addition, the RX-7 has an extensive history in street racing and is beloved by most car enthusiasts as one of the best cars to take on a track.

 <p>
	The RX-7 has unique capabilities that require it to be specially tuned to handle quick turns thanks to its rear-wheel drive. In
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	, the RX-7 has a top speed of 159 miles per hour with excellent traction and a 40 percent drift value in handling. Keep in mind that the RX-7's younger sister, the RX-8 Spirit R, is also a very impressive choice for drifting.

	Nissan is another line of vehicles that many racers, both pro and recreational, trust to give them an edge on the track with the right parts. The
	<strong>
	 Nissan 180SX
	</strong>
	is a highly used classic that can perform incredibly well on multiple types of tracks but is common in drift events.

 <p>
	Acquiring the 180SX in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	won't break the bank and will provide a powerful vehicle that players can take through the majority of the game. With a top speed of 146 miles per hour, the 180SX can compete admirably with just a little tuning, thanks to its drift value of 20 percent.

	The
	<strong>
	 Nissan 350z
	</strong>
	is a powerful two-door compact vehicle that is sought after for its wide range of customization options and above-average acceleration. Because of the 350z's size, it is exceptional at cornering, and it is no different in
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	Able to go from zero to sixty in under six seconds and costing just under sixty thousand in-game currency, an adequately tuned 350z will glide across the streets of
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	and take corners like nothing else on the market thanks to its starting 20 percent drift value. It's even possible to win in style, cosplaying as Rachel's Nissan 350Z from
	<em>
	 Need for Speed: Underground 2
	</em>
	with this model, as there are plenty of suitable fan liveries available in the customization menu for this vehicle.

 <p>
	The
	<strong>
	 Silvia Spec-R Aero
	</strong>
	is a wide-body two-door with excellent horsepower and handling. Many Nissan vehicles are prominent in street and circuit racing, and the Aero is no different. However, players who prefer drift races will want a car that can maintain its speed while skating around corners and accelerating to get back in the race.

 <p>
	Being able to go from zero to sixty in under six seconds and with a top speed of 155 miles per hour, the Aero is a wonderful choice to take into
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	. It boasts a 20 percent drift value too, making it one of the best drift cars in the game. As an alternative, the Nissan Silvia K's performs almost identically to the Silvia, so you can choose whichever version you like most.

	The

	 Subaru BRZ

 <p>
	Players will need to modify the engine and transmission accurately to awaken this beast and rule the drift competitions
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	has to offer. The BRZ has a base top speed of 144 miles per hour and a 20 percent drift value. Without a doubt, it is one of the most suitable and balanced cars for any high-skill events such as drift, Gymkhana, or even Takeover, where players can score some additional points on every corner thanks to the responsiveness and precision of this car.

	The
	<strong>
	 Nissan Skyline
	</strong>
	is a fan favorite in the racing community and car enthusiasts. The Japanese-made car rose to a higher tier of popularity in the
	<em>
	 Fast and Furious
	</em>
	movie series, where it was featured multiple times. The GTR is also a favorite and common unit in most
	<em>
	 Need for Speed
	</em>
	games.

 <p>
	Of course, not many cars can compete with a well-modified Skyline GTR on the streets or the track, but when drifting around tight bends, the GTR excels at powering through with all-wheel drive and well-rounded handling and traction values. It's an amazing automobile and one of the very best cars for drifting in
	<em>
	 Need For Speed Unbound
	</em>
	. Granted, a cheaper Nissan Skyline R32 won't disappoint either and is a great vehicle for any drift enthusiast.

	Sitting at stock S-tier, the Z06 can be a fun pick for drifting events and can look good while hitting corners. With a top speed of 198 mph and a 3-second acceleration stat, it is a beast in its own right.

	Embark Studios has shown off details regarding the third season of its team-based shooter
	<strong>
	 <em>
		The Finals
	 </em>
	</strong>
	, which is set to launch on June 13
	<em>
	 .
	</em>
	<em>
	</em>
	Debuting back in December 2023, Season 3 of
	<em>
	 The Finals
	</em>
	will see a launch later this month, bringing with it new content for players to sink their teeth into.

 <p>
	<em>
	 The Finals
	</em>
	is a competitive team shooter stylized as a virtual reality blood sport in which three to five players team up and battle against other teams to complete various objects in a completely destructible location. The maps within the game sporting fully destructible buildings are one of the biggest draws for the game, as the ability for players to reshape the map themselves lends to a lot of tactical thinking and innovative gameplay between matches. Despite
	<em>
	 The Finals
	</em>
	underperforming since launch, Embark Studios is determined to re-ignite the game's momentum, and the changes being brought in Season 3 aim to help with this endeavor.

 <p>
	Season 3 for
	<em>
	 The Finals
	</em>
	looks to enhance the competitive experience of the game by introducing new game modes, maps, weapons, and equipment.
	<em>
	 The Final
	</em>
	's highly popular game mode, Terminal Attack, will see a continued run in Season 3 as a Ranked game mode, raising the stakes even higher in an already action-packed game mode. With no healing or revives, gamers will have to play more carefully than ever if they wish to come out on top. Players will get to experience a new map in the form of Kyoto 1568, sending players to Japan to battle through cobblestone paths and ancient temples, offering a stark contrast to the more urban city maps the game is known for. Players will also be able to try out new equipment, all inspired by feudal Japan, such as the recurve bow and dual katanas.

 <p>
	<em>
	 The Finals
	</em>
	is a game that, despite having a turbulent lifespan so far, may be on the path to something greater. Frequent bug fixes and performance enhancements make the game a smoother and more enjoyable experience for those still playing, and the constant addition of new content will make new faces want to try the game for themselves. Embark Studios was founded by former DICE employees, a studio most commonly known for the
	<em>
	 Battlefield
	</em>
	series which also sported destructible environments. Fully destructible terrain makes the gameplay loop exciting, and Embark Studios is looking to enhance that experience with Kyoto 1568. The new map offers layered buildings to make sneaking around easier for the stealthier player, or make it more fun for the more destructive players of
	<em>
	 The Finals
	</em>
	to level the entire map to the ground.

	a more fulfilling experience, but Embark Studios is taking steps in the right direction with this upcoming update. Season 3 of
	<em>

	is set to arrive on June 13.

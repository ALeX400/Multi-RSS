	Niantic has spoiled the
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Pokemon GO
	 </em>
	</strong>
	community with consistent content for years, but nothing quite compares to the possibility of winning a personalized PokeStop.
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	will host an event known as Pokemon GO Fest: Madrid on June 14 until June 16, taking place at the municipal park Parque Juan Carlos I and even reaching greater Madrid. Attendees will experience exclusive gameplay, receive special bonuses, and have the opportunity to explore the city of Madrid alongside their fellow trainers. Pokemon GO Fest: Madrid is a ticketed event that comes with one more incredible perk: the chance to have a personalized PokeStop featured in-game for a limited time.

	Since its release in 2016,
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO

	has hosted over 200 events, some of which are holiday-specific, such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, whereas others have coincided with real-life events, such as Fashion Week and the theatrical release of
	<em>
	 Detective Pikachu
	</em>
	. Certain events have focused on specific Pokemon, such as the Chansey Peach Festival, Lapras in Miyagi, and Alolan Exeggutor Event.

			<title>Wuthering Waves' Biggest Opportunity for Growth Isn't Rocket Science</title>

	<em>
	 <strong>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </strong>
	</em>
	' global debut has been a smashing success, despite encountering a few glitches at launch. The game's popularity is palpable, evidenced by strong viewership numbers on Twitch and over $10 million in mobile revenue within the first five days. With such overwhelmingly impressive numbers, it's undeniable that Kuro Games appears to have struck gold with their latest open-world RPG.

 <p>
	Interestingly, even with its massive success,
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	could be doing more to grow its playerbase. While the developers have already shown great generosity with in-game rewards, there's one obvious solution to sustain the ongoing success of the gacha title: a console release on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch. Although the thought is certain to have crossed the developer's minds, they may not realize just how viable this would be for long-term sustainability.

	Wuthering Waves Should Expand To As Many Platforms As Possible

 <p>
	Lauded for its vivid graphics and intricate combat system, PC and mobile players have been able to fully immerse themselves in all that Solaris-3 has to offer since the game launched on May 22. Fortunately for Apple users,
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	has plans to launch on the Mac App Store. Less optimally, the game's availability on other platforms remains uncertain.

 <p>
	Whether or not the title will be coming to consoles, it's clear that doing so would provide a huge boost for the playerbase. Since
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	offers the ability to play co-op, cross-platform play for more devices is a highly-anticipated feature. Additionally, with the console playerbase already home to a large and dedicated community, it seems Kuro Games may be shooting itself in the foot by limiting its game to PC and mobile users.

 <p>
	Notably,
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	is optimized for controllers, so matching the controls to Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch shouldn't be too challenging. The greatest obstacles would likely lie in adapting to the different hardware specs across these systems while ensuring that the graphics and performance levels are stable. Nevertheless, after the influx of revenue from the mobile community,
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	is guaranteed to increase its sales after expanding to the aforementioned consoles.

	Wuthering Waves Could Beat Genshin Impact To The Switch
 </h3>
 <p>
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	' massive audience presents a golden opportunity for Kuro Games to capitalize on the Switch market. Unlike other popular open-world gacha games like
	<em>
	 Genshin Impact
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Tower of Fantasy
	</em>
	, and
	<em>
	 AFK Journey
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	has the chance to be one of the first major titles in its niche to premier on the Switch. Not only could this advantage attract a dedicated playerbase hungry for a fresh free-to-play RPG experience, but it could also allow users who typically play on other devices to play on their Switch as well.

 <p>
	Interestingly, though
	<em>
	 Genshin Impact
	</em>
	put out a teaser trailer for an upcoming Switch release in January 2021, it has yet to appear on the platform. Considering that it's been over three years since the announcement, some suspect that HoYoverse is waiting for the Switch 2, which is confirmed to be coming sometime after March 2025. This theory could hold some ground since the Switch 2 is rumored to be a next-gen console with enhanced specs. While it has yet to be confirmed, some leakers have suggested that this includes an eight-inch LCD screen, backward compatibility, and similar processing power to the PS4.

 <p>
	The changes are part of a refocus for the studio. The growth period experienced by the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic saw Behaviour Interactive's size more than double, increasing from 575 employees to 1,300. During this period, the horror title reached over 60 million players and saw
	<em>
	 DbD
	</em>
	partnering with popular IPs like
	<em>
	 Dungeons and Dragons
	</em>
	<em>
	 ,
	</em>
	<em>
	 Stranger Things
	</em>
	, and
	<em>
	 Alan Wake.
	</em>
	The studio also focused on developing titles outside of horror, such as
	<em>
	 What the Fog
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Islands of Insight.
	</em>

 <p>
	The restructuring, however, will bring the studio back to its horror roots. The main focus of the studio will continue to be
	<em>

	The press release didn't mention if
	<em>
	 Project T
	</em>
	would be affected by the layoffs. Since
	<em>
	 The Casting of Frank Stone
	</em>
	is set to release this year, it can be assumed that the title will still launch. The positions of those laid off weren't specified, but it did note that production, product, business development, and marketing were the areas being restructured.

 <p>
	While Behaviour Interactive's layoffs aren't the largest in the industry, it comes at a time when the industry is experiencing high levels of unemployment across all disciplines and experience levels.

 <p>
	Hyperkin has recently revealed that its upcoming
	<strong>
	 Xbox Series X/S
	</strong>
	controller called “DuchesS” will be available on August 21, 2024, and pre-orders will start soon. The DuchesS will be based on the original “S Model” Xbox controller, and it will cost $50.

 <p>
	Originally unveiled back in January, Hyperkin’s DuchesS Xbox controller will bring back the design of the classic S Model gamepad, and it will be available in black and white colors, being compatible with Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows 10/11. The controller is modeled after the controller that Microsoft originally released in 2002, which reworked the previous "Duke" controller's design to be smaller.

 <p>
	Now, Hyperkin’s has finally announced the official release date and price for the DuchesS Xbox controller. The controller will be released on August 21, 2024, but gamers can pre-order it starting on July 15. This device can be purchased via Hyperkin’s official website or from Amazon, and it will cost $50 in the United States, but regional pricing may apply. The DuchesS will have a design that is greatly inspired by the original Xbox but with slight tweaks, such as a Share button, and it comes with a USB-C Port and a 3.5mm headset jack.

	This is not the first time that Hyperkin is behind a nostalgic comeback of classic Xbox controllers. Back in 2018, Hyperkin released Xbox’s “Duke” controller for Xbox One, for example, which was launched as a limited edition.

 <p>
	Xbox gamers certainly have plenty of options for controllers to pick from right now. Despite many unofficial models being available, the original Xbox Series X/S controller is still one of the best and most popular options, and Microsoft recently unveiled the new Fire Vapor Xbox controller. Priced at $69.99, this controller can be purchased exclusively via the Microsoft Store. While the actual design of the Fire Vapor Xbox controller is not any different from any regular controller, the visuals are pretty radical, as the device uses a color pattern that resembles flames instead of a single color.

 <p>
	Another controller that appeared recently and really stood out was Xbox’s Proteus Controller. While priced at $299, this controller is perfect for gamers with disabilities due to its “snap and play” parts that can be easily attached in different ways, which allows the gamer to customize it and get a more comfortable experience.

 <p>
	The rumored
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Final Fantasy 9
	 </em>
	</strong>
	remake has faced some development difficulties, a well-known leaker has claimed. Despite one notable setback, the reimagining of
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 9
	</em>
	is reportedly not in danger of cancellation, and is said to be progressing well.

 <p>
	While not officially confirmed, the game itself has been considered as one of Square Enix's worst-kept secrets for a while now. The first piece of evidence pointing to its existence dates back to summer 2021, when a
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 9
	</em>
	remake was mentioned in the Nvidia GeForce Now leak, which has repeatedly been proven accurate. Multiple insiders have reaffirmed its existence ever since.

 <h2 id="rumored-final-fantasy-9-remake-switched-developers-leaker-claims">
	Rumored Final Fantasy 9 Remake Switched Developers, Leaker Claims
 </h2>
 <p>
	Yet another update on the much-rumored project has now been provided by Midori, an established leaker with a long track record of gaming industry scoops. Taking to Twitter on June 4, Midori said that the
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 9
	</em>
	remake is still in development, but has previously faced one not-everyday setback. Specifically, Square Enix originally outsourced the project to an external studio, but decided to reassign it to a different developer after not being "satisfied" with its first choice's results, the leaker claimed. When exactly this purported developer switch happened is unclear, but the move is possibly years old, not least because the insider insists that the development of the
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 9
	</em>
	remake is "very far along" as of mid-2024.

 <p>
	Although the wording of the report implies that Square Enix may now be working on the
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 9
	</em>
	remake in-house, Midori did not outright confirm that. What they did say is that the RPG survived Square Enix's recent restructuring, which saw the company admit to writing off ¥22.1 billion ($140.4 million) in "content abandonment" losses attributed to a variety of game cancellations.

 <p>
	With the remake of the classic 2000 JRPG now supposedly being in an advanced stage of development, Midori believes that it could hit the market in the second half of 2024. However, the insider noted that they are not certain whether that will actually happen. If Square Enix were to release it by year's end, the
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 9
	</em>
	remake would have to be announced in the immediate future if it's to have a marketing cycle of any substantial length. In that scenario, the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase would be the earliest high-profile opportunity for the publisher to unveil it. Midori claims that Square Enix will indeed have a presence at the June 9 event, but says that they are uncertain whether the
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 9
	</em>
	remake will be part of its event lineup.

	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 9
	</em>
	remake was previously rumored to be a PlayStation console exclusive, Midori says that Square Enix is currently planning to treat the game to a multi-platform release.

      <title>Best Batman Games, Ranked</title>

 <p>
  Once upon a time, DC's
  <strong>
   Batman
  </strong>
  seemed to get a new game every other year. The Dark Knight was the talk of the town, and his run under Rocksteady's banner arguably helped usher in a new era of superhero games that is still going strong today.

  However, in recent years, Batman has taken a backseat in the video game department. The Caped Crusader has not received a proper standalone outing since 2017's
  <em>
   The Enemy Within
  </em>
  , and no news has come out to suggest that will be changing anytime soon. While comic fans have plenty of upcoming superhero titles to look forward to, if someone wants to wear Bruce Wayne's cowl, they will need to look to the past to find the
  <strong>
   best Batman games

   Batman games have become very rare nowadays, which is a shame. To help fill the void until the next adventure, two more classics have been added to this discussion.

     Generally, only games starring Batman will be included. Some borderline cases will be included, like the
     <em>
      Injustice
     </em>
     series since The Dark Knight plays a central role in the stories and
     <em>
      Gotham Knights
     </em>
     since the Bat Family is an extension of Batman.

  <em>
   Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu
  </em>
  occupies a unique place in
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  gaming history. Although it uses the designs and overall continuity of the
  <em>
   New Batman Adventures
  </em>
  TV show, it stars an original villain named Sin Tzu who seeks out the toughest opponents to defeat them in combat. Naturally, this draws him into the cross-hairs of Batman.

 <p>
  At its core, this game is a surprisingly difficult beat-em-up where Batman fights through legions of henchmen before ending each stage with a boss who has been broken out by Sin Tzu. You can level up and buy new combos but most importantly, you and up to four friends can play as Batman, Robin (Tim Drake), Nightwing, or Batgirl.
  <em>
   Rise of Sin Tzu
  </em>
  is at its best with four players, and while it will likely never top a
  <strong>
   best Batman games
  </strong>
  list, it is fun enough to play once.

  The
  <em>
   Batman Arkham
  </em>
  brand is synonymous with quality. Even the weakest console release (
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  ) is an above-average action-adventure game. Unfortunately, the franchise's single attempt to transfer over to the handheld market resulted in a significant decline in quality.

 <p>
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate
  </em>
  is a side-scrolling Metroidvania set within the titular prison after it has been taken over by a myriad of DC villains. Not the most original of stories, but it gets the job done. The game adjusts
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  's influential combat system to complement the limitations of portable consoles, but the transition could have been a lot smoother. Ultimately, this is a mediocre game in a subseries known for excellence.

  While not one of the easiest titles to revisit in the modern age, the Caped Crusader's debut game was ambitious for its era. Before closing shop in 1998, Ocean Software was a prolific development team that produced some great titles, including 1987's
  <em>
   Head over Heels
  </em>
  and 1992's
  <em>
   The Addams Family
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  ranks among the company's better projects. An isometric platformer, the game guides players from one impressive room to the next, challenging them to find Batman's equipment, avoid traps and enemies, and make the occasional decision.

  Although dated,
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  's visuals hold up reasonably well, provided someone goes in expecting 8-bit graphics. The map is essentially a labyrinth that regularly forces players to make choices that could lead to dead ends, which could be literal considering the game's overall difficulty. To combat the gameplay's potentially frustrating nature, Ocean incorporated a save system, which was an innovative move in 1986.

  Based on Christopher Nolan's movie,
  <em>
   Batman Begins
  </em>
  has slipped through the cracks due to coming out just a few years before
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  , a game that is superior in nearly every way. However, Eurocom's 2005 release was a better-than-average licensed game for its era, and it was impressive in some regards. For one, the visuals were great, and they are still decent today. The voice acting was also top-notch, with many actors from the film reprising their roles.

 <p>
  <em>
   Batman Begins
  </em>
  falters slightly in the gameplay department, albeit not to the point of becoming unplayable. The game is just a bit unfocused in this area, combining a few different ideas to create a serviceable but ultimately shallow whole. Nevertheless, this was a fine late addition to the PS2, Game Cube, and Xbox libraries.

 <p>
  Technically,
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  is not a Batman game, at least in terms of playable characters. That said, the Dark Knight's shadow looms heavily over this version of Gotham. The main storyline centers around the Caped Crusader, while the four playable heroes – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – are all intrinsically linked to Batman. In the last 20 years, DC has emphasized the Bat Family quite a bit in the comics, and this association serves as the beating heart of WB Games Montreal's action-adventure title. Despite giving off heavy "lone wolf" energy, Bruce Wayne has repeatedly searched for a successor capable of picking up the mantle of protecting Gotham once he is no longer around.
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  brings that ambition to fruition.

  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  shines the brightest in its characters and story. All four leads are likable and bounce off each other well, and cutscenes change depending on which character players are using at the time. Each hero essentially serves as a separate class, and they all have unique skill trees and individualized progression systems. The narrative assembles a wide selection of Gotham's most dangerous villains, ranging from the lesser-known but fascinating Court of Owls to heavyweights like Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn.

 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  consisted of nothing but story missions, it would rank higher on this list. However, the game bogs itself down with open-world busy work that only serves to pad out the campaign's runtime. Gotham has a few impressive locations, but they are spread thin across a rather empty and often uninspired map. The combat also leaves something to be desired, and it is made worse by the fact that enemies are damage sponges.

  For better or worse,
  <em>
   Batman: Return of the Joker
  </em>
  is a bog-standard NES action-platformer. It controls well enough to be playable but features plenty of "Nintendo Hard" sections that threaten to be frustrating rather than fun. Unsurprisingly, Batman's moveset is limited and mostly consists of ranged attacks along with a typical jump.

  There is not too much to say about this project due to just how basic it is; however, that does not mean it is bad.
  <em>
   Batman: Return of the Joker
  </em>
  is a perfectly serviceable representative of this type of project, and it benefits from a stylish presentation that fits the IP and seems to take inspiration from
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  , at least in its color palette.

  <em>
   Arkham

  's rise,
  <em>
   Batman: The Brave And The Bold – The Videogame
  </em>
  showcases a different side of DC's legendary hero. Based on the eponymous animated series,
  <em>
   The Brave And The Bold

  Blending platforming and beat 'em up combat,
  <em>

  Back in the 16-bit console era, it would have been quite impossible for Batman games to have heavily detailed stealth or detective mechanics. Thus, fans received mostly linear side-scrollers, but that doesn't mean they weren't fun. Case in point, Konami's classic
  <em>
   Batman Returns
  </em>
  on the Super Nintendo.

 <p>
  Aside from a single Batmobile driving level, the game follows the events of the movie as Batman fights Catwoman, The Penguin, and endless legions of thugs from a beat-em-up perspective. While the game is hardly revolutionary, the graphics have aged quite well and the controls are solid, making its combat highly satisfying. Its cheap bosses knock it down a peg compared to other beat-em-ups on the SNES, but it's still fun to throw criminals into glass windows after stunning them with a Batarang.

  A slightly forgotten entry in the Caped Crusader's gaming career, Konami's
  <em>
   Batman: The Animated Series
  </em>
  does an impressive job of paying tribute to its beloved source material while making the most of the Game Boy's limited hardware. Obviously, realistic expectations are needed when analyzing a licensed game for a handheld system that debuted in 1989, but all things considered, Konami could not have done a better job putting together a project that delivers solid gameplay, great visuals, and even better music.

  Controlling either The Dark Knight or Boy Wonder, players work their way through an array of stages centering around different villains from the show. Each segment is somewhat standalone, which makes the campaign feel episodic in nature. While
  <em>
   Batman: The Animated Series
  </em>
  might not blow most players away, it has more than enough positives to justify a recommendation for people who have a fondness for Game Boy-era releases.

  Developed by Ubisoft, of all people,
  <em>
   Batman: Vengeance
  </em>
  is one of quite a few early 3D games that have been consumed by
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  's shadow. The consensus seems to be that none of the Caped Crusader's pre-Rocksteady projects are worth seeking out in this day and age, which is slightly unfair. Sure, most of them are way too clunky to hold up to modern scrutiny, but there are a few gems that deserve some recognition.
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  is one such title.

 <p>
  Now, to be clear, this 2001 release is not some forgotten masterpiece, nor is it one of the greatest superhero games of all time. However,
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  does a good job of capturing the source material's style and spirit, particularly
  <em>
   Batman: TAS
  </em>
  . The game tells a pretty good story, and it even features a surprisingly complex combat system for its era.

  Retro gamers still loyal to Nintendo's breakout console still swear by this Batman title and after playing it, it's easy to understand why.
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  on the NES is a simple side-scroller where players must reach the end of a stage, beat a boss, and move on to the next one until they reach The Joker.

 <p>
  From its wall-jumping puzzles to its various weapon power-ups, the game plays extremely similar to
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  on the same console, which isn't a bad template for an 8-bit Batman title. What puts this over the edge of many other
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  movie games, though, is its presentation. The 8-bit cutscenes look amazing for their time and its soundtrack shines on a system known for classic soundtracks. Very much worth the time of any Batman fan.

  <em>
   Batman: The Telltale Series
  </em>
  garnered a mixed reception during its initial run due to suffering from performance issues, particularly the PC version. Telltale fixed quite a few of these problems once the season was completed, allowing the actual quality of the content to take center stage rather than its technical execution.

  For the most part,
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  offers a nuanced look into the hero's psyche, and it does a great job of distinguishing between the character's different personas. Most games do not even show Bruce Wayne with the cowl, let alone emphasize his role in the Batman mythos. Telltale goes out of its way to define Wayne as a counterpart to the Caped Crusader, and it is great. The rest of the cast is also very good.

 <p>
  There are a couple of
  <em>
   The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin
  </em>
  games available, and they are not ports of each other. The Genesis game is an average beat 'em up that has fast-paced combat that is entertaining but becomes repetitive quickly. The soundtrack is also mind-numbing. The Game Gear version was fine for its era, but it might struggle to hold somebody's interest all these years later. Finally, Konami's
  <em>
   The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin
  </em>
  graced the SNES, delivering lethargic gameplay along with fantastic visuals and music.

 <p>
  As an action-adventure beat 'em up, the SNES game is rather one-note, mostly consisting of moving along a straight line while plowing through repetitive enemies. However,
  <em>
   The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin
  </em>
  faithfully captures
  <em>
   Batman: The Animated Series
  </em>
  ' look and sound. The backdrops are jaw-dropping and perfectly replicate the source material; meanwhile, the soundtrack utilizes the show's classic music, which just never grows old. Even though the action is not great, the game earns points for allowing players to pick a gadget loadout before a stage, which adds some variety and customization.

  The Dark Knight's third solo
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  adventure is bigger and, in some ways, better than everything that came before. At the time of its debut, this game had arguably the best roster in any release in the franchise, not just the ones starring Bats.
  <em>
   Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham
  </em>
  delivers exactly what its title advertises, pushing the Caped Crusader away from his main hunting grounds into the wider DC universe.

 <p>
  Gameplay-wise, this is generally more of the same, offering a mix of puzzles, light combat, and exploration. The story is also quite amusing.
  <em>
   Beyond Gotham
  </em>
  's most divisive element is the inclusion of hub areas that contain most of the game's content outside the story missions. While visiting iconic locations like the Hall of Justice and Justice League Watchtower is fun, the hubs vary greatly in quality and size, making quite a few of them underwhelming.
  <em>
   Beyond Gotham
  </em>
  might have been better off creating one big city.

  Rocksteady Studios is synonymous with the Caped Crusader, but this association does not stem from
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham VR
  </em>
  's brilliance. This project is undoubtedly the developer's least impressive foray into DC's universe, even if it is still fairly decent. Prior to jumping into this virtual reality package, fans should temper expectations as this is a rather restricted experience.

 <p>
  The thought of viewing the world through Batman's eyes is enticing, and
  <em>
   Arkham VR
  </em>
  scratches that itch to a certain extent. As Bruce Wayne, players step into his alter-ego's shoes as they head out to investigate a murder mystery. Featuring appearances by many figures found in Rocksteady's mainline
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games, this project tells an effective storyline that would not seem out of place on the pages of a comic. Batman's detective skills are put front and center, and this aspect of the campaign is reasonably immersive.

 <p>
  Otherwise,
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham VR
  </em>
  is lacking in content. The game has no combat, which is arguably the most beloved part of Rocksteady's
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  trilogy, and the controls can be clumsy at times. While die-hard Dark Knight fans will probably get a kick out of this project,
  <em>
   Arkham VR
  </em>
  is not a must-play release.

  Calling this a Batman game might be a stretch since it is clearly under the
  <em>
   Justice League
  </em>
  brand, but it warrants a mention since the Caped Crusader is one of
  <em>
   Cosmic Chaos
  </em>
  ' three playable characters. While all three heroes (Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman) will need to be used at one point or another, players can switch between them on the fly, allowing them to play most of the campaign as Bats if that's what they would like to do. More importantly, this 2023 release launched with very little fanfare, so much so that it might have slipped by even die-hard DC fans. And, while not the biggest superhero-themed game released in the last few years,
  <em>
   Cosmic Chaos
  </em>
  was arguably among the best, as long as someone goes in with realistic expectations. PHL crafted a charming and accessible brawler that oozes personality and humor.

  At a glance,
  <em>
   Justice League: Cosmic Chaos
  </em>
  may seem like an uninspired children's game, especially since it had such a muted debut for a project featuring DC's holy trinity. However, there is a lot to appreciate here. The writing is witty and filled with little nods to all three characters' legacies. The beat 'em up-style combat is flashy and enjoyable, even if it is not particularly deep. All three characters play differently enough to ensure there is enough variety to keep things interesting throughout the campaign. Set in a sandbox,
  <em>
   Cosmic Chaos
  </em>
  gives players the freedom to explore Happy Harbor, and the open-world has a decent range of optional content to complement the main missions.

  Is this a "traditional" Batman game? Obviously, no; however, it shows a different side to the Caped Crusader and two of his closest companions.

  Overshadowed entirely by its superior successor,
  <em>
   Injustice: Gods Among Us
  </em>
  is somewhat difficult to recommend in this day and age. While far from terrible, the gameplay is stiff even by NetherRealm's standards, and a few characters are so overpowered that they throw the roster's balancing completely off. Still, the
  <em>
   Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  can be picked up for a steal, and its single-player content should be able to keep a DC fan entertained for a couple of hours.

  The combat might leave something to be desired, but the same cannot be said for the story.
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  's tale of Superman-gone-bad can be consumed in a few different forms of media, but the game's iteration is still the best of the bunch. More importantly, this story is all-around great, arguably ranking among DC's better narratives of the 2010s. An argument could also be made that
  <em>
   Gods Among Us
  </em>
  is better than its sequel in this area.

  The
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  games have gradually evolved to incorporate large sandboxes and hundreds of characters;
  <em>
   Lego Batman: The Videogame
  </em>
  is from a different era. Released before these releases started to incorporate open-worlds or voice acting, this
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  is a level-based action-adventure game overflowing with humor and charm.

  Despite lacking voices, this title still manages to capture the personalities of the legendary characters that make up Gotham City. This entry also has the best story in the
  <em>
   Lego Batman
  </em>
  trilogy, perhaps a benefit of the campaign's streamlined nature. Along with just being really fun to play, this game is an endearing celebration of The Dark Knight's mythos and legacy.

 <p>
  The black sheep of the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  franchise,
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  deserves more love. Yes, the game notoriously launched in an underwhelming state that rightfully garnered criticism. It also recycles
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  's map and features an uninspired selection of boss battles, at least when compared to its predecessors. WB Games Montreal's prequel is far from perfect, but it is not a stain on the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  name either and would have been a positive addition to the myriad of compilations the series has produced in recent years.

 <p>
  Even though the setting is the same, the snow-covered Gotham looks absolutely gorgeous, and this seemingly small change makes the city feel fresh. The story has its share of great moments, particularly in its first two acts. Finally, the combat system is nearly as good as
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  , and arguably even improves on the formula in places.

  <em>
   Batman: The Telltale Series
  </em>
  laid the groundwork for a superior sequel, and
  <em>
   The Enemy Within
  </em>
  delivers in almost every area. Season 2 revolves around arguably DC's greatest relationship: Batman and Joker (John Doe). While the latter was a part of the previous season, the Joker's story is properly told in
  <em>
   The Enemy Within
  </em>
  , and players get to actively influence the narrative's direction.

  This season's first few episodes are a bit cumbersome as they are bogged down by too many unenjoyable puzzles, but things improve greatly from around episode 3. After that,
  <em>
   The Enemy Within
  </em>
  transforms into something special as it tells one of the strongest Batman stories in gaming.

  While
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stardew Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers a realistic farm management experience, there is much more to the game than farming. In Pelican Town, you have the freedom to be creative and craft various items that will help you on your journey. One essential tool for crafting is the Workbench. Crafting becomes much easier with the help of a Workbench since it removes the hassle of carrying the necessary items in your inventory all the time. For those who want to learn more about how to effectively use this convenient tool, continue reading.

  The Workbench allows you to craft items using resources stored in adjacent chests. Once you have placed a Workbench on your farm, you can access the contents of chests located on the eight tiles surrounding it. This enables you to store crafting materials in these chests and use them directly through the Workbench without needing to manually transfer the items to your inventory.

  To use a Workbench, place it in any accessible location within your base where you can easily interact with it.

      <title>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance - Da'at and the Nahobino Have Deep Theological Roots</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-vengeance-daat-nahobino-abrahamic-religion-inspiration/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The recent release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
   </em>
  </strong>
  sees the already impressive JRPG becoming even better through the addition of a brand-new storyline that runs concurrent to the original. Dubbed the Canon of Vengeance,
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  's new alternate campaign starts similarly to the original game's plot (now referred to as the Canon of Creation) but branches off after just the first several hours, placing a greater emphasis on new human characters and a host of new adversaries led by the enigmatic Lilith. Like many other games in the
  <em>
   SMT
  </em>
  series or its most popular offshoot,
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  , the naming conventions and plot points in
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  have some very obvious theological roots.

 <p>
  Without even getting into the naming conventions of the many demons that players can recruit in
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  , the names of both the protagonist and the realm that players explore are extremely significant, especially considering the game's general plot and the new primary antagonist introduced in the Canon of Vengeance. Players getting to control the Nahobino might not seem all that important on its own, but learning the etymology behind the name, as well as the significance of the world being called "Da'at", illustrates some strong connections between
  <em>
   Vengeance
  </em>
  and the Abrahamic religions.

 <p>
  The beginning of
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  utilizes a voice-over in its intro to establish a history of the war between the presumed forces of good and evil, along with an explanation of how demons came to be in the aftermath of God's ascension to the throne of creation. In the world of
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  , the commonly understood deity of the Abrahamic religions, YHVH, was one of many gods who just happened to be successful in a bid for supreme power. As a result of his claim over the universe's knowledge, all other gods and their descendants became demons.

 <p>
  What makes the protagonist of
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  special is his ability to blend his humanity with the essence of a demon (in this case, the divine entity Aogami). The name "Nahobino" seems to be derived from "naobi" or "Naobi-No-Kami", which are terms from Shintoism (Japan's oldest religion) that refer to entities of purification. Essentially, a "naobi" is a spirit that rectifies a previous wrong, but the term has also been applied to the cultural pursuit of knowledge and ethical consciousness in Japan. Given the importance of knowledge (or the concept of "true" or hidden knowledge) in
  <em>
   SMT
  </em>
  <em>
   5
  </em>
  's plot, it's obvious the naming convention bears significance.

 <p>
  As if the general storyline of
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  or the naming of its protagonist weren't enough, players can draw a clear throughline between the game and its themes back to the Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism just from the name of the game's world. More than just the official name of the netherworld in
  <em>
   SMT 5
  </em>
  , Da'at is a location of pronounced significance in the practice of Kabbalah. Da'at is understood to mean "knowledge", and in the Kabbalistic tradition, is the location in the Tree of Life in which all branches (
  <em>
   sefirot
  </em>
  ) unite as one. In other words, it is the place of ultimate knowledge or understanding.

 <p>
  Given that
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  explicitly outlines that it is humanity's wrongful taking of knowledge that results in them being cast out of paradise (another Biblical allegory), and that it is the Nahobino's knowledge and humanity combined with demonic power that makes him a being of powerful potential, naming the game's world Da'at has an obvious thematic significance. To be fair,
  <em>
   SMT 5
  </em>
  is but one of many JRPGs with obvious connections to esoteric thought or spiritual concepts (something that
  <em>
   Xenogears
  </em>
  did to a pronounced degree more than 25 years ago), but its naming conventions and connections that they have to the game's themes give an already excellent narrative even more depth.

      <title>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Big Multiplayer Innovations Won’t Matter if One Issue Isn’t Addressed</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  is officially coming in November, bringing a host of new multiplayer improvements for fans to chew on. Treyarch has really leaned into revamping the movement system, with their “Omnimovement” allowing for full, 360 degree sprinting, diving, and sliding. There are plenty of other new toys coming to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  with several fan favorite features that were absent in previous iterations, including round-based zombies and a more traditional perk system.

 <p>
  But even before release, there’s something already plaguing the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  multiplayer experience. It’s a problem that’s been haunting every
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game for years and some players probably don’t even know it exists. It’s been negatively impacting the franchise for longer than anyone could guess, and
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  won’t be able to reach its full potential unless Treyarch finally addresses the elephant in the room.

  It doesn’t matter what improvements are made to multiplayer if Treyarch does not address the insidious damage the matchmaking system inflicts on the experience. Skill-based matchmaking has been upsetting the flow of the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  multiplayer for years; some players still aren’t fully aware of the effects it’s been having on their matches.

 <p>
  Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) has been in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles since as early as 2007 with the original
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
  </em>
  What it essentially does is match similarly skilled
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  players together based on an invisible number assigned to players that changes with their performance. In theory, it’s meant to prevent players of lower skill levels being pitted against seasoned series veterans and having miserable games. It’s not inherently bad by any means and when implemented right; it can make games a lot more fair for everyone playing them. The problem is it isn’t always implemented well.

  Does Call of Duty Need Skill-Based Matchmaking?

 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  ’s SBMM has seen plenty of criticism in years past, and with good reason. It’s incredibly common to still end up in wildly mismatched lobbies despite the supposed matchmaking system at play. Playing even just one afternoon of a
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game will result in at least a dozen matches with one team completely and hopelessly outgunned.

 <p>
  Some players feel that it unfairly penalizes them for above-average performance. One stellar match causes their MMR to rise, placing them into much, much harder games for an indeterminate amount of time. This is one of the more common issues with SBMMs in general, and past
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games are no exception to this, as one or two good games can get a better-than-average player in over their head.

 <p>
  There’s even an argument to be made that SBMM doesn’t belong in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  at all, and that matchmaking should be left solely up to chance. The idea is that the game would be more fun if teams were not evenly matched 100% of the time, eliminating the need to try extra hard against equally matched opponents every single game. This would, of course, result in horribly mismatched games more often, but it would also mean that players are more likely to have more of those overwhelming victories. 50/50 odds are pretty dicey when it’s a one-time gamble, but even if every match is a 50/50 gamble (which it likely wouldn't be, in reality) individuals will have about as many good games as bad.

  What Can Call of Duty Use Instead of Skill-Based Matchmaking?
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are a few alternatives to
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's current SBMM system, the most obvious of which being straight up removing any sort of matchmaking system at all. While this would result in more or less evenly dispersed chaos in theory, it’s more than understandable why Treyarch would want some level of balance with its matchmaking. Steamroll games, one way or the other, get old very quickly and keeping them to a minimum is key to player retention.

 <p>
  The best option for Treyarch before
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  drops is also probably the most difficult. Fixing the existing matchmaking system is a tall order, but the long term benefits of doing so will benefit the playerbase for years to come. Reworking it so that one-off games don’t impact MMR dramatically one way or the other might make SBMM almost invisible all on its own. Creating an environment where lopsided games are a rarity instead of an everyday occurrence can go a long way towards keeping the playerbase engaged with games that are always winnable.

  Being able to soak up damage in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  makes completing hard events much easier. There are lots of very strong enemies in the game that can take down players in a single hit if they aren't well-prepared. While having good armor does help, there are a few other things that players can do to maximize their damage resistance.

  Depending on the player's build, there are legendary effects, perk cards, and consumables that can help boost their damage resistance. By combining high AP, high damage resistance, and high damage output, it's possible for players to truly conquer the ruins of post-war Appalachia.

  There are two main armor types in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  : Power Armor and regular armor. While there are lots of variations of both armor types, for the most part, Power Armor tends to offer more damage resistance.

  Without any legendary effects, perks, or other damage resistance increasing items,
  <strong>
   the Power Armor set that offers the most damage resistance is T-65
  </strong>
  . By having certain legendary effects, T-65 Power Armor can offer incredible amounts of protection. Legendary effects that players will want to keep an eye out for can be seen below:

  As for standard armor, the one that is often quoted as being the
  <strong>
   best armor in
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
   is Secret Service armor
  </strong>
  . This untradable armor set is a costly one. However, it's more than worth it as it has a great base damage resistance. The best legendary effects for boosting damage resistance on Secret Service armor can be seen below:

  There are lots of modifications that players can add to their armor pieces. For every armor piece, there's a mod section dedicated to increasing the player's damage resistance. Unfortunately, there aren't really any mods that offer damage resistance boosts for Power Armor pieces. This is because Power Armor already has pretty high damage resistances as standard. The mods that increase the player's damage resistance can be seen below:

  For the biggest increase,

  Backpacks do more than increase the player's carry weight. There are backpack mods that reduce the weight of various items, reduce the rate at which food spoils, and a mod that increases the player's damage resistance.

  The armor-plated backpack mod
  <strong>
   increases the player's damage resistance by 90.
  </strong>
  To get the plan to craft this mod, the player will need to buy it for 5 Possum Badges at a Possum Vending Machine. For those who don't know where to find a Possum Vending Machine, one can be found at Camp Adams.

  There are lots of different consumables in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  that help to increase a player's damage resistance. While they only work for a limited amount of time, they can be crafted, purchased, or farmed so that the player can have a steady supply of consumables that boost the player's damage resistance.

  Mutations are something that most players have on all of their characters.
  <strong>
   There are a total of 18 different mutations in the game.
  </strong>
  There are mutations to suit all playstyles. Some increase the player's movement speed, others boost the player's damage output, and some can increase the player's damage resistance.

 <p>
  Scaly Skin gives players a +50 to their damage and energy resistance. This can be boosted if the player is using the Strange in Numbers perk alongside it. The negative effect that comes with this mutation is a -50 to the player's overall AP. However, as listed above, the Class Freak perk can dramatically reduce the negative effects that come with using mutations.

 <p>
  The other two mutations don't directly affect the player's damage resistance. Instead, they double the benefits gained by consuming plant-based or meat-based meals, depending on which mutation the player opts to have.

 <p>
  As shown in the consumables entry above, there are some foods that boost the player's damage resistance for a limited time. So, for example, consuming Fried Fog Crawler gives the players a +25 to damage resistance. However, if the player is using the carnivore mutation, then this boost goes up to +50 to damage resistance.

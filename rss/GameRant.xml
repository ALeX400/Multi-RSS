  Summer in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stardew Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  means green trees, grass, and butterflies. There are nine birthdays and two festivals, the Luau and the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies. In the summer of the first year, the railroad and spa area of the game map is unlocked as well.

  Every season in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  has its quirks. As usual, players are expected to farm. However, the summer season influences the fish, crops, foragables, events, and weather. The best things players can do in summer includes finding what can profit them the best and what to prepare for in the events and coming fall season.

    Updated July 15th, 2024, by Alexandra O'Leary:
   </strong>
   Seasons are fundamental to Stardew Valley. Instead of months, there are four seasons that mark the passage of time in Pelican Town. They dictate the kind of crops players can grow, what items they can forage, as well as the types of artisanal items that can be made. Seasons add a sense of importance to the tasks players do each day, since they have limited time to complete them. There are also important events that only take place during certain seasons, like festivals and birthdays - and players will want to save the date.

  Summer is one of the prettiest and most exciting months of the year. With great weather and a great selection of festivals, it's a brilliant season to keep busy. Now that the Stardew Valley 1.6 Update has been out for a few months, players have had time to discover all the new and fun things they can do during the summer.

  <strong>
   Starfruit
  </strong>
  is an incredibly profitable crop, but it's unlikely that players in their first year will have access to the Oasis store in Calico Desert where Sandy sells these seeds. However, in the second and third years, buying a few extra Starfruit seed packets is ideal for summer. It's the most profitable crop in the game, once processed into Wine a Keg and aged in a Cask.

 <p>
  A regular Starfruit will sell for 750 gold, but once processed in a Keg, the resulting Wine is bumped to 2250 gold. This processing price is the same for Starfruit of any quality, but is an especially nice boost for any regular quality Starfruit.

  <strong>

  How to Obtain Summer Bundle Items
 </h3>
 <p>
  As the names might suggest, there are certain themes to these bundles, and getting ahead of the game is key to completing them quickly and efficiently. Whether it's crops, fish, or foraging for flowers, making the most of the summer from day one is integral to making money and completing the season's bundles. The items required are all easier to get during the summer season, so players will want to start collecting them as soon as possible.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Grapes
   </strong>
   can be grown, but the catch is they aren't a summer crop. They may grow if players plant Summer Seeds, but otherwise, Grape Starters can only be bought and grown in the Fall. However, Grapes can be foraged in the summer, and are easy to find all around the map.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Spice Berries
   </strong>
   can be foraged during the summer and are another plentiful item. They can also appear in the farmer's cave if players choose the Fruit Bat option when unlocking it. Demetrius also stocks Spice Berries in his shop at the Desert Festival, which takes place in Spring - so players can always get ahead and secure these
   <em>
    before
   </em>
   the summer season arrives.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Sweet Peas

   <strong>
    Melons
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Corn
   </strong>
   can be grown in the summer though, and they can both be purchased from Pierre's shop for 80g and 150g respectively (or from JojaMart for a lot more money.)
  </li>
  <li>
   The best way to ensure quality crops grow is to use quality fertilizer. The combination of deluxe fertilizer and a player with high farming skills should produce gold star crops. Deluxe fertilizer can be crafted using one iridium bar and 40 sap.

  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Shad
   </strong>
   can be caught in Pelican Town and Cindersnap Forest's River. Farmers with a pet Cat may also be gifted a Shad if they have the maximum friendship level. There is also a chance a Shad will appear in Krobus' shop, or the Traveling Cart, but this is random and an unreliable method of obtaining this fish.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Sturgeon
   </strong>
   can be caught in the Mountain Lake, most likely on a rainy summer day. Farmers with a pet Cat may also be gifted a Sturgeon if they have the maximum friendship level. There is also a chance it will appear in Krobus' shop, or the Traveling Cart, but this is random and an unreliable method of obtaining this fish.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Tuna
   </strong>
   can be caught in the ocean at the bottom of the map. They can also be caught in the ocean on Ginger Island, and may also appear in the Traveling Cart's randomly rotating stock.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Red Snappers
   </strong>
   can be caught in the ocean at The Beach. There's a small chance it will appear in the Traveling Cart's randomly rotating stock.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Tilapia
   </strong>
   can be caught in the ocean at The Beach, or in the ocean on the west and north sides of Ginger Island. There is also a chance Tilapia will appear in Krobus' shop, or the Traveling Cart, but this is random and an unreliable method of obtaining this fish.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Pufferfish
   </strong>
   can be caught in the ocean at The Beach at the bottom of the map. They can also be caught on Ginger Island, or potentially appear in the Traveling Cart's randomly rotating stock.

   Crops are a big money-maker in summer

  For a first-year summer especially, if the player can afford it, it's a good idea to
  <strong>
   invest in a coop or barn
  </strong>
  at this point. Coops will be the most likely choice for most players and will help with completing community center bundles, as well as contribute extra profit from mayonnaise.

  <strong>
   Blueberries
  </strong>
  are known to be the most profitable crop of summer.
  <strong>
   They take 13 days to grow and produce three berries with every harvest
  </strong>
  . While the blueberries can be sold raw, they can also be turned into jelly or wine.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Make sure to plant blueberry seeds (bought from Pierre's shop) on the first day of summer
  </strong>
  . That way, players can harvest from the plant about four times before fall comes. Seeds only cost 80 gold while each berry sells for 50 gold. That is 150 gold per harvest since each harvest produces three berries.

  Gold star blueberries should be a top priority for the player to
  <strong>
   place into kegs and preserves jars.
  </strong>
  Even on their own, they won't sell for as much as they will once they're turned into jelly or wine. The only difference is the time spent turning them into these products, so it depends on how fast the player needs a profit.

   Corn
  </strong>
  is a little special because it grows throughout both summer and fall. So it can be a part of a farm for half of an entire year. Like blueberries, corn can be harvested multiple times.

  <strong>
   It takes corn 14 days to grow

   Corn can be used to make cooking oil
  </strong>
  in the oil maker. While the selling price of cooking oil isn't great, it's an important ingredient for a lot of good recipes. Players will want to cook a bunch of recipes to gain access to powerful buffs, so make sure to save a few pieces of corn for cooking purposes.

  There are a lot of fish that can only be caught during the summer. These include
  <strong>
   Pufferfish, Tuna, Rainbow Trout, Octopus, Dorado, and Crimsonfish
  </strong>
  . For players that complete the main quest (the Community Center or Joja Community), some of these fish can be accessible during all seasons on Ginger Island. These fish include Tuna and Pufferfish.

 <p>
  Some are particularly hard to get, and not only because they are only around for one season. For example, Crimsonfish requires level five fishing and can only be caught at the East Pier on the beach.

  The fishing mini-game can be a little challenging for newcomers to the game. If it gets frustrating, it's possible to also level up the fishing skill by
  <strong>
   purchasing or crafting crab pots
  </strong>
  and placing them in water. These are great all year, but especially useful at the beginning of the game.

  There are several ways to get them.
  <strong>
   To unlock Quality Sprinklers, players need to have a farmer at level six
  </strong>
  . It is also a reward for completing the Summer Crops Bundle or the Garden Bundle in the Pantry. On rare occasions, it can be in the stock of the Traveling Cart or be found in a treasure room in the Skull Cavern.

  For players who have unlocked the sewers with the Rusty Key and have extra money,
  <strong>
   Iridium Sprinklers
  </strong>
  are already a possibility as early as the summer of the first year.

   Every Friday, Krobus will sell one for 10,000 gold.

 <p>
  On the 11th of summer, the
  <strong>
   Luau event
  </strong>
  occurs between nine in the morning and two o'clock in the afternoon. The main event attraction is a potluck soup, and players are going to want to save a high-quality ingredient to add to the soup. While this won't net a profit of gold, it is a great way to boost a ton of villager friendships all at once. With a high-quality item added to the soup, players will get 120 friendship points with the villagers in attendance.

 <p>
  Keep in mind that only uncooked but still edible items are allowed to be added to the soup. Examples of items that work include wines, fish, milk, crops, and some foragables like mushrooms. Just make sure it is iridium or gold quality.

  If the player has managed to get a high enough friendship with Marnie to gain access to Lewis' purple shorts, there's a unique scene that plays out if those shorts are placed inside the Luau soup. Doing this won't affect the friendship levels, however, which will make players miss out on the powerful friendship buff.

  Although the Luau is the only Summer festival that requires any pre-planning, there are three different festivals that take place during Summer. Each of these festivals is very different from, but they offer a great chance to experience something wonderful with the denizens of Pelican Town.

  takes place on the 11th of Summer, and is the first of the sunny festivals. It takes place on the beach and is a great opportunity for players to show off their high-quality produce by adding it to the potluck soup. The Governor is in town, though, so players should be on their best behavior — or not, if they want to pull a prank.

  <strong>
   The Trout Derby
  </strong>
  was introduced in the
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  1.6 update, and it's one for fishing fans. The Trout Derby acts differently to most other festivals, since players can enter and leave the event at will. This means it's not mandatory for all players, like most other festivals are. The goal is to fish for Rainbow Trout, but while doing so, players can find Golden Tags, which can be traded in for unique prizes.

  <strong>
   The Dance of the Moonlight Jellies

  happens on the last day of Summer, and is a beautiful send-off for the sunny season. This event is mostly about bonding with fellow townspeople by experiencing a breathtaking natural phenomenon together. It takes place down at the docks, and various villagers will have lovely things to say to the player. Then, the town can watch the Moonlight Jellies as they swim by, and keep a longstanding tradition alive.

  . Octopus can be caught at the Beach during the Summer, and are another big favorite of Willy's. Since they're a challenging catch, they're part of the
  <strong>
   Master Fisher's Bundle
  </strong>
  . Finally, Sturgeon can be caught during the Summer in the mountain lake, and are loved by Willy. They're also an element of the
  <strong>
   Lake Fish Bundle
  </strong>
  .

  Melons

 <p>
  <strong>
   Melons
  </strong>
  are one of the most profitable single-harvest crops available during the Summer, with a base profit of 250g. They're also the perfect gift for shy teacher
  <strong>
   Penny
  </strong>
  , and a sure way to gain some hearts with her. Most players don't have a negative reaction to Melons, apart from Abigail, Jas, Haley and Vincent, who hate them.

   Hops, a summer vegetable crop, matures after 11 days

  . Once harvested, place the hops into a keg to create Pale Ale, an item with one of the highest return investments in

  So be sure to get a keg. Players can get it at farmer level eight and it's a reward for completing either the Artisan Bundle or the Brewers Bundle in the Pantry. It's worth getting not just for the Pale Ale, but for making other goods like wine, beer, coffee, green tea, mead, and juice.

  is one of the best consumable items in the game since it gives the player a speed boost.

  The characters of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  are not just actors to move the story forward; for many players, they can be complex and relatable reflections, comforting and familiar faces, and even role models. Just as there have been many iconic female characters from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  , there have also been great leading men, memorable male mentors, and sly side guys.

 <p>
  There has been almost as wide a variety of male characters across the long-running anthology series as there are valid modes of masculinity. From father figures to fine friends, these gentlemen have been chosen for their strength, wisdom, ability to embrace growth, and many other aspects kindred to positive maleness.

  2001's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 10
   </em>
  </strong>
  saw some of the series' big changes, including true 3D environments, the return of traditional turn-based combat, and voice acting. The setting and story were structured radically differently than before, and a "fish out of water" character was needed. That man was Tidus. Although he stands out as a divisive figure, there's no denying his boyish, himbo charm.

  His outlandish enthusiasm and penchant for bumbling into affairs that are neither his business nor within his understanding provide a stark (and, for those who live there, refreshing) contrast to the depressing world of Spira, which has been caught in a vicious spiral of doom and depression for generations.

  When the chips are down and even when surrounded by cynics and lowlives, the leader of the Knights of Pluto conducts himself with the integrity befitting of a knight in shining armor. While
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 9
   </strong>
  </em>
  plays him off as a comic relief stooge because of his strict adherence to the law, Steiner has a good heart, despite his orderly intransigence.

 <p>
  He seeks justice and protection for those who cannot protect themselves, a virtue that eventually shines through after his Queen's evil actions become too much for him to bear. His struggle between duty and virtue is a relatable and honorable one. The fact that both his personality and design manage to ride the line between "doofus knight" and "heroic strongman" made him an iconic and memorable figure.

  Where sinister emperors and demi-gods parade themselves in public with their openly evil acts, the world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  is initially under attack by a far more insidious enemy: corporate monopoly and greed. Although he may seem intense, Barret sees what it will take to save the planet and, ultimately, those he loves and is willing to do whatever it takes.

 <p>
  Despite his hot-headed sensibilities and intimidating gun arm and silhouette, Barret is a dedicated and loving father. Ultimately, his motivations to fight Shinra, Sephiroth, and the shape-shifting Jenova, stem from an unwavering love for the next generation and all the future generations to come.

 <p>
  Dark knight Cecil was one of the first pre-defined characters in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  history, and his story and the depth of his personality still stand up today. When players first meet him in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  , he is an unquestioning servant to a morally dubious king. After reflecting on his deeds, he embarks on a journey of redemption, ultimately defeating his shadow self and returning as a paladin.

 <p>
  In his heart, Cecil was always a champion for good, but due to his confusion about his identity, he allowed loyalty to blind his judgment. It took time away from his position and the goodness of kind people to show him the way to the light.

  Cloud shares insecurities that will be familiar to many young men, which is unsurprising given the trauma and hero disenchantment he received early in his career. Although he comes across as self-centered, disinterested, and occasionally straight-up rude, Cloud makes the right choice when the moment of truth arrives.

  Although his attitude and shattered psyche hardly make him the ideal role model or even companion, Cloud's determination to overcome his own doubt, shame, and depression is admirable. Inner turmoil aside, Cloud has one of the coolest, most iconic, and recognizable looks in the series, from the impossibly styled spikey hair to his moody purple jumpsuit and ginormous Buster Sword.

 <p>
  While his fashion sense is undeniable, with an intriguing "main character" facial scar to match, Squall's popularity in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  fandom is polarizing. Unlike other protagonists, every one of Squall's inner thoughts is on full display to the player in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 8
   </em>
  </strong>
  . While witnessing someone's every doubt and insecurity can be grating, especially from what is supposed to be the game's hero, it adds a layer of relatability, depth, and frankness that typically goes unexamined in adventure stories.

 <p>
  Although it is hard to discern for those who have full access to Squall's dark, moody monologues, keen-eyed players will notice that Squall's highly critical inward assessments tend to be at odds with the professional and collected persona he presents to the rest of the world, even in dire situations. If players had access to the thoughts of the series' previous protagonist, they might see a similar situation. Despite his hidden vulnerabilities, Squall pushes on, eventually confronting his fears and allowing himself to open up with Rinoa, demonstrating tremendous growth.

  Charming, roguish, but ultimately the owner of a good heart, the leader of Figaro does not just leverage cutting-edge technology to help his people thrive but has an intimate knowledge of its workings, being one of the series' first mechanists, and despite his royal heritage, is never afraid to stain his hands on machinery.

  Despite his penchant for pursuing a woman's affection, he is ever cordial and always respects their wishes. From the moment he appears in
  <strong>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </strong>
  , Edgar is shown to despise the oppressive Empire and, from the beginning, under the guise of having an alliance with its emperor, works with the Returners to hinder its army and influence however he can.

  Stoic. Mysterious. Cool. Auron began as a straight-man guardian and became a legend but ended up as a renegade defying Yevon's deceptive, evil doctrines. His ability to cling on beyond death stems from a steely will to mentor his friend's son and bring justice to a world doomed to endless sorrow. His courage in standing up against his teachings, resolve to bring Jecht's son, and determination to bring an end to Yevon and Sin's reign.

 <p>
  Auron hits hard with his enormous sword (he is the hard-hitter of the party), with his words, and his impeccable fashion sense. His samurai chic and dark glasses combo also makes him one of the coolest-looking men in the series.

  Balthier is, in his own words, the "leading man," which is true in a few ways. First, his charisma makes him stand out even among the legendary heroes and sky pirates of Ivalice. Second, Vaan's status as the main character in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 12
   </strong>
  </em>
  was roundly accepted to have been hijacked by Ashe or Balthier, which is a testament to the strength of their characters.

 <p>
  Mature, unflappable, brilliant, and suave, of all the male characters in

He takes the high road whenever he can (and not just in his supremely stylish airship) despite his troubled family history, but despite his roguish nature, he also takes the time (at his pleasure) to cause trouble for self-serving authorities with his partner in crime, Fran.

      <title>Teamfight Tactics Devs Discuss the Magical Design Inspirations for Set 12</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Teamfight Tactics
   </em>
  </strong>
  showcases a lot of creative freedom when it comes to its sets. After five years, Riot Games' auto-battler has managed to showcase unique themes that utilize
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  ' IP, especially its wide array of skins. For
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  ' latest set, Magic n' Mayhem, also known as Set 12, Riot devs took a lot of inspiration from various types of magic and even created their own.

 <p>
  Just as the name suggests, Magic n' Mayhem highlights whimsical and hectic elements as it transports players to the Magitorium, a castle of curiosities where the most talented magic wielders gather to prove their mastery.
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  fans can see this with this set's traits, which include familiar forms of magic, like Witchcraft and Arcana, to more unique ones, like Sugarcraft and Honeymancy. Riot devs recently shared insights on how they designed Magic n' Mayhem and interpreted existing
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  IP to match the theme.

  Every
  <em>

  set is pulled from various pieces of media, like superheroes for Monsters Attack (Set 8) and Eastern fantasy for Inkborn Fables (Set 11). For Magic n' Mayhem, Riot Games wanted to create a fun and colorful theme because the set was coming out during summer. Mindy Chi, Set 12's gameplay designer, said that they wanted to include magical elements like witches and fairy magic, while also taking some notes from
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  to create unique traits based on existing
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  skin lines.
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  set lead Sam Judd also notes that they aimed to introduce unexpected brands of magic that tacticians might practice in the convergence.

  <p>
   We wanted to think outside the box and come up with some more unexpected brands of magic that we thought our tacticians might practice in the convergence. Combining that with our desire to explore some fan-favorite skin lines that hadn’t appeared in TFT yet led to us creating some brand-new types of magic just for our TFT players.

 <p>
  Magic n' Mayhem will feature fan-favorite
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  skin lines, such as Bees and Cafe Cuties, to represent some unique traits. Honeymancy is based on the Bees line, and it summons a swarm of bees that attach to honeymancers when the trait is active. Meanwhile, the Sugarcraft trait features Cafe Cuties, as champions will create cake layers to get powerful rewards.
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  is also releasing a new premium arena called the Le Bunny Bonbon Bistro, which is essentially a magical maid cafe-inspired arena with whimsical music.

  The magic continues with the new Charms mechanic, which are single-use spells that can be purchased in every other shop. Each Charm's use varies from ability buffs to summoning powerful allies, and they also get more powerful as tacticians level up throughout the game.

  How Teamfight Tactics Set 12 Showcases Other League of Legends IP
 </h3>
 <p>
  In previous sets,
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  includes new characters who match the theme, like the dragons in Dragonlands (Set 7) and Silco from
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  in Runeterra Reforged (Set 9). Inkborn Fables (Set 11) stood out because it included champions like Alune, who is Aphelios' twin sister and essentially an NPC in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , and the
  <em>
   TFT
  </em>
  -exclusive Yordle named Kobuko. It was praised for expanding
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  ' lore further and adding a fresh take to it.

 <p>
  For Magic n' Mayhem,
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  is debuting Norra, a Yordle champion from
  <em>
   Legends of Runeterra
  </em>
  , as a 5-cost Portal mage. It's also bringing over the Stargazer skin line from
  <em>
   League of Legends: Wild Rift
  </em>
  under the Chrono trait. According to game director Peter Whalen, these crossovers are a great way to strengthen relationships across Riot Games' teams, so they're always open to collaborating with them to create new experiences in
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  .

  If you'd like to skip some sections of the dungeon, you can use the alternate route showcased in the image above. This will get you to the Shadow Pot Enemy quickly. However, you'll need to deal with the Gravebirds guarding the rooftops. You can use this route if your character dies before reaching the next Site of Grace.

  The Divine Beast Dancing Lion can be a difficult boss to take on due to its continued aggression throughout the fight. It's recommended that
  <strong>
   you're at least at Scadutree Blessing 5 when fighting this boss
  </strong>
  , and that you summon Freyja to assist you. A strong spirit summon like

      <title>Teamfight Tactics: Magic n' Mayhem's New Charms Mechanic Explained</title>

 <p>
  In every set,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Teamfight Tactics
   </strong>
  </em>
  introduces new mechanics that help make matches more interesting and exciting. For its 12th set, Magic n' Mayhem, Riot Games is hammering down on the fun, whimsical elements of the set to attract both newbies and experienced
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  players. One of them is the new Charms mechanic, which will test the magical mastery of tacticians.

 <p>
  Charms are essentially single-use purchasable spells that appear in every other shop and replace one unit slot. It's similar to how players acquire Heimerdinger's Turret upgrades in
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  Runeterra Reforged (Set 9). The mechanic goes well with the theme of Magic n' Mayhem, which spotlights traits like Witchcraft and Honeymancy. Additionally,
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  game designer Matt Dunn and senior manager for game product management Alex Cole said that playing Charms "can be very intuitive for new players," while also being "strategically deep" for experienced players who are building powerful late-game boards.

  Magic n' Mayhem features over 100 Charms, each having different magical effects that range from giving buffs to allies to disrupting enemy actions. Just like champions, Charms also get more powerful and expensive as matches progress and levels get higher, which is helpful during late-game battles. Cole and Dunn also noted that using Charms "feel like you're actually slinging magical abilities in tense duels," especially if players are trying to one-up their opponents using the best Charms possible.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Coin Flip (0 gold):
   </strong>
   50% chance to gain 1 gold for each Coin Flip used. If players purchase a lot of them throughout their game, there's a chance that they'll get a big payout.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Moonlight Ritual (1 gold):
   </strong>
   After using this Charm, a random 1 or 2-cost champion on the players' board or bench will star up at the start of the next combat.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    All Ones (1 gold):
   </strong>
   This Charm allows players to reroll their shop with all 1-cost champions available.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Hocus Pocus (1 gold):
   </strong>
   If the Witchcraft trait is active, this Charm gives witches 20 ability power (AP) at the start of the next combat. This is one of many trait-specific Charms that only appear in the shop when specific traits are active.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Major Gambit (2 gold):
   </strong>
   If players win the next combat, they gain 10 gold. This is great for players who are win-streaking, especially in the early game, as this Charm can improve players' economy. Plus, Major Gambit is similar to the Teemo encounter in
   <em>
    Teamfight Tactics
   </em>
   Inkborn Fables (Set 11), which has players guess the outcome of their next fight to get a pretty reward.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Scrappy (6 gold):
   </strong>
   At the start of the next combat, two champions without items gain a temporary full item.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Summon Dragon (12 gold):
   </strong>
   Summons a 2000 HP Dragon for only one round. This Charm, along with the Dragon trait, is a callback to
   <em>
    Teamfight Tactics
   </em>
   Dragonlands (Set 7), which featured powerful dragon units, like Shyvana and Daeja.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Conjure Artifact (20 gold):
   </strong>
   After using this Charm, players will gain an Artifact Anvil.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Tower (can only be obtained if Xerath is played):
   </strong>
   Summons a giant tower that protects champions and deals damage to enemies for one round.
  </li>
 </ul>

  Compared to previous
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  mechanics like portals and Hero Augments, Charms are a quick and effective way to improve players' teams. Those that provide combat and defense buffs can be game-changing when players find them in the shop and activate them at the right time, possibly giving them the advantage they need as their game progresses. It will also be interesting to see the magical combinations that
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  fans will come up with using Charms. Of course, obtaining the right Charms in every other shop can also be a gamble, so it's still important to set up a strong board with high-level champions with synergized traits and equip the best items.

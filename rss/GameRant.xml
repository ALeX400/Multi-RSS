  The Burning Monolith is a special map on the Atlas of Worlds, similar to the Realmgate, which can be encountered near the location where players start their mapping journey. Using it, however, is anything but simple.

  The Burning Monolith requires three special items, called Crisis Fragments, to access, and each one can only be found by completing Citadels, which are special map nodes on the Atlas that are extremely hard to find.

  The Burning Monolith is the encounter area for the
  <strong>
   endgame pinnacle boss, Arbiter of Ash
  </strong>
  . After players visit the Burning Monolith for the first time and try to activate the door, they’ll automatically start the quest, The Pinnacle of Flame, with three subquests: Ezomyte Infiltration (Iron Citadel), Faridun Foray (Copper Citadel), and Vaal Incursion (Stone Citadel). Completing the three Citadels will reward players with three unique Crisis Fragments.
  <strong>
   Use the three Crisis Fragments together on the altar in the Burning Monolith to activate and unlock the fight with the Arbiter of Ash.

  <strong>
   There are three Citadels in
   <em>
    PoE 2
   </em>
   : Iron, Copper, and Stone
  </strong>
  , each with a different map boss that you need to defeat in order to obtain the Crisis Fragment associated with that Citadel. By far the most difficult part about Citadels is finding them in the first place.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_10">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     Citadels can only be attempted once.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Since each player’s Atlas is randomly generated, each one is unique, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to where a Citadel might appear. A few tentative theories have emerged among the community based on anecdotal evidence and personal experience. Take these with a grain of salt.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Pick a direction
   </strong>
   on the Atlas and keep progressing in that direction until you eventually encounter a Citadel. Unlock Towers to get an eagle’s eye view of the maps.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Follow the corruption
   </strong>
   . Look towards the edge of your field of vision in the Atlas and look for nodes with corruption. Make a beeline towards these nodes, clear them without failing, unlock the nearby Tower and repeat. This can be combined with the previous tip.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Citadels seem to appear in a cluster.
   </strong>
   If you find one, you’ll find the other two nearby.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Citadel hunting is a time-consuming endeavor that should be left for very late in the endgame when your build is as strong as it can get and hunting bosses becomes second nature.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_14">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     Crisis Fragments—the whole reason to hunt for Citadels in the first place—can be bought from the trading website or through the Currency Exchange. They do, however, tend to be fairly pricey owing to their rare encounter rate, though this price can sometimes be worth it to avoid the hassle of trying to hunt for the Fragments yourself.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto V
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been around since 2013, but it has not lost its popularity to date. Perhaps
  <em>
   GTA VI
  </em>
  could finally force players to let go of
  <em>
   GTA V
  </em>
  , but until then, the game remains a juggernaut. One of the biggest reasons why
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  remains relevant today is the constant updates and new content. Whether you want to play with your friends or drive a tank, the sky is the limit.

 <p>
  Speaking of driving tanks, many players do not know they can acquire them for free in
  <em>
   GTA V
  </em>
  . To get a tank to do some serious damage, you must make your way to the military base. Unfortunately, many players do not know where the military base is located either. This guide will cover everything you need to know about finding the military base and getting the Rhino tank, along with other useful information.

  If you check out the map, you can find the military base referred to as Lago Zancudo. You can find the base
  <strong>
   south of the North Chumash beach
  </strong>
  , but the above image notes its exact location. It should not be surprising that the military base is heavily guarded and surrounded by fences. However, there are a couple of ways you can infiltrate the base.
 </p>
 <h3 id="infiltrate-the-base-by-air">
  Infiltrate The Base By Air
 </h3>
 <p>
  You can try infiltrating the base
  <strong>
   via a helicopter or plane
  </strong>
  , but you will get a two-star wanted level with a warning as soon as you enter the base’s airspace. If you do not turn back, you will get a four-star wanted level and be targeted by guided missiles.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_8">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     You can still try landing or jumping with a parachute to avoid dying easily.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <h3 id="infiltrate-the-base-by-land">
  Infiltrate The Base By Land
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another great way to get into the base involves getting a fast car and
  <strong>
   jumping over a cliff or hill around the base
  </strong>
  . Your best bet would be to land between the two outer fences without being seen. If you make it, you can drive around the base without alerting the guards. Similarly, you can also use a bike to pull off this feat, but sometimes, you can just drive through the main checkpoint without raising an alarm if the guard isn’t looking.

 <p>
  Now that you know where to find the military base and how to infiltrate it, the next step is to get the Rhino tank. You can find a Rhino tank driving around the base, which makes this endeavor more tricky.
 </p>
 <p>
  To get the Rhino tank, here is what you need to do:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Take a few shots at the Rhino tank and hide.
  </li>
  <li>
   Repeat step 1 until the driver exits the vehicle.
  </li>
  <li>
   Kill the driver and get into the Rhino tank.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  It is worth noting as soon as you get into the tank, you will immediately get a four-star wanted level. To avoid helicopter attacks, get into a tunnel as soon as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the Rhino tank, you can also get the following vehicles from the military base:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Titan chopper
  </li>
  <li>
   Buzzard attack chopper
  </li>
  <li>
   P-996 LAZER fighter jet
  </li>

  Following the release of the mid-season update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Apex Legends
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players are unhappy with nerfs made to Pathfinder, specifically his grapple ability. While this massive patch for Season 23 of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  looked to make some Legends, such as Mirage and Loba, more viable in matches, some players think the nerfs to Pathfinder went too far.
 </p>
 <p>
  On January 7, Respawn Entertainment launched the mid-season update for Season 23 of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  , bringing substantial alterations to the battle royale. While the change list was extensive, several Legends received potentially game-changing buffs. For example, Mirage's kit was reworked with new level 2 upgrades and a buff to his Tactical. In addition, Loba and Alter were shown some love in the mid-season update, with the developers making major improvements to their Ultimates, among other things. However, not every Legend received positive changes, as Pathfinder was hit with some nerfs as the developers attempted to reign in the power of his kit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, the nerfs to Pathfinder in
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  have not been well received by the game’s community. In a post from Reddit user paradoxally sharing the patch notes, fans discussed their frustration with the Pathfinder changes. Specifically, players were unhappy with the increase to the Grappling Hook cooldown. According to the patch notes, Pathfinder’s cooldown on his Tactical is now 30 seconds. This was a big nerf for the character as the ability previously used to be variable, with the cooldown being potentially much shorter based on the grapple travel distance. In addition to his Grappling Hook, changes were made to his Insider Knowledge ability and Zipline Zen upgrade.

 <p>
  Pathfinder’s Grappling Hook has gone through various iterations over the years. For example, the cooldown for Pathfinder's Tactical ability was 35 seconds a few years ago. In addition, it is worth noting that the ability did not always have a variable cooldown. Nevertheless, this recent change in Season 23 could make using the Legend much less satisfying in matches, considering how pivotal his Grappling Hook can be to his gameplay, both for entering and exiting skirmishes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It will be interesting to see how these recent changes to Pathfinder impact his pick rate in Season 23 of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  . So far, the Legend has been one of the most popular characters in the game, with Apex Legends Status revealing him to have a 14.6% pick rate. Impressively, this is only second to Lifeline at 18.2%, and she received a rework to her kit at the start of the season and enjoyed improvements to the Support class in
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  While Pathfinder could drop somewhat in popularity thanks to these recent nerfs, there is always the possibility that Respawn could release a future patch to adjust the Legend based on player feedback. Hopefully, the developer will be able to continue to update the game to provide an enjoyable experience for those playing in Season 23.

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan is getting plenty of attention online after posting their creative idea of making a group of Drifloons in real life. Done as part of celebrating the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan's birthday, the multiple Drifloons are photographed from a variety of angles and locations around their apartment, leading to a charming photo series that has caught the eye of thousands of fellow fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Introduced as part of the fourth generation of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , Drifloon is a dual-type Ghost/Flying Pokemon that bears an appearance that is essentially a purple balloon with a tape-like X, a pair of strings for arms, and hearts for hands. While often considered "cute" in appearance, Drifloon is rumored to steal children who hold onto them too long, taking them to the afterlife. Along with its evolved form, Drifblim, Drifloon is the only known Pokemon with Flare Boost as an Ability. Both Drifloon and Drifblim are obtainable in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet
  </em>
  most recently, appearing as one of the version's exclusives.
 </p>
 <p>
  The impressive real-world Drifloons come courtesy of a Reddit user named ChloeReynoldsArt, who posted their collection of photos onto one of the forum site's main
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  pages. Consisting of eight images, the first two appear to be the Drifloons' original spot, placed among lights and vines. According to the caption, the rest of the pictures were taken in the following weeks of the birthday, showcasing the Pokemon on blinds, a laundry rack, and most adorably, in bed, complete with closed eyes. Despite its benign appearance, Drifloon is considered the cute but evil Pokemon in the franchise by many.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan who created the Drifloons turned 25, they wouldn't have to worry about falling under the purview of Drifloon's sinister nature. While the child-abducting nature of the Pokemon is largely inferred via various Pokedex entries, an ominous Easter egg in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  anime could potentially show Drifloon shortly before such an act.

  fandom, with the post amassing roughly 3,400 upvotes within hours of being posted. Commenters were quick to point out their favorite one, with many choosing either the one with angry eyes or the one asleep, while others lauded the ingenuity behind the simplistic craft. While undoubtedly impressive, they aren't the only
  <em>

  fan to create a real-world version of a Pokemon with Ghost typing, with one

  fan creating an actual Lampent lamp. These projects certainly highlight the fandom's love for bringing spooky Pokemon to life.

  From Riften to Solitude,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  is rife with opportunities to make new friends and forge connections. Assassin's guilds, armies, institutes of learning — the game has them all. As players make their way through the world, they must decide which factions will be most useful and best suit the character they're roleplaying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of these factions and guilds provide the Dragonborn with huge advantages and have compelling storylines that immerse the player in the world. Others, meanwhile, feel bland and boring — or have core philosophies that just don't sit right. Here's a list of every faction the player can join, ranked from worst to best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated on January 7, 2024, by Chris Harkin:
   </strong>
   Skyrim may have been released almost fifteen years ago, but that doesn't stop it from still being wildly popular today. Part of the reason such a high level of popularity has been retained is down to the game having so many role-playing options. Players can customize their experience to their character, and fit them into a perfect mold of what they imagined that run to be. What's more, there is always plenty of room for another playthrough after the first that involves little crossover in quests. Players may never tire of Skyrim, and with such a huge list of options regarding different factions and options that can be taken in the game, there doesn't need to be.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Some guilds are more interesting than others, some have more gameplay relevance, and an unfortunate few have neither. However, whether for practicality or simply roleplaying, a player may have a reason to join any one of them. With that in mind, this updated ranking of
  <em>
   Skyrim'
  </em>
  s guilds includes all the reasons players might (or might not) consider joining up, as well as the steps the Dragonborn must take to be accepted into the fold.

  <em>
   Skyrim's
  </em>
  Bards' College storyline (if it can even be called a storyline) feels like wasted potential. A few errand quests here and there, a brief festival event, and that's it. There's none of the wild romp that players expected from this guild.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the player is technically considered a bard after joining this faction, they gain no new skills to demonstrate this. Bard Dragonborns can't play instruments, nor sing to a tavern. An entertainment-based Power would have been a great reward for the main Bards' College quest; alas, none exists.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">
  How To Join
 </h3>
 <p>
  Players can join the Bards' College by completing the quest
  <strong>
   "
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Tending the Flames."
  </strong>
  First, speak to Viarmo at the Bard's College in Solitude, and accept his request to find King Olaf's verse. Return to Viarmo and help him "reconstruct" the missing parts of the verse, and accompany him to present it to Elisif. The choices that the player makes in reconstructing the verse will not affect the outcome. Finally, attend the Burning of King Olaf festival event to become a member of the College.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">

 <p>
  Another reason for the Bards' College's low ranking is the lack of interesting perks they offer. Giraud Gemane offers Master-level Speech training, but that's about it.

  Delphine and Esbern have noble goals, but they're shortsighted and militant. Furthermore, fully joining the Blades requires killing Paarthunax, the wise, kind old dragon who leads the Greybeards. After the quest "Season Unending," Delphine will refuse any service to the Dragonborn until this deed is done.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though she provides helpful guidance in the first few main quests, Delphine's self-righteous attitude starts to grate on many players — especially when she demands Paarthunax's death. Considering the Blades don't do too much for the player anyway, most don't consider this a worthy sacrifice.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">
  How To Join
 </h3>
 <p>
  Follow the main questline through
  <strong>
   Season Unending.
  </strong>
  These quests will take the Dragonborn to Sky Haven Temple, where Delphine will introduce the Blades. After Season Unending, Delphine will ask the player to kill Paarthunax. Complete this task, and report back to Delphine.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">
  Benefits of Joining
 </h3>
 <p>
  As a member of the Blades, players get access to all the gear and items in Sky Haven Temple, including the unique sword Dragonbane. However, unlike the higher-ranking factions on this list, there are no unique skill trainers or followers associated with them.
 </p>
 <h3 id="quests">
  Quests
 </h3>
 <p>
  Several quests in Skyrim's main storyline involve the Blades:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A Blade in the Dark
  </li>
  <li>
   Diplomatic Immunity
  </li>
  <li>
   A Cornered Rat

  <li>
   Alduin's Wall
  </li>
  <li>
   Season Unending

  If the player chooses to side with the Blades from this point on, further quests include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Paarthunax

  <li>
   Rebuilding the Blades

  There are many different quests in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , but few lead to such despicable things as the Daedric quests often seem to contain. Perhaps the least appetizing of all is Namira's mission, The Taste of Death. While this is just a singular mission, it doesn't simply lead to the Dragonborn becoming a champion of a Daedric God, it leads to them becoming a member of a coven.
 </p>
 <p>
  Namira's coven are cannibals and are initially encountered in the catacombs beneath Markarth, but the Dragonborn is later tasked with luring someone to the entire coven to be eaten. Even more shocking, the people of the coven are regular members of society in Markarth, and the Dragonborn can have new interactions with them based on seeing them there later in the game. While it isn't the most glamorous group and there are no further missions, this is an interesting faction to join or destroy.

 <h3 id="how-to-join">

  Even though killing Paarthunax leaves a bad taste in some players' mouths, the Greybeards aren't much more useful even if he's left alive. They're the opposite extreme from the Blades, refusing to take action even when they could save lives.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remaining loyal to the Greybeards allows the Dragonborn to visit Paarthunax and meditate on Words of Power, making their shouts more powerful. However, they're not a very interesting bunch. They don't have quests or side stories associated with them like other factions do, making these old monks a bit dull.

  With Paarthunaxe alive, the player can meditate on certain Words of Power, making their shouts more powerful. However, there are only three options, affecting the Unrelenting Force, Become Ethereal, and Fire Breath shouts. What's more, the Dragonborn doesn't gain access to any special items, trainers, or unique services, as with some other guilds.

  Although there aren't many advantages to joining them, the Tribal Orcs are better to have as friends than enemies. There are several orc strongholds around
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , cut off from the rest of society, and it is rare to see any orcs outside these locations. The player will not be initially welcome in the strongholds unless they are playing as an orc but can be welcomed as "a friend to all orcs" if they endear themselves somehow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can become welcome in the strongholds in many different ways, some are even surprisingly easy. If they clear out Kolskreggr Mine and talk to the Orcish miner, or find a Daedric heart for the blacksmith Moth gro-Bagol in Markarth, they can become welcome in the strongholds. There are also more complicated methods, and quests involved, but the Tribal Orcs are a fun, mysterious aspect of the game worth exploring.

 <p>
  Though the Stormcloaks are fighting to preserve their way of life, they also have a nasty tendency towards racist nationalism. Some Stormcloak supporters simply want the freedom to worship Talos in peace. Others, however, want to see all non-Nords violently driven from their land.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joining the Stormcloak army may be an important roleplaying choice for some. However, the quests tend to be a bit dull compared to other factions: Go to a location, kill several enemies, and repeat. It's a good way to level up combat skills, but narratively underwhelming, which ranks them low among the game's factions.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">
  How To Join
 </h3>
 <p>
  Speak to Ulfric Stormcloak in Windhelm about joining the Stormcloak Army. He will ask them to complete a test of strength by traveling to the island near the Serpent Stone in Winterhold and
  <strong>
   slaying an ice wraith.
  </strong>
  Once this is finished, complete the ensuing quest
  <strong>
   "The Jagged Crown,"
  </strong>
  and deliver the item to Ulfric.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">
  Benefits of Joining
 </h3>
 <p>
  There aren't really any benefits to joining the Stormcloak army, aside from getting to participate in the quests themselves. There are no faction-specific trainers, and players don't get treated any differently for their involvement in the war.
 </p>
 <h3 id="quests">
  Quests
 </h3>
 <p>
  The first few quests in the Civil War questline are the same no matter what side the Dragonborn chooses:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Join the Stormcloaks (or Join the Legion)
  </li>
  <li>
   The Jagged Crown
  </li>
  <li>
   Message to Whiterun
  </li>
  <li>
   Battle for Whiterun
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  From here, if the player sided with the Stormcloaks, their Civil War quest is labeled as "The Liberation of Skyrim." Its quest line is as follows:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Rescue from Fort Neugrad
  </li>
  <li>
   Compelling Tribute
  </li>
  <li>
   The Battle for Fort Sungard

  There's really no good side to pick in the Civil War. Though they claim to want unity, the Imperial Legion fights to stamp out religious freedom and Nordic traditions. As with the Stormcloak rebellion, some players may join the Legion as a roleplaying choice but find themselves bored with the story.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Legion doesn't seem to realize that they're nothing more than Thalmor puppets. Furthermore, just like fighting for the other side, the storyline isn't particularly engaging. The quests are more or less the same between the two sides.

 <p>
  After completing the first four quests (which are the same as they are for the Stormcloaks), complete "The Reunification of Skyrim," which consists of:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   ​A False Front
  </li>
  <li>
   The Battle for Fort Dunstad
  </li>
  <li>

 </ul>
 <p>
  House Telvanni
 </p>
 <p>
  A Throwback To Morrowind Without Much To It
 </p>
 <p>
  The Dragonborn DLC allows players to leave Skyrim itself and head off to Solstheim, an island mostly inhabited by the Dunmer people who fled towards Skyrim when the Red Mountain erupted. Neloth is one of the grand wizards of House Telvanni and he makes sure their presence is felt on Solstheim, where the Dragonborn runs into him several times.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the Dragonborn chooses, they can visit Neloth and engage with him in a variety of quests and miscellaneous missions that lead him to naming the Dragonborn a member of House Telvanni. This honorary position doesn't mean much, but if players are looking for more action on Solstheim, these quests vary greatly and some are quite fun.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">
  How To Join
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Dragonborn must complete a variety of quests for Neloth after first meeting him at the Earth Stone during the main Dragonborn DLC questline. He can be found at his tower, Tel Mithryn, and after finishing The Path of Knowledge, Heart Stones, Telvanni Research, Reluctant Steward, Experimental Subject, and Briarheart Necropsy, Neloth will give the player the quest Old Friends which results in the Dragonborn being made a member of House Telvanni officially.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">
  Benefits Of Joining
 </h3>
 <p>
  Technically, as Neloth admits himself when the player joins, there are currently no benefits to being made a member. When Neloth returns to Vvardenfell, he tells the Dragonborn they will be made Morrowind royalty, but until then he will simply keep a bed and chest for the player in Tel Mithryn (which is a lie). Fortunately, being friendly with the members of Tel Mithryn has its own benefits like staff enchanting.

  The Companions guild is a good way to build combat skills as a low-level player, with more narrative interest than the Civil War. However, at higher levels, the large number of radiant quests become tedious and dull.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beast Form is an interesting power, and for some players, joining this guild is worth the werewolf transformation alone. Despite this, the questline leaves something to be desired. The story had the potential for emotional impact, but it felt a bit rushed, making it one of the weaker subplots in the game.

  Speak with Kodlak White-Mane in Jorrvaskr in Whiterun. This initiates the quest
  <strong>
   "Take Up Arms."
  </strong>
  For their first task, Kodlak will tell the player to train outside with Vilkas. Vilkas will then ask the player to take a sword to Eorlund Gray-Mane, who in turn asks the Dragonborn to deliver a shield to Aela the Huntress. After completing these errand quests, the player will receive one more radiant quest, which can be anything from eliminating a dangerous animal to brawling with a random NPC. Upon completion, return to Jorrvaskr for the initiation ceremony.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">
  Benefits of Joining
 </h3>
 <p>
  The most obvious perk of joining the Companions is the Beast Form ability, gained after being transformed into a werewolf. In this form, players can maul their enemies to death and feast on kills to increase their strength. The player also gains access to seven followers: Aela, Athis, Farkas, Njada, Ria, Torvar, and Vilkas, all of whom are capable warriors as well as potential marriage candidates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, the following trainers will offer their services to members of the Companions:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Aela the Huntress: Expert-level Archery
  </li>
  <li>
   Athis: Expert-level One-Handed
  </li>
  <li>
   Njada Stone-Arm: Expert-level Block
  </li>
  <li>
   Eorlund Gray-Mane: Master-level Smithing
  </li>
  <li>
   Farkas: Master-level Heavy Armor
  </li>
  <li>
   Vilkas: Master-level Two-Handed
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="quests">
  Quests
 </h3>
 <p>
  The main questline of the Companions' Guild proceeds as follows:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Take Up Arms
  </li>
  <li>
   Proving Honor
  </li>
  <li>
   The Silver Hand
  </li>
  <li>
   Blood's Honor
  </li>
  <li>
   Purity of Revenge
  </li>
  <li>
   Glory of the Dead
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Companions' Guild also offers a wide range of radiant quests. Players must complete a certain number of these as prerequisites for some of the main story quests listed above, but they can also be repeated infinitely for gold and experience.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Animal Extermination
  </li>
  <li>
   Hired Muscle
  </li>
  <li>
   Trouble in Skyrim
  </li>
  <li>
   Family Heirloom
  </li>
  <li>
   Escaped Criminal
  </li>
  <li>
   Rescue Mission
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  After completing "The Silver Hand," a few new radiant quests become available, relating to defeating the Silver Hand organization. The player must complete two of the following in order to progress the main story:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Striking the Heart
  </li>
  <li>
   Stealing Plans
  </li>
  <li>

  The
  <em>
   Dawnguard
  </em>
  DLC allows the player to pick sides in a war between mortals and vampires. If the Dragonborn sides with the latter faction, they join the Volkihar Clan, led by the abusive and overbearing Harkon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clan Volkihar's members are kind of one-note. They're all fairly bloodthirsty, believe they're above others and are bored with the politics of Harkon's court (except those who want his throne). While playing through
  <em>
   Dawnguard
  </em>
  from a vampire's point of view is fascinating, the Volkihar Clan often feels stifling and creepy, leading to a slightly lower ranking.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">
  How To Join
 </h3>
 <p>
  Speak to Isran at Fort Dawnguard, who will ask the Dragonborn to retrieve a "vampire artifact" from Dimhollow Crypt. This begins the quest
  <strong>
   "Awakening."
  </strong>
  This "artifact" turns out to be Serana, a member of the Volkihar clan. Upon returning Serana to her home at Castle Volkihar, accept Lord Harkon's offer to transform the Dragonborn into a Vampire Lord.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">
  Benefits of Joining
 </h3>
 <p>
  The main reason to join the Volkihar Clan is, essentially, to become a Vampire Lord. Players gain access to a slew of new abilities, and a whole new style of gameplay along with it. The Dragonborn can also use Death Hounds as followers, but none of the clan's members are available to join the player on adventures. Finally, the player gains access to the following trainers:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Garan Marethi: Expert-level Destruction
  </li>
  <li>
   Ronthil: Expert-level Speech
  </li>

  As one of the factions available for the
  <em>
   Dawnguard
  </em>
  storyline, the Volkihar clan is involved in every
  <em>

  Most players wind up here in their hunt for an Elder Scroll but get caught up in the story. With ancient artifacts, dragon priests, Thalmor spies, and a long-gone magical order, who could resist the intrigue?
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the College is an incredible resource for mages. Not only is this guild home to powerful followers and trainers, but it also possesses a multitude of tools. The Atronach Forge, the Arcaneum's library, and the items in the Arch-Mage's quarters turn the Dragonborn into an incomparable wizard.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">

 </h3>
 <p>
  Speak to Faralda, gatekeeper at the College, to begin the quest
  <strong>
   "First Lessons."
  </strong>
  She will ask the Dragonborn to cast a spell of her choosing in order to prove their worth. If the player does not know the requested spell, Faralda will sell it for a low price. Cast it, and she will admit the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alternatively, during the quest
  <strong>
   "Elder Knowledge,"
  </strong>
  the player can reveal their identity as Dragonborn. Faralda will then ask them to demonstrate the Thu'um, upon which she will admit them to the College.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">

 <p>
  The College of Winterhold is home to a professor in each of the schools of magic. Each professor can train the Dragonborn in their respective school at the Master level, as well as sell that school's spells. They also offer "Ritual Spell" quests for each of their respective schools, which are the only way that the Dragonborn can gain access to Master-level spells in a given school. These trainers include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Collette Marence: Expert-level Restoration
  </li>
  <li>
   Phinis Gestor: Expert-level Conjuration
  </li>
  <li>
   Sergius Turrianus: Expert-level Enchanting

  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Finally, the Dragonborn gains access to three potential followers at the College. After completing each of their personal quests, fellow apprentices Brelyna Maryon, Onmund, and J'zargo will all be available to recruit as followers. Onmund and Brelyna are potential marriage candidates as well.
 </p>

  Though the Volkihar Clan's storied history may hold some macabre appeal, the Dawnguard has plenty of its own intrigue in its past. In its present iteration, Isran may be a little intense, but he's dedicated to protecting Skyrim and the whole of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, in addition to having powerful followers, this faction's members are some of the game's most delightful personalities. From Florentius' casual chats with Arkay to Gunmar's brilliant idea to tame and outfit trolls, it's hard to grow bored among the Dawnguard.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">
  How To Join

 <p>
  Speak to Isran at Fort Dawnguard, and follow the quest
  <strong>
   "Awakening"
  </strong>
  described above. This time, upon delivering Serana to Castle Volkihar, reject Lord Harkon's offer of vampirism and return to Fort Dawnguard instead.
 </p>

  Players gain access to armored trolls, which make fantastic followers — and the other members of the Dawnguard make great companions as well. Potential followers among them include Agmaer, Beleval, Celann, Durak, and Ingjard. The player can also master crossbows, and utilize several unique restoration spells that deal heavy damage to undead creatures. The Dawnguard also provides the Dragonborn with access to training via the following NPCs:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Isran: Master-level Heavy Armor
  </li>
  <li>
   Gunmar: Master-level Smithing

  In terms of the titles, the only main
  <em>

 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Preemptive Strike

  For players who love to lurk in the shadows, there's no better faction than the Thieves' Guild. A code of honor among thieves governs these rogues, and the Dragonborn must use stealth and strength to rise through the ranks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The questline surrounding the Guild is one of the most satisfying in the game. Betrayal, revenge, and redemption are its guiding themes, and its complex characters make for a powerful story. Its side quests remain interesting as well, as the player performs favors to build the Guild's influence throughout Skyrim.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">
  How To Join
 </h3>
 <p>
  Approach Brynjolf in the Riften marketplace to begin the quest
  <strong>
   "A Chance Arrangement."
  </strong>
  He will strike up a conversation, asking the player to steal Madesi's silver ring from the strongbox beneath his stall and place the ring in Brand-Shei's pocket. Upon agreeing, Brynjolf will begin a distraction. Use this time to complete his request, reverse-pickpocketing Brand-Shei.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether the Dragonborn succeeds or fails, Brynjolf will tell the player to meet him in the Ragged Flagon in the Ratway. Players can make their way there to be accepted into the Guild.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">
  Benefits of Joining
 </h3>
 <p>
  By joining the Thieves' Guild, players gain access to fences over the course of the questline — merchants who will buy their stolen goods. As the guild gains influence, these fences gain more and more gold, allowing the Dragonborn to sell them expensive items. The Guild is also home to the following skill trainers:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Niruin: Master-level Archery
  </li>
  <li>
   Vex: Master-level Lockpicking
  </li>
  <li>
   Vipir the Fleet: Master-level Pickpocket
  </li>
  <li>
   Delvin Mallory: Master-level Sneak
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="quests">
  Quests

 <p>
  Of the factions in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , the Thieves' Guild offers perhaps the most variety when it comes to its quests. Like most of the high-ranking factions, it features a main story made up of several quests that come one after the other:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A Chance Arrangement
  </li>
  <li>
   Taking Care of Business
  </li>
  <li>
   Loud and Clear
  </li>
  <li>
   Dampened Spirits
  </li>
  <li>
   Scoundrel's Folly
  </li>
  <li>
   Speaking With Silence
  </li>
  <li>
   Hard Answers
  </li>
  <li>
   The Pursuit
  </li>
  <li>
   Trinity Restored
  </li>
  <li>
   Blindsighted
  </li>
  <li>
   Darkness Returns
  </li>
  <li>
   Under New Management
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Guild members Delvin and Vex each offer several "small jobs" as side quests. These can be repeated infinitely, but the player can only take on one from each of them at a time. Delvin's jobs include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The Fishing Job
  </li>
  <li>
   The Numbers Job
  </li>
  <li>
   The Bedlam Job
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Vex offers:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The Shill Job
  </li>
  <li>
   The Heist Job
  </li>
  <li>
   The Sweep Job
  </li>
  <li>
   The Burglary Job
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  After completing five small jobs in a specific city, the player will receive a "city influence" quest:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Imitation Amnesty (Whiterun)
  </li>
  <li>
   Summerset Shadows (Windhelm)
  </li>
  <li>
   Silver Lining (Markarth)
  </li>
  <li>
   The Dainty Sload (Solitude)
  </li>
  <li>
   Deliver Moon Sugar to Ri'Saad
  </li>
 </ul>

  Despite questionable morals, this brethren of assassins has always been a favorite faction among
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  players. Each quest requires the Dragonborn to employ different strategies, keeping the game interesting. Its characters are lovably odd, from a 200-year-old vampire child to grumpy old Festus.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story is also the least predictable of the game's subplots. Players experience multiple twists and finally reach a satisfying conclusion. Furthermore, of all guild questlines, the Dark Brotherhood has potentially the greatest impact on the world — and that's always rewarding in an RPG.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-join">
  How To Join
 </h3>
 <p>
  Speak to Aventus Aretino in Windhelm and accept his request to kill Grelod the Kind, mistress of the Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. This begins the quest
  <strong>
   "Innocence Lost
  </strong>
  <strong>
   ."
  </strong>
  It's not difficult to complete, as Grelod can be killed in broad daylight without consequences. After returning to Aventus and collecting their reward, the next time they are in a city, the player will receive a letter from a courier saying simply, "We Know," with a black handprint.
 </p>
 <p>
  Go to sleep in a bed. Upon waking, the player will find themselves in an Abandoned Shack, beginning the quest
  <strong>
   "With Friends Like These."
  </strong>
  Astrid asks the player to kill one of her prisoners. Kill one (or more) of them, and she will give the Dragonborn the location and password for the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary in Falkreath Hold. Head there to join the faction.
 </p>
 <h3 id="benefits-of-joining">
  Benefits of Joining
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary is home to a Word Wall, giving the player one of the necessary Words of Power for the Marked for Death shout. It also gives them access to one of the best sets of Light Armor in the base game, the Ancient Shrouded Armor. Finally, joining the Brotherhood grants access to two trainers:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Nazir: Master-level Light Armor
  </li>
  <li>
   Babette: Master-level Alchemy
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  After the main questline is completed and Nazir begins recruiting new members, the Dragonborn can recruit any of these Dark Brotherhood Initiates to be their followers. Cicero can also be recruited as a follower if the Dragonborn chooses to let him live.
 </p>
 <h3 id="quests">
  Quests
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Dark Brotherhood questline is an interesting one, as it is interspersed with side quests that the Dragonborn receives from Nazir. Each batch of these assassinations is trickier than the last, and the player receives them at specific points during the story.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Innocence Lost
  </li>
  <li>
   With Friends Like These...
  </li>
  <li>
   Sanctuary
  </li>
  <li>
   The player must speak to Nazir and complete at least one of the following before proceeding to the next story quest:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Beitild
    </li>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Narfi
    </li>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Ennodius Papius
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Mourning Never Comes
  </li>
  <li>
   Whispers in the Dark
  </li>
  <li>
   Complete at least one of the following
   <ul>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Lurbuk
    </li>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Hern
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   The Silence Has Been Broken
  </li>
  <li>
   At least one of the following
   <ul>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Deekus
    </li>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Ma'randru-jo
    </li>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Anoriath
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Bound Until Death
  </li>
  <li>
   At least one of the following:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Agnis
    </li>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Maluril
    </li>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Helvard
    </li>
    <li>
     Contract: Kill Safia
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Breaching Security
  </li>
  <li>
   The Cure for Madness
  </li>
  <li>
   Recipe for Disaster
  </li>
  <li>
   To Kill an Empire
  </li>
  <li>
   Death Incarnate
  </li>
  <li>
   Hail Sithis!
  </li>
  <li>
   Where You Hang Your Enemy's Head
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once they move the story along, any remaining "Contract" quests can be completed at the player's leisure, even after the Dark Brotherhood questline is over. After completing the faction's main story, players get the infinitely repeatable quest "The Dark Brotherhood Forever," which tasks them with killing radiant targets.

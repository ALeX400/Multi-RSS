      <title>The Last of Us’ HBO Show Seemingly Tugs a Tight Leash on Naughty Dog’s Upcoming Part 3</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/last-of-us-hbo-naughty-dog-part-3-schedule-release/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  concluded with a couple of white-hot bangs—
  <em>
   A Thief’s End
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Lost Legacy—
  </em>
  during its heyday,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Last of Us
   </em>
  </strong>
  has arguably been Naughty Dog’s crown jewel for the past two decades. It’s endlessly ironic and interesting that
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  has been so revered and beloved with only two installments to its name and, even with it supposedly concluding at some point with a third game, its popularity has never been greater and will probably continue to blossom as seasons of HBO’s show are doled out.
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  ’ HBO show adapted
  <em>
   Part 1
  </em>
  —however loosely—in Season 1, but as far as what’s known for Season 2 its approach to an adaptation of
  <em>
   Part 2
  </em>
  will be nowhere near as simple.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  is definitely a more complicated story to tell than
  <em>
   Part 1
  </em>
  due to its multiple and intertwining perspectives, though with HBO reportedly planning on having the show go on for four seasons it seems as if Naughty Dog might be pressed to move forward on a
  <em>
   Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  . This would normally be a non-issue—
  <em>
   Part 2
  </em>
  wouldn’t follow
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  for a whopping seven years, to be fair—but the scheduling for HBO’s live-action adaptation suggests that a third game may need to bookend the narrative sooner rather than later, especially with
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  on the way.

 <p>
  Naughty Dog will probably want all attention on
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  and to have it released long before a
  <em>
   Last of Us
  </em>
  threequel now that it has a brand-new, shiny IP revealed.
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is still its breadwinner, and yet with a slew of remasters and remakes—however necessary or ancillary they may be—and a recently canceled standalone multiplayer game, it’d be terrific to keep
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  at an arm’s distance until that dust settles and
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  deserves ample time in the limelight.

 <p>
  So, with absolutely nothing revealed about an upcoming
  <em>
   Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  , it is highly unlikely that
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  will precede
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  . Considering how many years it takes for modern, AAA, first-party studios to churn blockbuster games out, it wouldn’t be anywhere beyond the realm of possibility to predict that a
  <em>
   Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  might not be released until 2030 at the earliest. It will be fascinating, then, to see when
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  will launch in relation to its story’s adaptation in the show.

  The Last of Us’ HBO Show May Be Stretched Thin by the Time The Last of Us Part 3 Launches
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  ’ HBO show may not actually end up running for four seasons depending on how much more of the game’s story there is to tell. Still, with such a duration being contemplated and shared publicly at all, there have probably already been conversations about where a
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  adaptation would sneak its way into the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was previously claimed that two seasons could be considered in order to cover the events of
  <em>
   Part 2
  </em>
  and only one season may be reserved for
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  in that case. Nonetheless, depending on how soon each subsequent season will be filmed and produced, that doesn’t leave quite a lot of time for Naughty Dog to have
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  developed and released.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’d be bizarre if Naughty Dog allowed the show to tell
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  ’s story before
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  was released, for instance, and it’d be odd if HBO decided not to adapt
  <em>
   Part 3
  </em>
  . It may be half a decade away or more, but it will be interesting to see how the show and the threequel intersect and how one affects the other in terms of Naughty Dog’s packed slate.

  Although
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  may not have a wide variety of Sniper Rifles, the ones available are exceptionally powerful, making them essential for players who want to dominate long-range engagements while staying out of enemy sight. Their effectiveness allows players to secure kills consistently, support their team from a distance, and control enemy movements without being easily detected.
 </p>
 <p>
  To fully capitalize on the strength of Snipers in the game, it’s crucial to equip the optimal loadout – combining the right attachments, perks, and equipment to enhance performance. With that in mind, here are the
  <strong>
   best Sniper Rifle loadouts in
   <em>
    BO6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , featuring everything you need to master long-range combat.

 <p>
  A staple of the
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  series, the
  <strong>
   SVD
  </strong>
  stands out from other Sniper Rifles due to its
  <strong>
   semi-automatic fire capability
  </strong>
  , making it the only one of its kind. This feature allows for a higher
  <strong>
   rate of fire
  </strong>
  , giving players more flexibility regarding accuracy. While its
  <strong>
   upper-body damage
  </strong>
  is on par with other sniper options, its effectiveness drops significantly below the neck.
 </p>
 <p>
  This
  <strong>
  </strong>
  loadout focuses on
  <strong>
   maximizing bullet velocity and rate of fire
  </strong>
  to ensure consistent eliminations. It also
  <strong>
   enhances
  </strong>
  <strong>
   ADS speed
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   sprint-to-fire time
  </strong>
  for quicker target acquisition. Additionally, it increases
  <strong>
   ammo capacity
  </strong>
  , allowing players to take down at least two enemies per magazine with well-placed shots while maintaining a
  <strong>
   fast
  </strong>
  <strong>
   reload speed
  </strong>
  . Finally, it
  <strong>
   reduces
  </strong>
  <strong>
   recoil
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   aim idle sway
  </strong>
  , improving precision and ensuring each shot counts – especially since the
  <strong>
   semi-auto fire
  </strong>
  can impact accuracy.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   LW3A1 Frostline
  </strong>
  offers solid stats for players aiming to excel as a competitive sniper in
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  . However, compared to its counterparts, it falls short in key areas that determine a weapon’s overall effectiveness. One major drawback is its
  <strong>
   ADS speed
  </strong>
  , which is crucial when using this weapon as a primary choice. With an ADS speed of nearly 600ms, it can feel sluggish – especially for players looking to quickscope enemies – even with attachments designed to improve this stat.
 </p>
 <p>
  This loadout is designed to balance
  <strong>
   bullet velocity, recoil control, and movement speed
  </strong>
  , ensuring the weapon remains viable, particularly on the game’s larger maps – though there aren’t many. While this weapon has drawbacks that place it behind more popular choices, it remains usable, particularly for players who understand its limitations and can adjust their playstyle to mitigate them.

  For players who prioritize high accuracy and prefer a more stationary playstyle in Multiplayer, the
  <strong>
   AMR Mod 4
  </strong>
  is an excellent choice. This Sniper Rifle delivers
  <strong>
   high damage across the board
  </strong>
  , compensating for its bulkier feel compared to its counterparts. As the newest addition to the sniper family, it stands as the only heavy option in its category, trading mobility for increased damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  This loadout is designed to
  <strong>
   enhance mobility
  </strong>
  , allowing it to complement the weapon’s
  <strong>
   competitive fire rate
  </strong>
  while maintaining
  <strong>
   maximum damage at any range
  </strong>
  . Additionally, it aims to make this heavy weapon more comfortable to use, reducing the risk of exposure during engagements.

      <title>PS5 Pro Sales Reportedly Start Lagging Behind PS4 Pro</title>

 <p>
  Sales of the
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5 Pro
  </strong>
  have started to fall behind the PS4 Pro's pace, according to one industry analyst. When Sony released its latest console, it quickly gained attention for its impressive specs and equally breathtaking price tag. Now it seems that, despite a solid start, the PlayStation 5 Pro isn't meeting the same standard as Sony's last Pro console version.
 </p>
 <p>
  The PS5 Pro launched in early November 2024 and sold well in that first month. At launch, the PS5 Pro sold as well as the PS4 Pro, despite costing $300 more. However, it's now looking like the system wasn't able to maintain that trend.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gaming industry analyst Mat Piscatella noted on Bluesky that, as of February 21, 2025, the PS5 Pro is lagging behind what the PS4 Pro sold in the same timeframe. Piscatella did not provide specific numbers, and Sony has not made the PS5 Pro's sales figures public, but the console's high price and an industry-wide decline in hardware sales could play a part in the dip. The console has also experienced some performance problems, although Sony said it's working on a fix for the PS5 Pro's issues and not all games suffered from them.

 <h2 id="the-ps5-pro-is-supposedly-no-longer-selling-as-well-as-the-ps4-pro">
  The PS5 Pro Is Supposedly No Longer Selling as Well as the PS4 Pro
 </h2>
 <p>
  Earlier in his thread, Piscatella did say that overall PS5 hardware spending had dropped by 38% year-over-year, which likely contributed to the PS5 Pro falling behind the PS4 Pro's pace. This decline isn't unique to Sony, though. According to Piscatella, the Xbox Series X and S saw a 50% decline and the Switch fell by 53% in the same period. Gaming hardware has struggled to keep up with software lately, with all console sales falling by 21% in Europe in 2024.

 </div>
 <p>
  Whether the PS5 Pro's sales will recover or how Sony will proceed from here is uncertain. There are rumors that a PlayStation handheld could release alongside the PS6, but there's no official news on the matter for now. Amid declining hardware sales, Xbox has shifted to focus on its software products, and Nintendo has the upcoming Switch 2 to potentially drive sales when it releases later in 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's worth considering that the PS4 Pro sold rather well. Despite being an upgrade and not an entirely new system, it moved an impressive number of consoles, so the PS5 Pro falling behind its pace is not dramatic news. Considering how the industry as a whole has seen a drop in hardware spending, such a decline is to be expected to some degree.

      <title>One Disney Lorcana Set 7 Card May Be One of The Best Ever, and It's a Common</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-belle-apprentice-inventor-op-good-why/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Without counting the various Enchanted cards in the set, Archazia's Island is adding a total of 204 unique cards to the overall
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lorcana
   </em>
  </strong>
  collection, which is pretty good for the first expansion of the year. There are many new good cards to add to existing decks or even make new ones, and some of the most interesting in Archazia's Island are
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  's dual-Ink cards, which can be quite powerful. For example, the new Ruby/Steel Mushu - Majestic Dragon could easily allow this color combination to become much stronger than ever before. While some of the rarest cards can also be some of the best, there is one
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  set 7 card that may change the game - and it's only a Common.

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Some of
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  's set 7 Legendary cards are a good example of this logic, with some of the best being Tamatoa - Happy as a Clam and Scrooge McDuck - Resourceful Miser thanks to their synergy with Items. One could argue that Sapphire is going to be one of the best colors in the set 7 meta because of cards like these and others, all providing good combos with existing cards and deck archetypes. As further confirmation of this, what is easily one of the best cards of the set, if not the, is the new Belle - Apprentice Inventor.

 <p>
  This Common
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  card is extremely powerful even beyond surface level. If played normally, this is a 3-cost character with 3 Strength and Willpower that quests for one, which is mediocre. However, it can be one of the strongest cards in the game in the right decks and under some circumstances, as it has the What A Mess ability that reads "During your turn, you may banish chosen Item of yours to play this character for free."
 </p>
 <p>
  Belle's ability is fantastic for Sapphire
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  decks because a lot of them run at least some Items, especially the 1-cost Pawpsicle in four copies. This card can hypothetically be played on turn one in this exact scenario, meaning that a player would Ink one card, play Pawpsicle to draw one card, then play Belle - Apprentice Inventor by banishing Pawpsicle. This can be done with any 1-cost Item on turn one, which is what makes this card so broken, especially seeing that there are 25 Items in the game that cost one Ink.

     It's worth mentioning that, given the game's rules, players cannot declare an Item target for Belle - Apprentice Inventor and then banish it for its own effects, such as the healing ability from Pawpsicle. The item must be banished to play Belle, and nothing else.

  If this game plan goes through, players will find themselves with a 3-Strength and 3-Willpower character on turn one, which is already unprecedented. This way, they can challenge most other 1- or 2-cost characters quite safely, which is great against aggro decks. On top of that, Belle - Apprentice Inventor has an Ink cost of 3, which even if it isn't paid when the card is played, allows Belle to sing any song that costs 3 or less on the following turn. Singing songs in
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  can be very strong, and this would be all the more effective in some color combinations over others.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  's color combinations may eventually shift around in terms of meta decks with Archazia's Island, but some synergies remain. Belle - Apprentice Inventor would be able to sing powerful songs like Let The Storm Rage On or I'm Still Here as early as turn two if used in a Sapphire/Steel deck, or maybe the new This Is My Family or Friends On The Other Side if paired with Amethyst. The possibilities are near endless, and it goes to show just how incredible this card is for being just a Common.

  Finding Sub-Zero in

  isn't essential to victory, but it's going to provide players with the Sub-Zero Kombat Kit, along with a fierce challenge that most players might not be able to survive. and they will end up going back to the lobby for another go.

  <strong>
   Sub-Zero is found at the landmark, Sleepwalker's Peril
  </strong>
  , which is located between Whiffy Wharf and Flooded Frogs, where the Great Turtle used to be in Chapter 6 Season 1. Sub-Zero acts as a non-hostile NPC, so players can approach him and exchange pleasantries with him. Players who talk to him can also
  <strong>
   hire him as a Scout Specialist for 500 Gold
  </strong>
  . Other than finding Sub-Zero and hiring him as a Specialist, he doesn't do much except for wander Sleepwalker's Peril. However, players can challenge him to an unprompted fight...

  Before players engage in Mortal Kombat with Sub-Zero, it is best to grab plenty of armor and weapons. Around Sleepwalker's Peril, there are plenty of chests that players can unlock to fill up their shields and gather a bundle of weapons. Once ready, start shooting at Sub-Zero, who will immediately become aggressive towards the player and attempt to eliminate them with his Kombat Kit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sub-Zero relies only on close-quarter combat, so it's best to use SMGs and Assault Rifles instead of Shotguns, as using a Shotgun provides Sub-Zero with an easy opportunity to combo players with his ice punches and kicks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon eliminating Sub-Zero, he will disappear, and players will no longer be able to hire him. When Sub-Zero is defeated, he will drop the Sub-Zero's Kombat Kit for players to use, which is a nice Epic drop for so early on in the game.

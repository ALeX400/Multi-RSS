 <p>
  In June, mobile developer MY.GAMES announced its new premium label, Knights Peak, with a slate of games including
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starship Troopers: Extermination
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as well as narrative games like
  <em>
   Pathfinder: Kingmaker
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mandragora
  </em>
  . The company’s foray into premium publishing is built on partnerships throughout the industry.

 <p>
  With more news teased for Gamescom in late August, Game Rant was able to do a deep dive into what makes Knights Peak stand out with the label’s Vice-President of Publishing, Eugenio Vitale. Vitale carries a lot of those partnerships and history, and he has a real passion for Knights Peak’s mission.

 <h2 id="the-vision-for-knights-peak">
  The Vision For Knights Peak
 </h2>
 <p>
  Each developer, publisher, or contributor to games has their own DNA, the fingerprint that makes their work stand out as their work. For Bioware it’s branching narratives, for Bethesda, it’s project scale; for Square-Enix it’s high expectations and impressive physics. Knights Peak is a very new label, so the unique style of a Knights Peak game has yet to coalesce.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1018} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  That doesn’t mean there’s nothing to say about what makes something a Knights Peak project. Vitale explained what values the label takes into its nascent catalogue, forming the beginning of that signature style.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":225} -->
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We believe that our games should embody three key pillars: personality, familiarity, and quality. Each title should bring something new to the table within its genre, offering innovation while still allowing players to connect with the game on a familiar level … At the heart of Knights Peak lies a steadfast commitment to partnership. We believe in fostering eye-to-eye relationships with developers and players alike. We have a deep appreciation for the sacrifices developers make and an unwavering respect for their creative vision.

 <p>
  And that shows in the choices Knights Peak has made thus far. One of the strongest examples of the three pillars Vitale mentioned is
  <em>
   Mandragora
  </em>
  , a forthcoming gothic metroidvania soulslike RPG written by
  <em>
   Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines
  </em>
  ’
  <em>
  </em>
  Brian Matsuda and inspired by Irish folklore. Knights Peak is dedicated to working with Primal Games to bring the game to life as part of a publishing partnership.

  That kind of commitment to partnership is very personal to Vitale. His career from indie motocross developer to today has been marked with collaboration.

  Why Vitale Being at the Helm is a Big Deal
 </h2>
 <p>
  Choosing Vitale for the job brought a lot of connections to Knights Peak’s fingertips. Vitale has worked with developers big and small, including Deep Silver and Mad Head. On top of that, his thirty years in the industry has given him a perspective on just what developers at any scale need for support from a publisher.

  <p>
   Starting a company in my early 20s was no easy feat, and while I had a clear vision of what I wanted to achieve, I have to admit that my people management skills left much to be desired initially.

These experiences continue to inform my understanding of developers and the challenges they face in bringing their creations to life.

  Vitale started The Dawn Interactive, working on motocross titles in 1994. He traveled all across Italy to recruit developers, starting with a team of three–with two working day jobs. Their team had to develop their own engine in MS-DOS, having started development before Windows 95 was even announced. From there, the team was able to release
  <em>
   Extreme Trial Motocross
  </em>
  in 1998. The small studio was able to sell 500,000 copies despite Vitale’s inexperience in marketing and publishing at the time.

 <p>
  He continued to work with motocross, partnering with publishers and champions of the sport and honing his talents, both as an indie developer wearing multiple hats and as a marketer and publisher. Now, he’s supporting people in the position he was in as a younger developer, and providing those resources to the teams that partner with Knights Peak.

 <p>
  Now the Vice-President of Publishing at Knights Peak, Vitale can directly apply his background to the kind of brand that MY.GAMES’ new label wants to be. His expertise with building connections, working at multiple levels of development, and getting resources where they need to be is critical to a good publisher.

  And he’s built both his team and Knights Peak’s catalogue to get that relationship with the broader industry off to a strong start. To no small extent, Knights Peak is the fruit of Vitale’s labor - though he humbly attributes the starting position of the label to good fortune.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  <strong>
   <em>
    Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  has finally revealed its launch roster in full. The game had previously faced concerns about the size of its roster, but the selections have been diverse enough to largely make up for it. However, there are still a few notable characters missing. In fact, some of these inclusions are so obvious that a DLC announcement for
  <em>
   Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact
  </em>
  seems more likely than ever.

  <em>

  's launch roster has already begun to exceed expectations. While the roster remains small, the makeup of characters included provides a stark contrast from its initial reveal. Rather than focusing on characters who may lend themselves better to a traditional fighting game, the roster embraces
  <em>
   Hunter x Hunter
  </em>
  's wide array of creative fighters, and potential DLC should definitely follow this trend.

  Unique Hunter x Hunter Characters Who Would Be Perfect for Nen x Impact DLC
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ging Freecss is one of the most important and powerful characters in
  <em>
   Hunter x Hunter
  </em>
  , and his role as Gon's deadbeat dad should make that clear enough. Likewise, Ging is a genius of Nen, and has shown himself to be capable of copying others' abilities, and using them to an even greater extent than they could. Though he has only demonstrated this with Leorio's ability so far, developers could use other members of the roster to give Ging a composite moveset that lets him fully stand out from the crowd he borrows from.

 <p>
  Prince Tserriednich is the presumptive main villain of the Succession Contest Arc, and has incredible potential as a playable character in
  <em>
   Nen x Impact
  </em>
  . Unfortunately, the roster trends towards excluding characters not yet featured in the
  <em>
   Hunter x Hunter
  </em>
  anime. Despite this, Tserriednich's prominence alone should put him in consideration, and his ability to alter the future would make him a formidable fighter.

  Alluka is Killua's younger sister and a member of the Zoldyck family of assassins. Thanks to her alter ego Nanika, she has an ability so esoteric that it'd easily provide the most unique design in the entire game. This unfortunately makes her inclusion somewhat of a challenge for developers, even as DLC. On that note, Alluka is by no means a combatant, though that hasn't stopped Leorio yet.

  Illumi seemed like a given to make it into the game, especially as a member of both the Zoldyck family and the Phantom Troupe. The so-called Needle People he manipulates with his Nen ability could provide an interesting playstyle, though it may conflict with other members of the roster, such as Morel or Razor.

  Any member of the Chimera Ant Royal Guard would've been a natural inclusion, especially Neferpitou. Shaiapouf and Menthuthuyoupi would certainly be worthy inclusions, and the latter is even referenced in Meruem's moveset. However, Pitou's role in the series is unmatched by her counterparts, with her fighting style fitting much more comfortably into a fast-paced fighter like
  <em>
   Nen x Impact
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Another character that has seemingly been snubbed is Knuckle, a key member of the squad assembled to exterminate the Chimera Ants. Even his partners on the squad, Shoot and Palm, would provide a lot of value to the roster. Palm's role as a heroic Chimera Ant would make her especially interesting. However, Knuckle's debt-based Nen ability sets him apart from the brawlers that are already on the roster.

 <p>
  The disappointment created by certain snubs does not measure up to the excitement that many recent announcements have created. Not only does the game appear more polished than when it was revealed, but the final character reveals have restored a lot of confidence in the diversity of the roster. At this point, certain characters being left out makes their eventual inclusion more likely, not less.

  Within the highly competitive shonen genre,
  <em>
   Hunter x Hunter
  </em>
  has always stood out for the depth of its fights and characters alike.
  <em>
   Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact
  </em>
  has made its voice heard among other upcoming anime fighters. It would be wise to maintain this momentum by announcing and releasing DLC characters that take full advantage of the series' best traits.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Temple Of Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a mobile game based on the
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  anime. It has fairly simple gameplay, but it is very enjoyable and addictive. This is an auto-battler where all players have to do is upgrade their ninjas and unlock new ones. The game is very generous from the very beginning and fans will quickly get plenty of fighters, the first of which will be Naruto. Nevertheless, it is possible to accelerate progress by entering several
  <em>
   Temple Of Shadows
  </em>
  codes. Using them, users will receive a lot of currency to upgrade their ninjas, as well as tickets to unlock new ones.

      <title>Legend of Slime Codes (August 2024)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Legend of Slime
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a cute, simple, yet addictive idle RPG with a bunch of mechanics that will grab your attention for hours, maybe even days. In many games, slimes are the weakest enemies, being the initial ones, but
  <em>
   Legend of Slime
  </em>
  breaks all the standards. Here, the slime plays the protagonist's role, fighting against evil people who rise up on the way. Throughout the game, you'll need to level up your slime, get new weapons, armor, and even companions, but all of this requires Gems, the local premium currency. By redeeming
  <em>
   Legend of Slime
  </em>
  codes, you'll get a bunch of Gems, which will be enough to properly equip your character, especially if you're a beginner.

  Even without an excessive amount of Gems, the game is easy and fast, but getting new cool equipment or companions is also nice, especially since it gives a good advantages. Manually accumulating currency can be a bit time-consuming, so the best method is to redeem
  <em>
   Legend of Slime
  </em>
  codes, which will bring you tons of Gems in seconds.

   Pay attention to the upper right corner of the screen. There will be a button with three dashes and dots. Click on it.

   This will open a drop-down menu. Here, find and interact with the Settings button. It's the second one on the list.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the Settings menu, pay attention to the bottom section. There will be a button labeled Coupon. Click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   This will open the redemption menu, which has only three options, an input field, and two buttons: Cancel and OK. Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above-mentioned active codes into the input field.

   Lastly, click on the OK button to submit the reward request.

  Dodging enemies and surviving as long as possible is what
  <em>
   Evade
  </em>
  is all about. This article will teach
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  players how to redeem
  <em>
   Evade
  </em>
  codes to receive a wide variety of in-game goodies that will help give them an edge over the competition. However,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  players should be sure to do so as soon as possible, as it is unknown how long these codes are going to remain active.

  Redeeming codes in
  <em>
   Evade
  </em>
  is relatively straightforward, with players simply needing to follow a few steps. If a code doesn't work, they should make sure they entered it correctly and try again. If it still doesn't work after this, it could mean that the code has recently expired or has already been redeemed by the player.

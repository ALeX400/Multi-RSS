 <p>
  Anyone trying to get a taste of the upcoming games in 2025 or later now has a golden opportunity to play a free demo of them as the first round of Steam Next Fest for this year is already live, with many indie developers - and some triple-A studios - showing off a vertical slice of their upcoming projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the massive number of demos available and a limited time, it's difficult to choose which games to play, especially when there are so many promising titles with creative approaches. However, some demos have already received positive feedback from the fans, which sets up a bright future ahead of them.

  If anyone misses the old RTS games like
  <em>
   Red Alert
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Generals
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   StarCraft
  </em>
  , then
  <em>
   Tempest Rising
  </em>
  is a must-wishlist for them, with a brief free demo already available to play. While featuring breathtaking visuals,
  <em>
   Tempest Rising
  </em>
  tries to remain as loyal as possible to classic games of the genre, where the army is the only thing that matters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like its sources of inspiration, managing the economy is a key part of the game. Players start by building different manufacturing facilities to produce warfare machines or recruit infantry units and then lead the army towards the objectives. Both airborne and ground-based units are supported in the game, and battles are fought on a variety of unique maps.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Tempest Rising
  </em>
  feels like a true spiritual successor to
  <em>
   Command And Conquer: Generals
  </em>
  , a game that never received its promised sequel.

  While still not ready for a full release,
  <em>
   Among Us 3D
  </em>
  does have a free demo available at the moment to let the fans feel what the next evolution of the game will be like. The biggest feature to expect from the 3D version is the native proximity voice chat support that lets players talk together with no need for third-party programs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The core gameplay still remains the same, but the first-person perspective does give the game a fresh feel and makes it a bit difficult for both impostors and crewmates, as their field of view is now limited, and they need to act more cautiously. It's worth noting that the current demo does not support VR yet.

  Coming from the developers of
  <em>
   SnowRunner
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   RoadCraft
  </em>
  is a new experience in the same subgenre with a focus on restoring roads damaged by natural hazards using a wide variety of construction machines, each with its own unique feel and challenges.
 </p>
 <p>
  Visually,
  <em>
   RoadCraft
  </em>
  seems more impressive than
  <em>
   SnowRunner
  </em>
  , but the gameplay loop might feel a bit slower, as players will have to use different machines with different purposes, though the missions feel more diverse, and they barely feel boring or repetitive.

  <em>
   Deliver At All Costs
  </em>
  is a light-hearted driving game that relies on its spectacularly destructible environment to inject more fun and chaos into the gameplay. The plan is simple. The player is tasked with delivering some peculiar cargo in each mission, and they must be delivered at all costs!
 </p>
 <p>
  To cut the long roads short, players can drive through the buildings or jump over the rivers and overcome some natural hazards along the way. Throughout this chaotic journey, the game also has a story to tell, and the players will have to tackle some missions on foot while completing deliveries.

  Hunderds of games have been released so far that put the player in the shoes of a lonely survivor trying to escape from a haunted mansion, but few games have done it vice versa. Deck of Haunts lets players enjoy being evil, scaring the residents of a haunted mansion by base-building and deck-building gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the day, players expand their mansion by adding new rooms and corridors to it and giving more depth to the maze inside it, while at night, the rooms become the playground for the evil to play their cards of terror and drain the sanity of residents. That being said, evil is not immune to damage, as the player must secure the heart of terror, which is placed within the mansion.

  After the incredible success of the original game simulating extreme cycling, now the same formula is back again with snowboarding.

  is less than two months away from its full release, and a free vertical slice of the game is more than appreciated by the community.

  While the core gameplay remains almost unchanged,
  <em>
   Descenders Next
  </em>
  comes with skateboarding in dry environments and snowboarding on top of tall mountains, which adds a new variety to the game's environment. The roguelike elements and massive grind to master each track are all there for a fresh adventure.

  While still lacking a release date, a demo for Gothic 1 Remake seems like a good opportunity for the player base to provide more feedback before the full release. The goal of this demo is to acquaint the players with the overall atmosphere and feel of the game rather than showing all gameplay elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  The demo includes a brief quest, during which players are introduced to the game's opening region, and they will have the freedom to explore the area and talk to the NPCs, though not much story progression will be made.

  The upcoming competitive shooter from the
  <em>
   PUBG
  </em>
  universe is quite a unique approach to the top-down shooter genre. Not that we never had tactical top-down shooters, but few of them have decided to make it a fully competitive experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   PUBG: Blindspot
  </em>
  feels like a top-down version of
  <em>
   Rainbow Six: Siege
  </em>
  . The game features unique heroes, each with their own abilities and equipment. Most maps feature complex interior design that requires teammates to clear it together and have a strategy for that.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game has some unique and fun mechanics, like a shared visual among the squad, which lets one player see everything that their friends see in real time, and this rewards the team with best coordination.

  The original
  <em>
   Breathedge
  </em>
  is always remembered for its lovely humor, and it's a relief to see the sequel will keep that alive!
  <em>
   Breathedge 2
  </em>
  remains loyal to its predecessor when it comes to the core gameplay while delivering a bigger world with new features like the spaceship, which is the real home to the protagonist and his crewmates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maintaining and upgrading the spaceship is a new gameplay loop, while driving other smaller vehicles - similar to the first game - is still available to explore the planet surface. The crafting system will allow players to create all sorts of useful and junky stuff, while new enemies are introduced to make it harder to survive!

  The first thing to note about
  <em>
   Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone
  </em>
  is that it has a completely different approach compared to its predecessor. It's not a continuation of Tatyana's story in the original game, and the story doesn't seem to be the main focus this time around.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead,
  <em>
   Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone
  </em>
  is more of a survival experience with a bigger focus on crafting, base building, and exploration. Not that it doesn't have a story to tell, but it is not supposed to be or feel like the original game's story.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sequel also comes with a switchable perspective, letting players explore in first-person or third-person, though it seems like the latter is what the developers try to encourage the players to use. Such a massive change of direction does require a demo before release to let the fans test the waters before making a purchase.

  A trusted
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Warzone
   </em>
  </strong>
  leaker has revealed that developer Raven Software intends to bring back a handful of iconic
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  weapons for the game's big Season 3 update, including the Grau Assault Rifle and HDR Sniper Rifle. With Season 3 of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  expected to launch sometime in March, leaks and rumors are beginning to ramp up as the update is also likely to see the return of Verdansk.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the massive success of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  OG,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  publisher Activision became the latest studio to follow in the newest gaming trend and confirmed that Verdansk would be returning to
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  in Spring 2025. While the release window is fast approaching, the studio has yet to confirm an exact release date for the map's return, but recent leaks and rumors all point to a March launch alongside Season 3. With
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  currently in a dire state, the entire
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  community is eager to see if Verdansk's return will bring the Battle Royale title to its former glory. Some remain skeptical, but a new leak has just given players a glimmer of hope.

   <em>
    Modern Warfare
   </em>
   weapons returning in March. TheGhostOfHope also took to Twitter and said that the CR-56 AMAX and Kilo 141 will return with Season 3. However, the leaker does note that this is a "grain of salt rumor," meaning there's a chance these weapons don't actually make a return. Should they return, it's unclear whether or not they will also be available in
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
   Multiplayer, as both games usually share the same batch of weapons.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  A separate post from CharlieIntel also claims that some content creators have been play-testing early builds of Verdansk in the current iteration of
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  ​​​​​​, with different map elements and traversal features. The rumor also corroborates a recent leak from TheGhostOfHope, who revealed some key changes being made to Verdansk for its return to
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  in March. Two sources have now stated that the map will be similar to the original version that launched in March 2020, with a handful of upgrades. While the original version of Verdansk had an inaccessible Stadium, leaks state that its interior will be open, but its roof will still remain closed.

  The return of Verdansk is shaping up to be a monumental moment for
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  , and Activision is supposedly well aware of its importance. According to CharlieIntel, the studio is trying to go "all out" for the map's return, which is apparently why Season 2 of
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  had little to no content. While
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  players were treated to a plethora of new maps, modes, and more,
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​fans were left with nothing more than a new perk. Activision says this was to prioritize gameplay tuning, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements, but it looks like it could have been to prepare for the return of Verdansk.

  Bandai Namco is gearing up to deliver a boatload of new content in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tekken 8
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s upcoming season 2, now that the game’s first year is over, and Anna Williams has been announced as the first fighter gracing the new season.
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  ’s Year 1 Pass included the arrival of new characters Angel Jin, Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo, and Victor Chevalier, alongside the surprising addition of protagonist Clive Rosfield from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  was first released in 2024, and as the title suggests, it’s the eighth installment in the main
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  series. The story mode is titled The Dark Awakens and is set six months after the events of
  <em>
   Tekken 7
  </em>
  following the showdown between protagonist Jin Kazama and his father Kazuya Mishima.
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  was one of the top-selling 2024 games, alongside
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   EA Sports College Football 25
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , and fans of the popular fighting franchise are confident season 2 will not disappoint.
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealed in Bandai Namco’s three-minute gameplay trailer, Anna was welcomed to the line-up, showcasing the Scarlet Lightning’s combos and style in impressive combat footage. Viewers will also have seen that Anna will be making good use of her bazooka in melee and ranged attacks. The fighting game community has already devised a
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  season 2 DLC character wish list ahead of schedule, but the fandom is pleased about Anna’s return and players can get to know her on March 31, 2025, during the Early Access period, or on the official release of April 3, 2025.

  Tekken 8 Season 2 Reveals Anna Williams as the First Fighter
 </h2>
 <p>
  Some fans believe the future
  <em>
   Tekken 9
  </em>
  should atone for the sins of past entries, but
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  fans are happy to see the Williams sisters back together again and have a lot of praise to give to Anna's new design. The fandom was also quick to comment on Anna’s amazing dress sense, especially her jacket, and most agreed Bandai managed to avoid the “Karen look” by styling Anna’s haircut to perfection.

  game released in 1994 and was introduced as the sister to Nina Williams. Anna has returned for every entry, except
  <em>
   Tekken 4
  </em>
  , and was welcomed as a new fighter in
  <em>

  </em>
  , alongside Lei Wulong. The fighter is known for her skills as an assassin and martial artist, usually appearing in her signature red or blue silk dress, and took part in the first two King of Iron Fist Tournaments.

  As shown above, here are all SHADOW Briefing Job Boards found in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Battle Royale’s Chapter 6 Season 2: Lawless. There are over 20 SHADOW Briefing Job Boards that can be found within the map at specific locations, but it’s worth noting that
  <strong>
   only 70% of them will spawn
  </strong>
  – meaning sometimes players will not find a Job Board where one should be. If players want to try the SHADOW Briefing Job Boards for themselves, then the best route for this is to take a car, follow the road, and look at the mini-map for a symbol of a terminal when approaching the POI or Landmark.

 <ul>

   Yokina Boardwalk, West of Outlaw Oasis
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Those curious about the details of the Supply Drop Job Boards can find them below. It’s also worth mentioning that this Job Board is perhaps the easiest, although people will have to be cautious when locating and looting the random Supply Drop that spawns, as other players can indeed see it and might pursue its location for loot and kills.

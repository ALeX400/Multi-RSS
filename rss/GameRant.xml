 <p>
  The launch of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  draws ever nearer, and it seems it is already set up to attract a new audience that its predecessor wasn't able to as a forerunner for the franchise. That being said, many of those who played the first
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  will likely be making their way over to the sequel, each of them looking for a similar but improved experience.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  was announced, fans of the first
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  may have been wondering whether their save file will carry over to the second game. Unfortunately, since
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  can be played without any knowledge of its predecessor, Warhorse hasn't implemented a way for save files to be transferred over to it. However,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  does offer players opportunities to establish their Henry from the first game. As such, while every choice players made in the first game won't be factored into the sequel,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  does take into account key choices, as well as their level of experience with the first game.

  Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's Tutorials and Dialogue Change Depending on Players' Experience
 </h3>
 <p>
  Sequels, especially RPG sequels, generally go the route of re-educating players on things they may already have experience with from previous entries. In some ways, this can be helpful, especially if there is a large gap of time between the last installment and the current one. It's also beneficial if certain systems have evolved over the course of each game, as these tutorials would help players become accustomed to any new mechanics that weren't present in previous installments. However, since
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  is more of a remake than a sequel, most, if not all, of its systems are the same as they were in the first game.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Thankfully,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  honors players' experience with the first game's many systems by giving them opportunities to choose whether they are more or less experienced with each one. For example, should players be more than familiar with
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  's Lockpicking system,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  will ask them what their level of experience is with it and then change or remove its tutorial.

  This way of honoring players' experience with the first game also changes
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2

  's dialogue in some ways, though specific lines of dialogue have yet to be revealed. It can be assumed, however, that, should players confirm they are well versed in

  's Lockpicking, if someone in the sequel were to offer to teach them how to pick locks, Henry's reply would consider the player's experience.

  Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Lets Players Choose the Outcome of Certain Events From the First Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the most prominent conversations has revolved around whether
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  will feature Theresa. While it's still unclear if Theresa will make an appearance in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , it has been confirmed that the sequel's prologue will allow players to establish what Henry's relationship with Theresa was in the first game. Another event that
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  has been confirmed to honor is Henry's fight with Hans in the first game, and whether he lost or won that fight.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Players' choices here will ultimately shape
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's dialogue, and possibly some of its events as well. Some
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  fans might find it disappointing that their save file won't carry over to the sequel, especially given that
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  will also follow the "something bad happened to Henry and that's why he lost all of his stuff and experience" trope. Nevertheless, at least the sequel has made some strides to honor players' experience with the first game.

  </strong>
  are key components for building any sort of automation and setting up a production line. Without the ability to autonomously transport materials and items from one location to another, players would have to rely on manual transportation to do the task.

  Conveyor Belts are not available at the very start of the game, during the tutorial. They need to be unlocked by completing certain milestones in the HUB. This is to prevent new players and beginners from being completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of things to do in
  <em>
   Satisfactory

  . Here is how it works.

  <strong>
   A Conveyor Belt needs to be connected to an output and an input
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Satisfactory
  </em>
  . It's easy to identify whether a port is an output or an input by looking at any structure's hologram in the build menu. The orange port is the input, and the green port is the output.

 <p>
  If the hologram does not snap into place, it means that the two ends of the Conveyor Belts are connected to invalid targets (like two outputs) or that the turn rate for the Conveyor Belt is not physically possible.

 <p>
  If the hologram is yellow instead of blue, it means there is a clipping error, where the pathing you’re using is running through other objects like trees or other buildings. This can be safely ignored, and pressing the LMB will create a functional belt.

  Progressive tiers of Conveyor Belts are called Mk.2, Mk.3, Mk.4, and Mk.5. Each progressive tier of Conveyor Belt can be unlocked by completing the relevant Milestone in the HUB. These will unlock naturally as the game progresses and players complete FICSIT's objectives. Here are the details:

 <p>
  The only difference between Conveyor Belts of different tiers is the speed at which they transport materials. Conveyor Belt Mk.2, for example, is twice as fast as Mk.1, the Mk.3 is 4.5x faster than Mk.1, and so on. However, simply upgrading all Conveyor Belts in a production chain without any forethought will not yield proportional results. This is because the bottleneck in many production lines is not the speed at which the materials are being transported but the processing speed for refining those materials.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Like all buildings and structures in
   <em>
    Satisfactory
   </em>
   ,
   <strong>
    Conveyor Belts can be dismantled at any time
   </strong>
   , and the player will be able to recoup the entire cost. If the Conveyor Belt is in operation and there are items actively being transported, everything will be deposited inside your inventory. If there is no space in your inventory, excess materials will be deposited on the ground in the form of a small storage container.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you're in a hurry, you can
   <strong>
    manually pick materials off of any Conveyor Belt
   </strong>
   by walking up to it and picking it up. This can come in handy when you need a material urgently and can't wait for the automation to finish. Since manual crafting is always faster than automated crafting, this can speed up the completion of milestones, especially in the early game.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Existing Conveyor Belts can be upgraded to the next tier
   </strong>
   by selecting the next tier from the build menu and interacting with the belt.
  </li>
  <li>
   Always keep a
   <strong>
    surplus of Iron Plates
   </strong>
   in a storage container in case of an emergency in the early game. Even after graduating to the next tiers, having the ability to always construct Mk.1 belts goes a long way in connecting far-off resources to the main base.

  The Alpha Lab for the upcoming
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  fighting game has come and gone, but hopes for
  <strong>
   <em>
    2XKO
   </em>
  </strong>
  remain high. This closed beta test impressed many players, but also was helpful in informing Riot Games and developer Radiant Entertainment of some things that could be improved before
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  ’s proper launch. Simple inputs may permeate every part of this
  <em>
   LoL
  </em>
  2v2 fighter, but it's just as fast and frenetic as its genre implies, and carefully managing the casual accessibility and competitive appeal of
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  will only be the first of many challenges this title will have to face.

 <p>
  Fortunately,
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  has proven capable of meeting those challenges so far. At least in terms of casual interest,
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  has done a stellar job of translating
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  ’ diverse Champions into a 2D fighting game form. Of the six confirmed characters so far, as well as glimpses of Jinx in trailers, everyone looks to be in peak form, with alternate skins promising to add even more flair in the future. Everyone's iconic kits have also been translated from
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  in smart and faithful ways, but one of the best examples of this also calls into question how certain other Champions could be realized in
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  .

  Hailing from the frigid north of the Freljord, the shield-bearing folk hero Braum has a smile as big as his muscles, and just as many fans in the universe of Runeterra as out of it. Shield characters are a fairly common archetype in competitive games, ranging from
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  's Reinhardt to the classic Big Shield Gardna in the original run of
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  , but they are a lot rarer in fighting games. Characters with Braum’s physique are typically pigeonholed into being grapplers, like
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  ’s Zangief, but
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  wasn't content with sticking to the norm.

  Braum’s Jump From League of Legends To 2XKO Builds Hope
 </h3>
 <p>
  Braum is a fully realized tank converted into fighting game form, boasting the ability to block for his partner while also deploying his own game plan and mechanics. In this way, he's like a supercharged version of his original tank support role from
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , and this can only mean good things for
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  's future. There are plenty of support or tanking-focused big-body Champions like Thresh, Alistar, or Blitzcrank that have varied kits, but an unclear way of translating into a fighting game.
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  has proven that it has a place for atypical fighters like these, but there’s still another major
  <em>
   LoL
  </em>
  archetype with an unclear fate.

  Tanks and other up-close support Champions may translate to
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  in natural ways that work in a new genre while retaining their original identities, but it's too soon to say if the same applies to enchanters. Marksmen and other long-ranged fighters are already a big question mark hanging over
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  ’s head, seeing as Ahri and the presumed Jinx could fill
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  's launch with enough zoning tools to fill a roster. There's a lot of
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  Champions with guns, traps, or magic, and while there is enough variety among them to cherry-pick the best fits for
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  , the same can't necessarily be said for enchanters.

  LoL’s Enchanters Risk Being Homogenous In 2XKO
 </h3>
 <p>
  As a major role in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , and also host to several iconic characters, including some better-known Champions like Sona, Soraka, and Lulu, enchanters can't be left out of
  <em>
   2XKO
  </em>
  . However, Radiant Entertainment will need to think hard about how to adapt these folks, as there are few more obvious roles that this group can fill than projectile or trap-based zoners that also have one or two partner-buffing abilities. Adapting Champions like Braum, Illaoi, and Ekko have been some of
  <strong>
   <em>
    2XKO
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s greatest successes so far, but the biggest challenges in doing
  <em>

  </em>
  justice may still lie ahead.

  One of the most beloved franchises in video games,
  <em>
   The Legend Of Zelda
  </em>
  has a deep history and a rich cast of characters, be they heroes, villains, or extras. Many of them have attracted their own following over the years, prompting everything from cosplay to memes, to the extent that they are the video gaming equivalent of real-world celebrities.

 <p>
  Characters as vibrant as these can attract devoted followers and strong opinions, and more than one can be the subject of intense debate as to their respective merits (or lack thereof). There are several examples, so here is a guide to the most high-profile characters in the many
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games who polarize opinion.

 <p>
  "Hey! Listen!" is a phrase that a lot of people were
  <em>
   very
  </em>
  familiar with, provided they owned a Nintendo 64 from the late 1990s onwards. It was the calling card of Navi, Link's trusty companion as he traversed across the many dungeons and landscapes of Hyrule. The fairy sprite was effectively a taskmaster and tip-giver, directing the player and giving prompts when it was unclear where to go next.

 <p>
  But there were occasions when, having already done the thing or gone to the place, she would keep piping up anyway. Several times. In a short space of time. Whether Link wanted her to or not. Fans saw her as charmingly persistent or ingratiating, and her unmistakable call has since gone viral, even turning up on lo-fi tracks.

  Like Navi, Beedle can be recognized through sound alone. His greetings, reactions and goodbyes are utterly unique. Beedle first popped up in
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  , selling his wares. He was doing something right, as he made a strong enough impression on fans to stay in the game's universe and had the honour of appearing in recent blockbusters
  <em>
   Breath Of The Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears Of The Kingdom.

 <p>
  Beedle is a friendly soul, perhaps to the point of seeming like a bit of an oddball, reacting with over-the-top excitement whenever Link shows up to buy some arrows or sell him a beetle (his portable shopfront in the most recent
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games resembles the insect), and his high-pitched exclamations can be heard all the way across Hyrule.

  If polarizing
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans were an Olympic sport, Tingle would walk away with the gold. The small green fellow first up popped in
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  as a humble map merchant and has been embedded in the franchise ever since. There is some debate over what exactly Tingle is but he appears to be somewhere between a human and a fairy.

 <p>
  Known for his catchphrase "Kooloo-Limpah!" as well as occasionally dangling from a red balloon, Tingle may have his share of detractors but he also has major staying power, appearing in several
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  titles since his debut, including his own spin-off games and the amusingly-named
  <em>
   Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip Of Love
  </em>
  .

  Skull Kid's introduction seemed harmless enough, as he was one of several creatures who popped up in
  <em>
   Ocarina Of Time
  </em>
  's notorious Lost Woods. Little did players know at the time that he would go on to become the malevolent antagonist in one of the all-time greatest Zelda games.

 <p>
  Under the influence of Majora's Mask, he becomes a powerful sorcerer and attempts to crash the moon into Terminus, thereby ending the world. Unlike the persistent nemesis Ganondorf, Skull Kid only got one shot at being the bad guy. His inherent creepiness (his head shake and rattle is still an unsettling sight to this day) meant that some players were glad to be rid of him, while others remembered him as a worthy, unforgettable foe.

  Zant started out strong in
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  ; a dramatic entrance where he usurps the Hyrulian throne and banishes not one but two princesses. He has an army of nasty underlings and a cool outfit. The primary antagonist in the game, he is the subject of much hype and world-building in the run-up to a much-anticipated boss battle near the game's climax.

 <p>
  And that's where things largely start to go downhill. Zant runs through many guises over the course of the fight, only to turn into a slapstick clown who is easily beaten and whose goofy demeanour is at odds with the fearsome figure seen earlier in the game. What could have been a
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  villain for the ages is instead a huge disappointment.

 <p>
  It's unclear what the design team at Nintendo was thinking when it concocted Ooccoo, as the creature has an unsettling form which still defies description years after
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  's release. The bird-thing resembles nightmare fuel but is a valuable ally for Link, and was the face behind a valuable mechanic in the game; the ability to save in-dungeon rather than having to start from scratch.

  Handy ally or disturbing entity? The jury is still out. As is the case for obscure Zelda characters, Ooccoo (and her even more odd-looking offspring Ooccoo Jr.) made cameos in other games, popping up as a trophy and sticker in
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Brawl
  </em>
  and also an image in the
  <em>
   Picross
  </em>
  series.

  The Mask Salesman seems alright at first, running a stand in Hyrule Town in
  <em>
   Ocarina Of Time
  </em>
  and enlisting Link in a cheerful side quest to deliver masks. By the time he pops up in
  <em>
   Majora's Mask

  , things are very different and he is re-positioned as an important but devious figure who uses Links to do his bidding.

  One of the things that made him so uncomfortable to watch was his abrupt switch in mood when it was clear he wasn't getting his way. The first sign of this was in
  <em>
   Ocarina Of Time

  but then in the sequel he would bounce between politeness, rage and malice within seconds. He is remembered as one of the most distinctive characters in the series, and one of the most unnerving.

  Princess of the Zoras and Sage Of Water, Ruto earns her polarizing status mainly through one key section in
  <em>
   Ocarina Of Time
  </em>
  ; the frustrating rescue mission in Lord Jabu Jabu's belly. A young Link must carry her through one intestinal setting after another, all while battling off creepy jellyfish and navigating treacherous landscapes. Her trademark: "Hmph!" as she is flung to safety by the hero is another memorable audio clip from the game.

  Never one to waste time, she is also enamored with her savior after she is rescued and, despite her young years, declares the two of them to be engaged. The celebrity engagement doesn't appear to last, however, and by the time adult Link travels through time to Hyrule 7 years later, Ruto says her duties as a sage prevent her from bringing things to fruition.

  Like a video game that gets patched with an update only to display the same characteristics that made it annoying in the first place,
  <em>
   Skyward Sword
  </em>
  's Fi is essentially Navi with a modern twist. The living embodiment of The Master Sword, she shares many of the same traits as her predecessor; she guides Link, can offer tips when needed and is his companion for almost the entire game.

 <p>
  And like Navi, Fi has more than a touch of persistence about her, offering assistance even when none is required or the task she set has been completed. When playing the game it almost feels like if Link stands still, Fi will suddenly appear and ask if he needs help with that. While she is vital to the game and has exquisite character design, she is not regarded as the best companion.

  It's not just the characters who are polarizing -
  <em>
   Zelda 2
  </em>
  still crates fierce debate to this day, due to its increased difficulty and esoteric gameplay. Some see it as a robust challenge which sets the tone for future action RPGs, others write it off as a well-intentioned but ultimately frustrating experiment. But it's not without its moments, including one character in particular.

  While Link is exploring the town of Ruto, he encounters a solitary villager who says: "I Am Error." What at first appears to be a bug in the game is, so legend has it, an intentional glitch left in by a programmer as an in-joke among the development team. Error enjoys his own meme status and is synonymous with the game, though he is of no use whatsoever to the hero.

  A talented
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan online has shared their impressive sneaker concepts, transforming the iconic Air Force 1 High shoe with designs based on the iconic franchise. The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community remains extremely dedicated to the long-running franchise, with designs like this showing exactly why that remains the case.

  Since the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise exploded in popularity in the late 1990s, fans have shared their love for the series in various ways. There are tons of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan art pieces online, and with it remaining one of the most popular franchises in the world, it can take something really unique to stand out from the crowd. Occasionally, something special does come along to wow the community, like the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan art that combined Mew with an
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  Xenomorph.
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  is showing no sign of a decline in popularity, meaning gamers can expect to see these types of fan creations for years to come.

  Redditor MelodicWeb2161 shared their
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  sneaker concepts with the community online, and they're extremely impressive. Each uses the Nike Air Force 1 High sneaker as a base, recolored based on the various Pokemon chosen. Importantly, the concepts don't visually show the Pokemon; instead, they manage to capture their essence through color and patterns. Several iconic designs are depicted, including Dustox, Alakazam, and Azumarill, but there are also some concepts for legendary Pokemon like Dialga, Palkia, Groudon, and Kyogre, too.

  MelodicWeb2161 is no stranger to these types of sneaker concepts, having done many popular ones in the past. Back in August, this talented
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan shared their sneaker designs inspired by shiny Pokemon, and it's clearly something they put a lot of thought into. While all of these images are just concepts at the moment, when asked about the possibilities of turning them into real sneakers for sale, MelodicWeb2161 seemed receptive to the idea for any user who asked. Considering how many concepts they've created so far, it doesn't seem as though they will stop any time soon.

  As of right now, there's no official news about when players can expect the next Generation of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  games. Earlier this year, a rumor indicated that
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  Generation 10 could arrive in 2026, although this should be taken with a grain of salt, as anything can change between now and then. In 2026, the franchise will celebrate its 30th anniversary, so it would make sense that this would be a proposed year for Generation 10. It's unlikely that Nintendo, Game Freak, or the Pokemon Company would want such a massive anniversary to go without huge celebrations, but let's wait and see what happens.

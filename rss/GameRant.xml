  Cross-platform gaming has come a long way since its inception back in the early two-thousands, particularly when it comes to connection latency across different video game platforms. However, there are still certain situations where a player may want to learn how to turn off crossplay, especially while playing competitive first-person shooters like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  PC players are a lot more likely to use a mouse and keyboard than their console-playing counterparts and can also benefit from true ultrawide support. Then there's the issue of cheat software, which can give players an unfair advantage by enabling auto aim or making certain textures transparent. Thankfully, console players can disable crossplay in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  to ensure that they're fighting on an even battlefield.

  PS5 players who want to turn off crossplay in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  will need to head to
  <strong>
   the Account &amp; Network menu
  </strong>
  , which can be accessed via the game's main settings menu. From there, it's then just a simple case of pressing the X button while hovering over the
  <strong>
   Crossplay
  </strong>
  option to switch the slider from On to Off.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the method for disabling
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  crossplay is a little more complicated on Xbox. To do so, players should navigate to
  <strong>
   the Settings menu of their console
  </strong>
  and then click on
  <strong>
   Online Safety &amp; Family
  </strong>
  . From there, they should choose
  <strong>
   Privacy &amp; Online Safety
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Xbox Privacy
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   View Details &amp; Customize
  </strong>
  . They'll then need to click on
  <strong>
   Communication &amp; Multiplayer
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   change the "You can join cross-network play" option to Block
  </strong>
  .

      Platform games have evolved from classics like
      <em>
       Pitfall
      </em>
      to 3D masterpieces like

 <p>
  Platform games have been around since...well, sometime after the beginning of time.
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pitfall
  </em>
  turned up way after the likes of
  <em>
   Pong,
  </em>
  but they showed that letting a player leap from platform to platform in real time was a hit. The genre rapidly grew from there, with the NES providing classics like
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mega Man
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  inspiring hosts of other animal-based mascot platformers.

 <p>
  Then 3D graphics came along and literally introduced a new dimension to gaming. Players could now move in all directions, with
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  showing how it could be done to great effect. These games didn’t put an end to the old sidescrollers, as
  <strong>
   some 3D platformers have mixed their multi-directional moves with classic 2D gameplay.

  If indie PC games are anything to go by, people love puzzle platform games. Then, judging by decades of internet pages, they also love cats. By that logic, putting a feline figure in a game can help it catch on quickly, especially if it has inventive mechanics to go with the cat-based cuteness, like in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Neko Ghost, Jump!
   </strong>
  </em>
  In this game, Nekoman has to save his bride, his friends, his family, and the entire Nekoworld from the Space Dog Pirates by running through levels.

 <p>
  To get through them, he’ll have to use two uncanny abilities. First, he can shift between 2D and 3D planes to find new routes around blocked paths. Second, his ghost can leave his body to fight off foes. Players have to be careful where they leave Nekoman’s body though, as it can still take damage. If players can master these mechanics, they can race through levels. The game is technically still in Early Access, but with 40+ levels and a ton of customization options, it already has a lot to offer.

  The Nintendo Switch is a great console that finally lets people take big games like
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros Ultimate
  </em>
  on the go. However, now that the line between portable and home gaming has been cut, some have lamented that there won’t be a place for inspired, mid-budget puzzle games like on the old handhelds. Niche as they were, they could be more inventive than the big AAA games.

  For example,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Crush
   </strong>
  </em>
  was a Burton-esque puzzle platformer where a boy named Danny faces his traumas with the CRUSH system, or tries to escape CRUSH’s virtual world. The story differs depending on whether people played the PSP version or its 3DS port. Both require the player to switch between 2D and 3D gameplay to avoid hazards and solve puzzles. They can even use a 2D top-down view,
  <em>
   a la
  </em>
  classic Zelda games, to find a new perspective with which to progress.

  Speaking of perspective, here’s
  <em>
   <strong>
    Perspective.
   </strong>
  </em>
  It keeps things simple by not really having a story, let alone two port-exclusive stories like
  <em>
   Crush
  </em>
  . Players just have to get their little blue avatar from the beginning of the level to the end goal. It sounds simple, until they come across impassable barriers. To get by, they have to look at things from a new angle, literally.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1005} -->

 <p>
  In 2D mode, players can move about, but can’t change the camera angle. Then, in 3D mode, they can move the camera around, but not the player character. To avoid resetting their progress by hitting the orange platforms, players have to use the 3D mode to find a new, more passable 2D path across the walkable blue platforms to make it to the goal. With each completed level, they’ll come across more tricky dimension-shifting brainteasers.

  Here’s a blast from the past. Today,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fez
   </strong>
  </em>
  is perhaps mostly known for its outspoken creator, Phil Fish, who canceled the game’s sequel and left the video game industry after drawing the ire of gamers. Even with his acerbic personality ("Compare your life to mine..."), he didn’t deserve the mass harassment he received. Not when there are figures in the industry who are still thriving despite doing stuff that makes Phil Fish look like Mahatma Gandhi.

 <p>
  Nonetheless,
  <em>
   Fez
  </em>
  sees Gomez don the titular hat to discover his 2D world has a third dimension, which he can rotate to take new paths he hadn't seen before. By using the power of the fez to rotate the world around him, Gomez can solve puzzles and collect cube fragments in order to bring balance to the universe. Fish didn’t think the mechanics were especially unique, but they were unique enough in 2012 to make it an award-winner, and it still holds up as a solid game today.

  Beyond their mechanics,
  <em>
   Fez
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Crush,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Neko Ghost, Jump!
  </em>
  all have something in common: They’ve all been compared to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Paper Mario
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  The first two entries in the series caught on as popular RPG spin-offs of the iconic plumber’s adventures, but controversially,
  <em>
   Super Paper Mario
  </em>
  returned to platforming, where Mario has to save the very fabric of reality from Count Bleck. To do that, Mario, Peach, Bowser, and Luigi had to jump along a 2D plane through various worlds in search of Pure Hearts and helpful partners called Pixls for special abilities.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  One such ability lets them shift into a 3D plane to find hidden routes and objects behind the 2D terrain, but if they stay in 3D too long, they’d take a hit. They could unlock the ability to go 3D for as long as they liked, though by then the game was basically over, and outside the hidden goodies, there wasn't a lot to see. That's why some fans still prefer the original RPG gameplay of
  <em>
   Paper Mario
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.
  </em>
  Still,
  <em>
   Super Paper Mario
  </em>
  is a fun game in its own right, and pretty dark for a
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game too.

  For a while, Nintendo kept Mario’s 3D games and 2D games separate, with the former being all about getting Stars and Shines as in
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  , and the latter about hitting the end-level flagpole, a la
  <em>
   New Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  . Then they got creative, with
  <em>
   Super Mario Galaxy
  </em>
  mixing 3D roaming with the odd 2D-style segment.
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D Land
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World
  </em>
  did the same by letting Mario and co. move up, down, and all around in search of that last flagpole.

  Even with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario Odyssey
   </strong>
  </em>
  changing things around, it still managed to fit in some 2D segments for players to traverse to grab those moons. They usually came in the form of pipes that would turn Mario into an 8-bit mural, where he'd run and jump over foes and hazards like it was 1985 again. As such, players still had to put those old-school jumping skills to the test, as they couldn’t rely on Cappy to extend Mario’s jumps like they could in the 3D overworld.

  All the classic
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  games could find a place on this list, as basically all the marsupial’s levels involved running and jumping either left and right, or into and away from the screen. The character lost his mojo when he went full 2D for handheld games like
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure,
  </em>
  or full 3D like
  <em>
   Crash of the Titans,
  </em>
  but those games had more issues than their dimensions. This is why the series went back to basics by remaking the classic games into the
  <em>
   N.Sane Trilogy
  </em>
  .

  The remakes were enough of a success to get a new sequel in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Crash, Coco, Tawna, Dingodile, and Dr. Cortex’s multiversal platforming offered longer, larger levels where players really had to master the game’s 2D/3D gameplay and unique power-ups, especially when they had to beat its increasingly difficult 2D Flashback levels, or its flipped and filtered 3D N.Verted mode. Players could also ignore them and beat the game normally, though if they wanted to 100% the game, they had to beat everything it included.

  After years of experimenting with one 3D style of gameplay or another, often to questionable results,
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  found a solid 3D niche with the Boost formula. It was basically the same into-screen/out-of-screen, left/right mix of 2D and 3D platforming that
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  did. The difference was that, in this case, the levels were much longer to fit Sonic’s high-speed runs, jumps, rail switches, and more. It made
  <em>
   Sonic Unleashed
  </em>
  a half-decent game, and
  <em>
   Sonic Colors
  </em>
  a fun time on the Wii.

  However, it arguably peaked with
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  , where Modern Sonic’s mix of 2D and 3D levels mixed with Classic Sonic’s exclusively 2D gameplay. The controls were more intuitive, complete with better drifting and levels. Still, it did have some rough points, like the dull final boss.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sonic X Shadow Generations
   </em>
  </strong>
  brought the game back, warts and all, but threw in a new campaign for Sonic's edgy rival Shadow, which refined the Boost formula with exclusive power-ups, levels, and bosses.

      <title>7 Horror Games That Are Great Despite Frustrating Combat</title>

  Horror games provide some of the most enthralling, atmospheric experiences players can find on the shelves today. Few genres have the same attention to tension and tone as horror titles, with the intended feeling often being one of suspense, dread, or simple, outright terror. Even among the many subgenres within horror that exist today, such as survival horror or psychological thrillers, the best games available will instill players with this unsteady feeling they can't quite put words to.

  Horror games are not usually known for their combat, but the aforementioned survival horror format does tend to give players a few more tools at their disposal. Between the many options of horror games available for players, however, there are some absolute gems that stand out beyond the rest. Unfortunately, among these gems, there are some titles that will nail their setting and atmosphere, but fall short where combat is concerned.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  series is known for many things. It holds one of the most disappointing cancelations of all time as a badge of honor, it essentially rewrote the rules for atmospheric horror games on consoles, and it created one of the most iconic horror settings in any medium.

 <p>
  What it did not do, unfortunately, was revolutionize combat. Combat in
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  is slow and clunky, and while this does make the many enemies in game more of a threat, it also can frustrate the player simply trying to navigate an area of the town.

  While the remade
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2

  controversially decided to revamp the game's combat, causing fans to stir at the faithfulness of this project overall to one of the best horror games of all time, the original
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  's combat, while innovating on its predecessor, left much to be desired.

 <p>
  There were a few different weapons in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2

  , most of them improvised but effective in the right contexts, but the game's clunkiness and occasional lack of hitbox detection made combat still less of a hit and more of a miss.

  <em>

  is a gem of a horror title, serving as the inspiration for
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  and, funnily enough, also being one of those rare video games that falls into the category of being a successful movie tie-in, being based on a Japanese horror film of the same name.

  The turn-based combat is reliable, but often incredibly difficult to the point of frustration, and enemies often appear out of nowhere that are well beyond the party's current capabilities.

  Koudelka is a fantastic horror JRPG, celebrating the works of Gothic masters like Mary Shelley and the eldritch stories of Lovecraft. It's a unique JRPG in so many ways, and so is its subsequent series,
  <em>
   Shadow Hearts
  </em>
  , with each title hosting multiple endings and an overarching story of mysticism and occult magic.

  Another opus of the horror genre, Resident Evil 2 and its predecessor were as influential as
  <em>
   Silent Hill

  in bringing horror to an entirely new medium, beginning a franchise that would host some of the best survival horror games of all time within its ranks.

  The combat in this game does miss the mark however, with fighting generally feeling clunky and unsatisfying. Unlike the previous title, combat is more frequent in this game, and this draws more attention to the ways that it falls short.

  <em>

  is a game with a fantastic premise, and to an extent, the execution of this premise matches suit, giving players a grim, stark environment they're forced to navigate both sober and also while hopped up on dangerous hallucinogens.

  But this solid, unconventional title has weightless combat that fails to leave an impression - even if combat isn't the core focus of the game, it's unavoidable for the most part, and players will find themselves frustrated with how ineffective virtually all forms of combat feel in this title.

  Perhaps some of the most iconic characters in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania
   </strong>
  </em>
  DLC are the bosses you face on your way to Dracula's throne room. From the likes of the Giant Bat that welcomes you into the castle walls, to the motley duo of Slogra and Gaibon poised to stop you with their tag-team attacks, they're all represented in some way in the expansion.

  To progress through the castle, you'll need to defeat them. Not all at once, mind, as that pesky Red Death is always on standby to stop a run after 30 minutes. No, instead you'll use them to open gates and warp between the different regions, thereby unlocking secret characters and their various weapon sets a little bit more easily. To help you keep track of who you've beaten at least once, here is a

  So far, there are a total of 15 runes in
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania
  </em>
  that contain the bosses you encounter on your trip through Dracula's Castle. To summon them, you need only walk over the rune until you see an exclamation mark. The enemy should then appear above you, and upon their defeat, they'll always drop at least one chest. Sometimes, however, they drop a second item that can be handy for progression.
 </p>

 <p>
  Many of these are optional, but you may find that beating them unlocks a new weapon for you to evolve, and thus more characters to use in your next run. Beating some of these bosses requires you to dodge their attacks, which will flash on the screen. They're relatively easy to avoid so long as you keep moving. You also don't need to stick around the same area as the boss will follow you, and you can have more than one rune active at the same time. Just make sure you don't lose track of where they are, otherwise, you could bump into them and take damage; or worse, lose out on valuable treasure after they perish.

  It should be noted that these bosses are separate from the enemies such as Bugbears, Medusas, or Malphas, who appear after a set amount of time has passed. Those foes, while also iconic
  <em>

  bosses in their own right, are the

  equivalent of the checkpoint foes you'll encounter as the clock ticks ever onward. Below you'll find a list of all the

  Shotguns are one of the most popular forms of weaponry in the open-world western
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  , known for their ability to fire multiple shots in short succession. They are generally quick to reload, but do not hold large magazines.

 <p>
  There are five shotguns players can acquire in
  <em>
   Red Read Redemption

  , each with its own benefits, whether that be unlocking achievements or improving a player's combat abilities. Four of these are available in the main game, with clear favorites emerging among fans of the game for their reliability and reload speeds. This list focuses on the firing capacity of each gun and their uses in combat scenarios.

 <p>
  While the Blunderbuss is an excellent weapon for killing the undead, it is limited to the
  <em>
   Undead Nightmare
  </em>
  DLC and cannot be used in regular singleplayer mode, so players of the base game won't be able to enjoy the benefits of this one.

 <p>
  The Blunderbuss can kill any undead in one shot, and can even kill multiple undead at a time if they are close together. Even fired against humans, it has high power, making it a worthwhile weapon to have. That said, the slow reload speed means players should be mindful of when they shoot and plan their movements in advance.

  Most players wouldn't go out of their way to get the sawed-off shotgun. It is extremely powerful, but at the expense of accuracy. Not to mention, with its small capacity, reloading can become an issue too. However, some players do recommend using two at once, which eases the reload issue and creates a very powerful set up.

  This definitely isn't the most accurate weapon in the game, but it can be very powerful, especially at close range. With its ability to spray fast, it can be perfect for intense combative scenarios, especially for those seeking multiple kills in one swoop. Fans of the game often recommend this gun for more experienced players, arguing it takes some getting used to before mastering the perfect shooting style.

 <p>
  This gun can be purchased from the Gun Merchant, who can be found at Escalera. The base price is $1000, but this can be halved with high honor, and reduced even further to $250 if players are wearing the Savvy Merchant Outfit. At that price, it's definitely worth purchasing the Semi-auto shotgun.

  In particular, the double-barrelled shotgun is great for firing at moving targets, giving players the option of firing both bullets at once by simply double tapping the trigger. Of course, this means they'll have to reload immediately, but with its moderate reload rate, this isn't too inconvenient.

 <p>
  Players can acquire this gun in a number of ways. They'll receive the gun after killing Spike Haggerty in the main game, Philip Ross in a side-mission, or after saving the deputy at the Tesoro Azul hideout. It can also be purchased in Armadillo, with the initial price of $300 halving or quartering, depending on the player's fame or honor.

  The pump-action is a fan favorite for lots of reasons. Its power makes it a great defensive tool for beginners, but its average reload speed and range don't make it overpowering either. Players have remarked on the cinematic quality of using this gun, with an immersive sound effect.

 <p>
  The pump-action also has the biggest ammunition capacity of any
  <em>
   Red Dead
  </em>
  shotgun, with an impressive 6 bullets per round. Sadly, it's the last weapon players will unlock in the game's single player mode, but it is well worth obtaining for its superior qualities.

  Most players will obtain this gun during the mission 'And The Truth Will Set You Free' from Dutch's Gang. There's also a chance players will receive it if they kill Edgar Ross, with the option to reload if they don't get it on their first try.

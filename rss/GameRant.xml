  A new expansion for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  means a whole slew of new content for players to enjoy. From new story quests to villagers, biomes, and crafting recipes, players certainly get their money's worth with every paid expansion that Gameloft releases. Naturally, new biomes mean new resources for players to gather. Whether it is for crafting or quests, there is always a reason to gather every item you discover.

  Though it may seem strange, one of the new resources is a gem called Pure Ice, which has nothing to do with the quest item that is part of A Story to Tell. Here is how you can obtain Pure Ice along with what it is used for in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley: The Storybook Vale
  </em>
  .

  Despite being solid water, Pure Ice is classified as a gem in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  . There is also a shiny version of Pure Ice as well. Pure Ice can be mined from the large black rocks in all the biomes in Everafter which consists of the Wild Woods, Teapot Falls, the Fallen Fortress, and the Beanstalk Marshes.

 <p>
  In addition to Pure Ice, you also have a chance of getting Star Sapphires while mining in the Everafter as well. If you are looking to farm either gem to have some on hand for later updates, make sure to bring along a character who has mining as their companion role so that you can get extra Pure Ice and Shiny Pure Ice.

  What is Pure Ice Used For?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Pure Ice has several uses in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  . Primarily, it will be used for crafting some of the new recipes added as part of
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley: The Storybook Vale.
  </em>
  Some of the new recipes are as follows, along with what materials are required for crafting them.

  Crafting aside, Pure Ice has a chance to be a daily favorite item for a Disney character, which provides a significant boost to the next level. Finally, Pure Ice is one of the two favorite foods for one of the new critters in Storybook Vale, Dragons. In addition to Pure Ice, Dragons also like to eat Magma. In order to feed them, you must approach them and wait for them to stop cowering before you can feed them.

  <em>
   <strong>
    STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the newest entry in the beloved
  <em>
   STALKER
  </em>
  franchise, has finally been released. As players take to The Zone in order to recover mysterious, otherworldly artifacts, they will encounter the many dangers, both human and inhuman, that dwell within. As a result, it is important that they have the right equipment, with weaponry in particular being of critical importance.

 <p>
  Though there are several factors that can affect a weapon's performance, such as degradation and attachments, each weapon in the game does come with a set of base statistics and there are some considerable differences between them.
  <strong>
   Assault rifles
  </strong>
  are the most common weapon type found throughout
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  and also the most versatile. Whether clearing buildings or fighting at range, assault rifles tend to have all bases covered, and a variety of unique rifles can also be found throughout the game with their own enhanced stats.

  The
  <strong>
   AKM-47U
  </strong>
  is a relatively common and weak assault rifle found throughout the game, most often on the bodies of lower-level enemies. While it can hold its own against some unarmored human enemies, it will really struggle against even the most basic mutants.

 <p>
  Though several upgrades can make the gun better, it is best kept as a backup for more powerful weapons. Reliability can also be an issue for the AKM-47U, but luckily, a replacement is going to be very easy to find.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   AR416
  </strong>
  is a more substantial weapon with a noticeable increase in accuracy. While it might not have the greatest stopping power, the AR416 is still decent enough for an assault rifle and will serve players well in the early game.

 <p>
  There are several unique variations of the AR416 throughout the game, each with improved stats and attachments. The
  <strong>
   Unknown Stalker's AR416
  </strong>
  can be obtained by completing the "Poppy Field" quest, while the
  <strong>
   AR416 Monolith
  </strong>
  can be purchased with the
  <em>
   Deluxe Edition
  </em>
  DLC.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Grom S-14
  </strong>
  is a considerable step up when compared with weaker assault rifles, offering high accuracy, range, and penetration, as well as marginally increased damage. This rifle can be bought from the trader, Wreck, in Yaniv Station.

 <p>
  With a few upgrades, the Grom S-14 can easily carry players through the mid-game, but its style might not be suited to everyone, and its small mag capacity makes full auto mode a big risk. If found, a Grom S-14 can be sold for up to 24,814 Coupons.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   AS Lavina
  </strong>
  is a very solid assault rifle with a focus on penetration and accuracy. It can be obtained either from Wreck at Yaniv Station, or from Death Cave in the Cordon region. If looking for the weapon in Death Cave, keep in mind that it will likely be guarded by a Controller Mutant.

 <p>
  The AS Lavina also has a unique variant, the
  <strong>
   SA-U Gabion
  </strong>
  , which is included in the
  <em>
   Deluxe Edition
  </em>
  DLC and has improved stats as well as several useful attachments. Overall, it makes for an excellent mid-range weapon, particularly against human enemies.

  The
  <strong>
   Fora-221
  </strong>
  is one of the stronger assault rifles in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  , and it has some of the highest accuracy out of any assault rifle in the game. The rifle is most commonly found as a drop from stronger, well-armed enemies such as Ward Soldiers.

 <p>
  Though it may suffer from its poor durability, often requiring repairs and risking jamming at crucial moments, when it does work it is a brilliant and efficient weapon — especially in semi-auto. A unique variant of the Fora-221,
  <strong>
   Lullaby
  </strong>
  , can be obtained by unlocking the Chemical Plant region as part of the main story, and is found in a Journalist Stash in the Army Warehouse.

  The
  <strong>
   AKM-74S
  </strong>
  is a mid-level assault rifle found by defeating reasonably armed enemies such as ISPF guards. With slightly above-average damage, the AKM-74S can hold its own against some smaller mutants, and should have little trouble taking down lighter-armed human enemies as well.

 <p>
  The AKM-74S is known for its reliability and will degrade at a slightly slower rate than some other weapons. Several unique variations of the AKM-74S can be found throughout the game, including
  <strong>
   Valik Lummox's AKM-74S, the Drowned variant, and the Combatant variant.

  This lightweight German assault rifle is arguably the most accurate rifle in the game, and can be found in the Plant Boiler Station area of the Garbage region. Though it lacks the power of some other ARs, the
  <strong>
   GP37
  </strong>
  makes up for it with supreme accuracy, range, and penetration.

 <p>
  This weapon also comes with a scope equipped as standard, though further enhancements can also be made. The GP37 makes for an ideal main weapon, particularly when faced with tougher enemies, including mutants.

  is an elite-tier Special Forces rifle with exceptional accuracy and penetration relative to other assault rifles. It can be purchased for a high price from Wreck at Yaniv Station, or will occasionally be found on higher-level enemies and dead Stalkers.

 <p>
  With a relatively lightweight and compact design, the Dnipro can be great as a secondary weapon for those who may prefer sniper rifles or other weapon types, but it is more than powerful enough to serve as a primary weapon too.

  is the strongest of the AR models in the game and, as a result, is also one of the most valuable as well. With high damage, penetration, and accuracy, the Kharod is ideal for mid-to-long-range confrontations and will be effective against both humans and mutants.

 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  is doubtlessly one of the most impactful games of all time. By sales alone, it has reached a colossal audience, and it continues to impress how much depth there is in a single title, honoring the legacy of CRPGs and D&amp;D campaigns that have come before it.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":275} -->
 <p>
  Players and DMs alike have been taking inspiration from the game to work into their own campaigns, but like D&amp;D proper, a little bit of homebrew never goes astray to help make this game feel more detailed and immersive. The Fighter class, often a mainstay for aggressive, front-on tactics, is already incredibly well-rounded, but these mods either directly or indirectly help enhance the fighter into an even more fearsome foe.

 <p>
  The Fighter Unleashed is the perfect class for those who want to experience
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  as a one-person army. This mod is balanced, but absolutely makes the game easier, giving players fighter-based boons that most DMs wouldn't hand their players for free at gunpoint.

 <p>
  There is a subtler version that simply augments the existing fighter class, so no matter what players are after, the Fighter Unleashed mod has them covered. This is definitely a mod to check out if combat is something players want to coast through.

  Among some of the best fighter subclasses is the Rune Knight. Utilizing powerful giant runes, these knights get an excellent new layer of utility to any party, and the flavorful giant powers are another great feature.

  The Samurai was always an excellent choice for players wanting to take on a flavorful but inherently grounded subclass option for D&amp;D. Many of the additional fighter subclasses had their powers in some way augmented with magic or other sources, but the Samurai is an implacable and fierce fighter with nothing but their sword and wits.

 <p>
  Like Sumradagnoth's other subclass mods, this is a faithful and mechanically friendly subclass mod that doesn't destroy the spirit of BG3, just adding in some more variety for players looking to change their playstyle.

 <p>
  Many massive RPGs such as
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  have embraced the katana, but BG3, adhering strictly to its fantasy aesthetic, seems to miss out on these graceful and powerful weapons. This mod adds several lovingly rendered katanas into the game.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Their implementation is immersive and lore-friendly, and the katanas are so well-rendered that even being outside the game's typical aesthetic doesn't make them feel out of place - this is a great mod that expands the Fighter's weapon variety, especially useful for those who use the above samurai mod.

  It's often said there's a martial caster disparity in D&amp;D 5e - that Wizards grow too powerful at certain levels and leave martial classes like Fighters and Barbarians in the dust. This issue really does come down to what kind of table the DM is running, and it's not especially prevalent in BG3, but for those who feel the fighter needs an extra early boost, this is the mod for them.

  This mod gives players the option to purchase a backpack filled with incredible pieces of weapons and armor, each in three tiers of rarity that denote their power. This means that those not looking to completely sully the spirit of the game can begin with the rare items and work their way up to legendary at their own pace.

  Shields have always provided an impressive benefit to players who can utilize them in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , often Fighters or Paladins, but this mod makes shields more reactive and useful, without completely changing how combat works.

 <p>
  Shields now reduce incoming damage directly instead of just providing an AC buff, and there are plenty of ways to utilize new shield skills in combat, implemented by this mod, that make shields more viable than ever in any encounter.

 <p>
  Many games showcase archers as a thrilling and exciting tactical build, but in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  they're often lost in the shuffle of available options, with no subclasses really honing in on an archer build.

 <p>
  The Arcane Archer subclass mod changes this, giving Fighters an option to specialize further into archer and augment their arrows with magical power. This mod is a fair and balanced adaption of the 5e subclass for players to take on and still get an immersive BG3 experience.

  Rounding out the improvements for Fighters in BG3 is a fantastic Eldritch Knight rework that changes the way these arcane Fighters utilize both their swords and spells in battle. This mod enhances the class in an immersive and unobtrusive way.

 <p>
  Eldritch Knight now borrows minor features from other classes and subclasses to better enhance its utility. An early example of this is that the Eldritch Knight gains spell sculpting, an evocation wizard feature that allows allies to not be affected by AOE attacks.

  To get your hands on
  <strong>
   Resin
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  fans will need to attack the Creaking mob. This deadly mob was also introduced in
  <em>
   Bundles of Bravery,
  </em>
  and you can easily
  <strong>
   find it at night in Pale Garden
  </strong>
  .

  Here’s the tricky part: it can’t be killed directly, no matter how powerful your weapon is. It’s spawned by a block called the
  <strong>
   Creaking Heart,
  </strong>
  so you’ll need to destroy that to get rid of the Creaking.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Every time players attack it,
  <strong>
   resin will spawn on the tree it’s on
  </strong>
  . But, be careful not to get killed.

  Resin’s
  <strong>
   bright orange color
  </strong>
  has quickly made it a favorite for many
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players. It’s mainly used for decorative purposes, and you’ll also need it to craft a Creaking Heart.

 <p>
  Eyeblossom Flowers are a bit different from other flowers in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . This is because they are
  <strong>
   gray during the day and turn orange at night
  </strong>
  . So, if you pick them up during the day, they will give you gray dye, and if you harvest them at night, you’ll get orange dye. This can be done at a
  <strong>
   crafting bench
  </strong>
  . You can craft the dye at a crafting bench and use it to color your bundles or other items.

 <p>
  Players within
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  will be pleased to know their progress won't be lost. The developers incorporated Auto-Save into the game, and that is strictly the only way that the game saves. Lucky for the player, this feature cannot be turned off and is the only way the game will save itself, so there are no steps needed from the player to be able to save their game.

 <p>
  The reason
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  doesn't require players to save themselves is because the game is a server-based game, the server doesn't allow players to save their progress, as it is built to keep automatically doing it as progress is made. When a player leaves and quits the game, the server saves the information with everything about the player onto its memory and waits for the player to log back in to call back all the information that the player had. With this save feature, this takes memory storage off of the player as well to where the game won't take up as much storage on their device or console.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  is server-based, this also works in favor of the player by enabling cross-save. This means that the player can log into their account on their mobile device and complete quests, then return to their computer with the progress they made on their mobile device.

 <p>
  Something that is important for the player to note is that with the game being a server-based game that requires the player to finish what they are doing and then log off for it to save, players will need to be careful of server maintenance. The servers will shut off during maintenance, and if a player is kicked during this, their progress might not be saved as the servers were down at the time they needed to save. It is important to be sure the player logs off about ten minutes before any maintenance happens.

 <p>
  If players already have an Infold Account and have been playing on a PC or Mobile, they can link their PSN account. The best way to do this is to open the options window and click the chat bubble with a headset. Do note that if the player would like to transfer saved data from their PS5 to a PC or mobile device, they will need to contact customer support. That is everything you need to know about how to save in

  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the best
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games in years. Its combat is highly polished, its game modes are enjoyable, and the visuals and sound design are top-notch. However, some new players may not be happy that they need to unlock all of the game's guns and perks before they can use them in multiplayer matches, especially if their weapon of choice is unlocked at a high level.

  Guns like the AS VAL and GPMG-7 don't become available until after players have hit level 50, which can take a considerable amount of time. Thankfully, by utilizing
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  double XP weekends, players can get everything unlocked a whole lot faster. To ensure that players never miss out, the following guide will be updated whenever a
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  double XP weekend gets announced.

   <strong>
    Updated December 11, 2024, by Tom Bowen:
   </strong>
   The third Black Ops 6 Double XP weekend was just announced by Treyarch. It will take place between December 13 and December 16, meaning those planning to take advantage of the Black Ops 6 free trial period will also benefit from the additional XP that's on offer. As always, start and end times vary by region, so players should take a moment to check the table below so that they can plan their schedule accordingly and maximize their gains.

  Una's Lute is found in the Ogham Farmlands, and to get there you'll need to head through the following areas in order:

 <p>
  When arriving in Ogham Farmlands, you'll create an Instance for that area. While they do all vary, Una's Lute more often than not will be
  <strong>
   found in a hut towards the middle of the area
  </strong>
  , usually not far off from where you entered. While the exact distances vary, take either the path up or down depending on which one is open for you through the wheat fields. The first time there is an opening in the wall that heads towards the middle of the map, take it.

  Una's Lute is found by interacting with Una's Lute Box, which will
  <strong>
   appear with a visible green name in the game even when you're standing outside the hut
  </strong>
  . Right by the entrance to the hut will be a checkpoint in case you need to heal, but once you get the Lute it's best to use the town portal and fast-travel back to Clearfell Encampment to complete the quest.

  An
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player pointed out the missed opportunity for Ashe to get a skin as part of the crossover with
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  . Since
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  collaborated with
  <em>
   One-Punch Man
  </em>
  , Blizzard has periodically released cosmetics in partnership with well-known pop culture names, like the most recent with
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Ashe, in particular, was one of the characters that got a
  <em>
   Cowboy Bebop
  </em>
  skin, the team-up that brought cosmetics inspired by the popular 1998 anime to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  . The collab dressed the leader of the Deadlock Gang as Faye Valentine, one of the main characters in the anime who joins Spike Spiegel and Jet Black during their adventures. Even BOB got a new makeover inspired by Faye's ship. Now, a
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  player has imagined what skin could have been given to Ashe from
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Redditor R2d2s_bleeper lamented that
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  didn't announce a skin for Ashe based on June, one of the characters from
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  . The reason for the player's sadness lies in the fact that both characters are voiced by Jennifer Hale, a well-known voice actress who has worked on
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  (Kronika),
  <em>
   Bayonetta 3
  </em>
  (Bayonetta), and
  <em>
   X-Men '97
  </em>
  (Jean Grey). The OP also notes that BOB could have received a cosmetic inspired by the badger mole, a giant blind mammal found in the Earth Kingdom of the
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  universe.

  While some Redditors agreed with the missed opportunity, others noted that June makes only a few appearances in
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  and that Blizzard opted instead for more popular characters. Players may even already know which
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  skins
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  will get, as a leak revealed the cosmetics of Aang, Zuko, Toph Suki, and Appa for Zenyatta, Genji, Venture, Kiriko, and Orisa. One of the highlights is Venture, who, after getting skins a little different from their standard outfit, will receive a collaboration cosmetic.

  The
  <em>

  collab is one of the features awaiting players in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 14. Launched on December 10, one of the highlights is the introduction of Hazard, the newest
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  hero with considerable mobility and the potential to deal damage to enemies. Blizzard also confirmed the start of the
  <em>
   Avatar

  collaboration on December 17, potentially bringing more cosmetics beyond the skins. Other features introduced by the update include buffs to heroes such as Soldier: 76, Ashe, and Baptiste, nerfs to Mauga and Pharah, and the start of the Winter Wonderland event.

  The PS1 proved itself in the RPG community thanks to
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   Squaresoft's support. This was heightened in the
   <strong>
    PS2
   </strong>
   era with unique experiences like
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 10,
   </em>
   which pushed the series, genre, and medium forward with cutting-edge graphics and voice acting. However, it still used random encounters,
  </span>
  which was a real bummer.

 <p>
  Even the HD remaster of the game included them when other
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  remasters, like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  , added cheats to negate random encounters. It’s a shame, but thankfully there were other good
  <strong>
   JRPGs on the PS2 that didn’t use random encounters
  </strong>
  . Let’s celebrate their forward-thinking design choices and rank them based on just how excellent these games are overall.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the hardest games on the PS2 and easily the hardest entry in the series. It was the first to have a modern steampunk aesthetic instead of a fantasy-based one. Players traverse an underground labyrinth, trying to outrun a government that is trying to kidnap a girl named Nina.

 <p>
  Players can enter combat by touching foes in dungeons and then move around on their turn in combat, sort of like a tactical RPG hybrid. Everything from moving to opening a chest to getting into battle ticked up a meter called the D-Counter. Once it reached 100%, it was game over.
  <em>
   Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter
  </em>
  was an oppressive game, but hey, at least it didn’t beat its players with random encounters.

  Players can add two more party members to their team, and gameplay is standard for a hack-and-slash RPG. Monsters run around the zones that players can randomly generate with keywords. Leveling up is also pretty standard and progress does carry over between every game.

   <em>
    Xenosaga Episode 1: Der Wille zur Macht
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the first game in a trilogy that dominated the PS2. Progress didn’t directly carry over like the
  <em>
   .hack
  </em>
  games but there are bonuses to be had, and the story is linear throughout the
  <em>
   Xenosaga
  </em>
  trilogy. The lead role changes between scenarios.

  It all begins with a scientist named Shion who is trying to create a way to fight back against an alien race known as the Gnosis. Then a bunch of religious iconography gets thrown in too. Enemies will litter dungeons and players can engage in turn-based battles once they touch them. Players can go into three-team battles and a majority of the cast can call mechs into battle too.

  The

  series has always been action-based, with the peak being
  <strong>
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Hearts 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  on the PS2. Sora continued his adventures through various Disney Worlds, where he would help familiar characters fight back against Organization 13. As Sora, players could swing around their Keyblade or use magic in real time. Two A.I. characters could accompany him as well, from the standard duo of Goofy and Donald to Mulan and Jack Skeleton in their respective Disney Worlds.

   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 12

  was the second mainline

  game not to feature random encounters. It had similar combat to the first example,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 11

  , which was an MMO. Like that MMO, players could encounter enemies as they explored wide-open areas. Players could target these enemies and then turn-based combat would commence automatically on the spot.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </strong>
  </em>
  will not be featuring the Blood Mage at launch, but BioWare hasn't closed the door completely on the notorious specialization coming back in the future. Whereas it could be argued that the Inquisitor could have been a Blood Mage in secret, the narrative in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is fundamentally incompatible with Blood Magic as a concept. Given Rook's unique connection to the Fade after the events of the Prologue, any use of Blood Magic likely ends in demonic possession.

 <p>
  That being said, many fans miss the Blood Mage as a specialization, especially given its popularity in the first two
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  titles. However, there has always been an undercurrent of ludonarrative dissonance between how the world of Thedas treated a
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  protagonist for dabbling in Blood Magic, versus how it treated other practitioners of the art. Despite Kirkwall being a hotbed of Blood Magic, Hawke was not only allowed to be a Blood Mage, but could even potentially side with the Templars during their purge in Act 3.

 <p>
  In a recent showcase of
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  's classes and specializations, Arekkz Gaming revealed that BioWare was not only interested in bringing back the Blood Mage, but also in finally doing it right. Not having proper reactivity in dialogue and story seemingly bothered the developers, and as such, any future version of the Blood Mage would likely be done as a separate class. Considering that players can refund their entire skill tree in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , this decision is logical from a gameplay standpoint as well.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  has no confirmed DLCs or expansion packs, it's more likely that BioWare will only do Blood Magic in a future sequel. What separates Blood Mages from other classes in
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  , is that they tend to have a more dubious morality due to the nature of their practice. Not only are its users more susceptible to demonic possession, but its power is used for corrupting purposes such as mind control and demon summoning. As a fantasy archetype, Blood Mages are closer to Warlocks than Wizards, which may justify BioWare's desire to split the specialization off into its own class.

 <p>
  Having better reactivity in dialogue would go a long way towards legitimizing Blood Magic in a
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game, as that was often one of its main critiques, both for the Hero of Ferelden, and the Champion of Kirkwall. It should be noted that while
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  allowed players to make evil decisions,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  was far more restrained in this regard. Though it remains to be seen what narrative freedom will be afforded to Rook in
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  , the return of Blood Magic should only be entertained if
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  players can lean towards the path of villainy once again.

  As part of HoYoverse's marketing efforts,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  has collaborated with many restaurants and brands around the world to create special menu items. The game has unique food and drink consumables inspired by real-world dishes, which many
  <em>
  </em>
  fans have tried to replicate at home. It only makes sense for
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  to let people experience its culinary offerings in creative ways.

 <p>
  Recently,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  announced a collaboration with McDonald's in the United States. From September 17 to 29, fans can purchase the "Genshin Impact Apple Pie" and "Genshin Impact Deluxe McCrispy Meal" via the McDonald's app, which will also include Primogems and other in-game rewards. The collab is a simple way to enjoy good food and gain limited-time rewards, but many fans seemed to agree that it might not be on-brand for
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . However, it would have fit
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  quite well.

  When
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's McDonald's collaboration was first announced, it was surprisingly met with a lot of skepticism from many fans. While this isn't the first time that the game had a collab with a popular restaurant chain, as
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  previously partnered with KFC and Pizza Hut, people online didn't seem sold on the food offerings and perks. On the other hand, there were still some who were excited about getting the special cosmetics which were previously only available in select countries.

  Meanwhile, one HoYoverse title definitely matches the modern vibe of McDonald's, and that is the futuristic action RPG
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero.
  </em>
  Set in the bustling city of New Eridu,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  features a number of restaurants offering various types of ramen and coffee. Fans can expect more establishments to appear in future updates, just like the Outer Ring's Cheesetopia in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  Version 1.2.

 <p>
  This makes
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  the perfect HoYoverse title to have a food collaboration next, especially with a modern brand like McDonald's. The caveat is that
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  still has a limited selection of food items, so if it were to collaborate with McDonald's in the future, it would have to have consumables inspired by fried chicken, burgers, and apple pies. At this point, it makes a lot of sense for
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  to come out with special ramen and coffee collaborations that come with in-game rewards in the near future.

  Shortly after its release,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  caught the attention of many fans with a collaboration with
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  , which is also the game that inspired the HoYoverse title's combat mechanics. It also collaborated with the YouTube-popular Lofi Girl to produce lofi versions of
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's tracks. So far, this shows a lot of potential for HoYoverse to come up with unique
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  collaborations beyond food partnerships.

  With its heavy focus on technological advancements, it only makes sense for

  to do a collaboration with tech brands for a custom collection. Recently,
  <em>

  </em>
  revealed that it partnered with Logitech to release limited-edition gaming peripherals, starting off with Lightspeed mice with designs inspired by characters like Kamisato Ayaka and Sayu.
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  could take a similar direction to spotlight certain Agents.

  <em>

  November 19 will mark
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  's 26th anniversary. Valve's first-ever game is still widely touted as one of the most seminal first-person shooters in the history of gaming. One of the final things that Valve was working on over the course of its development was PvP multiplayer, which the company was ironing out until the very last moment.

 <h2 id="half-life-beta-build-containing-cut-level-leaks-online">
  Half-Life Beta Build Containing Cut Level Leaks Online
 </h2>
 <p>
  A testament to these efforts has now emerged online in the form of a
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  beta build uncovered by game researcher Frogsnatcher. This pre-release version of the game was found on an old CD dated October 20, 1998, suggesting the build predates the shooter's commercial debut by roughly one month. The disc itself has "net test 2" written on it in a sharpie pen, which indicates that this beta was primarily geared toward ironing out the game's multiplayer features right before Valve hit it big with
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  . That notwithstanding, one of the biggest differences between the leaked beta and the finished product has nothing to do with multiplayer, but a cut single-player level called The Communications Center.

 <p>
  The Communications Center was envisioned as the original version of Forget About Freeman,
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  's Chapter 13. According to past reports, this map was designed by Valve engineers John Guthrie and Kelly Bailey. Its beta version is mostly static, except for a large radar dish that was scripted to turn. Other levels from the leaked build also have some scripting differences compared to the finished product, though they are largely inconsequential, Frogsnatcher reports.

  Leaked Half-Life Beta Build Comes With a Time Bomb
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although Frogsnatcher already shared a dump of the game's 1998 beta disc, playing it is not a straightforward affair. This is largely because the beta comes with some time-bomb code that prevents it from being activated past a certain date. Frogsnatcher said that this was easy enough to side-step by setting their system date to any day during October 1998. According to some other early reports from fans who gave the build a go, the leaked beta can only be run in the Windows ME Compatibility Mode.

 <p>
  Frogsnatcher has also uncovered some unused textures in the net test, with most of them being of the weapon variety. E.g., the beta build's crossbow looks slightly different, on account of having a different bolt-mounting mechanism. The researcher also discovered a static model of Stukabat, a flying alien enemy that was cut from the original
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  near the end of the game's development.

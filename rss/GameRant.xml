      <title>PlayStation Store Adopts Popular Steam Feature in New Update</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/playstation-store-reviews-new-update/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Sony is now allowing PS4 and PS5 users to leave written reviews up to 4,000 words on the
  <strong>
   PlayStation Store
  </strong>
  as part of a new update, similar to other digital storefronts such as Steam. Previously, the PlayStation Store only allowed users to leave a rating of up to 5 stars for games they owned. While that feature is still available, users now have the ability to leave longer, more in-depth written reviews along with their star rating.

  This feature couldn't have come at a better time for PlayStation fans, as tons of exclusives, AAA hits, and standout indie titles have been making waves across PS4 and PS5 this year.
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  launched earlier this month, receiving rave reviews from critics, while
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  cemented itself as a Game of the Year contender back in June, and now PS Plus subscribers have
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  to check out. The critically acclaimed sequel from Remedy was released in 2023, but is now available for all PS Plus subscribers to claim alongside
  <em>
   Cocoon
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Goat Simulator 3
  </em>
  .

  PlayStation Store Update Adds Written Reviews
 </h2>
 <p>
  Thanks to its regular updates, huge sales, and handy features, Steam has become one of the most popular storefronts for PC users. Now it looks like Sony is taking a leaf out of Valve's book, as a new update to the PlayStation Store now allows users to write game reviews instead of simply rating them out of 5 stars. As of writing, the feature is only available on the web-based storefront, but there's a chance that it will roll out to the console version in the near future. Those who own a game digitally through the PlayStation Store can leave a written review of up to 4,000 words, as well as a title for the review, the usual star rating, and even mark a spoiler warning if applicable.

  The ability to leave written reviews is a feature that will greatly benefit those on the fence about a certain game. While looking at a game's star rating is handy, reading reviews for new games like
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  allows users to understand the finer details of a release and ultimately decide if a title is worth their money. Although the feature has only been available for a couple of days now, players are already leaving tons of reviews, particularly for the newly released
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  . One user said they are "dreading" completing it, as they know nothing will ever come close to it. While another said
  <em>
   Yotei
  </em>
  "outshines" its predecessor, referring to
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  .

  For anyone who hasn't yet purchased a PlayStation console, now is the perfect time to grab Sony's flagship console, as a new PS5 model has just hit shelves with significant visual upgrades. PlayStation has ditched the glossy center piece of the console in favor of a matte finish, something fans have been requesting for years now, due to the constant fingerprints left behind with the glossy finish. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition is also approximately 4.23 ounces lighter than its predecessor, but the downside is that it has less storage space.

  <li>
   Loot: Mythic High Stakes Shotgun
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Jason Voorhees is the central antagonist of the Friday the 13th franchise, and he's made his stalking grounds that of Creepy Camp, the former location of the Resistance Base.
  <strong>
   Jason Voorhees can be found lurking around Creepy Camp
  </strong>
  , a POI that's very reminiscent of Jason's own home, Camp Crystal Lake. Jason will walk around the POI and will instantly become aggressive if he sees you, so it's best to shoot at him first. Jason will only walk towards you and swing a machete, which deals around 25+ Damage per hit. While Jason's walk is fairly slow, he has so much health as an intimidating and unstoppable force, so be sure to bring plenty of ammo and a Shockwave Hammer to keep the distance.
  <strong>
   Upon defeat, Jason drops the Mythic High Stakes Shotgun
  </strong>
  , which can deal a whopping 191 Damage per shot!

 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Mother of Thorns is located in the Thorny Throne landmark
  </strong>
  , which is just west of Supernova Academy. While Mother of Thorns might spawn on a rare occasion at Freaky Fields, she's more often than not going to be found on the Thorny Throne. At this location, players will hear 'Demons' from Doja Cat's Scarlet album, and then they will need to approach her at the throne to challenge her to a fight. The Mother of Thorns is a typical boss with not much health to worry about, so just bring ammo and shields to wipe her out, and be mindful of her Thorn Ripper, which deals melee damage and can pull you in.
  <strong>
   After defeating the Mother of Thorns, she will join you as an ally, and she will drop the Thorn Ripper
  </strong>
  , which is essentially the Chains of Hades from Chapter 5 Season 2. The Thorn Ripper can pull enemies towards you for 60 Damage, and each strike deals 50 Damage, except for the final slam, which deals 80 Damage.

  Originally released in 1992,
  <em>
   Steel Empire
  </em>
  —also known as
  <em>
   Koutetsu Teikoku
  </em>
  in Japan—is a Sega Genesis classic developed by now-defunct Tokyo-based studio HOT・B. The side-scrolling arcade shooter made its way to the Game Boy Advance and 3DS in 2004 and 2014, respectively. Japanese studio Medius remastered it for PC in 2018. Six years later, the company partnered with German publisher ININ Games on another version for the Switch, which expanded on its PC counterpart enough to warrant a new name:
  <em>
   The Legend of Steel Empire
  </em>
  .

  The Legend of Steel Empire Debuts on PlayStation Consoles
 </h2>
 <p>
  This latest and greatest version of the arcade shooter has expanded beyond Nintendo's hybrid console, making its way to the PS4 and PS5. As of October 9,
  <em>
   The Legend of Steel Empire
  </em>
  is available on the PS Store for $24.99, matching its eShop price. Roughly 24 hours into its release, the PlayStation port holds an impressive 4.73-star player rating, though based on just 15 reviews. The small sample size indicates that the day-one sales of
  <em>
   The Legend of Steel Empire
  </em>
  's PlayStation version were in the hundreds rather than thousands.

  <em>
   The Legend of Steel Empire
  </em>
  lets players choose between piloting a nimble Striker plane or a more heavily armored Zeppelin with aerial mines. The machines are capable of firing from both the front and rear, making for some rather chaotic fights. Screen-clearing bombs—a staple of side-scrolling shmups—are also part of the package, together with a setting that blends steampunk and dieselpunk influences.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Legend of Steel Empire
  </em>
  features some distinctive presentational qualities. Its story is framed like an old war film, depicting a military dictatorship—the titular Steel Empire, also known as the Motorheads—enslaving most of humanity. The only nation resisting its rule is the Antarctica-based Republic of Silverhead. Though vastly smaller, Silverhead is technologically superior, making it a target for destruction. The Steel Empire, still reliant on coal- and steam-powered technology, views Silverhead’s atomic energy and other advanced capabilities as a threat that could inspire and catalyze global resistance.

  The remaster expands on
  <em>
   Steel Empire
  </em>
  with the introduction of a leveling system paired with level scaling, placing an RPG twist on the classic side-scrolling shoot-em-up formula. Its arrival marks the end of the game's Nintendo Switch console exclusivity, which started in late January 2024. There are currently no indications that
  <em>
   The Legend of Steel Empire
  </em>
  will be coming to more platforms in the foreseeable future.

      <title>All Free Fortnite Skins in October 2025</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/all-free-fortnite-skins-available-now/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There are more than 2,000 skins in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Some are based on fan-favorite fictional characters like Spider-Man, Lara Croft, and Goku, while others allow players to take on the appearance of real-world icons and celebrities. Unfortunately, most of the game's skins will need to be purchased using V-Bucks, although there are opportunities to get free
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins from time to time.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <p>
  The following guide contains a list of all of the free
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins that are currently available, as well as information on how players can unlock them and the deadlines for doing so. We'll update it whenever more free skins become available, so it's a good idea to check back here every once in a while to avoid missing out on future freebies.

  Free
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins are added to the game on a fairly regular basis, although the unlock method tends to vary from skin to skin. Many just require players to link their Epic accounts with third-party services, while others have their own specific quests. Ultimately, though, the best way to get free skins in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is to play the game regularly and keep up to date with all of the latest news. For those who only play periodically, it may be a good idea to bookmark this page and check back here regularly, as we'll update the table above whenever more free
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins become available.

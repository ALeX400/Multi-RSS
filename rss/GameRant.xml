      <title>League Of Legends: Beginner Tips For Jungle</title>

 <p>
  The Jungle role is arguably the most unique in
  <em>
   <strong>
    League of Legends
   </strong>
  </em>
  with players engaging in PvE combat with Jungle monsters, instead of heading to lanes to farm minions. With how different the role is and how scary the Jungle can appear, it is no wonder newer players find the prospect of Jungling too daunting.

   League of Legends is a game with incredible depth, meaning new players taking their first steps in the Jungle have a myriad of things to learn about the role. Players who are gaining confidence in the Jungle also have plenty to learn and may have missed some vital tips and tricks in their introduction.

  As with everything else in League of Legends, the Jungle is also constantly evolving, and the 2024 season has brought about changes to the objectives in the Baron Pit, which naturally affects junglers most. Junglers will also have to find new gank paths as there are significant changes to the map, especially around the entrances to lanes. Either way, those wondering
  <strong>
   how to play Jungle in LoL
  </strong>
  have come to the right place.

  The Practice Tool available in
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  is exactly that, a tool that should be utilized. It provides players with a safe and controllable environment in which to practice a whole range of skills, which for Junglers includes clearing camps safely and efficiently.

 <p>
  While elite junglers spend plenty of time in the Practice Tool fully optimizing their clears, beginner Junglers should focus on getting used to fighting each unique camp of monsters and navigating to the next one. After clearing the entire jungle once, the player can then reset the game using the Practice Tool UI to go again immediately. As each champion clears differently, this tip can also be used when trying out new Junglers. Even pro Junglers use the Practice Tool to fully optimize their clears on each champion.

   Krugs, Wolves, and Raptors all have one monster that is bigger and deals more damage than the rest.

 <p>
  Certain jungle camps, namely Krugs, Raptors, and Murk Wolves contain multiple monsters that can all be killed for more gold and experience. However, the large monsters within each camp are the most important and should be focused for two main reasons.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  First of all, when large monsters are killed, players receive a heal, which if low, can come in extremely useful. Secondly, if a player doesn't have time to kill an entire camp before they are needed elsewhere, as long as the large monster is killed, the smaller ones will naturally die after a short amount of time. Although the player won't get the extra gold, the camp will now level up and respawn in a few minutes, ensuring the player has a better farm in the future.

 <p>
  Jungle Companions have one purpose and that is to help players farm the jungle. Anytime a champion attacks or is attacked by a jungle monster, their pet will strike back, healing the player for a portion of the damage dealt. With this consistent source of extra damage and healing, there is less to worry about when low on health.

 <p>
  Other than the main benefit of keeping Junglers' health bars topped up, knowing exactly how companions work can be extremely useful. For example, the fact that a pet will attack two times after a player stops hitting a monster means that junglers can start walking to their next camp, trusting their pet to finish off low prey, which is more efficient.

  Learning how to play Jungle is not easy in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , and like learning anything in the game, it is easier when fewer variables are changed. For this reason, it can be a good idea to play easy champions at first while learning how the jungle works.

 <p>
  Tanks with point-and-click-Crowd Control for example can be particularly easy, first of all because they are unlikely to die in the jungle even when invaded, and second of all because ganking becomes a lot more simple. Plenty of other easy junglers exist, and players might opt to play a champion they are familiar with from other roles, as long as they are viable in the jungle.

  The jungle and the map as a whole are dictated by timers, and being aware of when camps or objectives are due to spawn will help in all games. First of all to be learned are the initial spawn timers, followed by how long they take to respawn after being killed, all of which are shown in the table below.

 <p>
  Ganks are one of the best ways to snowball and get ahead, but identifying suitable targets can be tricky. The first thing to do is look for enemies that are either immobile, squishy, lacking Summoner Spells, or pushed up too far. Some champions also have annoying mechanics, such as Vladimir's pool, which make them particularly hard to gank.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  After finding an enemy who is susceptible to death, the next thing to consider is whether you and your teammate have the necessary catch potential, Crowd Control, and damage, to result in a successful gank. In the case of allies who have excellent gank setup, ideally lots of CC, even slippery opponents can be caught.

  Part of the jungler's job is to help their team and this help will often come in the form of ganks. The aim of most ganks is to either get kills or at least force enemies to use key summoner spells like Flash. Unless the enemy jungler or a roaming laner turns up for a counter-gank, a numbers advantage is made which usually results in success.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  However, if a lane is already losing heavily, an attempted gank may turn south and potentially end in a double kill for the opponent. Instead, it is better to focus on winning or neutral lanes, which can provide win conditions for the team. Alternatively, if no lanes present welcoming opportunities or if the Jungler's champion has good scaling, they can prioritize farming and securing objectives like Dragons.

  Other than avoiding natural pockets of vision like lanes, Junglers can switch out their own ward in the shop for an Oracle Lens, which can then be used to sweep bushes for enemy wards. This can be done for free and junglers will often start off the game with an Oracle Lens. Control Wards can also be bought and used for the same purpose, but note that only one can be placed on the map at any given time.

 <p>
  When players imagine a gank, they picture the Jungler approaching from the river or an entrance to the jungle. However, this does not have to be the case, as Junglers can walk into the lane when it is pushed into the enemy tower, meaning there are no opposing minions to give vision. From here they could wait in the lane bushes or alcoves. When the enemy proceeds to push the wave back, lower elo players in particular will not expect the Jungler to jump on them from such a position.

 <p>
  Some Junglers with either lots of dashes or high movement speed, such as Hecarim, can even just run down the lane to begin with and catch up to immobile targets. Lane ganks can also be used defensively. For example, if an ally lane looks like it's in danger, perhaps because they are low on health or without a Flash, players can hover around their tower just out of vision to see if the enemy Jungler appears. They could also wait in the lane bushes of Top and Bot Lane for the same effect.

 <p>
  One of the Jungler's many responsibilities in
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  is to take neutral objectives such as the Dragon, Rift Herald, and Baron. They do so not only because they don't have lanes to farm and turrets to protect, but also because they are the ones with the Smite Summoner Spell. Smite is capable of dealing a large burst of true damage, meaning that if a dragon is at 590 HP and the Smite currently deals 600 damage, the Jungler will secure the objective for their team.

 <p>
  Timing Smites isn't as easy at that, however, especially when the enemy Jungler is contesting. Nevertheless, all beginners need to know is to save their Smite if they know they will be doing an objective soon. Simultaneously, this doesn't mean they should never Smite Jungle monsters, as it has two charges and there are times when no objective is up.

  <li>
   With the enemy's only Smite top, this is generally the safest time to secure Dragon.

   This also applies the other way around. If the Jungler is in the bottom half of the map, take Voidgrubs or Rift Herald.

 <p>
  Knowing when to take Dragons can be difficult for beginner junglers, and as no situation within a game of
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  will ever be the same, it is a skill that simply requires experience. That being said, if the enemy Jungler appears in the top lane, for example, the Dragon on the bot side should be relatively easy to secure.

 <p>
  Alternatively, if the enemy Jungler or their team is ever spotted doing the Dragon and you can't contest, now is the perfect time to take the Voidgrubs or Rift Herald if it has spawned. However, players will still need to take the relevant lanes into account for either objective. In other words, if your laners are dead or back in base and the enemy is pushed up in mid and bot, now would be a risky time to attempt the Dragon, even with the enemy Jungler topside.

 <p>
  While every player needs to know about the rewards for killing each of the Elemental Dragons in
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  , the Jungler, most of all, should also learn everything there is to know about fighting them. This is because not every Dragon fights in the same way, and players should adapt and make decisions based on which Dragon they are attempting to slay. In some situations, it might even be best to avoid fighting a certain Dragon.
 </p>

 <p>
  For example, as detailed above, both the Infernal and Chemtech Dragons can damage multiple enemies with their attacks, so Junglers should be careful to position away from their allies when tanking the Dragon. Additionally, if their current Jungle champion doesn't do much damage, they will want to consider waiting for help to take down the Mountain Dragon, who is much tankier than the rest. Players should be even more careful if the enemy is close when fighting the Ocean or Hextech Dragons, as their slows can enable the other team to pounce.

  Replacing the first Rift Herald, Voidgrubs are the latest neutral objective to land on Summoner's Rift, and how they work isn't at first apparent to new players. At the 6-minute mark, three Voidgrubs spawn and when any one of them is attacked, they will all spawn small Voidmites and attack in unison. When a Voidgrub dies, any remaining grubs gain a shield, so players should always be ready for this. If all three are killed before the 9:45 minute mark, then three more will spawn after four minutes.

 <p>
  For each Voidgrub slain, up to a total of six, the entire team gains a permanent incremental buff that makes attacks burn structures for extra damage. However, if a team can kill four or more Voidgrubs, then those tiny Voidmites will also spawn and run at structures for even more damage. This means that sometimes even just killing three Voidgrubs is good, as it denies the enemy team any chance of killing at least four. The first Voidgrub killed also gives a lot of XP, making it a worthwhile investment for junglers who want to reach level 6 quickly.

  Due to the ability to influence every part of the map, Jungle is regarded as one of the most important roles in
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  . The downside to such potential power is that teammates tend to have unrealistic expectations of their Jungler, so when things go wrong, they are often the first to be blamed.

  As such, it is a good idea to mute the chat and focus on the game, and if players get aggressive with their pings too, these can be muted as well. Thankfully for players starting in
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  , the chat is now set to off as a default, so new players might not even have to change anything. As with climbing in any competitive team game, having a good mentality is key, and players should use every tool in the box to avoid toxicity.

 <p>
  For example, any time there are minions that will die to the tower and no ally is around to take them because they are dead or elsewhere on the map, then take the farm. Additionally, if you gank a lane and both the enemy and your ally die, then it can often be a good idea to push the wave into the enemy tower, as this will deny the enemy and reset the wave. This is a good tip for laners, too.

   Clear the topside of the Jungle, then the bottom side, before performing a surprise Bot Lane gank.

 <p>
  Most beginner Junglers will start on the bot side of the map for the simple reason that two allies from Bot Lane can help out with the first camp, rather than just their Top Laner if they start on the top side. While sticking to bot side starts might be recommended at first though, players wanting to take their jungle skills that next step further might consider sometimes starting top side.

 <p>
  Doing so will enable them to surprise the enemy Bot Lane by pathing down. If players aren't looking to gank, this might still secure them an easy bottom Scuttle Crab, as their opposing Jungler is likely pathing up for the top side crab.

  Each time Ivern takes a camp he sacrifices a set amount of HP and mana, and if he doesn't have enough the action cannot be completed, meaning players will never die from simply farming.

  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  and Marvel have become one of the biggest partnerships in gaming, and recent leaks are teasing even more skins on the way. Now that Chapter 6 Season 1 of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is underway with a wave of big changes, many have been wondering what else is on the horizon. If these leaks are true, then a lot more Marvel content is imminent.

  According to well-known leaker ShiinaBR,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  could get more Marvel skins in just a matter of days, further expanding its partnership with Disney and its various IP. At the beginning of 2024, Disney invested a whopping 1.5 billion dollars into Epic Games. While leaks should be met with skepticism, the combination of ShiinaBR having a history of correct predictions and Disney and Epic Games' partnership makes the arrival of these four more Marvel skins much more probable.

 <p>
  Doom 2099 is essentially the same villain as Doctor Doom, but this version of the Marvel Comics antagonist hails from the future. According to ShiinaBR, Doom 2099 is expected to be available in the Item Shop by December 9, so fans of the villain may want to keep their eyes peeled for a release.
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  fans will be quick to note that this is by no means the first time Doctor Doom has been featured in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . Chapter 5 Season 4 of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  revolved heavily around Doctor Doom, becoming one of the game's biggest Marvel crossovers yet.

 <p>
  As one of the many Spider-Man variants featured in the beloved animated film
  <em>
   Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
  </em>
  , this version of Spider-Man is an older iteration of Peter Parker. In his late 30s, actor Jake Johnson's role as one of Marvel's most iconic heroes was a standout portrayal of Parker, turning him into far more of a charming slacker than depicted in other adaptations. In the
  <em>
   Spider-Verse
  </em>
  movies, Peter B. Parker is depicted in his usual spidey-suit, but he also dons a brown trenchcoat, which would make for a fun
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skin.

  Spider-Noir
 </h3>
 <p>
  One Spider-Man variant that has received the most love from fans of
  <em>
   Into the Spider-Verse
  </em>
  is Spider-Noir. Nicknamed so because of his universe's noir setting, Spider-Noir's unique take on Peter Parker as a private investigator has been a big hit. Out of all the
  <em>
   Spider-Verse
  </em>
  variants, Spider-Noir may be one of the most striking in terms of design. The character has garnered such popularity that there is even a live-action series in the works based around Spider-Noir and his investigations in a 1930s New York City setting.

  Spider-Punk
 </h3>
 <p>
  As the name implies, Spider-Punk is Spider-Man's punk rock counterpart, complete with a spiked mohawk sitting on top of his head. Spider-Punk's iconic and rock-infused character design would make him a perfect addition to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . All the aforementioned Marvel characters that ShiinaBR claims to be coming to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  are destined to be hits among many players, especially fans of the
  <em>
   Spider-Verse
  </em>
  films. From Spider-Noir's black and white mystery-focused appearance to Peter B. Parker's trenchcoat-wearing slacker persona, the
  <em>
   Spider-Verse

      <title>Genshin Impact Players Are Frustrated About a Recent Character Trend</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  players have expressed their frustration at the lack of new male characters, and many fans worry that this trend will only get worse in the coming updates. With the launch of Version 5.3 on January 1, 2025, and excluding the Traveler,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  will have a total of 93 playable characters. Out of the entire roster, 32 are male, and 61 are female. While this ratio isn't too dissimilar to what
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  had at launch, the Natlan era is slated to only feature 3 male characters in its entirety.
 </p>

 <p>
  One of the biggest strengths that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has over other gacha games is maintaining a relatively balanced ratio between male and female characters, and thus casting a wide net by having a diverse cast. However, since the release of Wriothesley and Neuvillette in Version 4.1, Kinich remains the only 5-Star male character to have made a debut in Version 5.0. With Ifa and Ororon both being 4-Stars in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , players may need to wait until Snezhnaya in Version 6.0 to see another 5-Star male character.

 <p>
  As pointed out by Fun_Fee_3435 on the
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  subreddit, it has become a worrying trend in 2024, as the year prior introduced five 5-Star male characters – with many of them becoming part of the meta, such as Alhaitham, Baizhu, and Neuvillette. In addition to the lack of male characters,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has also struggled with assigning them a variety of gameplay styles. After Kazuha's debut in Version 1.6 and all the way to Version 5.3, Baizhu has been the only 5-Star male Support character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , with the rest being different hypercarry archetypes.

 <p>
  While the drought of male characters is frustrating, this has fortunately not applied to Event Banners in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , as Neuvillette, Kazuha, Baizhu, and other male 5-Stars certainly don't struggle with getting a rerun. In terms of negative Event Banner trends, the
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  community is mostly frustrated about Cryo characters being ignored in favor of more desirable elements – notable examples being Shenhe and Ganyu, who have both been absent for over 550 days. The extremely popular Capitano would be a step in the right direction for HoYoverse to address both issues, though it may be some time until he finally gets his playable debut.

  As
  <em>

  </em>
  continues to tease Snezhnaya, the community can't help but wonder if this trend will continue in Version 6.0 and beyond. Many of the Fatui Harbingers are male, such as Pierro, Capitano, and Dottore, but not all of them are guaranteed to be playable. While Version 5.3 is expected to launch on January 1, 2025, players should be ready for Ifa to only debut in Version 5.6.

  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has revealed the release order of Iansan, Ifa, and more upcoming characters from Natlan and Inazuma. Since she was revealed in the early days of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , Iansan has become one of the most anticipated units from Natlan.

 <p>
  Iansan was first teased in 2020 in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's Teyvat Chapter trailer as a warrior from Natlan. For years, Iansan was the only reference players had about the Pyro nation, as no other playable characters or NPCs from Natlan appeared in-game. When Natlan was finally released in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  5.0, fans were able to meet Iansan during the Archon Quest, but she hasn't been confirmed as a playable unit yet. Instead, HoYoverse has opted to release other units like Mualani, Chasca, and Kinich.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.3 will also debut Mavuika and Citlali, so it seems Iansan will not be joining the roster in the next patch. Fortunately for fans, a new leak may hint at Iansan's release window.

  Prominent
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  leaker HomDGCat has shared the character IDs of future playable units, including Iansan, Ifa, and more characters. In the past, character's IDs have reliably narrowed down their release order. For example, a previous character ID leak accurately predicted Chasca, Ororon, Mavuika, Citlali, and Lan Yan's release order until Version 5.3. This new ID list reveals Iansan in second place, behind a character named Kimitsuki Ayano. The latter is a recently leaked Inazuma character teased for Version 5.4. This could mean that Iansan might also join the playable roster in the 5.4 update. The list goes on with Varesa, an unknown character from outside of Natlan, and finally, Ifa.

  While the leak may be encouraging news for Iansan fans, it also reveals that players will have to wait some more for Ifa's release. Ifa has long been rumored to be a future playable unit, but he hasn't appeared in-game outside of some dialogue mentions. Previous

   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  leaks teased Ifa's rarity and suggested he might be a 4-star, but his Element remains a mystery. Meanwhile, Varesa is a surprise new unit that has only recently begun appearing in leaks. She's been hinted to come from the Collective of Plenty, the same tribe as Iansan's.

  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  in the newest DLC character reveal for Mai in
  <strong>
   <em>

  . Mai was considered a possible pick for a DLC character in
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  by fans,
  <em>
  </em>
  though the game's director, Masahiro Sakurai, revealed he couldn't add the character because the
  <em>
   Smash

  series was only for "good boys and girls," a comment that would go down in infamy within the fighting game community. This comment appears to live on in the official Mai reveal trailer for
  <em>

  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  was released in the summer of 2023, effectively taking the legendary fighting game franchise into new territory, complete with improved mechanics and features intended to make it the most accessible and rewarding entry yet. Classic faces like Ryu, Cammy, Guile, and Dhalsim are found within
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  's ever-expanding roster, though the game introduced quite a few new characters as well. Fighters like JP and Manon shook things up considerably, especially due to the new combos offered as part of
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  's Drive system. Fast-forward over a year later, and new fighters continue to be added to the game, with
  <em>

  cheekily revealing the newest addition to its roster.

  The official trailer for Mai, the newest guest character coming to
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  , was released today, and in the reveal hides a possible reference to a years-old joke about
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  . "Mai will teach you all the Shiranui techniques you can handle," reads the caption on Twitter. This brief description is capped off with "This good girl from SNK's Fatal Fury series is coming to #StreetFighter6 in early 2025!" While somewhat unassuming, this "good girl" description may, in fact, be a reference to
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  . Longtime director of the series Masahiro Sakurai claimed Mai would not be added to
  <em>
   Ultimate
  </em>
  , saying the Nintendo fighting game was designed for "good girls and boys."

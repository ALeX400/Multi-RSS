  The combat in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  requires precision and attention to detail. Players are better off playing a defensive role in fights, especially when they are still trying to build up their equipment and armor. Grappling is a great way to get the upper hand during unarmed combat.

  Players can start a clinch whenever fighting with swords, where Henry and his opponent try to force one or the other to submit. However, unarmed fighting doesn't have the same attack; instead, it starts a grappling movement. This guide has everything players need to know about grappling in

  Weapon combat isn't Henry's only option when fighting others. Unarmed combat can be just as useful as an opportunity to avoid killing someone unless necessary. There are also several story moments that have Henry duking it out old-school style rather than fighting with the intent to kill. Grappling in
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  is triggered during a clinch in hand-to-hand combat, and it is a way to put opponents in holds or a headlock to throw them off balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever players enter combat, the camera will focus on their target and an icon showing what direction they can hit from. Players can strike, block, or dodge during fights to avoid taking damage. Unlike offensive attacks and blocking, which rely on timing and positioning, grappling depends more on Henry's Strength level. To grapple, move toward the target and hold the attack button. This is done with the following controls:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   L2 on PlayStation
  </li>
  <li>
   Left-click on PC
  </li>
  <li>
   L2 on Xbox
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Henry and his opponent will grab each other in a test of strength, and whoever is stronger will win the clinch. There are also combo moves that Henry can do during a grapple that will either land a hit, flip his target, or twist his arm and slow him down. Players can also unlock a perk that gives them a chokehold attack during grappling. Henry can then use the opportunity to move in on his opponent and knock them out. Having a high strength stat is also beneficial for Henry in breaking out of grapple attempts.

  Henry's strength can be viewed under the Player menu. The best way to increase strength is through combat and training, so exercise Henry's muscles when possible. There are several NPCs in different towns and areas that will train with Henry. One of the first trainer NPCs Henry encounters is a Nomad named Tomcat, who hangs out at the Nomad Camp near the Semine River.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players walking through the woods and near the roads will eventually come across bandits or vagabonds they can fight. Additionally, Players can visit an underground fight club in Semine for hand-to-hand combat when they reach a certain point in the store. The fight club is a good way to train and try out grappling in

   <strong>
    Citizen Sleeper 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  improves on the first installment by offering varying levels of challenge to players. Now, you can choose how hardcore your adventure should be, thanks to the new stress and death mechanics. However, this added complexity might leave some players wondering about the three difficulty settings in
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper 2
  </em>
  and how they affect gameplay. To help clear things up, we've put together this guide.

 <p>
  In a past interview with Game Rant, the game's developer said, "One of the things I set up in
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper 1
  </em>
  was that the game doesn't really have a game over. It’s only in the hardest difficulty of
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper 2
  </em>
  —where permadeath is introduced—that you can actually get a game over." This shows that permanent death is a key element in how the difficulty levels are structured in the new installment. But here's everything else you need to know.

  In Safe mode, every time you break a die, it turns into a 1, meaning the damage affects the die's pip rather than its slot. However, in Risky or Dangerous modes, a broken die becomes unusable until repaired, with the damage affecting the die's slot instead of its pip.
 </p>
 <p>
  In Dangerous mode, repairing dice comes at a higher cost, requiring more resources like Scrap or Rare Components to revive each die, further increasing the challenge.

  In
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper 2
  </em>
  , decisions can lead to negative outcomes that increase your stress. In Safe and Risky modes, your characters can handle more stress, meaning they experience glitches or death less often. However, in Dangerous mode, even a small amount of stress can devastate your characters, making glitches or death more likely.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dangerous mode also doubles your energy depletion per Cycle. Each time you reset the day, you'll start with lower energy, which eventually leads to higher supply consumption. In Safe and Risky modes, energy depletion per Cycle is not as significant.

 <p>
  Unlike the first installment,
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper 2
  </em>
  introduces the possibility of death, with three distinct ways to experience it: Disabled Death, Revivable Death, and Permadeath.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Disabled Death (Safe)
   </strong>
   : In the easiest mode, your characters don't die, and the story progresses regardless of how you handle challenges. This option is similar to the mechanics in
   <em>
    Citizen Sleeper 1
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Revivable Death (Risky)
   </strong>
   : In normal difficulty, dying results in a glitched die. If you keep dying, you'll eventually accumulate up to five glitched dice.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Permadeath (Dangerous)
   </strong>
   : In the hardest mode, excessive stress and energy depletion can lead to your character's death, causing you to lose all progress and restart the game. However, you can use a save-scumming trick to reload the game and continue from where you left off on a lower difficulty.
  </li>
 </ul>

  The ideal difficulty for your first playthrough is Risky. It offers a balanced experience, allowing you to enjoy the story while feeling the pressure of the stress mechanic. If you're a beginner
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper 2
  </em>
  player or haven't played the first game, Safe mode is a better choice for your first adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  For veteran players who felt

  lacked challenge, Dangerous mode is the way to go. The introduction of permadeath in this mode addresses criticism of the previous installment's easier gameplay.

 <p>
  A Nintendo patent published on February 6 confirms the
  <strong>
   Switch 2
  </strong>
  Joy-Con mouse functionality and gives fans a deeper look into the hardware upgrade details for the next Nintendo controllers. Audiences got an early teaser of this possible new use for the Joy-Con in the reveal trailer for the Switch 2, and a timely patent publication has now unveiled the technological details behind the mouse functionality of the new console's Joy-Cons.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking to build upon the popularity of its predecessor, the Nintendo Switch 2 console will feature many of the same base features, such as a handheld mode, docked mode, and detachable Joy-Con controllers. However, many were delighted to see the first trailer for the console giving a sneak peek at the changes coming with the next generation of the Switch. Thanks to a recently published patent, fans now have an even better look at what to expect with the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a Nintendo patent (via ArsTechnica) filed back in August 2023 and published on February 6, 2025, the Switch 2 Joy-Cons will have a brand-new hardware feature that allows them to be used similarly to a computer mouse. The patent showcases the internal structure of these innovative controllers, which utilize a light source and sensors, similar to optical computer mice, to allow users to slide the Joy-Cons across a flat surface and produce on-screen movement. This gives players the ability to hold the Joy-Cons with the sensor-side down and slide the controller around like a mouse while simultaneously using the familiar face and shoulder buttons, as well as the joystick. Being able to choose between a standard hold and mouse hold means players have more control over how they utilize the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware when gaming, offering a greater depth of functionality compared to the existing Switch Joy-Con model.

  Figures 24 and 25 of the Switch 2 Joy-Con patent show a comparison between the standard hold and mouse hold for the Switch 2 Joy-Cons, while Figures 27 and 28 show how both Joy-Cons can be used in a dual mouse hold or a split standard and mouse hold. The existing Nintendo Switch Joy-Con motion controls are detailed as making a return, along with the new hardware additions that allow for the unique Joy-Con mouse hold functionality. While the patent was just recently published, it is key to note that it was originally filed back in 2023, and there may have been changes made to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons since that initial filing date. As such, audiences should await official details from Nintendo about the functions of the Switch 2 console and controllers.

  With fans gearing up for the big Switch 2 Nintendo Direct in April, this patent publication helps to shed some light on what may be in store ahead of the console's release. Interested fans will want to stay tuned for any confirmed details from Nintendo and other

  Season 1 has been a huge success for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with the update bringing in tons of new players thanks to the addition of two new heroes, a fresh and extensive battle pass, and plenty of unique skins being up for grabs. However, this is just the beginning, as developers NetEase have assured players that they will continue to update and patch the game for many years to come, so it only makes sense that people have already begun thinking about what character changes could be coming in Season 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Season 1 patch did help to balance out some of the most problematic members of the cast, there are still a handful of heroes and villains who feel just a tad too strong for their own good. With that being said, it's time to look at the characters who are most likely heading for a nerf and also consider what alterations could be made to their kits to make them less powerful but still usable and fun to play.

  Compared to many of his fellow Duelists, Moon Knight is incredibly easy to play, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the sheer amount of damage he can deal with his Ankhs does feel a little cheap at times. Rather than trying to follow a strategy to ramp up the damage or working in tandem with the team, Moon Knight can effortlessly melt health bars with just one or two abilities, which has resulted in many people seeing him as a must-pick.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, his ultimate attack has become somewhat of an issue in Season 1, considering that it is capable of essentially instant-killing anyone who stands in the center, which isn't mentioned in his hero details. A slight damage nerf and maybe even longer cooldowns would prevent Moon Knight from appearing in virtually every single match, which it feels like he does in Season 1.

  Squirrel Girl has quickly become the number one Strategist killer in the game, and it's all thanks to her acorns. Because Squirrel Girl's acorns can bounce off walls and cause an AOE damage effect, it means that players can simply hang back and eliminate the entire enemy backline, even if they miss every single one of their shots.
 </p>
 <p>
  This has made her a little irritating to play against, and while she should definitely still keep the bouncing effect, since this is her main gimmick, the AOE range of her acorns probably needs to be toned down a bit. Additionally, her ultimate attack also feels far stronger than that of most other Duelists, being capable of killing full-health Strategists with one to two hits, so nerfing the damage on that would also be greatly appreciated.

  Admittedly, the Punisher isn't wildly overpowered in his current state, but his Culling Turret could definitely do with some small tweaks and amendments. When throwing out his turret, Punisher gains a tremendous amount of HP, meaning that unless the enemy has flankers like Wolverine or Spider-Man, it can feel more or less impossible to take him out from a distance, especially if he's being buffed by Mantis.

  With Invisible Woman now being in the game, some players have even started placing shields in front of the Culling Turret, making it even more durable. He also can't be affected by crowd control abilities when the turret is up, so adding this weakness in would be an easy way to make this ability a bit more manageable during a match. It would also encourage the enemy team to devise a strategy to take him down for good.

  The Season 1 patch made some pretty drastic changes to Cloak &amp; Dagger, despite the healer already being pretty strong before. The biggest buff they received was their ultimate attack now having four charges rather than three, and while it's a small adjustment, it does end up making her a little mindless to play.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than getting the team to line-up and popping the ultimate strategically to heal everyone, it can now just be used randomly since it lasts for so long and doesn't require the same positioning that it did before. Cloak &amp; Dagger also receives their ultimate far too quickly, since they are able to both heal and deal damage at the same time. So, while the other buffs, such as the faster character switching, are welcome additions, her ultimate may need to be tweaked.

  Omega Hurricane has become the stuff of nightmares ever since Storm received her generous buff at the beginning of the season. Not only does it deal a bit more damage, but Storm also receives more bonus health upon using it, which will now slowly chip away after the attack is finished. That's not all, though; despite dealing an absurd amount of damage, Omega Hurricane is an ultimate that players can place wherever they like, rather than it being an instant activation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clearly, the ultimate needs to be fixed; right now, it's annihilating public lobbies, with many seeing it as a prime example of overbuffing. She also acquires the ability a bit faster than most Duelists, so knocking down the recharge rate and maybe even the overall damage output, too, could help make Storm a little more fair to play against.

  The issue with Luna Snow's ultimate isn't that it can make her entire team immune to damage; it's the length of the ability. For 12 entire seconds, Luna can essentially shut down the entire enemy team by keeping her allies protected, and considering that she recharges the technique staggeringly fast, cutting down its runtime would help to balance her out without removing the ability entirely.
 </p>
 <p>
  As of right now, there's a good number of people who only pick Luna Snow because of her ultimate; it's undoubtedly the best of them all, without considering what the other Strategists have to offer. In order to ensure that players don't start calling for her to go through an entire re-work, amending Luna's ultimate so that it's shorter is an easy fix that would make her a lot less overpowered.

   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      The 5-Star outfits in Infinity Nikki provide the biggest advantages in styling battles, but luck is key to obtaining them.
     </li>
     <li>
      Some players favor the look of 5-Star outfits over abilities, making them highly desirable in the visually impressive game.
     </li>
     <li>
      The best 5-Star outfits are Blossoming Stars, Dance Till Dawn, Blooming Dreams, Flutter Storm, and Whispers of Waves.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  , even though each level of outfit provides its own benefits, not to mention visual value, the 5-Star outfits that players can discover and utilize provide what is undeniably the biggest advantage when it comes to styling battles. As a gacha game, the 5-Star outfits that gamers receive without having to upgrade or spend their valuable diamonds are randomized, making it even more of a challenge to hunt down that one piece of clothing most desired by the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  is such a visually impressive game, it stands to reason that players generally favor the look of an outfit, even at the 5-Star level, over the abilities an outfit affords them. Following, then, are the
  <strong>
   best 5-Star outfits in
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  based on their aesthetic appeal and why players should make a beeline for them should they come across them either by chance or in a store. As expected, there are far fewer 5-Star outfits than 3-Star, but upon discovering them, players will want to collect them all.

 <p>
  For players to successfully obtain the Blossoming Stars outfit, they need to rely (in part at least) on luck. From within the Resonate tab in the store, under the Pearpal banner, random clothing items appear, but the outfit is only revealed once the player has spent their Diamonds or Resonance Crystals. Sometimes, the Blossoming Stars outfit appears here. Blossoming Stars consists of nine key pieces. Said pieces include the Starry Splendor dress, the Bloom Together hairpiece, the Starlit Dreams hair clip and the Starry Pathway shoes. The other elements of Blossoming Stars are Imminent Bloom, Blossom Promenade, Distant Twinkle and Blooming Pact.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the evolution of the dress to the pink and light mauve variation (Dreamfall), players must obtain heartshine by completing 185 Resonance draws in the Deep Echoes Resonance Banner. For the midnight blue, sparkly teal and silver variation (Starlight), 235 Resonance Draws are necessary. To evolve Blooming Dreams to the light lemon yellow and iridescent variation (Radiance), players should complete Crystal Poems Recrafted.

 <p>
  The only way to successfully gain the 5-Star Dance Till Dawn outfit is to locate it in the banner Fireworks Prelude, but players should be warned that the appearance of the outfit is entirely sporadic. There are a whopping fifteen separate items that come together to create Dance Till Dawn. Stand-out pieces of the outfit include the Honeyed Melody dress, the Prelude to Dawn tights, the Ceremonial Blaze hair clip, and the Singing with Joy necklace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upgrading the Dance Till Dawn outfit into the three variants, which are Boat, Fireworks, and Nightlight, is purely down to chance and perseverance. Whilst working away at the Fireworks Banner, as soon as 160 Resonances have been reached, the option to collect the additional items for each of the three will present it itself. Dance Till Dawn Boat is a fairy-like, dreamy outfit of pastel pinks and blues with the long-haired Guardian's Oath piece. Dance Till Dawn Fireworks is a muted gold, silver, and striking blue variant with the deep blue Lucid Dream piece. The Dance Till Dawn Nightlight outfit is a statement gold and sparkly light green ensemble with the blonde and green Joyful Echo hairpiece.

 <p>
  As in the case of the vast majority of 5-Star outfits in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  , the Blooming Dreams outfit can only be obtained with a big dollop of luck. Whenever possible, players should enter the Pearpal tab within the store and use either Diamonds or Resonance Crystals to pull each random item, and hopefully, in time, items from Blooming Dreams will appear. There are ten individual components in Blooming Dreams, with the key pieces being the Path of Flowers tights, the Flower Melody dress, and the incredible Wings of Wish fairy wings, which enable Nikki to fly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first evolution of Blooming Dreams is the midnight blue and silver-gray sparkle of Tides, which can be obtained by at least 180 separate draws on the Blooming Fantasy Resonance Banner. For Glow, with a grass green and gold bodice and an angelic gold princess skirt, a minimum of 230 draws is necessary. For Phoenix, Blooming Dreams Recrafted is necessary. Phoenix is definitely the most enticing of the variants, with fiery oranges, deep crimsons, and baby peaches and pinks coming together for a showstopper dress.

  The Flutter Storm is, arguably, one of the most beautiful 5-Star outfits possibly available in the entire
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  game and is like an upgraded Endless Longing ensemble. Gaining access to the base Flutter Storm, as well as the three variants, comes down to pure luck. If players head to the store (any of them), pull down their Pearpal tab, and use either their Diamonds or their Resonance Crystals to pull separate items of clothing, eventually, they will have all nine items necessary for the basic Flutter Storm outfit. Stand-out pieces in the Flutter Storm outfit include the Delicate Wings gloves, the Windhowl Tears earrings and the Fluttering Twist Dress.
 </p>
 <p>
  The stunning Flutter Storm ensemble can be evolved into Dream Chant, Fire Song and Forest Song. To obtain the entirely iridescent and almost blindingly sparkly Dream Chant variant, players need to complete Flutter Storm Recrafted. The emerald green Forest Song variant can be won by sourcing 235 draws on the Deep Echoes Resonance Banner, and the red and orange Fire Song variant requires 185 draws from the same banner.

  's iconic dress, the Whispers of Waves outfit is truly spectacular, and as players will soon see, this ensemble is clearly inspired by the awesome beauty of the ocean. There are nine separate parts that come together to form the Whispers of Waves: The Kiss of the Waves hairpiece, Wave Dance Steps shoes, Pearl Gift gloves, and Boundless Blue Socks. In addition, Whispers of Waves also includes Glistening Beads, Azure Heart, Billowing Shadows, Mermaid Fairy Tale, and Silver Branch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The three evolutionary variants of Whisper of Waves are all as stunning as each other. To obtain the floaty pink and purple Echoes variant, players need to draw 185 pulls from the Deep Resonance Banner, and for the mermaid-style green, gold and light yellow outfit called the Forest variant, 235 draws are necessary. Finally, for the most stunning Whispers of Waves variant, the Phantom, players require the materials sourced from Whisper of Waves Recrafted.

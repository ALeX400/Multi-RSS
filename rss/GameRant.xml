  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  's new Vessel of Hatred expansion has gifted fans with what is arguably one of the most polished and powerful classes in the series in the form of the Spiritborn, which has a lot of potential combos to take advantage of and as many good builds to make. The base game classes in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  got new active and passive skills to improve their arsenals, and while these are good additions, they hardly shake the status quo all that much when taking into account how strong the Spiritborn is. Plus, a lot of players will inevitably gravitate toward the newest class. With several balance issues in the game's past and the current state of the meta, it could be a good idea for
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's next expansions to skip new classes in favor of something else.

 <p>
  Additional playable classes as the game evolves are a huge staple of
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  , so it may seem abrupt to end this tradition after one
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  expansion as the game will get more, but it may be in Blizzard's best interest in order to add more replay value to the title. This could be done by adding two or more subclasses for each class to specialize into instead of a separate seventh class, as it only risks overshadowing all others like the Spiritborn is doing now.

 <p>
  This may be easier said than done, and it's a big change in terms of design philosophy that Blizzard may not be able to pull quickly, so if it ever happens, it may need more time in the oven. Still,
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  's class system could be exactly what
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  needs. Namely,
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  employs a system called Ascendancy that features three specializations for each base class, with the exception of the Scion only having one Ascendancy.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":996} -->

 <p>
  With seven base classes and 19 Ascendancy classes,
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  has plenty of build diversity that makes for an interesting model when paired with plenty of balance updates throughout the year, essentially giving fans a lot of good reasons to come back to the game after a League ends. Since each Ascendancy class provides the base classes with new, diverse power-ups, and not all of them can be unlocked at once, players can potentially make the same character over and over and still have new builds to try. This can't really be said about
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's classes all that much, and subclasses would address this issue in the best way possible.

  Baldur's Gate 3, Path of Exile Are Proof That Character Customization Helps Replayability
 </h3>
 <p>
  As games like
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  have proven, character customization has to be three-dimensional to fully engage fans, and the RPG's subclasses help in that department. The same holds true for
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  , which has had over 10 years of continued support to become one of the pillars of the ARPG genre, but when it comes to subclasses, it still has a lesson to teach
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  . The Spiritborn builds in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  are great, and they're proof that with more dedication, classes can be enough.

 <p>
  However, it's hard to completely innovate on five existing classes with each expansion, with the number growing to six with Vessel of Hatred. The best way to do it would be to add subclasses that offer unique and interesting power-ups, but also force some choice on players, meaning that they won't unlock everything at once. This makes for a great recipe for a live-service title, and
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  already uses the model - all it needs is for some of the series' tenets to get a shake-up in order to offer more replayability. Whether
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's Vessel of Hatred endgame content will prove to be enough to retain players remains to be seen, but this option is something Blizzard shouldn't dismiss.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  's developers are giving players free items as an apology for recent issues they've faced during gameplay.
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  was released in July 2024 and is developed by Starry Studio, which is a subsidiary of NetEase, a gaming company making strides within the live-service gaming world. NetEase has most recently gained attention from
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , an
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  competitor. Although
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  has recently celebrated milestones with item giveaways, it appears that giveaways is also how the developers apologize to fans.

 <p>
  Players have complained about the quality-of-life in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , describing issues with the co-op gameplay experience like frequent lag and a lack of features like cross-server play. Other issues include gamers being forced to create new characters to play with newcomers, making what could be an otherwise enjoyable experience a hassle to get through. It appears that Starry Studio has largely taken note of these problems, specifically those tied to server issues.

  Players are getting server-wide compensation for dealing with lag issues during

  gameplay. Starry Studio released a statement apologizing for the lag many players are facing and a roadmap for its fixes following
  <em>
   Once Human

  's September update. As an apology and to thank the players for their patience, Starry Studio is giving players items including Starchrom, Mitsuko's Mark, Stardust Source, Gunpowder, and Canned Seafood in Oil. The first round of server performance optimizations was slated for October 11, and the next round of optimizations is set to arrive on October 17.

  On October 17, a new PvE scenario is being added, and other adjustments and tweaks will be introduced along the way.
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is Starry Studio's first release, so it may be natural to expect some core issues with the experience as its developers learn to account for and fix problems that gamers don't face in other titles. Alternatively, Starry Studio and NetEase are counting on this release to do well, and the more competitive the market for live-service games like
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  becomes, the more costly issues like these are since they could potentially drive audiences away.

  players had a largely positive response to this new announcement, even if a few gamers have voiced other complaints now that they're aware Starry Studio is listening. Some players want the developer to do away with loot crates entirely, since they find those aspects just as damaging to the gameplay experience, and others just want to see a mobile version of
  <em>

  with crossplay released. The bigger the game gets, the more issues Starry Studio may have to tackle, though it's nice to see players rewarded for pushing through the problems thus far.

      <title>5 Most Stylish Strategy Games</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-strategy-games-stylish-graphics/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Strategy games
  </strong>
  are hardly known for stylish visuals, often relying on deep, engaging gameplay to make up for dry presentation or a complex user interface. Games such as
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   RimWorld
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   FTL
  </em>
  are not typically recognized as stylish experiences. Even hits like
  <em>
   Slay The Spire
  </em>
  are hardly much to look at.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":329} -->

 <p>
  Still, that does not always have to be the case with the strategy genre. Games as far back as
  <em>
   Warcraft 3
  </em>
  have proven that a stylized look can compensate for limitations, often resulting in a superior aesthetic. Games such as
  <em>
   Northgard
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Against The Storm
  </em>
  have been influenced by this, while other releases have struck out and created their own unique styles. Just take a look at titles such as
  <em>
   Frozen Synapse
  </em>
  .

  This unique combination of tower-defense and real-time strategy is a base defense game that's drenched in minimalist style, offering up vivid colors and stark environments to do battle.
  <em>
   Thronefall
  </em>
  isn't the most visually complex strategy game on the market, but it's clear that time and effort were put into developing a unique style.

 <p>
  In the game, players roam a small map and build defenses to protect their keep from waves of enemies. The variety of structures, both defensive and economic, along with the intuitive RTS mechanics (players can also recruit units to bolster their defenses) and diverse collection of perks, make for a strategically deep game with plenty of replay value. All this is to say that
  <em>
   Thronefall
  </em>
  is a stylish indie strategy game that manages to be accessible without lacking depth.

 <p>
  This smash-hit rogue-like deck-builder is better known for its addictive gameplay than its visual style, but there's something to be said about just how stylish
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  can be. The diversity in the pixel-art illustrations of
  <em>
   Balatro's
  </em>
  many cards is one thing, but the consistent and energetic nature of the visual effects makes for a game that's frequently satisfying to play.

 <p>
  Even an interaction as simple as hovering over a card is stylized, as it floats around and reacts to the touch of the player's cursor, and playing or discarding a card can be just as satisfying. This is even before players bring about the colorful flames that come with a high-scoring hand, or simply begin to appreciate the nuance of the game's design, which at first seems so simple.

  <em>
   Cataclismo
  </em>
  is a base-defense game that's simple in its concept but complex in its design, providing a well-balanced experience that's as rewarding as it is satisfying. In the game, players build castles and fortifications using a modular system akin to playing with
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  . This results in a tactile experience that would be fun on its own, but watching as swarms of enemies attempt to bring it all down elevates the gameplay, providing a tightly wound loop.

 <p>
  This game is also a joy to look at, with its subdued colors and foggy environments, both of which contribute greatly to its gloomy atmosphere. The use of flat colors and minimalist painterly textures elevate the somewhat basic shapes of the game's environments and characters, making for a soft aesthetic that's easy on the eyes.

  Grim-dark, Gothic, and hand-drawn are all terms that can be used to describe
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon's
  </em>
  appropriately-dark sense of style. This dark-fantasy strategy game features turn-based dungeon-crawling and RPG mechanics, packed with strategy and layered with Lovecraftian horror.

 <p>
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  is a brutal strategy game, with every one of the player's heroes being lost permanently should they fall in battle. If a hero doesn't fall from a fatal wound, it might just be the stress of the dungeon that kills them, or at the very least causes mental trauma. Depicting this dark and unforgiving world is the game's scratchy hand-drawn artwork, portraying an ensemble of haggard characters and rendering the grim-dark setting in a brilliant Gothic style.

  <em>
   Wildfrost's
  </em>
  presentation almost outshines its unique innovations in the deck-building genre, but not quite. The game's winter theme, dense with snow and fantastical elements, is its cornerstone, which the developers riff on repeatedly to offer incredibly memorable character designs and tongue-in-cheek humor. However,
  <em>
   Wildfrost's
  </em>
  gameplay is also distinctive, with a unique turn system, inspirations drawn from games such as
  <em>
   Hearthstone
  </em>
  , and a pull-no-punches style that's unforgiving to the first degree.

 <p>
  Players control a leader and their companions in turn-based battles across a fantasy world trapped in an eternal winter. Every time a player uses a card, a turn is taken and the counters on each card in play count down. When these counters reach zero, the respective card acts. This results in a system that's tremendously engaging and strategic, but often hard to read. This leads to turns taking more time than they should, as players are forced to calculate the outcome of any given play, and it's not hard to make a run-ending mistake. However, for the most part, the game's cute and colorful art style helps to keep frustration at bay.

  The journey through

  was long, and now you're at the final boss, ready to take it down. Throughout the game, players are subject to the horrors of the town while witnessing reality changing to its rust-covered counterpart. After the reality unfolds, players can get a good idea of what, or who, is waiting for them towards the end.

  Players will encounter the final boss of

  , Mary, on

   top of the Otherworld version of Lakeview Hotel

  After the fight, James exits the arena and walks through a long hallway filled with echoes of Mary's argument with James. At the end of the hallway, players will start ascending a rust-covered stairway. Reaching the top will transform the world back to its relatively normal state with Mary staring through an open window. After a brief conversation with Mary/Maria, she'll become hostile, starting a
  <strong>
   three-phase boss fight
  </strong>
  with her.

 <p>
  The Mary/Maria boss fight in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  is quite similar to Flesh Lips, albeit it does have more phases. After the fight starts, Mary/Maria will float up in the air transforming into a disfigured monster caged in a rusted-iron bed frame. Here's a complete breakdown of this phase of the final boss fight and how to survive it.

  <li>
   Try to keep your distance from the boss and shoot hunting rifle rounds at it. Target the body of Mary/Maria instead of the iron frame of the bed.
  </li>
  <li>
   The final boss will mainly try to get close to James and hit him with its long tendril. It's easily avoidable and if you maintain your distance, this attack won't be a problem.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mary/Maria will send a swarm of moths at James that he can either dodge at the right moment or swing his melee weapon to disperse it.
  </li>
  <li>
   After a while, the boss will turn into a swarm of moths itself and disappear from the arena. Wait for it to reappear and start unloading your bullets in it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mary/Maria will also shriek at certain points which will disorient James for a few seconds.
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>
  After inflicting enough damage on the boss, it will begin to transform its cage into a spider-like creature similar to Flesh Lip. This crumbles the floor causing James to fall into a dark corridor below the arena. This is where the fight gets a bit tricky, as the visibility is low and Mary/Maria can pop up at any location to attack James. However, here's the best way to beat it in this second phase.

 <ol>
  <li>
   James will have room to move around the dark looping corridors as he hears the boss moving around above. You'll have a few moments before the boss appears, so make sure to collect ammo and health items scattered around.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once the boss appears, try using the shotgun to damage it at close range. However, the moths will attack James randomly, so be prepared to dodge/swat them.
  </li>
  <li>
   To predict where Mary/Maria will appear next, players can see the trail of sparks on the ceiling.
  </li>
  <li>
   Try to keep moving around as staying still will let the monster drop onto James, damaging him severely.
  </li>

  After damaging the boss enough in the dark corridor, it will shriek again, breaking the ceiling above and lighting up the arena. As far as visibility is concerned, this last phase of the fight will be a lot better. Here's how to survive this phase and finally beat the boss Mary/Maria in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake

 <ol>
  <li>
   Mary/Maria will now crawl on the floor, in her rust-covered spider cage, while rushing at James to attack. So, make sure to keep running away and shooting it from afar.
  </li>
  <li>
   The final boss will now also attack James with one of its metal legs. It will either try to hit James once or multiple times, so be prepared to dodge the attack accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
   This phase punishes James for maintaining his distance from the boss as it will charge at James, damaging him in the process. As you spot the boss lowering its body to charge at James, quickly dodge out of its path.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mary/Maria will summon the months again to attack James, be prepared to swat them away. There are instances where the boss will send out the swarm first and then shriek to disorient James. If that happens, you'll have a very small window to recover and dodge the attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   Try to circle the boss to avoid its attacks, and keep switching between the shotgun (close-range), and rifle (long-range), depending on your distance from the boss.
  </li>
  <li>
   After inflicting enough damage on the final boss, it will drop to the floor. Now, the only thing you must do is land a final blow with a melee attack or your gun to finish the boss fight.
  </li>
 </ol>

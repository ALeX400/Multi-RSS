      Fortnite x Pixar collab could be as legendary as Fortnite x Marvel, with iconic characters like Merida, Sully, and Woody joining the game.
     </li>
     <li>
      Each Pixar character has unique showmanship and potential for the Fortnite locker, from the confident Merida to the charming Sully.
     </li>
     <li>
      Including characters like Hector and Jesse from popular Pixar movies would add diversity and fun to Fortnite, alongside Buzz Lightyear and Syndrome.

 <p>
  Pixar is set to join the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  family by bringing some members of The Incredibles into Battle Royale. With some characters already set to join
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  from the Pixar world, it would be great to see some more Pixar representation in the Item Shop, especially ones as iconic as this.
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  x Pixar could be as legendary as
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  x Marvel, especially with the right characters on the market.

 <p>
  There’s an abundance of potential from Pixar’s library of characters, whether they are toys, undead, or heroic. Each of these characters has an art style and an iconic showmanship that makes them worthy of joining the locker for every
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  player.

  Whilst she may count more as a Disney Princess, Merida is definitely a character that deserves to join the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  family. Merida is Pixar’s first Disney princess, and armed with her Scottish pride and a bow, she proves herself more than capable as a warrior.

 <p>
  Merida challenges her kingdom and the traditions that bind it, and that makes her more than worthy of having her own spot on the

 <p>
  A large monster seems perfect for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , especially as
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  mares approaches. Whilst Sully is regarded as one of the kinder monsters in
  <em>
   Monsters, Inc.
  </em>
  , his features are still one that can cause some intimidation. It would be rather funny to see Sully on the Battle Royale island, as his huge size and fuzzy coat of blue fur would make quite the skin.

 <p>
  Sully would easily stand out as one of the more distinct outfits, and it would be strange yet fun to see this blue monster running around and cranking 90s, especially with the history players might have with the wholesome Pixar icon.

  Cowboys seem to go hand-in-hand with looking cool with an assortment of weapons, which is exactly why the most rooting and tooting of the bunch deserves to be in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . Woody may be a toy, but with the right proportions, he can bring further imaginations to life with double pump action.

 <p>
  Seeing the toy version of Woody have a full-sized model to run around
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  might be hilarious, but it oddly works in a game where every character is welcomed as an icon. Besides the cool cowboy skin from Woody, having a duo with the likes of Buzz Lightyear should be what it's all about.

  One of the more heartbreaking stories of Pixar’s movies is that of Hector in
  <em>
   Coco
  </em>
  , a man who tried to make songs for his family, only to have them stolen by a richer and more charismatic man. Hector’s appearance in
  <em>
   Coco
  </em>
  is that of a skeleton to honor the spiritual beliefs and culture surrounding Mexico.

 <p>
  Hector wouldn’t be the first skeleton skin inspired by this culture, but it would be one of the more iconic, especially since Hector is a literal skeleton and not just an outfit with face paint. Hector would join the game as a skeleton model which could look great with
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ’s art style.

  Since Mister Incredible, Frozone and Elastigirl are coming to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , Syndrome would make for the perfect antithesis to their arrival. With heroes, there must be villains, and Syndrome deserves a spot to shine, even if his affinity for capes was his undoing, and might get him caught in the turbines of the Battle Bus.

  Syndrome is a smart and inventive villain that has caused his fair share of trouble, so allowing him to play on a Battle Royale island where everyone is super, is the perfect paradise for him to let loose on his hatred for Mister Incredible.

  Buzz Lightyear has the potential to take players to infinity and beyond with his inclusion into the

  roster. Not only is it a great idea to have him join the likes of Woody and Jesse for trio matches, but his outfit and sci-fi aesthetic will really stand out with his bright colors and a clueless grin that remains painted on his face.

  One of the few things you should look out for while building your character in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , other than the obvious damage output capabilities, is how much your character will be able to handle damage and increase its survivability. Whether your character class is naturally prone to survive enemy attacks like the Druids or Barbarians, or a class that needs skills and passives to ensure you make it out of endgame encounters alive like the Sorcerers or Rogues, making sure you don't fall to your death is a priority and should not be left unchecked.

  That is where the Endurant Faith Unique enters the equation. This is a Unique pair of gloves that will make sure that any incoming powerful damage attack does not take your life and effectively give you a second chance to fight back. Today's guide will focus on how you can get and farm the Endurant Faith Unique in
  <em>
   Diablo 4

  .

  You can get the Endurant Faith Unique gloves by reaching Rank 15 of the Mother's Gift Reputation system during the Season of the Infernal Hordes in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  . You will gain access to it after starting the seasonal questline named "Of Lambs and Wolves" with a new seasonal character, with the Mother's Gift Reputation system having a total of 20 different ranks. To get Mother's Gift Reputation, participate in any activity and defeat powerful enemies – e.g. Helltides, Infernal Hordes, Nightmare Dungeons, etc. Here is a list of all Mother's Gift Reputation rewards:

  That said, the Endurant Faith Unique you get from its Triune Strongbox has an item power of 850, so if you wish to get a more powerful version with better rolls – or get it for your eternal characters – you can farm the Unique in the Infernal Hordes endgame activity. Unlocking it will require you to complete the seasonal quest named "The Eyes of the Enemy", which starts after completing "Of Lambs and Wolves" in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  Season 5. Once you do, you will unlock access to the Infernal Hordes and regular Infernal Compass drops.

  Farming the Endurant Faith Unique – along with the other Season 5 Unique items – will require you to open Spoils of Equipment chests by spending Burning Aether in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Aether will drop after completing Aetheric Events during each Infernal Hordes wave, which will trigger when defeating a specific number of enemies. Once you defeat the Fell Council bosses, spend either 20 or 60 Burning Aether to open Spoils of Equipment or Spoils of Greater Equipment chests – the latter needs Tier 3+ Infernal Compasses.

  Surprising even its creator with its success,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Undertale
   </em>
  </strong>
  has led as a smash indie hit since its release in 2015, changing the genre in many ways for RPGs that have come after it. That success couldn't have been more unprecedented, with its main developer Toby Fox hoping the game would stay out of the limelight, wishing for its tale to be experienced by players rather than smothered online for all.

 <p>
  Despite those desires,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  became something of an indie legend. Through gameplay that allowed players to end boss fights without killing anything, multiple endings and more, the stand-out nature of its offerings made an impact on players, streamers, and YouTubers everywhere. Toby Fox's own original audience also played a big part in his success, bringing over listeners of his incredible gaming soundtracks to discover his venture in making

  Selling over 30 million copies, the cozy life and farming simulator
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  remains a smashing success after its release back in 2016, continuing to reach new audiences to this day. Created by solo developer ConcernedApe, this
  <em>
   Harvest Moon
  </em>
  -inspired gem added a new level of depth into the life-sim genre, featuring hundreds of hours worth of content to be enjoyed solo or with friends.

 <p>
  Its substantial success could be for many reasons; finding many new players through streamers and YouTubers playing the game, as well as ConcernedApe's endless love and care for his game that's continually being poured into it.

  is clearly a project made from the heart, and players can feel that while they play.

  achieved a substantial success that many would've never predicted. While the original reached a large audience itself, it garnered such numbers over the span of seven years, with only a few thousand people ever playing at one time.
  <em>
   Helldivers 2,
  </em>
  on the other hand, reached millions within its first week, challenging the servers with the mass number of players eager to fight for super democracy, and taking over the internet with memes and commentary.

  As a cooperative third-person shooter,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  found much of its success with simple, pure luck. Reaching audiences at the right time with the opportunity to use online mulitplayer with friends, or to meet new people. The core gameplay loop is addictive as ever too, delivering different sized missions for players to hop into no matter their busy schedule.

  With minimalist artwork and addictive but simplistic gameplay,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Vampire Survivors
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a gaming success story that players never would've expected. Created by just the solo developer poncle, this rougelite project began with a few open-levels and reused assets, a handful of abilities, and waves of enemies that progressively get harder. Surviving to the half hour mark is the only objective, delivering a concept that sounds bare but, in practice, proves to be one of the most replayable games of its kind.

 <p>
  Much of
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors'
  </em>
  success is owed to the streaming community, with streamers sharing the game to their different numbers and varieties of audiences, and ultimately pushing the viewer to pick it up and start a run of their own. The low price tag is another reason that so many mass viewers were quickly turned into players themselves, with such little cost to get hooked on
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  for life.

  Created by the small team at Mobius Digital,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Outer Wilds
   </strong>
  </em>
  quickly became a success beyond any scope imaginable, launching in 2019 to a fan base now praising it as one of the greatest indie games of all time. With just two previous projects made by the studio, a mobile exploration game called
  <em>
   Beacon 38
  </em>
  and a puzzle RPG called
  <em>
   Terra Chroma,
  </em>
  the incredibly unprecedented reception for
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  can't be understated.

  As an interstellar adventure that stands out for its incredibly rich storyline and lore, all packed into an open-world that can be explored in any order,
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  delivers a pretty much faultless experience for players. Through puzzle-solving, secret hunting, world building and diverse characters, it's no surprise that once this hidden gem was discovered, it soon reached millions. Reaching those heights as a small studio with little else behind them is a feat that certainly does make the success of
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  a completely and utterly surprising success story.

  Coming out of Early Access as a complete surprise success,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Deep Rock Galactic
   </strong>
  </em>
  has swiftly become a number one multiplayer game for many over the years, delivering on aspects that gamers had been yearning for long before it arrived. Standing out with a unique identity through dwarven character designs and fun catchphrases like
  <em>
   "Rock and Stone!"
  </em>
  , the Ghost Ship Games team immediately captured players through a concept that's bizarre and memorable in the best way possible.

 <p>
  That's not all though. The consistent combat, co-operative play, and procedurally generated caves and missions allow a new feel to the game every time players return. Through all these little details,
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  quickly made a name for itself despite its small presence and smaller development team, making its way out of Early Access as one of the most renowned games of its kind.

  An overnight success of sorts,

  quickly became the game everyone was talking about, reaching streamers, YouTubers, and casual players everywhere. Perfect for players of all ages, this quirky offering stood out from the masses as something more colorful, more fun, and more unique than anything that ever came before it. With gameplay mechanics like builds, vibrant artwork, and cartoon-y character design, it took an already loved genre of game and made it into the stand-out success it's become today.

  While it's no surprise that

  Through social media clips, promotion through various streamers, and more, it feels incredibly clear that a lot of

  's success is down to how readily it was shared, leaving its niche of

  lovers or RPG players, and instead attracting audiences that may have never even picked up a video game before. Its whimsical story, gorgeous art, beloved characters, and consistently shocking moments of incredible narrative choices have set a precedent for all games, something Larian Studios could've never imagined when the game first launched.

  After a long and troubled development period,

  will be in the hands of players in late October 2024. With nearly ten years between the last major
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  title and
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  , BioWare will have to reintroduce both the game itself and the
  <em>

  franchise as a whole to players to get them excited about the new release. To that end, the studio is continuing its promotional efforts by focusing on some of the most enduring aspects of
  <em>

  The latest wave of information from BioWare via the game's official website and social media accounts reveals a little more about
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  companions from a gameplay perspective. In a series of profiles, the studio listed some of the abilities they'll be able to call on in battle alongside the player protagonist, Rook, as they struggle to secure the future of Thedas.

  In a series of posts to kick off what the studio is calling the
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  Companions Week, BioWare highlighted the profiles of the in-game companions, with deeper profiles showing off character art and listing the abilities of Davrin, the Dalish Elf Grey Warden, Lucanis the Antivan Crow Assassin, and Bellara, the Veil Jumper. The official website was also updated with the same information, as well as info about other
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  companions.

  Though the ability listings did not include specifics about their use in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's combat, the ability names dovetail with the different companions' apparent roles. For example, the titling of Davrin's abilities focus on his role as a front-line combatant, and his relationship with Assan, his Griffon. Meanwhile, Vellara's expertise in the Fade emphasizes her mastery of electricity and control magic, as well as her ability to support the party and hinder foes. Some abilities seem to be shared across companions or classes, such as the mage characters all having access to Time Slow, or rogue characters being able to call on Adrenaline Rush.

 <p>
  With the exception of Lace Harding, who last appeared in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  as an NPC, BioWare did not detail returning
  <em>

  characters like Morrigan and Varric. Companions Week appears to be focused so far on
  <em>
   The Veilguard

  's newer characters and how they'll support Rook as the pillars of the first new

  game in a very long time.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the most popular JRPG franchises of all time, with this series continuing to make waves to this day. Both new and old fans can't get enough of a series that lets them engage with riveting combat mechanics as they get invested in an gripping story with memorable characters. A huge part of what makes every
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game so memorable are the villains who serve as a major source of motivation for players, who will want to give these heinous figures the beatdown they deserve.

 <p>
  Some of these villains are so iconic that the weapons they wield have become iconic in their own right. From massive swords to sinister staffs and everything in between, there are many
  <strong>
   villains with iconic weapons in the series
  </strong>
  that will strike fear in the hearts of players. Facing off against these imposing foes is no mean feat, and players must pull out their strongest attacks to come out victorious.

  <strong>
   Seymour
  </strong>
  is one of the best antagonists in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy,
  </em>
  with this sinister summoner conveying his evil nature from the very moment he's featured on-screen. While it's easy to hate this character and how he almost forces Yuna to marry him, learning about the story of his mother and how she turned into an aeon can make for a heartbreaking tale that lends some context to his evil actions.

 <p>
  Still, that doesn't take anything away from Seymour's evil nature, and facing off against this tough enemy multiple times throughout
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 10
   </em>
  </strong>
  makes for one of the biggest challenges in the game. The mere sight of his staff will send shivers down a player's spine, especially if they've faced off against Seymour Flux and were taken aback by the difficulty of one of the hardest JRPG bosses of all time.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 8
   </strong>
  </em>
  leans into the idea of ridiculous weapons, with Squall's Revolver gunblade being equal parts impractical and awesome whenever he whips it out in battle. It's easy to write off this weapon as an over-designed blade, but most of these frustrations melt away as the game slowly grows on players. It helps that Squall's rival wields another gunblade that looks even more ridiculous, too.

  <strong>
   Seifer's Hyperion
  </strong>
  combines the handle of a pistol and the attacks a long blade to make for one of the most puzzling yet iconic weapon designs in the series. This rival's cocky attitude makes him an easy character to hate, but fans can't help but marvel at his gunblade during a brief section where they get to control this character before the tables are turned on them.

  lighter tone may have disappointed some fans, especially since it's sandwiched between two story-heavy games in the series that take their plots very seriously. However, there are many positives to this cheery approach to the narrative, and one need only look at
  <strong>
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Gilgamesh's
  </strong>
  iconic presence throughout the game to realize this. Despite being rather goofy at times, the boss fights against Gilgamesh are challenging if players take him too lightly.

  One of the best moments in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 5
  </em>
  comes during one such boss fight, when Gilgamesh proclaims that he's sourced one of the most legendary weapons he could get his hands on. Players buff themselves up and brace for impact, only for this comedic villain to whip out the iconic Excalipoor and hit them for a measly 1 damage. It's easy to see why Exdeath was fed up with his bumbling henchman after a point, even if this moment is one of many that shows
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 5
  </em>
  's strengths and cements it as one of the most underrated games in the series.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 10
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a game full of iconic moments. From Seymour's sinister presence to the revelation of
  <strong>
   Jecht
  </strong>
  being a good guy all along, it's easy to see why fans can't get enough of this title. While Tidus' father may not be the villain everyone expected him to be, the fight against Braska's Final Aeon is clearly presented as a showdown between a son and his morphed, corrupted father.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1036} -->

 <p>
  Throughout the game, players see Jecht wielding a blade that looks very sinister. The final boss wields a gigantic version of this blade that strikes fear in the hearts of players, and anyone who hasn't unlocked the Ultimate Weapons' full potential will have a tough time against a boss that takes no prisoners and cycles between multiple phases.

  It would be impossible to talk about the most iconic weapons in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  without giving due credit to the
  <strong>
   Masamune
  </strong>
  , a ridiculously long weapon wielded by none other than
  <strong>
   Sephiroth
  </strong>
  himself. It's easy for players to laugh at this weapon's ridiculous length when they glance at it for the first time, but Sephiroth's intimidating presence and combat expertise make this lengthy katana look natural in his deft hands.

  The number of times this blade has sliced and diced everyone's favorite characters from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  proves why so many fans fear the mere sight of this sword in the ex-SOLDIER's hands. Any showdown with Sephiroth, in both the original game and the remake, when the threat of this katana looms over the player, makes for some of the most iconic moments in any game, making Masamune legendary for all the right reasons.

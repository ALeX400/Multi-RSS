   <strong>
    Death Note: Killer Within
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been rated for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 according to new leaks. There is a lot of potential within the
  <em>
   Death Note
  </em>
  franchise that some feel has barely been tapped. The show took over as a phenomenon soon after the manga ended in 2006, and fans of the medium still consider it one of the best around. A new
  <em>
   Death Note
  </em>
  video game could be a hit if done right.

 <p>
  Fans have been craving a new release in the
  <em>
   Death Note
  </em>
  series for some time now. The franchise is largely considered a cultural icon, and in an age of media full of remakes and reimaginings of content that's at least a decade old, 20 years is more than enough for a new take for many people. Some fans also just want another shot at the story after the controversial Netflix
  <em>
   Death Note
  </em>
  movie failed to line up with expectations.

  Gematsu reports that the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee rated an upcoming
  <em>
   Death Note
  </em>
  project for PS4 and PS5 systems.
  <em>
   Death Note: Killer Within
  </em>
  is an unannounced project that will be published by Bandai Namco. The scope of the project is not clear, but the ratings show that the game will contain
  <em>
   Death Note's
  </em>
  usual fare of violent acts and "anti-society" themes. There are many directions for a
  <em>
   Death Note
  </em>
  video game project to go in, but fans getting more
  <em>
   Death Note
  </em>
  at all is an exciting possibility.

 <p>
  Further searches on the Taiwan Digital Game Rating Committee website have confirmed the English title of the release as
  <em>
   Death Note: Killer Within
  </em>
  , as previously it was just a translation. When it comes to what kind of mechanics the title will feature, some gamers have guesses. Several fans would like the project to resemble a
  <em>
   Professor Layton
  </em>
  video game, operating around a central mystery with plenty of puzzle-solving and visual novel elements. This could be a great way to emphasize the cat-and-mouse style of conflict between L and Light throughout the series.

 <p>
  Other fans would prefer this release to be like a
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  game. Having a seemingly normal student moonlighting as a vigilante bears enough similarity to the premise of
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  that it sounds like an easy sell to many gamers. Some gamers are struggling to fully wrap their heads around whether this title will contain combat and what that would look like, leading many to hope that
  <em>
   Death Note: Killer Within
  </em>
  steers clear and draws most of its influence from visual novels like
  <em>
   Danganronpa
  </em>
  instead of the style of anime fighters that so many shows are adapted into.

   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the sequel to the fan-favorite action RPG,
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes.
  </em>
  It takes players through terrifyingly dark worlds where they come face to face with lethal enemies and World bosses. The only way to survive in the game is by effectively eliminating any enemies that cross the traveler’s path.

  Thankfully, there’s a diverse variety of weapons players can choose from, each with unique damage specs. Weapons are available for purchase from different merchants or are unlocked as players defeat bosses and get access to new locations. There are three main types of weapons in
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  , namely Handguns, Long Guns, and Melee Weapons. This guide compiles a list of the best weapons in each category, ranked according to tiers.

   <strong>
    Updated October 14th, 2024 by Jacob Buchalter:
   </strong>
   Now that all three of Remnant 2's DLC expansions have come out, with the Awakened King, the Forgotten Kingdom, and the Dark Horizon, it's time to take another look at where all the weapons fall. The dev team at Gunfire Games put a lot of work into Remnant 2 and has been constantly and consistently updating the game since its release with patches, bug fixes, and more. So, the rankings of a good number of weapons on here have been changed, and for good reason. First, let's break them into tiers, and then rank all the DPS options from S to D Rank.

 <p>
  All Weapon types in
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  can be divided into the following ranks, with the efficacy of weapons decreasing down the hierarchy. The scale for these weapons differs a bit depending on whether they're Long Guns, Hand Guns, or Melee Weapons, of course.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  With Long Guns, sustained damage, mod utility, and burst damage are incredibly important. Hand Guns are typically backup damage and are rarely built around entirely, so their burst damage and support abilities are very important. Lastly, Melee Weapons are difficult to build around and are best used for crit damage or with high attack speed. So, let's break down what exactly each Tier typically encapsulates:

       The S-Tier of weapons in
       <em>
        Remnant 2
       </em>
       are the ones that hit the hardest, have the most damage sustain, or work well in tons of different builds. Depending on the weapon category, the most important 'part' of the weapon changes, but overall these are the weapons that make the most impact.

      <p>
       Where the A-Tier of weaponry differs from the S-Tier is they're commonly not described as 'overpowered'. These are weapons that are great to slot into tons of different builds but aren't the 'best choice' for many of them. They're the sort of 'old reliable' choices players can always fall back on.

      </p>
     </th>
     <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>
       B-Tier weapons typically are incredibly strong in very specific builds and are decently strong otherwise. These are the weapons that sort of require being built around, but as long as the player does so even slightly, they'll usually prove their worth.

       C-Tier
      </p>
     </th>
     <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>
       The C-Tier is pretty similar to the B-Tier of weapons, but where they fall short is that they have even fewer builds they're the best choice in (or even a good choice in). C-Tier weapons can be worth using and are commonly decently strong, but there are almost always better options than them in most situations.

       D-Tier
      </p>
     </th>
     <td style="text-align:left">
      <p>
       Last up is the lowest tier, the D-Tier of weapons, and these are basically just fully not worth using. In very rare circumstances players can make a build work with these weapons, but even then there are almost always stronger build variations that are much better than the ones using these weapons. Overall these are typically weapons with unique ideas or designs but poor execution of these ideas.

  In
  <em>
   Remnant 2,
  </em>
  long Guns are the primary weapon type. These serve as the backbone of a player’s build as they venture into the dark realms. Long Guns, like rifles and shotguns, are capable of dealing significant damage to enemies, even from a distance, due to their impressive range and firepower. Most Long Guns have innate Boss Mods that can't be switched out and are the go-to weapon choice when players face off against lethal world bosses.

 <p>
  Long Guns are almost always the 'core' of a build or at the very least their attached Weapon Mod is. With the
  <em>
   Dark Horizon
  </em>
  DLC now out, let's also take a second and talk about the new Long Guns added with it, the Genesis and the Monorail

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Genesis:
   </strong>
   The Genesis is by far one of the strongest weapons in
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
   , hands down. The raw damage output, accuracy, and reliability are all top-class. Plus, the Mega Drive Weapon Mod is just straight-up absurd and makes aiming even less of a factor.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Monorail:
   </strong>
   The Monorail, at least as of the current patch (this was written on October 14th, 2204) feels like it has to be bugged. The damage of this weapon in no way makes up for the risk, low magazine capacity, or long reload speed. Compared to most other Long Guns in the game, the Monorail just falls incredibly short.
  </li>
 </ul>

  For these rankings, we took their overall damage, sustain damage, attached Weapon Mod, and more into account, and these are where the weapon rankings fell:

 <p>
  Handguns, such as pistols and SMGs, act as secondary firearms, essentially providing support to Long Guns. They're meant to be used as opposite weapons to a player's Long Gun for the most part. If a Long Gun is a high single-target weapon at close range, then a good Hand Gun would typically be a lower-damage AoE weapon or one good at long range.

  As far as Hand Guns in the
  <em>
   Dark Horizon
  </em>
  DLC goes, the developers at Gunfire Games only added one, but it's a fantastic one, the Redeemer.
  <strong>
   The Redeemer is one of the most unique weapons in the game now, synergizing with so many different Relic Effects, giving players the ability to heal allies, deal damage, or trigger any effect relying on Relic Use.

  For Hand Guns, the important stats tend to be unique Weapon Mods, sustainable ammo count, reliable damage, fast reloads, or high-capacity magazines. The weapons below were ranked taking these statistics into mind:

  Compared to its predecessor,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  has revamped its Melee Weapons collection. There are many more viable and versatile options for players to choose from. Most of these weapons come with special skills that can transform all regular attacks into unique, highly destructive special attacks.

 <p>
  Melee Weapons fall into a unique sort of area in
  <em>
   Remnant 2,
  </em>
  as they're typically used for high crit builds or on players who want to try and do a full melee playthrough. There are a rare few Melee Weapons with ranged options, but for the most part, these are used for mob clearing without wasting ammo, high damage at close range, or burst damage using crits.

  The
  <em>
   Dark Horizon
  </em>
  DLC adds three new Melee Weapons into
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  , and all three are pretty fantastic. Because this is the newest content in the game, let's go over all three of them a bit more in-depth:

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Dark Matter Gauntlets:
   </strong>
   The Dark Matter Gauntlets are the viable full-run Melee Weapons that
   <em>
    Remnant 2
   </em>
   fans have been asking for since the game came out. Finally, players have a weapon that works up close and at range incredibly well outside of the World's Edge. The Darkness Beam in particular is just absurd in terms of damage. As long as players get used to the specific mechanics of this weapon, it's incredible.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Black Greatsword:
   </strong>
   This can barely be called a weapon, it's more like a hunk of iron. In any case, outside of being an incredible reference to
   <em>
    Berserk
   </em>
   , the Black Greatsword is incredibly powerful, works well in Charged Melee builds, and the animations of the weapon itself are incredible. That said, it's not recommended to use on any 'glass cannon' builds, as a lot of the viability of this weapon comes from tanking some hits from enemies and unleashing a massive Charge Attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Harvester Scythe:
   </strong>
   An incredibly unique weapon, and one that is absurdly powerful when used in combination with the Shocker Melee Mutator. Very fast, the Phantom Blade Weapon Mod is a ton of fun to use, and just a great option overall.
  </li>

  <em>
   Everwild
  </em>
  is an upcoming open-world action-adventure Xbox game developed by British game studio Rare. Rare is known for the development of
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  , the high-seas sailing pirate game where players tackle an open world of adventures as a pirate sailing across the ocean. With the success of its previous game, Rare's upcoming
  <em>
   Everwild
  </em>
  is looking to be
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  but with a magical twist, as many of the elements of what made the open-world pirate game successful could easily be implemented into
  <em>
   Everwild.
  </em>
  While players have yet to see much gameplay for the upcoming title, a new update suggests that development on
  <em>
   Everwild
  </em>
  is going well.

  Originally talked about on the Xbox Two podcast and later shared in a tweet from GPN Game Pass News, insider Jez Corden shared some small updates on
  <em>
   Everwild
  </em>
  . During the final segment of the latest episode of XB2, Corden shared that development on
  <em>
   Everwild
  </em>
  is going well and that the studio has really "nailed down" the gameplay loop. This is especially uplifting, as Corden's last positive update on
  <em>
   Everwild
  </em>
  was relatively scarce and provided limited details on the game.

  While this is certainly good news for fans of the series, it is still unclear when exactly more will be revealed about Rare's upcoming title. Official statements on the game still seem to be extremely limited, as this information is still technically unconfirmed by Microsoft itself. As it seems now,
  <em>
   Everwild
  </em>
  is still set to feature a large-scale multiplayer world, alongside some magic-heavy gameplay and action-adventure elements.

   Those who have opted into the digital version of the multiplayer-centric party game or just plan on snagging it on the eShop at launch should know the exact release times for

  Mario Party Jamboree Release Times (Mario Party Jamboree eShop Unlock Time)
 </h2>
 <p>
  Now, Nintendo never goes to Twitter to confirm the release times for any of the company's first-party titles, unlike competitors like Sony and Microsoft. However, thanks to a trusty Nintendo support page (and our experience with release times for Switch exclusives), we can pretty much guarantee that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario Party Jamboree
   </strong>
  </em>
  <strong>
   will launch for the Nintendo Switch on October 17 at midnight ET.

      Gamers look to Traveler's Tales for potentially adapting more mature-themed games like horror franchises into LEGO form.

     <li>
      Some iconic horror franchises like

      </em>
      ,
      <em>

      </em>
      , and Universal Monsters could potentially be adapted into LEGO games.
     </li>
     <li>
      Traveler's Tales could bring humor and self-parody to horror classics like Romero's

 <p>
  With the new
  <strong>
   <em>
    LEGO Horizon Adventures
   </em>
  </strong>
  , fans are excited to see how Traveler's Tales adapts a more mature-themed game to LEGO form to play solo or with a friend. It also has raised curiosity as to what else LEGO games will attempt in the future, given their history with many other franchises, such as
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  LEGO and Traveler's Tales could potentially explore the horror genre, as many horror franchises would fit their format, despite their R-rating and gruesome content. They feature many iconic characters and memorable locations, with enough content for the games to poke fun at them in their own way while still honoring them.

 <p>
  Already one of the more tame horror franchises out there, Tremors balances out the horror of the subterranean monsters known as Graboids, as well as their multiple forms of evolution, with a cast of goofy yet relatable characters. Whether it's Kevin Bacon's Val, Fred Ward's Earl, or the franchise's poster child: Burt Gummer, as played by Michael Gross.

 <p>
  A LEGO version of Tremors could easily adapt the first three or four movies, giving people the chance to explore Perfection in Nevada, the oil fields in Mexico, and Perfection again back in the 1800s. It's a creature feature franchise that still has its fans, and they will likely enjoy the Traveler's Tales version of it.

 <p>
  As terrifying as Freddy Krueger is as a demon that haunts the dreams of characters, A Nightmare On Elm Street is also known for having a large amount of comedy as the movies went on. Freddy Krueger himself was so famous for spewing one-liners and movie references, that he was almost like a horror version of Deadpool.

 <p>
  Also, the sequel continuously became more and more outlandish with not only Freddy's kills but also how characters were able to combat Freddy in the Dream World and the real world. As a result, A Nightmare On Elm Street would fit well within the realms of self-parody in LEGO form, even if it doesn't feature the blood and gore that fans would expect.

  The
  <em>
   LEGO Indiana Jones
  </em>
  games already showed what Traveler's Tales could do with a game set in the 1930s, and they could do that with Universal's monster movies of the time. With
  <em>
   Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
  </em>
  , Dracula, The Wolf Man, Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, Creature From The Black Lagoon, and The Mummy, a LEGO game could use each movie for its usual episodic structure.

 <p>
  There are also many famous Universal Monster movie locations to use for potential open-world maps, especially with monochromatic visuals, from Dracula's Transylvanian castle to Victorian-era London to Egypt. Each monster brings a new flavor to the world of horror, but are also known for their many parodies over the years, which Traveler's Tales could easily do.

  In the world of horror video games and movies, zombies have been a staple for over half a century and fans have George A. Romero to thank for that with movies like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Night Of The Living Dead
   </em>
  </strong>
  . While he did not invent the idea of a zombie, he revolutionized it and made zombies into something that people fear in multiple movies.

  In LEGO form, his main quadrilogy of movies, including
  <em>
   Dawn Of The Dead
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Day Of The Dead
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Land Of The Dead
  </em>
  , would take players to a graveyard, a farmhouse, a mall, an underground base, and multiple post-apocalyptic cities. The shambling zombies have led to comedic moments in the movies and that would just be taken a step further in LEGO form.

  On top of it all, Predator is an iconic franchise that mixes horror, action, sci-fi, and even comedy in certain entries. Fans would love the chance to play a LEGO version of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover, Amber Midthunder, Adrien Brody, and other famous actors from the franchise, as well as the different variants of Yautja Hunters.

  With

  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Alien
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise proves that it is still going strong. There are seven canonical films in the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  franchise, with some more loved than others, but each one gave fans new and unique perspectives of the terrifying Xenomorph.

 <p>
  Not only does Alien change the Xenomorph with each movie, but it also changes genres, from isolated horror to action thriller to epic space drama. It would allow Traveler's Tales to broaden their skills in trying to adapt the Alien movies to LEGO form while introducing their style of humor to something as dark as the perfect organism.

  The first
  <strong>
   <em>
    Jaws
   </em>
  </strong>
  is regarded by audiences as the only good one in the four-movie franchise, but that is arguably what would help it fit as a LEGO title. LEGO can honor and create humorous scenes in the iconic shark movie and parody the others for how ridiculous they got, with a Megalodon at Sea World and a supernaturally driven shark out for revenge against the Brody family.

  <em>
   LEGO Indiana Jones
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   LEGO Jurassic World
  </em>
  already replicated so well. Add in fan-favorite characters such as Martin Brody and Quint, a LEGO
  <em>
   Jaws
  </em>
  could be a fun gem for the Traveler's Tales library, especially since there has never been a focus on underwater levels before.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Friday The 13th
   </em>
  </strong>
  movies are some of the most definitive slasher movies ever made, but they can also be some of the cheesiest. For every movie that shows how gritty and scary Jason Voorhees can be, others go as wild as possible, depicting Jason Voorhees as an immortal zombie going into space or fighting Freddy Krueger.

  With twelve
  <em>
   Friday The 13th
  </em>
  movies at their disposal, Traveler's Tales could go all out in showcasing just how silly the franchise can be. As a bonus, every single movie redesigns Jason Voorhees to look different and, since the official
  <em>
   Friday The 13th
  </em>
  game is no longer available to purchase, the LEGO game would allow fans to unlock and play all Jason variants again.

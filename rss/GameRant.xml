  A classic 90s franchise is coming back in the modern era with the upcoming
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tokyo Xtreme Racer,
   </em>
  </strong>
  a revival of the racing franchise made popular on the Sega Dreamcast set to release as a PC exclusive on Steam. While little is known about the title for now, it serves as the first mainline entry in the
  <em>
   Tokyo Xtreme Racer
  </em>
  series since 2006, when
  <em>
   Import Tuner Challenge
  </em>
  was released on the Xbox 360.

 <p>
  Debuting on the Super Nintendo in 1994 under the title
  <em>
   Shotoku Battle '94, Tokyo Xtreme Racer
  </em>
  is a fast-paced racing title where players challenge different racers and upgrade their vehicles with various custom parts. It wasn't until the follow-up,
  <em>
   Tokyo Xtreme Racer,
  </em>
  released on the Sega Dreamcast in 1999 that the series found a significant western audience and joined the likes of
  <em>
   Crazy Taxi
  </em>
  as part of the console's lineup of racing titles.

 <p>
  Now, the series is set to make a comeback as developer Genki revealed a new entry set to release in 2025, with the newly-rebooted
  <em>
   Tokyo Xtreme Racer
  </em>
  receiving a short teaser trailer showing off the game's logo. The trailer flashes back through the logos of all previous titles before revealing the new game, though it did not show off any gameplay or other details about the game.

  Fans of the older titles will know that
  <em>
   Tokyo Xtreme Racer
  </em>
  plays like something akin to the
  <em>
   Need for Speed
  </em>
  titles, but with a uniquely Japanese spin, featuring real-life Japanese cars and an RPG-like progression system. Players can challenge different racers on various street racing tracks throughout the city of Tokyo to unlock custom parts and upgrade their cars.

 <p>
  As of now, the teaser only confirms a release on Steam, implying that the game will be a PC exclusive, though the description describes the series as a console racing game, so ports to other platforms may be in the works. Some have speculated that the game may be gearing up for a launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 which is rumored to be revealed soon, alongside potential PS5 and Xbox ports.

 <p>
  In any case, the new

  will be the series' first entry in over 18 years, though it is not yet clear what new mechanics, cars, and tracks are set to come with the newly-revived series. The series will likely see a major visual upgrade, however, as it joins the lineup of racing titles on PC come next year when it launches on Steam, where it is already available to wishlist.

  Xbox already has an immense list of titles lined up for 2025, many of which are first-party. Obsidian Entertainment's
  <em>
   Avowed,
  </em>
  which was originally slated for release this year, is coming on February 11.
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages

  ,
  <em>
   South of Midnight
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Fable

  are also aiming to be 2025 day-one Game Pass releases. Beyond that, several big third-party titles are picking up the slack, such as
  <em>
   Expedition 33
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sniper Elite: Resistance
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Wuchang: Fallen Feathers,
  </em>

  Despite all this, it seems Xbox still has more up its sleeve for Game Pass in 2025. During its second-day Gamescom livestream, Xbox confirmed two more titles coming day-one to Game Pass next year. An isometric,
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  -like action twist on 2021's
  <em>
   Coraline
  </em>
  -inspired EA Originals adventure game,
  <em>
   Lost in Random: The Eternal Die
  </em>
  was unveiled and confirmed as a Game Pass release during the livestream. The second game, a survival title named
  <em>
   Voidtrain
  </em>
  , will see players building and customizing their own train that they can use to embark on a journey to explore a surreal and mysterious void.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  is getting an update with Gleaming Depths at the end of the year, bringing a fresh new chapter to Bethesda's multiplayer addition to the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise.
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  showcases a nuclear-ravaged wasteland set in the mountains of Appalachia, which has proven to be a wonderful setting to explore. As of now, Gleaming Depths has merely been teased, but there will hopefully be more on the horizon that involves an underserved area of the map.

 <p>
  All that is known about Gleaming Depths at the moment is that it will release near the end of the year, and it was teased at this year's QuakeCon.
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  's creative director, Jonathan Rush, revealed a teaser trailer, which featured locations that were filled with Ultracite, hence the name Gleaming Depths. With Ultracite being a rare radioactive crystal residing in the depths of Appalachia, this presents the perfect opportunity for the next update to focus on a map location that is in need of some love: the Ash Heap. The mines of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  are filled with mysteries, and the Ash Heap could finally be explored to its full extent.

 <p>
  Out of all the locations in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , the Ash Heap is one of the most hazardous areas on the map. The location has gained its name for a very good reason. Pillars of billowing smoke and cinders permeate the area, making it a serious health risk. From Wendigos to various Mutants, the Ash Heap is home to some horrifying creatures, but there is hopefully more to the area than meets the eye.

 <p>
  Much of the area's smoky atmosphere comes from the mines that lie underneath the land. It is believed that there are non-stop fires raging in the tunnels below, but there hasn't been any real confirmation about what lies beneath the Ash Heap's surface. Since there are mines, there is bound to be some sort of precious resource, and it wouldn't be too wild to assume that this resource is Ultracite. This resource is all over Appalachia, and the footage Rush revealed for Gleaming Depths showcasing an ample amount of Ultracite could be teasing what is hiding underneath the Ash Heap. Ultracite is a powerful component, and it would make since that there is a substantial supply buried under the location's surface.

 <p>
  It seems possible because, at the moment, there is no way to really get to the Ultracite if there is actually a huge bounty lying dormant under the Ash Heap. The many locations of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  all have their own special makeup, but the Ash Heap has yet to be explored to the same extent as the surrounding areas.

 <p>
  The Ash Heap has to be more than just a smoldering wasteland. If
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  wants to breathe some new life into the map, turning this often-avoided area into a central focus of Gleaming Depths would be an exciting change of pace. Not only would it entice players to explore the Ash Heap, it would provide Gleaming Depths with the perfect stage to offer an exciting hunt for Ultracite while also providing an intense environmental challenge.
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is filled with valuable items, and there is no telling what other great rewards could be hidden underneath the Ash Heap.

 <p>
  Only time will tell if Gleaming Depths finally gives the Ash Heap the attention it deserves. As the release date for the Milepost Zero update is drawing closer, it will be exciting to see if there will be any hints teasing a potential venture into the dreaded Ash Heap with the following update.

  Free-to-play games are enticing options on the
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5
  </strong>
  , and this category of projects has drastically shifted in recent years. With the explosive popularity of titles like
  <em>
   Fortnite and Genshin Impact
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  many games want to adopt a free-to-play formula.

  The greatest free-to-play titles can keep someone engaged for potentially months at no cost. Some have visuals and gameplay that compare favorably to full-priced projects; even if those titles are the exception, quite a few freebies are perfect for short play sessions. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best free PS5 games

  <em>
   March ended up not featuring any notable
   <strong>
    free PS5 games
   </strong>
   , largely due to FragPunk delaying its console versions to an undisclosed point in the future. That news was a bit disappointing due to it coming out just a few days before the game was set to launch, but PlayStation 5 owners can always turn their attention to the many, many other freebies available in the store.

  Hero shooters have been cold for a few years. However, the genre is still visible enough that one exciting release could turn the tide, and
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is shaping up to be that game. Obviously, the big-name license helps, but the presence of Spider-Man and The Hulk would not matter that much if they were trying to carry an otherwise underwhelming release. Fortunately, NetEase's multiplayer game is built upon a strong foundation that wisely takes lessons from the best hero shooters of all time, primarily
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  looks and plays great, offering conventional 6v6 matches that emphasize teamwork along with the three-class system. At launch, the game has three modes (Domination, Convoy, and Convergence) that are fairly typical for the genre, but they are enhanced by well-designed maps and 30+ recognizable characters who are quite well-defined.

  There are only a handful of single-player role-playing games that are free, and
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is one of the most popular projects of all time. The game is story-based and includes some multiplayer options, but it is largely intended to be played as a solo action RPG experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  To make
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  stand out even more from the crowd, it is an open-world game. The gameplay and freedom of exploration are phenomenal, and the game has grown exponentially since its debut. There is already a ton to do in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and this universe will only expand further in the future.

  Making the jump from mobile exclusivity to consoles and PC,
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  is a glorious triumph and comfortably one of the
  <strong>
   best PS5 free games
  </strong>
  . Set in a beautiful open-world, Infold and Papergames' project is a sight to behold even at the worst of times, and it runs pretty well considering its ambition and size. More importantly, the game is the definition of cozy, guiding players through a tension-free adventure that emphasizes exploration, wardrobe customization, and NPC interaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of whether someone is a long-time fan of the franchise or is donning their first outfit ever,
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  should have something to offer them, as long as they are primarily craving a slow-life adventure with minimal combat and limited danger. Although it is still in its early days,
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  seems like a free project that will be around for a long time.

  The MMORPG genre can feel static. New entries are rare since they require such a substantial investment of time and money, all the while coming with a huge chance of failure. Not many releases succeed spectacularly, but the ones that do refuse to die and remain available in some form or another for potentially decades. Although still in its infancy,
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  seems set to be a mainstay, offering an exciting modern take on the classic MMO formula found in titles like
  <em>
   Lineage
  </em>
  . Just to be crystal clear, this
  <strong>
   free PS5 game
  </strong>
  is very much a multiplayer experience, to the point that players will need to interact with others through guilds. That's not to say
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  does not support solo adventures, but they are not the default or extremely encouraged.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  manages a few impressive things that make it a worthwhile recommendation for both veteran and new MMO players. For one, the world is gorgeous and quite diverse, containing plenty of incredible vistas and cities. The map is essentially open-world, although it will take a while to gain access to everything. The combat comes with a bit of a learning curve, but it should eventually click; if it does not, players should try out a few different class combos as they can make a considerable difference. Finally, traversal revolves around the ability to shapeshift into various animals, a mechanic that is freeing and arguably the best part of the whole package.

  There is a perfect chance that
  <em>
   Astro's Playroom
  </em>
  will be most people's first PS5 game; after all, it comes installed on the console. Despite lasting roughly 3–4 hours, this 3D platformer is the best free PS5 game and one of the best pack-in titles ever. For the most part,
  <em>
   Astro's Playroom
  </em>
  showcases the DualSense's capabilities, with each of the four zones utilizing different gimmicks that emphasize the controller's immersion and touch controls. Even all these years later, Team Asobi's title arguably still makes the most impressive use of the DualSense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond functioning as a technical showcase,
  <em>
   Astro's Playroom
  </em>
  is just a delightful love letter to PlayStation's history. As players run through the vibrant and gorgeous zones, they will gradually unlock artifacts relating to a console generation and discover plenty of cute Easter Eggs. The gameplay is also pretty darn solid and goes through enough changes to remain interesting. The game even has a couple of spectacular boss fights.

  Although initially a premium product,
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  eventually went free-to-play, a decision that further cemented it as one of the industry's most successful projects. It's a vehicular soccer game that has been called a blend of racing, soccer, basketball, and hockey. On paper, this concept might sound ridiculous; in execution, it is fantastic. Arguably the
  <strong>
   best free PS5 game
  </strong>
  for quick sessions,
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  is the ultimate casual option, the type of game that someone can launch when they have 30 minutes to kill but no idea what to play. More often than not, they will have a fun time.
 </p>
 <p>
  With steadier framerates, playing
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  on PlayStation 5 might give people a competitive edge. While a native PS5 version seems likely to never materialize, that should not deter players from giving this sports phenomenon a try via backward compatibility. It runs splendidly and looks pretty good for this sort of project.

  Sticking with HoYoverse,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  will likely appeal to most fans of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , although the
  <strong>
   free-to-play PS5 game
  </strong>
  is hardly a retread of the developer's smash hit. Dipping into sci-fi territory,
  <em>
   Honkai
  </em>
  casts players as the Trailblazer, an agent who will find himself visiting a range of planets that each come with their own ecosystems, politics, and storylines. Naturally, the protagonists won't be flying solo during these missions, and they will be accompanied by a couple of free characters along with a fairly robust selection of unlockables.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Honkai

  is a gacha game, so players will need to spin the wheel to acquire most of the characters (along with equipment). While this can be a time and money sink, the game dishes out rewards at a decent rate, and it is usually possible to play through the core content without having to invest any hard cash. HoYoVerse is also consistent with updates, so there is usually always something on the horizon to look forward to. At the moment, the campaign has three main zones/areas, all of which serve up mini-adventures. None of them are open-worlds or particularly expansive, but they provide some room for exploration.

 <p>
  Unlike
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's real-time action,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  utilizes turn-based combat that takes inspiration from many JRPG masterpieces while still finding its own voice. Battles are visually stunning, and they tend to move at a quick pace. The system has nuances as well, especially since each character comes with unique strengths, weaknesses, and classes that need to be taken into account when forming a 4-member party.

  The sequel to 2014's highly-successful MOBA,
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  has led an uneven life so far, with the game entering open beta to a fairly divisive initial impression. In early 2025, the game made its free-to-play PS5 debut, which was a relatively big deal since Sony's console does not have all that many native MOBAs in its library. For all its polarizing elements,
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  has quite a few strengths in its favor, including a massive roster of gods and a combat system that managed to adapt its predecessor's loop to a 3D perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  is still very much a work in progress, and it has more than a few rough edges that will hopefully be removed over the coming months and years. If somebody is not a huge fan of MOBAs, they might not get too much of this sequel. Meanwhile, die-hard fans of the original title will find that
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  retains quite a bit of its charm, but still has a unique identity that might or might not be for them.

  It took a while to happen, but
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  finally made its PS5 debut in August 2024. Riot's hero shooter has been a staple of the PC multiplayer scene for a few years by this point, and it is generally seen as a tactical alternative to something like
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  . For the most part, that is true, with the project implementing hero-shooter elements with a heavy focus on teamwork and fairly conventional gunplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  While obviously popular and somewhat accessible,
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  has a pretty steep learning curve that can be off-putting at first. Players are expected to coordinate with their teammates, and people who decide to do their own thing will quickly find out that such actions are rarely rewarded. The agents are also quite diverse and require practice to master, so new players might need to spend some time trying out different characters to see which one fits them the best.

  Although it had been coming for a while,
  <em>
   The Finals
  </em>
  unexpectedly launched during the 2023 Game Awards, offering PS5 owners another first-person shooter they can play for free. The multiplayer market for these types of games is oversaturated, but Embark's title does enough to set itself apart from the crowd. Matches are presented as showcases on a competitive TV show, and the game has essentially two modes that play somewhat differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the options pits four teams against each other as they try to accumulate cash, which involves transporting money to a specific location. This comes in different flavors since
  <em>
   The Finals
  </em>
  offers both ranked and casual versions. While taking inspiration from popular PvP modes of the past, this take is still fairly unique for the genre, even if it has some issues that will hopefully be ironed out over the coming months. Bank it is somewhat similar, although it is a bit more of a free-for-all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Finals
  </em>
  will hopefully be around for a long time. The combat and movement are generally fine, although players might want to tweak the settings to find a responsiveness that feels good to them. They should also try all three classes since they play very differently from each other. Along with decent gunplay, the game heavily emphasizes destructible environments, a feature that allows for a more tactical and experimental approach.

  continues to be one of the most played free-to-play games because of its abundance of content. The PlayStation 5 version was ported in November 2020. Developer Digital Extremes has pumped more content into the RPG post-launch than possibly any other of its type.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game's structure revolves around completing quests and upgrading the Warframe armor set. With an in-game currency called Platinum, players can upgrade and customize their spaceship and trade with other players. The clan features of
  <em>
   Warframe

  are exceptional.

  Initially a premium product,
  <em>
   Naraka: Bladepoint
  </em>
  transitioned to a free-to-play model in July 2023, which happened to coincide with its PS5 launch. Battle royale games are not only a dime-a-dozen but also inescapable in the free scene, but 24 Entertainment's title does an admirable job of distinguishing itself from its competitors. For one, the combat focuses on close-quarter fights rather than ranged battles, with the gameplay sharing more in common with character action games than first or third-person shooters.
  <em>
   Naraka: Bladepoint
  </em>
  's two maps are both gorgeous and reasonably large without venturing into excess territory.
 </p>
 <p>
  Matches can be played solo or as part of a trios team, and both versions are enjoyable in their own right. The game also comes with a few different modes in order to keep things diverse and interesting. While players can create their own characters,
  <em>
   Naraka
  </em>
  also takes inspiration from hero shooters through the implementation of characters, each of which comes with unique abilities. There is even a progression system that allows players to level up their chosen hero.

  Released for the PS4 and ported natively to the PS5,
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   free-to-play RPG
  </strong>
  that is frankly too good to not be a premium product. Although players can interact and form parties, most of the game's main content can be readily tackled solo. In fact, someone could easily treat the RPG as a single-player experience reminiscent of something like
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Offering an impressive range of classes, build and customization options, and great world-building,
  <em>
   PoE
  </em>
  is an expansive game that can stand alongside most $60+ entries in the genre. Narratively, players find themselves stuck on an island inhabited by ancient gods, whom they naturally must kill if they want to make it back to civilization.

  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  jumped on the battle royal bandwagon with
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  , a free project that has been entering new seasons alongside the franchise's mainline entries. As with every
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  is either the greatest or worst game ever, depending on the person. In truth, Activision's title is a mixed bag that shines in a few key areas. Now, technically, the first
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  ended its run in 2023, with
  <em>
   Warzone 2.0
  </em>
  becoming the franchise's main battle royale. The latter launched in 2022 and is still going strong nowadays.
 </p>
 <p>
  For one,
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  is among the most polished battle royale games on the market. Due to being largely the same as the core releases, the gunplay is fast-paced and satisfying, ranking alongside
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  as the genre's best option in this area. Currently, there are various maps available, which provide a decent amount of variety.
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  also has a couple of extra modes if someone wishes to step away from the standard and quite difficult battle royale.

  Debuting on PC and mobile devices in May 2024,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  was not exactly "new" when it arrived on PS5. However, those extra months in the sun helped some of the original version's rough edges, allowing for the PS5 iteration to be a notable improvement.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the uninitiated, Kuro Games' project is an open-world gacha action RPG that can mostly be played in single-player. The current story will keep most people busy for roughly 20 hours or so, although it is not the most exciting or immersive campaign in existence.
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  is simply fun to play, offering fast-paced combat that has a surprising amount of depth through different resonators, weapons, and echoes (which are, essentially, abilities). If nothing else, the game nails its movement both in and out of battle.

  was, arguably, the first great battle royale release and was responsible for launching the genre into the massive space it is today. There are tons of players out there that love the prospect of battle royale and many still come back to
  <em>
   PUBG
  </em>
  to get their fill of its unique and sometimes punishing gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who want to see and experience the roots of the genre can download the title for free from the PlayStation store and load it up on their PS5. It may not be the most graphically intensive game (especially by today's standards) but it still maintains a level of visual charm that makes it instantly recognizable for most battle royale fans.

  Initially launching with a price tag,
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  eventually went free-to-play, which was the best move the game could have made. The battle royale genre is oversaturated, but Mediatonic's title is a wildly different beast than the likes of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   PUBG
  </em>
  . Rather than be a third-person shooter set in a forever shrinking map,
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  consists of essentially obstacle courses. 60 players compete in a series of mini-games as they try to make the cut for the next round, with the ultimate goal of being the last jelly bean standing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The clever premise is matched by charming visuals and a lighthearted tone that makes rounds fun regardless of whether someone survives or not.
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  is accessible to all ages, and both kids and adults are likely to get a kick out of its wacky but competitive gameplay loop. The mini-games are also varied enough to ensure things do not get repetitive too quickly.

  <em>

  After the proliferation of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  on the online forefront, developer Respawn Entertainment answered back with
  <em>
   Apex Legends.
  </em>
  Respawn Entertainment's battle royale game differs from
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  because it's more focused on combat and doesn't have a building component.
 </p>
 <p>
  Matches have a 60-player count and pit teams of three against each other, pushing coordination and communication to the forefront.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Apex Legends
   </em>
   is also a first-person shooter
  </strong>
  , setting itself apart from
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . Lastly, Respawn's game classifies itself as a Hero Shooter, as it includes various characters who cater to different play styles.

 <p>
  July 2024's first two weeks were jam-packed with huge free game launches. While
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is not on consoles at the moment,
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  are available on the PS5, and they are divisive in their own ways. However, the latter certainly enjoyed the more "positive" overall debut, even if it remains to be seen whether the project manages to stand alongside miHoYo's other juggernaut IPs in the long run.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, despite sharing a developer and gacha mechanics,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  is not that similar to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . Unlike those two releases,
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  places far less emphasis on exploration; in fact, except for a small hub city, the game mostly consists of linear stages and battle arenas. There is no open-world like
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  or expansive cities like
  <em>
   Honkai
  </em>
  . To be clear, that is not meant as a criticism but only as a note to reframe expectations as, ultimately,
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  does its own thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dropped into a post-apocalyptic hellscape, players take charge of a Proxy, who is essentially a leader who guides a team of Agents as they enter portals known as Hollows to clear them of Ethereals, which are the game's enemies. Missions combine combat arenas and grid-style puzzles that slow down the pacing, and the latter can be divisive since they are nowhere near as enjoyable as standard fighting. Still,
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  showcases miHoYo's familiarity with high-octane hack and slash combat, along with the developer's tendency to prioritize team synergy. Unlocking and mastering different
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  characters will dominate most people's time with the game.

  new dialogue confirms that it's aware of Emma Frost's design looking too similar to another character in the game. Released just last December,
  <em>

  </em>
  has made waves with its exciting take on the 6v6 hero shooter genre featuring numerous Marvel characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is launching Season 2 on April 11, with Emma Frost as one of the newest additions to the roster. She is a Vanguard hero with the ability to shield herself and allies, and transform her body into an impervious diamond. In terms of her design, many
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  fans pointed out that she looks a lot like Dagger and Invisible Woman because they all have blonde hair and wear white and blue costumes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  devs are aware of the design similarities, as players discovered a dialogue between Cloak and Dagger and Emma Frost that acknowledges their outfits. In a screenshot shared by Informal-Cod4035, Cloak and Dagger tells Emma, "Look at us! We practically match!" when they encounter each other. It's still unknown if Emma and Invisible Woman will have a dialogue like this if they see each other.

 <p>
  In the comments, a number of

  fans liked that the devs had a sense of humor about Emma's outfit having the same color palette as Dagger. However, many fans have also expressed their concerns on social media, noting that Emma, Cloak and Dagger, and Invisible Woman's designs might cause confusion in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  matches. It's a valid point considering that
  <em>

  ' many match modes can get chaotic at times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, each of the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals

  heroes has distinct roles and abilities that could help players tell them apart. As mentioned, Emma is a Vanguard with shielding abilities, and she's the only one of the three with a short haircut. Cloak and Dagger are a Strategist pair that heals allies, deals damage and stuns enemies, and they can switch between characters. Lastly, Invisible Woman is also a Strategist with shielding and has an Ultimate ability that can turn the whole team invisible.

  Arrowhead Game Studios has just released Patch 01.002.203 for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Helldivers 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , addressing a frustrating bug. This latest
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  patch is concise and specifically fixes an issue with the Autocannon, a popular weapon in the game, which has been disrupting gameplay for players during their missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  came out in 2024 and earned a lot of praise right away for its wild, large-scale battles against Terminids and Automatons, along with its unique satirical patriotism angle. Since its release, Arrowhead’s hit co-op shooter has gotten regular updates, many aimed at tackling the constant bugs that affect how the game plays. Recently, a
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  support agent clarified that the Eruptor weapon wasn’t nerfed in a patch as players feared, but is actually bugged, responding to a wave of support tickets from users reporting unexpected behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Reddit user named PapaToXic56 posted recently about another frustrating weapon bug in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , explaining how the Autocannon stops working after one reload. They tested it several times and noted that other weapons, like the Spear, didn’t have the same problem. The comments section filled up fast as many players chimed in, saying they’d seen it too and felt relieved it wasn’t just them. Arrowhead acted quickly, pushing out Patch 01.002.203 on April 4 to deal with it. The hotfix concentrated only on fixing the autocannon reload glitch, which the developers decided was urgent enough to address before the weekend began.

  Now that the patch is live, the Autocannon in
  <em>

  </em>
  works properly again, bringing relief to players who rely on it during missions. This hotfix arrived just days after update 01.002.202 went out on April 1, 2025, showing Arrowhead’s focus on handling critical problems fast. The studio’s steady and quick support keeps the game running well and shows it's serious about staying connected with the community through constant fixes.

  Asymmetrical horror games are only borderline co-op experiences, and they mostly just fall under the general multiplayer banner. Still, these games can be viewed as cooperative experiences, and
  <em>
   The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
  </em>
  takes things a step further by incorporating teams on both sides rather than going down the 4v1 route. Each match consists of up to four victims and three family members, with the former trying to escape while the latter seeking to kill them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players are largely free to ignore their teammates and do what they want, but
  <em>
   The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
  </em>
  emphasizes coordination and cooperation a bit more than most asymmetrical horror games. If one group works together while the other doesn't, the former will almost certainly win in the end.
 </p>
 <p>
  Debuting in 2023,
  <em>
   The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
  </em>
  has lost quite a bit of steam by this point, meaning that matches can take a while to set up. However, the game should receive a boost during its run on PS Plus Essential, so April 2025 is arguably the best time for new PS5 players to jump on board.

  Joining PS Plus just a month after
  <em>
   Chivalry 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mordhau
  </em>
  is another medieval multiplayer game that sells itself on large-scale warfare. Modes like Invasion and Frontline place players into two teams and let them engage in coordinated battles, so they are technically candidates for online co-op experience since victory is very much a team effort. However, these
  <em>
   Mordhau
  </em>
  modes and
  <em>
   Chivalry 2
  </em>
  fall under the general banner of "multiplayer," and they might not be able to scratch a co-op itch if a group of players specifically want a mode that demands they work together.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately,
  <em>
   Mordhau
  </em>
  also has Horde, which is just a straight-up co-op mode that pits six players against AI enemies.
  <em>
   Mordhau
  </em>
  mostly excels in PvP action, but Horde presents a nice PvE change of pace for those who want something a touch different. In terms of how this mode works, Horde pretty much delivers the routine that its title suggests. Players must fight off increasingly harder waves of enemies, all the while trying to upgrade their equipment to increase their chances of survival. It works well enough for what it is.

  Soulslikes are no strangers to co-op, with many games incorporating player summons in some form or another; however, the mechanic tends to be a small part of most packages rather than a defining feature. Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  series is generally an exception, to the point that the first entry can be hard to recommend as a solo experience. While catering better to single-player runs thanks to the Handler class' good boy companion, the 2023 sequel is still very much sold on its online co-op support that allows three players to take on this difficult but not impossible challenge as a unit.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  expands greatly on its predecessor's selection of archetypes, which are classes. They are all fairly unique and come with a range of skills, perks, and traits that allow for varied gameplay styles that should cater to most people's preferences. Beyond just variety, parties can and should aim for synergy, creating a lineup that caters to different roles like tank and healer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is generally great as far as online co-op PS Plus games are concerned, but it does require an appreciation for Soulslikes and third-person shooters. The game is a fairly "typical" entry in both genres that will likely not hit the mark with people who do not generally enjoy these types of projects. The campaign incorporates procedurally generated elements as well for replayability's sake, although it is primarily related to secondary dungeons. While implemented well, this feature can be divisive since the stages can be a bit nondescript at times.

  Sure,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  can be played and enjoyed solo for 100+ hours without much issue; however, the game pushes its co-op element, something that can be said for most entries in Capcom's franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  has two types of quests: Village and Hub. The former are single-player only and, in total, last about 10 hours. While a bit too easy for veterans, these quests serve as an introduction for newcomers, teaching them the basic skills they will need to stand a chance in the harder missions. Once someone gets through the Village quests or feels confident in their abilities, they should head to the Hub to try out its many hunts, which are far harder and can be played in co-op.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  handles its co-op brilliantly, making it as easy as possible for friends to team up while removing some of the more frustrating elements in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  . Parties can try to synergize their builds to create a well-rounded team; alternatively, they can simply go with their preferred loadout and ignore everything else. As the Hub quests can take quite a long time to complete, co-op makes them easier to digest and arguably more enjoyable.

  is a fantastic action-adventure game with a robust single-player campaign. A few months following the base title's debut, Sucker Punch dropped
  <em>

  </em>
  , a co-op side experience deep enough to justify a standalone release. Along with common modes like Survival,

  also comes with a Story that guides two players through roughly 6 hours of content.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Legends

  A popular first-person action game,
  <em>
   Warhammer: Vermintide 2
  </em>
  is celebrating its five-year anniversary in 2023. Despite its growing age, Fatshark's release is still reasonably active, and it is arguably the best action-oriented
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  game of the last decade.
  <em>
   Vermintide 2
  </em>
  pits the Heroes of Ubersreik against wave after wave of rat-themed enemies, showering them with loot if they manage to survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the vanilla version only has 13 missions (+4 from free updates), the stages are meant to be repeated endlessly as players upgrade their class and weapons.
  <em>
   Vermintide 2
  </em>
  's five playable characters are wildly different from each other, ensuring most people find someone who suits their preferences.

  Supermassive's
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures
  </em>
  is an anthology series that will eventually include 8 games; at the moment, four main entries have been released along with a VR spin-off. While not quite as robust as Supermassive's other horror projects like
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures
  </em>
  ' chapters are consistently great picks for co-op, especially local. In online co-op,
  <em>
   House of Ashes
  </em>
  opts for a shared experience where players get to stir the ship for a while before handing over control to their friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although overshadowed by the couch iteration,
  <em>
   House of Ashes
  </em>
  ' online co-op is a valid option in its own right. Limited to two participants, the game automatically picks who will be actively playing the campaign and decides when to switch control. This system might not be to everyone's fancy, but it does provide a unique co-op experience since one player's actions directly impact the full group.

  Housemarque knows a thing or two about co-op.
  <em>
   Dead Nation
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Resogun
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  all make good use of the feature, and they support both local and online connections. The developer's most recent project,
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  , did not launch with multiplayer, but an online two-player co-op option was added as part of the
  <em>
   Ascension
  </em>
  update. Thanks to this addition, players can now join forces to take on the game's roguelike challenges, and there is the option to use a public or private server.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  is challenging, and co-op does not necessarily make the experience easier. However, it does introduce a revive option into the gameplay loop, granting players a second chance. Otherwise, co-op provides essentially the same core experience as solo runs, albeit with two Selenes rather than just one. As the base package is fantastic, the same can be said about
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  's co-op.

  They might not come around as often as they once did, but it is always an exciting day when a
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
  </em>
  game launches. And, in a nice change of pace from most of the franchise's post-2000s efforts,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  is also great. Looking to recapture the Turtles' beat 'em up glory days, Tribute Games basically created a game ripped right out of the '90s, albeit with enough modern touches for it to come across as a loving homage rather than just an antiquated throwback. Up to six players can join forces to take on the Foot Clan, and they are free to pick from the Turtles, Master Splinter, April, and Casey Jones. Even at face value, that is a more than solid selection for this type of game, and that is before taking into account each character's unique traits. All the playable figures bring something fresh to the table, so even solo players can enjoy replaying the campaign by switching between the characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gameplay-wise,
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  sticks fairly close to the standard beat 'em up formula. The characters have a limited but satisfying moveset, and the levels pack a considerable punch. The boss fights are quite difficult and require mastery of the combat system's mechanics to overcome. The stages are overflowing with references to
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  's past, and the nods cover many of the franchise's sides rather than just its gaming history.

  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is the most famous asymmetrical multiplayer game on the market, and that seems unlikely to change anytime soon. The game pits four survivors against one killer, with many of the available characters being based on popular IPs (although there are several original creations too). While one side of the equation will not be cooperating with anyone, the survivors should try to work together since they are considerably weaker than any of the killers. That said, players are largely left to their own devices, so they can decide themselves whether they wish to prioritize communication or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is kind of a weird inclusion as it is primarily advertised as an online multiplayer rather than co-op experience, which makes sense since matches are PvP rather than a group of players against AI. Nevertheless, it still works well as a co-op game, and it is among the best and most popular titles on PS Plus.

  2018's
  <em>
   Tetris Effect
  </em>
  gave the ultimate classic video game a contemporary makeover, creating a modern reimagining that stuck true to the original's blueprint while carving out a unique identity all of its own. That version was and still is fantastic, an easy recommendation for players craving a robust puzzle game designed around solo content. In 2020,
  <em>
   Tetris Effect: Connected
  </em>
  hit the market, an upgrade that – as suggested by its subtitle – focused on multiplayer. Providing a fairly addictive PvP experience, this iteration incorporated a range of modes that complement the gameplay loop. While
  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  is largely associated with single-player content, the franchise is obviously a good match for competitive play, and
  <em>
   Connected
  </em>
  showcases as much.
 </p>
 <p>
  As fun as PvP is,
  <em>
   Tetris Effect: Connected
  </em>
  is specifically named after its online co-op mode. This option allows a few players to share the screen as they work towards completing separate puzzles while taking on an AI opponent. On the surface, this might sound like a basic implementation of co-op that does not add all that much to the core experience; however,
  <em>
   Connected
  </em>
  has one great twist: the players' puzzles combine to create a single canvas. This development is a treat whenever it triggers during matches, and it creates a cooperative exchange that works wonders.

  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  is a first-person co-op shooter reminiscent of
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  . Turtle Rock's project wears its influences on its sleeve, which is hardly a terrible thing considering the market is not flooded with these sorts of titles.
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  has solid gameplay and visuals, along with a card-based customization system that permits players to tweak their loadouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The differences between
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  's playable survivors are not skin-deep either. Each character has unique traits and default weapons, which encourages teams to craft parties consisting of survivors that bring the best out of each other. Even though it is not a masterpiece and has had a fairly short lifespan for this type of project,
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  is more than good enough to keep a group of friends engaged for a few hours.

  Another zombie shooter akin to something like
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Zombie Army 4: Dead War
  </em>
  is for those people who prefer a third-person perspective. Even though the game does not quite have the same name recognition as either of those projects, it is a respectable entry in the subgenre. As is always the case, four players can join forces to blast their way through fairly self-contained levels filled with a colorful and grotesque assortment of flesh-eaters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Zombie Army 4
  </em>
  shakes things up by being set after World War 2 and granting a Nazi coat of paint to its armies of the walking dead. This setting is the element that distinguishes the game the most from its peers, and the campaign makes good use of the premise.
  <em>
   Zombie Army 4
  </em>
  guides players through an over-the-top and entertaining story that is long enough to feel substantial without overstaying its welcome. Along with a decent selection of weapons,
  <em>
   Dead War
  </em>
  uses a rewarding perk system that adds some flavor to combat.

  <em>

  is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for co-op-driven action-platformer games. All the franchise's titles are worth seeking out, however, PS Plus subscribers will need to settle for
  <em>
   Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince
  </em>
  . Despite the number in its title, this entry can be enjoyed without prior knowledge of its predecessors, so newcomers can start here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Trine 4
  </em>
  follows three heroes (a mage, thief, and knight) as they go on an epic fantasy-laden adventure that tests their might and teamwork. While not devoid of combat, the campaign focuses on puzzles and platforming, with the former requiring creative use of the characters' abilities. In solo runs, players can switch between the characters with the click of a button; in co-op, each user takes charge of one hero.
  <em>
   Trine 4
  </em>
  features two modes: Classic and Unlimited. The former ties three players to specific heroes, while the latter allows four users to swap to any character whenever they want.

  October 2024's PS Plus Extra and Premium lineup had quite a few online co-op options.
  <em>
   Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed
  </em>
  is an asymmetrical multiplayer game that lets people take charge of either ghostbusters or ghosts, while
  <em>
   Firefighting Simulator The Squad
  </em>
  allows four players to team up to battle fires.
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me
  </em>
  is another one of Supermassive's short but generally engaging horror experiences, and it is a fine entry that should hit the mark with people who enjoyed the other stories in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  While all those are decent titles, the month's headline act was
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  , both in terms of general size and also co-op support. After spending a long time in development hell, this sequel finally materialized in 2023 and, to everybody's surprise, was pretty good!
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  drops players in Los Angeles and mostly encourages them to kill every zombie in their wake, and there are plenty of them. Everything is framed through missions that gradually open up small-ish self-contained maps, so the campaign is fairly streamlined. The story is nothing special, but the combat is pretty awesome, especially the melee side of things.
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  indulges in gore and excess, delivering an addictive and satisfying gameplay loop that is enhanced with a few RPG elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Co-op is implemented fairly well and becomes available within the first hour of a playthrough. Players can pick from six slayers, who are essentially classes with unique skills. That said, they are not that different, and a party can include duplicates.
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  is a blast solo and even better with friends.

  FromSoftware's
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  games incorporate a unique form of multiplayer that enables players to visit each other's worlds, and the
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  remake is no exception. Depending on the item used, players can either invade and engage in PvP or be summoned to provide a helping hand. While the former tends to get more attention, the latter is also a common practice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to four players can convene to take on the game's plethora of challenging fights, with the helpers being sent back to their universes if they die or take down a boss. It should be noted that while co-op is ongoing, two invaders can also show up to add a PvP twist to the tale, so players should always be on their toes.

  </em>
  's co-op is kind of weird. On the one hand, it is an exciting feature that should and does serve as a selling point for the game. Conversely, co-op is added fairly haphazardly, with the extra players essentially being along for the ride rather than active parts of the story. The feature also came with its share of bugs, although Techland has released quite a few updates with fixes since the game's debut.
 </p>
 <p>
  Putting aside all that stuff,
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  's gameplay loop is so fun and addictive that bringing on a few friends naturally adds to the mayhem, even if some aspects of co-op are a bit broken. Set in an impressively designed open-world, the game is all about parkour and movement, encouraging players to free-run across buildings and streets while fighting off both zombies and humans. While not necessarily scary,
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  can be very intense, particularly at night when the infected flood the streets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, it should be noted that only the host player can progress in their story, which can be a bit frustrating for people planning to play through the whole campaign together. Still, everyone keeps their acquired items, so it is not like they receive no progression.

   The Division 2

  builds on its predecessor's solid foundations. The action RPG tries to be both a single-player third-person shooter and a live-service always-online experience, and, for the most part, it does an impressive job.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main story will keep players engaged for a good 30 hours, and this section can be largely enjoyed solo. Alternatively, most of the campaign can be experienced in co-op, which unlocks after the story's intro is completed. In comparison, the endgame content revolves heavily around PvP and online co-op. Four players can combine to create squads and take on missions, while that number is doubled for raids.

  PS Plus Extra has a few co-op games capable of scratching someone's "blast zombies in the face" itch, and
  <em>
   Killing Floor 2
  </em>
  compares favorably with any of its peers. Despite being fairly old by this point, the 2016 release holds up well thanks to its enjoyably over-the-top core gameplay loop along with a surprisingly addictive progression system. The campaign guides teams through a series of levels filled with wave after wave of enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Killing Floor 2
  </em>
  's gameplay loop is not complicated, and it is arguably simpler than games like
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  ; however, it is complemented by Perks that essentially serve as classes. Coming with unique abilities and weapons, each Perk can be leveled up, which adds a lot of replayability to the package.
  <em>
   Killing Floor 2
  </em>
  supports up to 6 players simultaneously, and this is one of those games that simply needs to be experienced in co-op. Technically, single-player is an option, and while not unplayable, it is not great either.

  In 2023,
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  celebrated its 10th anniversary, and the co-op shooter is still as popular as ever. The game has a simple but brilliant premise: team up with friends to pull off heists. It is possible to take on missions solo, but
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  is intended to be experienced with a consistent group of friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  The progression system revolves around unlocking better gear and skills, both of which play significant roles in enhancing a crew's professionalism. Consequently, players genuinely feel like they are improving with each new heist as their crew gradually morphs into a well-oiled machine.

  To start "
  <strong>
   A Collection of Crests
  </strong>
  ," you'll first need to gain access to Yasuke as a playable character. Once you've done that, you'll want to visit Kyoto, Yamashiro as Yasuke. Look for the quest marker in the southern section of the city, just below the southeast corner of Honnoji Temple. There, you'll meet Ota Gyuichi, the former scribe to Oda Nobunaga, and an acquaintance of Yasuke's.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking to Ota Gyuichi will initiate "A Collection of Crests," and set you on the path to finding all nine Kamon Crests in
  <em>
   AC Shadows
  </em>

  Square Enix recently announced that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Nier: Automata
   </strong>
  </em>
  has sold over nine million copies globally to date. Released in early 2017,
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  continues to find praise from critics and players alike for its unique world, compelling characters, and evocative soundtrack.
 </p>
 <p>
  A sequel to the 2010 title
  <em>
   Nier
  </em>
  and a spin-off of the
  <em>
   Drakengard
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  instantly garnered critical acclaim following its release in 2017, selling over 1.5 million copies in its first two months. The action RPG snagged a number of year-end awards, with many of these prizes highlighting the game's soundtrack and game design. Years later, the title is still serving as a major influence on the gaming world, with a recent
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  crossover showing just how much staying power the PlatinumGames action role-playing romp has. According to the game's publisher, sales of the game have continued their upward trend.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  has officially shipped over nine million units worldwide, with the most recent figure accounting for both physical and digital sales. In February 2024, it was announced that the game had sold eight million copies, meaning that
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  has shipped one million units over the last 10 months alone. Interest in the title doesn't seem to be waning, as a
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  anime series premiered in January 2023 and a bizarre dinner show inspired by the game was held in Tokyo on December 29.

 <p>
  The future of the
  <em>
   Nier
  </em>
  series has been the subject of recent fan speculation, as director Yoko Taro and other developers began teasing a new project in May 2024. However, earlier in December, it was reported that some high-level developers had left PlatinumGames, with many fans quickly expressing concern over the fate of future titles. Given the continued popularity of
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  and the appearance of its characters in other titles, the possibility of a third game in the series still seems likely, despite the lack of any concrete announcements.

  Following the release of
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  in April 2024, Yoko Taro told IGN Japan that the game was better than
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  , praising the title's graphics and appeal.
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's director, Kim Hyung Tae, brushed off the compliments, simply saying that his game "couldn't compete." While a new
  <em>
   Nier
  </em>
  entry seems feasible at some point down the line, Taro's body of work is vast and varied, with his recent
  <em>
   Voice of Cards
  </em>
  trilogy highlighting his ability to branch out and try new things.

  One imaginative
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has reimagined Mei, Juno, and Sigma as space aliens in a new collection of concept art. These characters are part of the vast catalog of heroes available in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , which still remains one of the most popular hero shooters around today.
 </p>
 <p>
  Released in 2023,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is a hero shooter game that picked up the baton from its highly successful predecessor, 2016's
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  . Though not quite as well-received as the original, it still has a huge player base and sees significant daily engagement. However, in recent times, the Blizzard Entertainment-developed title has faced stiff competition from a new entrant in the genre,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . While its Marvel-themed rival is gaining momentum quickly,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  hasn't stopped attracting tens of thousands of players every day across different platforms, with a 24-hour peak of 33.4k Steam players at the time of writing. Due to its popularity, it is often the inspiration for unique fan creations, some of which represent the game's characters from a refreshing perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Reddit, user jezjhart posted their concept art that reimagines
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  characters in outer space-themed skins. The art depicts popular heroes, namely Mei, Sigma, and Juno, in noticeably different forms compared to their in-game models. These tweaked characters have been named Astro Mei, Deep Space Sigma, and Unknown Species Juno, respectively, by the talented fan. While Mei has been given an astronaut-like costume, Juno appears to belong to an alien species. Moreover, Sigma also looks intriguingly distinct, with a skin reminiscent of a glimpse into star-studded space. Jezjhart revealed that the skins are the result of their "fifth attempt" at making skins for the hero shooter title.

 <p>
  Jezjhart's fan concept showing

  heroes in a new light has been received positively in the Overwatch subreddit, getting more than 2.5k upvotes so far. Several fans praised Sigma's skin concept in particular, with some comments commending the design as "really fun" and "absolutely dope." A few different users also said that they would be ready to purchase the tank-type hero's Deep Space Sigma skin concept if it became available in the game. Another user jokingly suggested that Mei's Astro Mei skin should be renamed "AstronoMei."

  studio's efforts with player-requested features like this one signals its intention to hold its own ground amid strong competition from
  <em>

 </p>
 <p>
  The gameplay in
  <em>
   +1 Block Per Click
  </em>
  is quite typical for a training simulator genre. Players just need to click to increase Strength. And the higher your Strength stat, the faster you will break blocks with your pickaxe. Moreover, players can boost their training by equipping pets. And to hatch rare pets from the first minutes of the game, you can use the help of
  <em>
   +1 Block Per Click
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Codes will reward you with items and currencies, such as wins. Just a few of them will be enough to quickly complete the first world. But it is worth noting that after some time after the release, each code expires, and the rewards become no longer available. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not postpone using them.

   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

  has seen its fair share of glitches and bugs since it launched in October, but an ongoing problem in the beloved Free-For-All mode has been particularly frustrating for players. While
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  has been a stronger release compared to some of its more recent predecessors, some glitches in the game have been persistent issues, and Free-For-All is seeing one of the game's biggest problems of all.

  When playing Free-For-All in
  <em>

  </em>
  , the goal is to be the first player to reach 30 kills. This seems pretty straightforward, but the glitch that is plaguing players has been barring seemingly rightful winners from the title of victor. Despite a player racking up the necessary 30 kills, the mode won't register them as the winner of the match, which has left many confused.

  A Long-Running Issue That Has Yet to Be Addressed

 <p>
  According to many players on Reddit, this issue has been happening since
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 1 started. That was on November 14, meaning this massive glitch has been continuing to irk players for close to two months. Player Eye_Of_Apollo posted to Reddit, stating that they had documented 200 instances of them being the official winner, only to not be given the victory. The frustrated player further stated, "I have reported it everywhere and to my knowledge, Treyarch, has not acknowledged it." Fellow players, like Raydeeoo0818, replied to the post, stating, "I don't know why they haven't fixed this yet."

  There are theories as to why this is the case, though. Reddit user Friendly_Pitch7039 suggested that these seemingly incorrect end-game scores could be due to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  registering assists as eliminations. While this would make sense as to why this is happening, it would also add to the frustration, as this method is counter-productive to the goal of Free-For-All. Counting assists as eliminations makes sense in a team-based match, but Free-For-All pits every player against each other, which could make this assist approach arguably unfair in this specific mode. There have been a variety of issues plaguing
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , and Treyarch's lack of response regarding the Free-For-All glitch has left many unhappy.

 <p>
  As of now, it's unclear whether the glitch will be fixed soon or not, but a patch will hopefully arrive in the coming weeks. While there may potentially be a good reason for Treyarch to not outright address the problem at hand, the silence also leaves many frustrated. Also, with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's player count on Steam dropping by over 30% since its launch, not responding to the community may only cause that number to drop even lower.

     Another major glitch to hit
     <em>
      Black Ops 6
     </em>
     was the recent Archie's Festival Frenzy holiday event. Thanks to a strange glitch, a lot of players were automatically given thousands of Jolly Archies, which served as the special currency for the event. This influx of Jolly Archies allowed players to instantly unlock the event's rewards.

  Unfortunately, sometimes fixes like this take longer than some would like, so it may be a while until Treyarch is able to make Free-For-All run as smoothly as frustrated players want. On the other hand, Treyarch may have intended to count the mode's scores this way all along. It may not be entirely clear, but until a potential fix gets brought to the mode, Free-For-All players may have to expect a potential loss, even if it seems as though they are winning.
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  has faced several controversies since its launch, but Treyarch will hopefully fine tune the game as the weeks and months pass.

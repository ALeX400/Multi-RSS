  Defeating General Teo when you face him as Pahn is a tricky feat in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Suikoden
   </strong>
  </em>
  , especially if you don't know it's coming and haven't prepared Pahn appropriately. Failing to defeat Teo will result in Pahn's death and the permanent loss of a Star of Destiny, which will also lock you out of the true ending to the game.

 <p>
  To defeat General Teo in
  <em>
   Suikoden
  </em>
  , you'll need to know how to read his attacks and counter them appropriately. You'll also need to level up Pahn and ensure he's loaded up with the best available armor. You'll additionally want to level his weapon up as high as it can go for this point in the game (level 12) so that he does a decent amount of damage.

 <p>
  To make sure you're ready to fight General Teo as Pahn, you're going to want to make sure that he's leveled up as high as possible, equipped with the best armor and accessories you can get, and that his weapon is leveled up as high as it can go.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   To go into more detail, you'll ideally want to get Pahn to level 30 at minimum.
  </strong>
  This shouldn't be too difficult by this point in the game, especially if Pahn has been in your active party, but if you're having trouble you should put him in a party with as few other members as possible to funnel more EXP into him. You can grind against enemies in areas like Scarleticia Castle or Soniere Prison to get good results here (and choosing the latter will allow you a chance to find the Opal needed to recruit another character).

  <strong>
   In terms of armor, Pahn should be wearing Ninja Garb, Headgear, and two Guard Rings.
  </strong>
  Luckily, all of this can be purchased from the Armor Shop in Antei, or the armor shop at your Castle if you've ever visited the Armor Shop in Antei. With Pahn armored up and leveled up, the last thing you'll want to do is level up his weapon.
  <strong>
   You should be able to get his weapon to level 12 with the Blacksmiths available at this stage in the story
  </strong>
  (Go to Teian and see the Blacksmith there), which will help out a lot.

  General Teo McDohl is a formidable opponent, especially at this point in the game, but fortunately, he suffers from the same weakness as all other duel opponents: Calling his Attacks.
  <strong>
   If you know how to interpret his lines before each turn starts, you can consistently predict exactly what actions he'll take
  </strong>
  , and counter accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's a breakdown of all his quotes and the actions associated with them:
 </p>
 <div class="table-container">
  <table align="" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="" summary="">
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td>

     </td>

    <tr>
     <td>
      <p>
       Is that all you've got? Now it's my turn!
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       This next one will not get past me!
      </p>

       It seems you are not to be underestimated...
      </p>

      <p>
       Impossible... Take this then!
      </p>

       Impressive, Pahn, seeing through my attack like that. I must be more cautious.

      <p>
       Impressive, Pahn.
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       What's the matter, Pahn? Going to come at me again?
      </p>

     <td>
      <p>
       My most powerful technique...
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <p>
       Forever on the Defensive, Pahn? I shall not hold back!
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       It seems I lost my cool. I must be more careful.
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       Let us see if you can read my attack, Pahn.
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <p>
       My Sword is still as sharp as ever!
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       Come at me, Pahn.
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       This one will hit its mark!
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      <p>
       This feeling in my hands... This is true combat!
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       Very wise, Pahn.
      </p>
     </td>
     <td>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
 </div>
 <p>
  By using this table, you can plan your moves. Attack whenever he Defends, use Special whenever he Attacks, and Defend whenever he uses his Special. With this, plus the stat bonuses from Pahn's weapon, equipment, and level, you should be able to take down General Teo.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a reward for beating General Teo, Pahn will survive and continue to be a part of the Liberation Army, which is crucial if you want to get the game's true ending (or just like having Pahn in your party).

   <em>
    Sea of Thieves
   </em>
  </strong>
  has revealed its collaboration with
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , adding a variety of items inspired by Bungie's game. Rumors about the new
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  crossover had been circulating for some time, with the official announcement revealing that the collaboration had been in the works since 2023.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  was released by Bungie in 2017, introducing players to an immersive sci-fi world with exciting combat and memorable characters like Cayde-6. Placing players in the role of Guardians, they must defend humanity's Last City in the solar system, under attack from villains.
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  was released by Rare in 2018, letting players turn into pirates. With a vast world to explore, players can sail the seas, amass loot, and face dangers such as the Megalodon and the Kraken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  has launched the previously rumored crossover, adding cosmetics based on
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . Players can purchase the Lightbearer Ship Bundle, with a collector's figurehead, collector's sails, hull, and flag in the design of Ghost, Traveler's robot companion in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . The Mighty, Silent, and Wise bundles contain the same items inspired by the Titan, Hunter, and Warlock classes. Those who want the full experience of customizing their
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  ships can buy the Lightbearer Big Bundle, a huge collection with all the items from the other four bundles.

   </em>
  </strong>
  for nearly thirty years, one of the most fascinating ones has been the commitment to featuring prominent and gorgeous pieces of artwork to litter the world. Sinister environments from
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , such as the Spencer Mansion and the Raccoon City Police Department, have become iconic locations in gaming, and many of them have also featured some absolutely spectacular paintings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of them have been purely decorative, designed to enhance the aesthetic of the world or create a symbolic connection to the protagonist, while others have figured into some of the games' most intriguing puzzles. These works of art have been a major part of the franchise since it debuted in 1996, adorning the creeping hallways and walls of the franchise's numerous locales. Capcom always puts a ton of effort into both the large and small details, making sure that these haunting works of art stick with the player well after they've survived the hordes of zombies and horrific Umbrella creations.

 <p>
  As Claire and Leon explore the crumbling Raccoon City Police Department during the events of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 2 Remake
   </strong>
  </em>
  , they come to discover its origins as a museum, explaining the numerous pieces of incredible artwork that litter the disintegrating hallways of the building. And one particular piece stands out, as the duo find it in the Art Room, which is located on the second floor, hidden behind some boxes piled up against the wall. Situated neatly behind the boxes is a painting that features a young girl peering behind the shadows, and it can be easily missed during a playthrough, as the Art Room is a rather small excursion that isn't revisited later.
 </p>
 <p>
  The painting is dark and moody, as the girl ominously stares over the boxes, casting a surreal energy in the room. The girl herself could represent Sherry Birkin, the wayward daughter of scientists William and Annette, as she's dressed in a similar outfit and is neglected behind the boxes. Either way, this haunting piece of art is one of the best paintings in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2 Remake
  </em>
  , a stark reminder of the strange sort of place that the RCPD was back when it was a museum.

 <p>
  After Sherry Birkin is abducted by Brian Irons, the twisted chief of the Raccoon City Police Department, Claire finds herself exploring previously unseen areas of the building. And, it's in the Private Collection Room, located right next to Irons' office, where she can find one of the most fascinating paintings in the game. Upon close inspection, the painting appears to act as a symbol of the complicated relationship between Sherry, her mother Annette, and Claire.
 </p>
 <p>
  The painting is a real one, known as The Toilette of Venus, and was done by Francois Boucher. Its inclusion in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2 Remake
  </em>
  is a fascinating one, as it could be seen as a way to represent the dysfunctional relationship between Sherry and Annette, as the children floating around Venus are willfully ignored in a similar manner. The color red features prominently, as well, guiding the children in the same way that Claire does with Sherry. It is a magnificent work of art that ties in brilliantly to the themes of Claire's campaign, as femininity and the fragility of motherhood are front and center.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  remains one of the most fascinating games in the franchise, as the journey of S.T.A.R.S. rookie Rebecca Chambers, alongside escaped convict Billy Coen, takes them from the confined corridors of an Umbrella-operated train known as the Ecliptic Express to a training facility infested with zombies and monsters. And as the pair make their way through the facility, they find a truly compelling piece of art in the cafeteria, one that seems to mirror the harrowing adventure that they find themselves on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The painting is situated over a dead zombie, depicting a violent war between ancient soldiers. It's made even more poignant by the zombie lying dead below it, as his positioning is similar to that of the fallen men in the painting. Its symbolic representation of an ongoing, seemingly never-ending cycle of destruction and violence is made real with the dead zombie below, adding a sense of gravitas to a game already rich in subtext and operatic musings.

  The heroes of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  first encountered the mythic Spencer Mansion back on the PS1 in 1996, but when Capcom decided to remake the title for the GameCube in 2002, they upgraded all the pre-rendered backgrounds and improved on many aspects of the original. And, one of the benefits of the upgraded visuals was the ability for Capcom to include higher resolution, more dynamic paintings to populate the walls of the Spencer Mansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was originally a stained-glass window at the top of the steps in the Entrance Hall became an absolutely gorgeous work of art, a tall painting that doubles as a door to the cemetery, a brand-new area for the remake. A pair of robed figures stand praying, perhaps each of them representing the duality of Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, the two playable protagonists of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 1
  </em>
  . The player must pass through both of them on the way to a cemetery, so perhaps it also represents Jill and Chris' souls being prayed over as they both enter the land of the dead.

 <p>
  One of the first areas visited after their arrival in the dreaded Spencer Mansion, the Dining Hall is home to one of the best paintings in the series and one that keenly ties into the puzzle with the grandfather clock next to it. Featuring two feuding swordsmen who have run each other through with their blades, this incredible painting is both a striking piece of art and a clue to the puzzle needed to open the clock and grab the Shield Key.
 </p>
 <p>
  The puzzle reads, "When the two have run each other through, the path to your destiny will open," which is reflected perfectly in the painting next to the clock. The painting could also be seen to represent Barry Burton, who turns traitor during the game due to being blackmailed by the duplicitous Albert Wesker, as neither swordsman seems to be coming out of the conflict looking too well. It's one of the franchise's most incredible paintings, as it ties in both with the lore and is a key part of the game design as well.

  A lot of aspects can be adjusted when you want to take a photo, such as changing the orientation mode, switching the in-game time, and customizing the Zois' poses and facial expressions. If you want to alter the character's expression or want them to use certain poses,
  <strong>
   click on the Zoi in the middle of the camera screen
  </strong>
  . A white outline can be seen if you hover over the character. There will be Expressions and Poses for you to tinker with. Of course, only one of each can be used at a time.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Expression
   </strong>
   : Change your Zoi's facial expression for the picture. A total of 10 basic expressions are available to choose from, and you can even use the Facial Capture facility by clicking the smiley face icon at the bottom right to upload new expressions.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Poses
   </strong>
   : Over 40 poses can be adopted to change your Zoi's poses while taking the picture. There are static and dynamic poses, and similar to expression, you can upload videos or images of a pose to integrate them into the game.
  </li>

  Open-world games often implement some way of traveling beyond simply walking or running, especially when it comes to huge maps where getting from A to B can seem daunting and potentially even boring. As such, vehicles and animals have become equally popular ways to traverse the landscape, with some unique and iconic mounts being born in the process.
 </p>
 <p>
  While some open-world games allow the player to fly via equipment or skill, like Batman's cape in the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  series or the flying suit in
  <em>
   Anthem,
  </em>
  others take a different approach. This list includes the
  <strong>
   best open-world games with flying mounts
  </strong>
  that players can tame, summon, ride, and fight alongside.

  There is no denying that
  <em>
   <strong>
    ARK: Survival Evolved
   </strong>
  </em>
  has had its fair share of problems, with its remaster
  <em>
   Survival Ascended
  </em>
  getting even more slack in its early access stage. However, it has remained a solid favorite to many for its unique concept and mechanics, offering addictive gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   ARK: Survival Evolved
  </em>
  pits players against dangerous wildlife, environments, and other players. Alongside the typical survival features — crafting, resource management, base-building — players can tame
  <strong>
   dinosaurs and mythical creatures
  </strong>
  such as Wyverns
  <strong>
  </strong>
  and train them to gather materials and fight, as well as
  <strong>
   use them as mounts
  </strong>
  .

  It may be surprising to hear that the first
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games were not initially a big success, but the slow and difficult start to the franchise has long since been forgotten. As well as branching into different media, the games have also developed, finally embracing the open-world genre.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
   </strong>
  </em>
  are the first mainline
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  titles to do so, allowing players to explore in a new way and find new Pokemon. Naturally, new ways to travel were also introduced; the Dragon-type
  <strong>
   Koraidon
  </strong>
  (
  <em>
   Scarlet
  </em>
  ) and
  <strong>
   Miraidon
  </strong>
  (
  <em>
   Violet
  </em>
  )
  <strong>
   can be ridden on land, in water, and in the air
  </strong>
  as a diverse way to explore every corner of the map.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  has become somewhat notorious for its blatant similarities to the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games — namely the "Pal" designs and collecting mechanics — but it would be unfair to completely strip it of merit. At its core,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is a survival game with crafting, base-building, and hunger management, drawing inspiration from other titles like
  <em>
   ARK.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Pal taming system is one of the main appeals of the game, with the variety of
  <strong>
   captured creatures being available for combat and as mounts
  </strong>
  — with some amazing flying Pals available to cruise through the skies. Complete with gunplay and the option to go multiplayer,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is a fun indie title to play with friends.

  Compared to Ubisoft's huge titles like
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Far Cry,
  </em>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora
   </strong>
  </em>
  is much less talked about, but there's no denying that it is a beautiful game. As a Na'vi, the player must confront the RDA as they invade Pandora, while grappling with their conflicted identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of how lush and stunning the environments are, exploration is a major draw of the game. Fortunately, players are able to ride an
  <strong>
   ikran
  </strong>
  (also known as a banshee) to soar across the expansive landscape. Once the ikran has been made available after the "Take Flight" quest, players can also unlock skills that improve the mount's abilities.

  Despite being disappointingly lackluster on its initial release, the space survival game
  <em>
   <strong>
    No Man's Sky
   </strong>
  </em>
  has since improved dramatically, transforming the bare-bones content into a much more fleshed-out game with over 37 major updates having released since launch. Updates expanding on base-building, combat, and quests have made it a lot more enjoyable.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the mechanics that was added in v3.20 was the ability to
  <strong>
   tame pets and ride them
  </strong>
  . Like the rest of the planets, the animals are procedurally generated, so there is no knowing what weird alien creatures players will come across. Mounts' usefulness is variable, but they are silly and fun to ride nonetheless.

  As a sandbox game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Terraria
   </strong>
  </em>
  throws players straight into a random 2D world with no direction, leaving them to experiment and explore as much or as little as they like. There is plenty to discover, from diverse biomes to strange enemies to special items, but it also allows simplistic base-building for players who don't feel like going on a dangerous adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  To make exploring a bit more interesting, players can summon a variety of unique mounts, provided they have the relevant item. Pre-Hardmode, players can

   ride the giant Bee
  </strong>
  , while
  <strong>
   flying mounts like Pigron and Rudolph
  </strong>
  are accessible in Hardmode.

  Over a decade after the game's initial release, gamers are still returning to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  , whether it's for the immersive fantasy world, the role-playing potential, or the numerous possible builds. Following the main questlines, exploring the wilderness, and living life as a merchant are all equally fun, but underscoring it all is the epic knowledge that the player is imbued with the blood of a dragon.
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of the
  <em>
   Dragonborn
  </em>
  DLC (which is included in the
  <em>
   Special Edition
  </em>
  ), players have the
  <strong>
   ability to ride a dragon
  </strong>
  by learning the "Bend Will" shout. While they can't be controlled manually, players can fast-travel while mounted, and giving a dragon commands will direct it where to go. Ultimately, riding a dragon in full dragon-bone armor is very cool.

  When it comes to fantasy, Tolkien is undoubtedly one of the most legendary figures, leaving behind a huge legacy and one of the biggest testaments to world-building ever.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Middle-earth: Shadow of War
   </strong>
  </em>
  pays homage to both Tokien's works and Peter Jackson's interpretations in an open-world action game that is just as epic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between slaying orcs and embarking on a quest to defeat Sauron, players have plenty of opportunities to roam Middle-earth, encountering beasts along the way. Fellbeast-like
  <strong>
   Drakes can be broken to ride
  </strong>
  . With the "Dragon Song" skill, the player can summon a Drake to fly and breathe fire on anyone who dares stand in their way.

  The
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  franchise is one of the most popular, with the book series being one of the best-selling series of all time.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </strong>
  </em>
  is another entry into the roster of licensed games, taking place at the iconic school of magic in the 1890s amid Ranrok's goblin rebellion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the exciting plot about a student grappling with an ability to wield ancient magic, there are plenty of RPG elements to make the most of, like character customization and progression. Throughout the main questline, players will unlock mounts; the
  <strong>
   Thestral and the Hippogryff
  </strong>
  are two mythical beasts that players will have
  <strong>
   fun gliding around Hogwarts
  </strong>
  on.

  The

  games are most memorable for their intriguing worlds and concepts,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Forbidden West

  being no exception. On the one hand, there is a beautiful post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce, and the people left are living similar to early humans. On the other hand, there is ancient technology, AI gods, mechanical dinosaurs, and a deadly plague threatening to end what remains of humanity.

   Sunwing is a flying machine

  not dissimilar to a Pterosaur, which is accessible after completing "Cauldron GEMINI" during the fourteenth main quest, "Gemini." The Sunwing is not as fortified as some of the other machines, but it's much faster and has the unique perk of dropping players into hard-to-reach locations.

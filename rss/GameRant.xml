      <title>Insomniac’s X-Men Game Has a Big Choice to Make if It Includes Magneto</title>

  Even though nothing has been officially announced yet, many Marvel fans are eagerly anticipating Insomniac's upcoming
  <em>
   <strong>
    X-Men
   </strong>
  </em>
  game. Allegedly releasing by 2030, Insomniac is set to finally let players explore the titular team, and the potential alone is extremely exciting. But, as the release date nears, the studio will have one major decision regarding
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  's version of the team's greatest adversary, Magneto.

  For years, Magneto has been constantly at odds with the X-Men team. He has been the villainous face they have fought against through many of the live-action films, has constantly butted heads with them in comics, and his dynamic with Charles Xavier has formed the backbone of the franchise. Yet, Marvel Studio's first foray into the team has made the iconic Mutant the leader of the X-Men rather than its enemy, which has made for some great television. And these drastically different adaptations have seemingly left Insomniac with a pretty hard decision as it forges ahead with its own
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  adventure.

  Magneto Was the X-Men's Biggest Adversary For Years
 </h3>
 <p>
  While Magneto has played many roles in the comics, the general audiences' perception of him has been as a villainous figure since Fox's first
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  film in 2000. In that trilogy, Magneto constantly fought back against the titular team through a variety of different schemes.
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  saw him attempt to mutate the leaders of the world,
  <em>
   X2
  </em>
  originally sees him ally with the team before attempting to take out humanity, and
  <em>
   X-Men: The Last Stand
  </em>
  sees him go to war against humanity's attempt to create a cure. Through every film, it has been up to the
  <em>
  </em>
  X-Men to stop him while they also fight back against humans that wish to do them harm.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  prequel trilogy presented a bit of a different dynamic with Magneto and the team, but he was still ultimately an adversary by the end of it. The only films where he was on their side for the majority of the story were
  <em>
   First Class
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Days of Future Past
  </em>
  , yet even in those films he would be at odds with the team eventually. Because of that, many viewers have seen him as the X-Men's greatest villain for years. However,
  <em>
   X-Men '97
  </em>
  has changed that.

 <h3 id="x-men-39-97-has-taken-magneto-in-a-different-direction">
  X-Men '97 Has Taken Magneto in a Different Direction
 </h3>
 <p>
  Instead of having him be a villain,
  <em>
   X-Men '97
  </em>
  has seen him take charge of the team after Professor X perished in the original series. This has given him a completely new dynamic with the team, with many of them being forced to learn how to work alongside him after spending years fighting against him. Additionally, it means that he must learn how to follow Charles Xavier's ideals, even if it pains him to do so. That story has made for some fantastic television, with many regarding it as one of the best things Marvel has done in years.

 <p>
  It also means that Insomniac will be facing a major decision with its version of Magneto. The studio could simply follow in the footsteps of a lot of
  <em>
   X-Men
  </em>
  media and have him be the villain once more, or it could follow
  <em>
   X-Men '97
  </em>
  's example by having him be more of an anti-hero. If neither of those approaches interest it, then it could attempt to do something completely new with the character, as it has done with Spider-Man. As long as it makes sense within the context of the character, many things could be rich storytelling veins.

 <p>
  Since Magneto is such a major part of the X-Men canon, he will likely show up in some fashion in
  <em>
   Marvel's X-Men
  </em>
  . There is also a chance that he appears first in
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  , as that will probably start setting up what is to come. Fans will just have to wait and see just what the studio has planned, but based on its previous Marvel projects, it seems like he will be in good hands.

  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  titles that is perfect for players tired of classic racing. In it, you have to train and use different pets to become stronger and win races. You can use

  The gameplay of
  <em>
   Bike Race Simulator
  </em>
  is basic, as you just need to click quickly to ride at maximum speed during the race. However, this is not enough to win. Thanks to pets and training, your opponents have a much higher top speed. To get closer to them at a faster speed, we recommend using codes in
  <em>
   Bike Race Simulator
  </em>
  .

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":939} -->

  Each of these codes will reward you with useful items. It's important to note that boosters are activated immediately after using the code, so you won't be able to postpone it. For your convenience, we have collected all the working

  codes below.

  <em>
   Sell Guns and Prove Da Hood Wrong
  </em>
  is one of the many Tycoon titles on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Therefore, your main task will be to craft and sell guns to earn Cash and upgrade your production. At first, though, your budget will be tiny, which is why many players opt to use
  <em>
   Sell Guns and Prove Da Hood Wrong
  </em>
  codes. Each of these
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  codes can provide you with different rewards — mostly Cash but sometimes Guns, too, so you should redeem them as soon as possible.

  As befits the genre,
  <em>
   Sell Guns and Prove Da Hood Wrong
  </em>
  has fairly straightforward gameplay. You craft Guns, sell them, and then upgrade your production. It costs quite a lot of Cash though, which is difficult to earn in large quantities at first. That's why
  <em>
   Sell Guns and Prove Da Hood Wrong
  </em>
  codes are so useful. By using them at the beginning of the game, you can immediately get Cash to hire workers and purchase several upgrades. However, like all codes, they are active for a limited time, so players should use them as quickly as possible before they expire.

  There's an overwhelming amount of secrets in
  <strong>

  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  and players don't even have to leave the confines of Ward 13 to encounter their first major one. Curious explorers might have already noticed that there's more to this safe zone than meets the eye, and one well-hidden weapon can be acquired if players are observant enough.

  This secret involves the Cargo Control Key, an item that players won't be able to just stumble upon as they explore
  <em>
   Remnant 2

  's
  <em>

  alien worlds. It goes to a very specific lock within Ward 13 itself, and thankfully, it's not too complicated to reach.

   Despite the many updates Remnant 2 has received since launch, the Cargo Control Key and its associated secret has remained untouched, and all information contained within this guide remains accurate and relevant.

  The Cargo Control Key is tucked away inside the locked chest in Ford's office, which is directly above the small workshop area next to the Worldstone. Players will be able to get to this chest at any time after finishing the tutorial and subsequent Ward 13 tour section.

 <p>
  To get the key, players need to inspect the bottom of the flashlight that Ford gives them at the start of the game. The code here is usually
  <strong>
   0415
  </strong>
  — this seems to be constant in almost every new playthrough, but the possibility of it changing in future versions of
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  remains. Input the code into Ford's safe to get the Cargo Control Key.

  As for where to use the Cargo Control Key, players need to go inside the derelict freight ship by the dock in Ward 13. From the Worldstone, take the exit to Brabus' firing range and go past the fenced area with all the shipping containers. There is a path here that leads to the inside of the ship that's blocked by a locked door. Interact with this door and select the Cargo Control Key from the inventory menu that pops up to unlock the room.

  On the table inside the locked room is the MP60-R SMG, a returning weapon from the original game that functions more or less the same as it did previously. It's a fully-automatic sidearm that might as well be a primary weapon. It comes with the following base stats:

 <p>
  The MP60-R SMG is an excellent secondary weapon for a class like the Hunter in
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  , especially early in the game where your choices of weapons are fairly limited. This gun fires extremely rapidly, which means Status Effect mods like Hot Shot will be more effective as the fast fire rate allows for quicker abnormal status build-up. However, the SMG's poor accuracy makes it ineffective at range, and its high ammo consumption makes it somewhat inefficient unless used with mods or other effects that buff damage.

  Chapter 5 Season 4 has arrived, shifting from the vehicular mayhem of the previous season to the ultimate Marvel crossover. This season introduces a variety of Marvel-themed POIs, such as Castle Doom and The Raft, along with some exciting additions to the loot pool.

  As players explore the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Island, they should be ready to face opponents wielding powerful Marvel-themed weapons like Captain America's Shield and Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets. While many of these battles will often take place on the ground, some players might be taking to the skies with
  <strong>
   War Machine's arsenal of weaponry
  </strong>
  .

  <strong>
   War Machine's Arsenal is an item of Mythic rarity that can be obtained by capturing the Loot Island, opening Weapon Crates in Bunkers
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   opening Avenger Chests.
  </strong>

 <p>
  The Loot Island will spawn at a random location once the third circle is revealed. Once players arrive at the island, they can capture it by
  <strong>
   heading to the Capture Point at the island's center
  </strong>
  and staying within its vicinity until the flag is fully raised.

  In addition to War Machine's Arsenal, capturing the Loot Island also rewards players with Epic and Legendary items, heals, and more. However, only one team can capture the island each game, making it a highly contested POI.

  For those looking to avoid the chaos on Loot Island, War Machine's Arsenal can also be

  — though obtaining it this way is purely down to luck.

  War Machine's Arsenal features two attacks, each of which can be used to eliminate enemies with ease. These attacks include
  <strong>
   the Arm Cannons and Rocket Salvo
  </strong>
  , both dishing out immense damage from afar. Here is a breakdown of the controls for War Machine's Arsenal:

   Unlike War Machine's Arsenal, War Machine's Auto Turret is an Epic item that players can obtain randomly either as floor loot or via Chests.

  The most surefire way to obtain War Machine's Auto Turret is through
  <strong>
   looting Rare Chests or Dr. Doom and Avenger's Chests
  </strong>
  , as each offers an increased chance of rewarding players with the item. This makes Weapon Bunkers a great place to loot to acquire it.

 <p>
  Unlike many other items in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , the War Machine's Auto Turret has a mind of its own, requiring only that the player keeps it in their inventory to use it.

 <p>
  Once equipped, the
  <strong>
   Auto Turret will automatically lock onto and fire at nearby enemies
  </strong>
  , dishing out a consistent 5 damage per shot. This makes the item rather similar to the Business Turret from Chapter 4 Season 4, but with the added benefit of being attached to the player.

  Just like War Machine's Auto Turret,
  <strong>
   War Machine's Hover Jets can be found as floor loot or by searching Chests.
  </strong>
  Since it’s an Epic rarity item, the best way of finding it is by
  <strong>
   searching Rare Chests, Dr. Doom Chests, and Avenger's Chests
  </strong>
  , as each yields a higher chance of acquiring it.

  Players can use the item without equipping it to their hands, allowing them to hover and fire their weapons simultaneously.

  as needed, provided they have enough fuel. If players find themselves running low on fuel, they should simply avoid using the Hover Jets to allow them to replenish.

  One thing
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  is known for is its strong emphasis on player agency. Players are essentially able to treat
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  's world as their personal sandbox in which many of the choices they make leave a lasting impression on the story and the characters within it. Unfortunately, this also means that players can get into trouble with the law at times, should they break it in any way. However,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  's crime and punishment system can be very forgiving at times, letting players get up to no good with very little to fear in terms of consequences.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  aims to change that with one of the most realistic crime and punishment systems in a role-playing game yet.

  's crime and punishment mechanics are a vast improvement over the first game, considering how much players can actually get away with and hardly be punished for it. In
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  , players might find themselves in trouble with the guards if they get caught robbing someone or killing an innocent person, but it is often very easy to evade their notice or to simply bribe away the crime with no long-term consequences.
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , on the other hand, takes things several steps further to encourage players to either do everything in their power to ensure they don't get caught or simply don't do anything wrong at all.

  It's Very Difficult to Avoid Being Caught Committing a Crime in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  makes it fairly easy to avoid being caught when committing a crime. When players are seen committing a crime by an innocent villager or a guard in the first game, simply bribing the guard or fleeing the scene quickly enough would almost always allow them to avoid punishment. In
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , if players are spotted committing a crime, witnesses can not only call the guard this time but can also extort Henry,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's protagonist, for their silence. This means that, if players wish to avoid wasting any of their hard-earned valuables, they will need to ensure they go unnoticed.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  To make matters more difficult, players need to avoid leaving behind any evidence of their crime in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  . If players manage to elude being caught in the act of committing a crime and are seen near evidence of their criminal activities — like a corpse, for instance — they will still be accused and punished as a result. Furthermore, any criminal evidence left behind will place the guards in that area on high alert, making it far more difficult for players to return to the scene without being heavily questioned.

  Getting Caught Committing a Crime in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Can Have Lasting Effects on Henry's Reputation
 </h3>
 <p>
  If players happen to get caught committing a crime in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , it can have lasting effects on Henry's reputation. For example, should players get caught stealing, the guard will brand Henry a thief, causing shopkeepers, regular townsfolk, and guards to treat him with contempt and suspicion. This will likely lead to increased difficulty when haggling, attempting to persuade certain individuals, and shirking punishment in the future. Henry's stats will also be temporarily affected by the wound of the brand until it heals.

 <p>
  Brands aren't all that bad, however, as they can earn Henry a positive reputation with less reputable NPCs in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  . While all the specifics haven't been revealed about how this system works, it's likely that a thief brand might allow Henry to associate more closely with other thieves. If players commit murder, perhaps they might find an inroad with an assassin of some kind. In one way or another,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's reactive crime and punishment system ensures players won't forget what they've done.

  Report Suggests Nintendo Switch 2 Is Releasing in Q2 2025
 </h2>
 <p>
  According to a new report from Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda, the Switch successor is likely to hit the store shelves in the first half of 2025. This forecast emerged online mere days after GameIndustry.biz's Christopher Dring reported that Nintendo's partners aren't expecting the Switch 2 to be released before the company's next fiscal year. Taken together, these two tidbits imply that the long-awaited device will have its commercial debut in the second quarter of 2025.

  Nintendo Switch 2 Estimated to Debut Below $500
 </h3>
 <p>
  Yasuda's newly shared outlook also saw the analyst estimate that Nintendo's next console will launch below the $499 mark. This is a fairly conservative approximation, not least because the PS5 and Xbox Series S currently start at $449 and $299, respectively, so the chances of Nintendo's next console being significantly more expensive seem unlikely. Back in January 2024, another industry analyst offered a corresponding prediction, forecasting that the Switch 2 will retail at $400.

 <p>
  For reference, the Switch debuted at $299, a price point that it retains to this date, more than seven years following its release. The Wii U had an identical launch price in 2012. But given the extremely high inflation rates in the early post-pandemic era, the chances of Nintendo releasing a third $299 console in a row appear slim. After all, inflation is widely believed to be one of the reasons why Nintendo keeps resisting a Switch price cut even after all these years.

 <p>
  According to previous reports, minimizing the chances of Switch 2 launch shortages will be one of Nintendo's priorities come 2025. The only way to do so is to build a sizable stock, which is a process that likely won't start before the console is officially announced if Nintendo doesn't want to risk factory floor leaks spoiling its reveal. Since the Switch was being mass-produced around four months ahead of its March 2017 launch, which was mired in shortages and plagued by scalpers, its successor will likely need an even longer pre-release production run. This is assuming, of course, that Nintendo hasn't significantly ramped up its production capabilities since 2017, for which there is no evidence.

  The upcoming
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Eclipse
   </em>
  </strong>
  has apparently lost its lead writer, as he intends to strike out on his own and found a new development studio. While developer Quantic Dream hasn't revealed much about
  <em>
   Star Wars Eclipse
  </em>
  in the years since its announcement, the studio will now have to press forward without the help of longtime lead writer Adam Williams.

  <em>
   Star Wars Eclipse
  </em>
  was first revealed at The Game Awards 2021, piquing the interest of fans of the sci-fi franchise. Set a few hundred years before the events of the original film trilogy in the High Republic Era, the trailer presented at the awards show still featured plenty of iconic
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  imagery, including lightsabers, space battles, and a protocol droid.

  Precious little new information has been officially released in more than two and a half years since the initial announcement. Recently, lead writer Williams posted on his LinkedIn account that he was leaving Quantic Dream after nearly a full decade to start his own development studio. In addition to his work on the new
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  game, Williams' lead writing duties have also been lauded for his work on the 2018 choices-matter adventure game
  <em>
   Detroit: Become Human
  </em>
  . While he showed gratitude to both Quantic Dream and LucasFilm, Williams said his new studio already has a project in the works that he described as "very innovative, very special and, for now, very secret."

 <p>
  It's not yet clear what impact Williams' departure will make on
  <em>
   Star Wars Eclipse
  </em>
  's development, though a change at the head of the writing table partway through the development process has a tendency to slow things down. Early reports from industry insider Tom Henderson in December 2021 had speculated that the game had already been in development for 18 months before its reveal and indicated that
  <em>
   Star Wars Eclipse
  </em>
  might not even launch until 2027. More-recent speculation has bumped that release window up to 2025, but the lack of any official announcements, screenshots, or teaser trailers from LucasFilm or Quantic Dream has left a lot of fans wondering when they'll get their hands on the game.

 <p>
  Quantic Dream's official website and social media accounts have yet to acknowledge Willliams' departure. Like much of the developer's catalog, the upcoming
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  game looks to have a high focus on narrative storytelling. Featuring multiple branching paths, and with the caveat that anyone in the main cast of
  <em>
   Star Wars Eclipse
  </em>
  can die and the story will still continue without them, the recently vacated lead writer's chair presents a lot of challenges for whoever is chosen to fill the seat.

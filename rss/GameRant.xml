      While it is the better option statistically, players tend to have different preferences, with some choosing the bottle. Still, it seems Team Asobi prefers bricks, or at least views at as the more iconic of the two tools.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Astro Bot
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Joel cameo appears to settle an age-old debate in the eyes of some
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  fans
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  Now that PlayStation has created a full-fledged video game around Astro, who is generally considered the gaming brand's new mascot,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  fans have another, larger batch of references to appreciate, one of which shows Team Asobi potentially taking a side in one of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  community's biggest conflicts.

 <p>
  One of the things players have been enjoying the most about
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  is the way that the game highlights minute details of beloved video game characters.
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  achieves this through its numerous cameos, using stylized versions of the game's titular character to pay homage to other franchises. Some cameos are taken to the next level through props that can be acquired for the PlayStation-themed bots, with Joel wielding one of his two go-to throwable distraction tools. c

 <p>
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  cameo displays Joel carrying a brick, which some Redditors have taken as a definitive answer to the debate over which item is better in the series' games. The many who have played through
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  games tend to have a preference between bottles or bricks as they fight through the post-apocalyptic world, with everything from their look and sound to their durability being taken into consideration. Either can be used as a melee or throwing weapon, and while the brick is statistically better, the choice often comes down to what players vibe with. Still, it seems like
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  is agreeing with the community's concensus on the superior throwable.

 <p>
  This makes sense, as there is an actual difference in bottles and bricks in
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  games. Players have recognized that the brick is considerably more effective in melee combat, available for three hits, with some gamers nicknaming brick attacks as the "three-piece combo." In contrast, the bottle breaks after one hit during melee gameplay, though some
  <em>
   Last of Us
  </em>
  players have argued that it can stun enemies longer when it's thrown. Still, a majority of players prefer to use the brick because it feels like it would make more sense in survival combat. Additionally, the fact that Ellie is carrying a bow in her cameo can be considered a testament to its usefulness, in addition to how much it fits her character, so the same would make sense for the brick.

  On top of the obvious options in combat, players can also land a Gun Strike, which sees your Space Marine pull out their pistol and take a quick shot at a weakened enemy. There is a method to weakening enemies and setting up Gun Strikes; here's how.

  A Gun Strike happens whenever a
  <strong>
   red reticle appears on a staggered enemy and the player presses the fire button
  </strong>
  . No matter what weapon is currently equipped, the Space Marine will pull out their pistol and take a quick shot hitting the enemy in the head to deal a lot of damage and also restore one bar of armor for the player.

  Players will also need to be
  <strong>
   facing the general direction of the reticle before pressing the fire button
  </strong>
  to trigger the Gun Strike animation and take the shot. The red reticle only appears on staggered enemies, and staggering them doesn't happen normally. There are two methods for getting an enemy to stagger:

 <p>
  Neither of these methods is a guarantee, and there's only ever a chance the enemy will stagger and the reticle will appear. That being said,
  <strong>
   landing heavy attacks to break an enemy's block is the best method
  </strong>
  to try and cause the enemy to stagger, as it is controllable by the player. Every melee weapon has a heavy attack that can be seen by opening up the menu when the weapon is equipped. The combo that breaks the block and is considered a heavy attack is represented by the cracked shield icon.

 <p>
  Ultimately all classes are able to Gun Strike as they all have a secondary weapon. The most reliable method to staggering an enemy is by hitting them with a heavy attack, meaning you'll want to hit multiple enemies at once to increase your odds of at least staggering one. With that, the
  <strong>
   best classes for focusing solely on Gun Strikes are Assault and Bulwark
  </strong>
  , as they both focus most on melee weapons and keep and ranged weapon as a backup.

 <p>
  Teamwork is the best hope for Survivors to make their escape, so it is always a good idea to unhook fellow Survivors. This build revolves around this act of altruism, giving benefits to reduce the chances of the Survivor being tunneled.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    No Mither (David King):
   </strong>
   The player's pools of blood and grunts of pain are drastically reduced, their recovery speed is increased by 25%, and they can fully recover from the dying state. However, the Survivor is permanently injured and cannot heal, making them constantly one-hit.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Decisive Strike (Laurie Strode):
   </strong>
   Decisive Strikes activate for 60 seconds after being unhooked; if the Killer picks the player up in this time, they can escape their grasp by passing a skill check.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Object Of Obsession (Laurie Strode):
   </strong>
   Anytime the Killer reads their player's aura, the player also sees the Killer's. This perk makes the Survivor a huge target for a chase, as their aura is revealed to the Killer every 30 seconds for 3 seconds. The player's repairing, healing, and cleansing speeds increase by 6%.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Lithe (Feng Min):
   </strong>
   After performing a rushed vault action, the player receives a 50% Haste buff.

  There are many generator perks and, therefore, plenty of generator-dedicated builds, but this one stands out as the most fun. It works best when used as a co-op build, and players can also bring in a toolbox to finish the generators at record speed.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Invocation: Weaving Spiders (Sable Ward):
   </strong>
   This perk allows the player to perform an Invocation in the basement for 60 seconds, revealing their aura to all Survivors and speeding up the process if others join. Upon completion, all generators require ten fewer repair charges, but the player will become injured and suffer the Broken status effect for the rest of the trial.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Resilience (General Perk):
   </strong>
   This perk pairs well with Invocation because when the player is injured, their repairing, healing, and other action speeds increase by 9%.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Déjà Vu (General Perk):
   </strong>
   The auras of the three generators closest to each other are revealed to the player, and their repair speed on those generators is increased by 6%.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    This Is Not Happening (General Perk):
   </strong>
   Increases the success zone of great skill checks by 30% when injured.

   <strong>
    Dramaturgy (Nicolas Cage):
   </strong>
   When Healthy, players can activate Dramaturgy to be granted a 0.5-second burst of +25% Haste followed by one of four randomized effects: become Exposed for 12 seconds, gain an extended 2-second Haste, scream, or acquire a random Rare Item with Add-ons.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Bardic Inspiration (Aestri Yazar):
   </strong>

  <li>
   <strong>
    Slippery Meat (General Perk):
   </strong>

   <strong>
    Deliverance (Adam Francis):
   </strong>
   The player can successfully unhook themselves, provided they have previously safely unhooked someone else.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Plot Twist (Nicolas Cage):
   </strong>
   When Injured, the player can silently enter the Dying State. Plot Twist suppresses grunts and bleeding and allows for full recovery from the Dying State. After self-recovery, the player is instantly healed and gains a 50% haste effect.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Decisive Strike (Laurie Strode):
   </strong>
   If the Survivor is picked up within 60 seconds after being unhooked or unhooking themselves, they have the power to stun the Killer and break free from their hold by passing a skill check.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Power Struggle (Élodie Rakoto):
   </strong>
   Carried Survivors can drop a pallet to stun the Killer and escape their grasp.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Boil Over (Kate Denson):
   </strong>
   Increases the swaying effects of wiggling on the Killer and obscures hook auras within a certain distance. When the Killer falls from a great height, it also accelerates the player's wiggle progression by 33%. Players can equip an Offering for one of the best maps for Survivors to maximize the perk's potential.

    Flip Flop (Ash Williams):

   50% of a player's recovery progression is transformed into wiggle progression.

   This perk compliments Flip Flop by improving recovery speed, which is subsequently turned into wiggle progression.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Power Struggle (Élodie Rakoto):
   </strong>
   Carried Survivors can use a pallet to stun the Killer. It requires a 15% wiggle advancement to activate, which the perks listed above will assist in achieving.

    Dramaturgy (Nicolas Cage):

   When Healthy, players can activate Dramaturgy to be granted a 0.5-second burst of +25% Haste followed by one of four randomized effects: become Exposed for 12 seconds, gain an extended 2-second Haste, scream, or acquire a random Rare Item with Add-ons. Dramaturgy causes the players to become Exhausted.

   Counters the adverse effects of Dramaturgy by suppressing the player's urge to scream and other audible alerts.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Vigil (Quentin Smith):
   </strong>
   Reduces the cooldown duration of Exhausted and other negative status effects, including Exposed, for both the player and nearby teammates so that players can get the most value out of Dramaturgy.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Windows of Opportunity (Kate Denson):

  A talented
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has recreated the movie trailer using in-game footage with a texture pack and mods. The
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  movie has been widely criticized for its combination of animation and live-action, and this in-game trailer may be what some of the community was hoping for.

  Since it was released,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  has garnered significant attention, generating $365 million in revenue in 2022 alone. While fans may not have been calling for it in its early days, some gamers have hoped for a
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  movie. Warner Bros. Pictures took on that challenge, casting Jack Black as the game's protagonist, Steve. Ahead of the movie trailer's release, some leaks hinted at props and characters used in its creation. When the trailer was released, it received a mixed response, largely due to its humor and Jack Black not resembling Steve. Despite this, other fans have defended the movie, insisting that its target demographic is children. One gamer who seemingly appreciated the trailer has recreated it in-game, and their work is impressive.

  Reddit user NEW-Mattiou recently shared their own version of the
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  movie trailer created with in-game assets. Like the movie teaser, this trailer begins by zooming in on a rectangular green portal before panning backward in a familiar
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  Seed. The characters represented by Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, and Danielle Brooks are replaced by in-game skins that resemble them. Each of them curiously looks around the blocky setting as they do in the trailer before it cuts to focusing on an in-game Sheep rather than the nightmare fuel from the movie. A montage then ensues, showing Piglins flying through the sky, a wolf howling at the moon, and a sneaky Creeper just as the movie teaser does.

  The in-game trailer shows
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  Steve appearing in front of the main cast in a puff of smoke rather than fire. Like in the movie trailer, Jason Momoa's character holds a glowing blue cube, the origin of which is currently unknown. Blocky letters soon begin to form in the sky, spelling out
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  as they do in the tutorial world, with text underneath cleverly calling it "Movie Edition" in place of Java or Bedrock edition. The in-game trailer concludes with Piglins running past a llama which is notably less emotive than the movie one. This trailer was created using BBS Mod, Fabric, and Fabric API which enable players to create animations. Many of the scenes appear to reflect the
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  Cartoon Texture Pack, but the Sheep is notably from the base version of the game.

  As the
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  community has many dedicated members, the full movie may one day get the same treatment that NEW-Mattiou gave the teaser. With Mojang continuing to update
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , some biomes, items, or mobs may be in the full movie that aren't in the game yet.

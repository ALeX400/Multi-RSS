  One of the coolest aspects of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is getting to upgrade the Super Destroyer over time. By collecting samples in-mission, players can upgrade their ships and subsequently improve their Helldiver's stratagems in various ways, including improved cooldown times, top increased damage, larger explosions, and more. While collecting samples is easy enough, the costs for some of the later upgrades are pretty steep for all but the most hardcore players, making them excellent incentives to keep most players engaged with the game in the long term.

 <p>
  Recent updates have proven that the developers are going to keep adding more and more upgrades for players to keep grinding for. But there’s a very fine line Arrowhead has to walk when it considers future Super Destroyer upgrades. While it's undeniably cool to see the destroyer's firepower increase over the course of the game’s lifespan, the developers have to consider the power these upgrades have over
  <em>

  ’s difficulty curve.

  The Super Destroyer upgrades in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  are some of the most powerful upgrades available to the player. They increase the effectiveness of stratagems, which are the lifeblood of the game and the main attraction that has set the title apart from its competitors. These stratagems are insanely powerful at a base level, as to even the odds between the four Helldivers and the endless hordes of bots and bugs. But that’s exactly where the problem comes from: stratagems are already strong without the upgrades.

 <p>
  Game balance is a critical consideration for any developer running a live service game, be it PVP or PVE. If one weapon or tool becomes too powerful in the meta, it ruins build diversity and generally makes the game less challenging and fun overall. Everyone wants to feel like a powerful, formidable force on the battlefield, but doing so with a broken or overpowered weapon dilutes the sense of accomplishment whenever they pull off something cool in-game.

  How Arrowhead Can Address Stratagem Power Creep With Continued Super Destroyer Upgrades
 </h3>
 <p>
  Continued Super Destroyer upgrades over the course of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ’s lifespan will inevitably make certain stratagems a little overtuned. Chief among these are going to be the various orbital strikes and the Eagle One bombing runs, which are easily the most powerful attacks in the game at a baseline. If Arrowhead isn’t careful with its Super Destroyer upgrades, these stratagems can end up making the gameplay feel trivial, with increased cooldowns and more damaging explosions taking out enemies faster than originally intended.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":979} -->

 <p>
  It’s going to be a difficult balancing act for Arrowhead. There’s no two ways about it. One less-than-desirable fix for stratagem power creep is to abandon future plans for more Super Destroyer upgrades. This would ensure that stratagems can always be balanced since the power scale isn’t constantly updated with new content. But it would be disappointing to veteran players who’ve invested so much time into their upgrades; they’d have nothing left to spend their hard-won samples on and would eventually start losing interest in the game without more long-term goals to work towards.

 <h3 id="the-ideal-approach-for-balancing-stratagems-moving-forward">
  The Ideal Approach For Balancing Stratagems Moving Forward
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another, perhaps more measured, approach to this issue would be finding creative new upgrades for stratagems that aren’t straight damage/cooldown buffs. Maybe a future Super Destroyer upgrade increases the amount of smoke from smoke grenades and orbital stratagems. Perhaps a future upgrade changes how stratagems function altogether, giving players more options based on what kind of mission they're heading into.
 </p>

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The bridge upgrade that buffs all fire damage should be the gold standard for designing Destroyer upgrades moving forward. It encourages the use of a specific build (in this case, fire-based weaponry) while not rendering any of the affected stratagems overpowered. Fire stratagems are already great at dealing out damage and the Destroyer upgrade accentuates that strength while not trying to compensate for flamethrowers’ short range and tendency to cause friendly fire damage.

  There are few playing positions in sport as crucial as football's quarterback. As the field general and on-field offensive coordinator, the success of a team's attacking output depends on the QB's ability to run plays, think quickly on their feet, and provide smooth passing to the receivers. Given it's such an important part of football, it is naturally a very popular position to play for fans of the
  <em>
   Madden
  </em>
  franchise and the first collegiate-level game in over a decade,

  There is more to passing in
  <em>
   College Football 25
  </em>
  , or any football game for that matter, than simply releasing the ball and hoping for the best. The game requires quite a lot of strategy, and not just from a route-running or defensive structure perspective, so the game requires quite a bit of study to be successful. To maximize your chances of a successful play, make sure you understand how you can change the behavior of the ball on release.

 <p>
  The most common pass you’ll likely use in
  <em>
   College Football 25
  </em>
  is the bullet pass. These require more power, but will get to your receiver a lot faster, which lowers the chance of being intercepted. On the other hand, putting less power into a pass will result in the ball having more of an arc, which is ideal for receivers who have a height advantage in contested balls or those who are outside of the defending player.

  Understanding the different passing types is one thing, using them in practice a the college or NFL level is an entirely different matter. There is a plethora of different running routes your receivers will follow, and not all of them will be suitable for a bullet pass. Quarterbacks need to be quick on their feet and even quicker to act, including adjusting the power and shape of their throw to accommodate the receiver and give them the best possible opportunity to catch the ball.

 <p>
  When determining your play, make sure to not just have one passing option in mind, as the defender may have the advantage on the running route. One important consideration when choosing who will receive the ball is how it should be sent to them. If they're 30 yards away and hugging the sideline, you'll want to lob it, but if they're running across the face of the defensive line, a quick bullet would be the best option to minimize the opportunities for the defense to react.

  In every game situation, the coach will offer suggestions on which plays to use for the next down. In Road To Glory mode, you may not have a choice in the matter, depending on your Coach Trust level, but in modes that allow you to take control of the offense, you can be more flexible.

  While there is plenty of glory in executing complex trick plays and long passes, they are generally low percentage, and are best used as a last resort or for when you’ve got an insurmountable lead. In competitive game situations, don’t be afraid to vary your play between running and passing, or even consider a punt fake if you think you can get that crucial first down.

  Few plays in football will hype up fans more than a successful Hail Mary, but throwing these in regular game situations isn’t particularly wise, as they’re tough to pull off. While some passing options might seem counterproductive, players shouldn’t be afraid to go for the available receiver in close proximity, or even the one that is behind the line of scrimmage.

 <p>
  Receivers situated past the first-down line will, of course, reset the count for the team for the next down, but are less likely to gain much yardage due to the defensive set up. Getting it to someone closer to you, however, could have the potential for larger gains if the receiver is able to make use of blockers and effectively evade tackle attempts, which can earn you valuable XP if you're playing Road To Glory mode. Of course, this won’t always work, which is why shaking things up from time to time can help keep the defense on their toes.

  There are plenty of quick-play options for more advanced players that allow you to quickly make adjustments if you don't like how your offense looks in comparison to the defensive structure. These can be quite complex mechanics to wrap your head around, but there are some minor adjustments you can make as a beginner to build up the confidence to try the more advanced plays.

 <p>
  A big part of being a successful quarterback, aside from building a strong supporting cast of players, is thinking quickly on your feet, so be prepared to make a sudden change if the play isn't going as you'd hope. Even something as simple as taking the ball for a run yourself when you see a bit of space is a great strategy to make some extra yards and catch the defense off guard. If you enjoy a running game, even holding the ball during a running play will give you the opportunity to fake a RB route and take the ball in a completely different direction.

  This one may seem a little too obvious, but
  <em>
   College Football 25
  </em>
  does a great job in making the training parts of the game pretty fun and engaging. There are multiple game situation scenarios you can put yourself in for any of the major offensive positions, which will help you to hone your craft without full-sized defensive lines in your way or the distractions of a Stadium Pulse.

  For quarterbacks, the training exercises are perfect ways to practice high-pressure situations where you need to act quickly to avoid loss of yards or possession. There are opportunities to practice moving and passing, throwing on the run, evading potential sack scenarios, and improving your long passing game.

 <p>
  Another obvious one, but if you’re new to football or even football games, the last thing you want to do as an offensive team is have your quarterback sacked. The reason for this is that it can result in a significant loss of yards, meaning you’ll have to go even further to earn the next first down. Not only this, but getting tackled could result in the ball being fumbled, and, considering the quarterback is usually the furthest back on the field, it can leave your team vulnerable to losing possession or even conceding a touchdown against the run of play.

 <p>
  If the quarterback is in a position where there are no viable passing options, they can opt to run for the first down themselves if there is space to do so. If there isn't, however, or if there's a defensive player gaining on them, players can always choose to throw the ball away by clicking the right stick on their controller. This will make the quarterback throw it over the sideline, which counts as an incomplete pass and won't result in any loss in yardage. This is a far better alternative to being sacked and having to work harder for the next first down.

      <title>Best Open-World Games On PlayStation Plus Extra &amp; Premium (July 2024)</title>

 <p>
  In June 2022, Sony unleashed its new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  . Split into three tiers, the service offers subscribers access to hundreds of games from across PlayStation's history, including PS1 and PSP projects. Along with showing love for the brand's history, PS Plus also covers most genres, be it horror, platformers, RPGs, or strategy. Unsurprisingly, PS Plus does not skimp out on open-world games either.

  Whether searching for a PlayStation exclusive or a third-party juggernaut, PS Plus Extra and Premium should have most players covered. With so many titles to pick from, knowing where to start can be challenging, and that extends to open-world projects. PS Plus covers this genre quite extensively, including everything from first-person shooters to survival and role-playing games. Therefore, let's take a look at the
  <strong>
   best open-world PS Plus games

  <strong>
   <em>
    Updated July 19, 2024:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   This month's PS Plus Extra and Premium lineup included a couple of
   <strong>
    open-world games
   </strong>
   , including one that is divisive. No More Heroes 3 made the controversial decision to bring back its open-world/hub area, which is essentially one big city filled with side activities that need to be completed in pursuit of unlocking the next boss fight. While the latter are generally fun and bombastic, the open-world falls fairly flat, being defined by empty nondescript streets and repetitive challenges that get old really quickly. NMH3 is still worth a playthrough, but it cannot be recommended for its open-world.

 <p>
  Remnant 2 is not a full open-world, with its campaign being divided into different universes that offer quite a bit of exploration. While not a candidate for this discussion, the game is an easy recommendation for Soulslike or third-person shooter fans. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous can feel like a pseudo-open-world at times, but it is mainly a linear RPG that grants players some choices in the order they tackle quests.

 <p>
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2 is a very open game that features an impressive large map that can be explored fairly freely. However, traveling is done automatically on the world map, with players taking direct control when they come across a town or battle. M&amp;B2 qualifies as open-world, but it might not fit everyone's definition of the concept.

  Ubisoft also added back a sports game with a great open-world.

  The spiritual predecessor to
  <em>
   Riders Republic
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Steep
  </em>
  gives players the Alps as their playground, allowing them to ski, snowboard, paraglide, or wingsuit their way across the gorgeous terrain. Delivering relatively grounded gameplay, the 2016 game generally lets players do their own thing, with the main progression loop revolving around completing challenges to expand the map. While standard for most open-world games, this structure makes a lot of sense for
  <em>
   Steep
  </em>
  since, in real life, slopes are divided by skill level; consequently, players having to show their mastery of entry-level areas before moving on to higher peaks fits the setting.

 <p>
  When it comes to the sports themselves, someone's mileage will likely vary quite a bit between all four of them. Each activity is suitably different and comes with a learning curve, and they all change the gameplay's tempo considerably. While players are free to focus on their favorite specializations if they are not driven to be completionists, they will need to dip their toes into all of them if they want to unlock the full map.

  Despite being more than 5 years old by this point,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is still among the most impressive
  <strong>
   open-world games
  </strong>
  on the market, let alone Sony's subscription service. Rockstar's projects continuously push consoles to their limits, crafting experiences that fully showcase the hardware's capabilities. Not only is it not an exception, but
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  might be the developer's crowning achievement in most areas, be it technical or artistic. The former is evident in the photorealistic graphics and expansive world inspired by the late 19th century Wild West; meanwhile, the latter involves a personal story that ties thematically into the historical setting, emphasizing the inescapable nature of evolution and the consequences of going against the winds of change.

  borders on an immersive sim at times, although it is not a standard entry in the genre. While certainly plot-driven, the campaign is filled with slow-life moments designed to showcase Arthur Morgan's daily routine beyond the shootouts and internal squabbles of the Van der Linde gang. Traveling across the map is an arduous and lengthy process, one filled with tiring elements that emphasize an outlaw's hard life.
  <em>

  's adherence to detail and authenticity can be exhausting and polarizing, but they contribute significantly to the unique brilliance of Rockstar's masterpiece.

  The PS4's swan song as Sony's main console,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  transports players back in time to the 13th century as the Mongols invade Japan's Tsushima Island. After failing to stop the invasion and almost meeting his end, Jin Sakai goes on a quest to recruit fighters that could help turn the tide of battle.

  <em>

  's open-world is gorgeous, be it on the PS4 or the PS5. Tsushima Island is lavish, varied, and breathtaking. The same can also be said about Iki Island, the location of the expansion that is included in the Director's Cut. Within this map, players can look forward to engaging in intense samurai-themed battles and decent side quests with memorable NPCs.

  Approximately a year following its debut,
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>

  Guerrilla Games' sequel sees Aloy heading west, visiting areas that were once part of Utah, Nevada, and California, just to name a few featured states.
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  retains what worked in
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  , which is also on PS Plus Extra, all the while expanding on a few things that could have been improved upon. While the 2017 release has a beautiful and impressive open-world, its sequel fills it with more interesting side content and micro stories. Consequently,
  <em>
   HFW
  </em>
  's map feels slightly more alive. When it comes to combat, the game delivers thrilling encounters that pit Aloy against both humans and robots. The latter is undoubtedly the campaign's highlight.

  was a massive hit right out of the gate, and its popularity has not waned over the last decade. The

  PS Plus Extra has a plethora of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games, including fairly recent releases such as
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  . Subscribers can readily spend half a year playing through the franchise's PS Plus projects, allowing them to explore a wide range of historical worlds. Picking a favorite will likely come down to a person's preferred setting; someone might gravitate toward
  <em>
   Syndicate
  </em>
  's UK aesthetic or feel more at home in
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  ' Ancient Egypt. The latter is a good entry point since the game acts as something of a soft reboot, along with having one of the franchise's
  <strong>
   best open-worlds
  </strong>
  .

  However,
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  should not be ignored either, especially since the game stands on its own quite well. Set during the height of piracy,
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  takes place in the West Indies, a map filled with diverse locations, three central cities, and lots to discover. The campaign quickly puts the player behind the wheel of a ship and gets them out on the water, encouraging them to explore to their heart's content.
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  is, first and foremost, a pirate game rather than an
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  sequel, and this helps differentiate it from everything that came before and after.

 <p>
  PS Plus has Batman fans well-fed. Rocksteady's full
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  trilogy,
  <em>
   Arkham Origins
  </em>
  , and the maligned
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  are available on the Premium tier; meanwhile, Extra-level subscribers can play
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  . While the latter has some positives that make it not a complete write-off, the former is undoubtedly the superior package, and it is not particularly close. In 2015,
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  garnered some controversy due to its terrible PC launch and the heavy inclusion of the Batmobile, resulting in a positive reception that did not quite live up to
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  's best-of-all-time standards.

 <p>
  Nevertheless,
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  is an impressive achievement, and it features arguably gaming's best rendition of Gotham to date. Even nearly a decade later, the game's open-world remains a sight to behold – it is visually striking, dense with architecture, and dripping in style and personality. Putting aside the polarizing Batmobile sections,
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  is generally fantastic and features the deepest combat system in the franchise.

  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  might be all about turn-based combat nowadays, at least the main entries, but the
  <em>
   Judgment
  </em>
  spin-off series has kept the franchise linked to its beat 'em up roots. While a third entry does not seem all that likely, both games are great fun, and they are available on PS Plus Extra. Newcomers should start with 2019's
  <em>
   Judgment
  </em>
  , which introduces Takayuki Yagami, a lawyer who quit the business to become a private investigator. Known to take on risky cases, Yagami gets dragged into a challenging murder case in the original game, which eventually puts him in contact with the Yakuza.

 <p>
  The sequel does not deviate too far from its predecessor's ideas, but it does fine-tune some elements to craft a superior overall package. For instance, both games incorporate lackluster detective-style mechanics, but the sequel spreads them out a bit more to try and make them less annoying. The melee combat is fast-paced and satisfying in both titles, and it should hit the spot with fans of Kiryu's
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  era; however,
  <em>
   Lost Judgment
  </em>
  just adds a tinge more depth to the system.

 <p>
  While all of that is great,
  <em>
   Lost Judgment
  </em>
  's main selling points are its storyline and world, the latter of which comes packed with side quests and minigames. Like quite a few entries in this license, the game is set in Kamurocho, which is inspired by Tokyo's Kabukicho district. The reused map might get tiresome for long-time
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  fans, but the open-world is great in isolation. Story-wise,
  <em>
   Lost Judgment
  </em>
  focuses on bullying, a touchy subject that the game treats seriously but also struggles to explore with nuance. Nevertheless, the campaign produces more than a few awesome moments.

  PS Plus has three
  <em>
   Saints Row
  </em>
  games:
  <em>
   Saints Row 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Saints Row 4
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Gat Out of Hell
  </em>
  . Despite falling within the same franchise, all three games are fairly different from each other.
  <em>
   Saints Row 4
  </em>
  and its spin-off,
  <em>
   Gat Out of Hell
  </em>
  , are unapologetically over-the-top to the point that they bear almost no resemblance to reality. They play somewhat similar to
  <em>
   Crackdown
  </em>
  , and they cast players as superhero-style characters who have abilities that make most of the conventional components of an open-world game like vehicles and weapons obsolete.
  <em>
   Saints Row 4
  </em>
  is fun, provided players know what they are getting into.

 <p>
  On the other hand,
  <em>
   Saints Row 2
  </em>
  is more down to earth, while nevertheless leaning into parody and comedic territory. Set in Stillwater, the story tasks the protagonist with reforming the Saints, which naturally means they will need to take on other gangs that have gotten a foothold in the city. Even if it is not as absurd as later entries in the franchise, the sandbox game still gives players all the tools they need to spread mayhem on the street. It just happens to be accompanied by a pretty good story and some great characters.

  Insomniac's
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  is arguably the Wall-Crawler's greatest game, although it does have stiff competition from a few older titles. Unfortunately, the 2018 release is not available on PS Plus Extra, having been removed in May 2023; that said, superhero fans yearning to swing through New York City can jump into
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  , a spin-off that maintains the main entry's high standard of quality.

 <p>
  Even though it ties into
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  in a few ways,
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  can be treated as a standalone experience since it has a fairly self-contained story. As its subtitle suggests, the game swaps Peter Parker for Miles, who is still in his infancy as a hero. Both games do splendid jobs of recreating New York City, and while it is not overly packed with memorable side content, the open-world is nevertheless fun to explore due to
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  ' satisfying movement. Compared to other games of this ilk, Insomniac's spin-off is on the short side as it can be readily completed in under 10 hours, which is a decent enough length for a PS Plus game.

  By the time 2004 rolled around, Naughty Dog's
  <em>
   Jak &amp; Daxter
  </em>
  franchise has morphed into a very different beast. While still utilizing platforming as a core mechanic,
  <em>
   Jak 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  greatly ramped up the action and replaced
  <em>
   The Precursor Legacy
  </em>
  's (fairly) linear levels with larger and more open-ended areas.
  <em>
   Jak 3
  </em>
  really emphasizes its free-roaming element, encouraging players to explore its two cities and wasteland as much as possible.

  Compared to its predecessors,
  <em>
   Jak 3
  </em>
  can come across as unfocused and disjointed; however, it is still one of the better action-adventure games on the PS2. As far as its open-world is considered,
  <em>
   Jak 3
  </em>
  's map is not nearly as expansive or diverse as some of its high-profile contemporaries like
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3
  </em>
  . That said, the core gameplay is strong enough to keep things interesting for the relatively short campaign.

  A Hideo Kojima project is always going to be something special, and
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  's bizarre reveal and early trailers instantly made that apparent. Set in a post-apocalyptic version of the United States, players portray Sam, a person charged with traveling across the country delivering packages and establishing communication points.

  Set in Washington D.C., Ubisoft's title envisions a post-apocalyptic alternate reality filled with warring factions and nature-covered landmarks. The series has quite a realistic presentation, although the sequel is slightly more colorful than its predecessor.
  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  has plenty of multiplayer-focused content, including PvP and an extensive endgame, but the story can be played solo and experienced as a single-player game.

  All the
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  games on PS Plus Premium are worth playing. While Cole's entries are highly rated,
  <em>
   Second Son
  </em>
  tends to get overlooked due to its (relatively) early release in the PS4's lifecycle. Despite coming out within a year of the console's launch,
  <em>
   Infamous: Second Son
  </em>
  is still one of the best-looking games on the PS4, and its iteration of Seattle is incredible.

  Although hardly hated,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  launched to a fairly meek response compared to other PS4 exclusives, which caused the game to slip by the wayside after a while. Nowadays, Bend Studio's release is relatively forgotten, and while garnering some online support, it hardly seems destined to become a modern cult classic. By 2019, open-world games had grown so commonplace that they were threatening to become tried; meanwhile, zombie stories had already faced some backlash due to overexposure. Basically,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  was fighting an uphill battle from the start, and debuting with a myriad of technical issues certainly did not help. The story can also be difficult to get into since the protagonist, Deacon St. John, starts out as rather unlikable, and he does not really improve until a good few hours into the campaign.

  If someone looks past
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  's uneven reputation and pushes through the narrative's slow early moments, they will eventually find themselves playing a refreshingly intense open-world experience. The game's main selling point is its zombie hordes, and a run-in with these armies of Freakers never fails to be exciting and terrifying. Although it might not seem that original,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  's world is fairly impressive, and it is filled with minor details that provide context for society's current situation. The project does a good job of populating its map with small events that add an element of spontaneity, and this goes beyond just zombies as there are plenty of humans running about as well.

  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  is a borderline open-world project since players won't have access to the full map at once, although they are free to rampage through a specific area while they are in it. Consequently, the campaign is a bit more restrictive than most releases in the genre, all the while still offering thrills associated with it. More importantly,
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  is simply a fun time. Cast as a normal goose, players are unleashed on an ill-prepared English village, with their goal being to annoy people and ruin a few days. That's largely it. The goose has a few objectives they need to accomplish in each area, which provides players with some direction on how to proceed. Otherwise, they can do whatever they want, and they are encouraged to explore the sandbox and cause as much havoc as a goose can cause.

  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  does not take itself very seriously and has a strong sense of humor. Silly as the concept sounds, the game works because it is fairly grounded, at least in the sense that this scenario could realistically play out in quaint villages. The setting is quite idyllic, making it prime for an influx of mayhem caused by a mischievous animal. Unlike many traditional open-world projects,
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  can be completed in a few hours and has very little "fluff" content. This makes it an ideal candidate to slot in between lengthier games that take weeks or months to complete.

  are somewhat recent names that saw the IP branching into fresh territories and genres, and they are all enjoyable. Out of the many games released during the 2010s,
  <em>
   Lego City Undercover
  </em>
  garnered arguably the most love, and it represents a high point in the franchise's legacy. Unlike some of the series' other original titles, this project largely sticks to the formula present in the licensed

  <em>
   City
  </em>
  <em>
   Undercover
  </em>
  tends to be cited as
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  's take on
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  , and while its world is nowhere near as stuffed with content as most of Rockstar's later releases, this comparison is not unfounded either. Lego City's design emphasizes variety, offering a wide selection of districts that each have their own flavor. The side quests and optional activities are relatively rudimentary and traditional for a
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  game, but the city itself is fun and relaxing to explore. The main story is also a blast, playing out like an action blockbuster ripped right out of the '80s.
  <em>
   Lego City Undercover
  </em>
  might be the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus Extra open-world game
  </strong>
  for kids, and older players could get a kick out of it too.

  PS Plus Extra has a couple of
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  games, including the most recent entry. Although not especially well-received,
  <em>
   Far Cry 6
  </em>
  has the best gunplay in the franchise so far, and its open-world is impressively big. If someone has never played a
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  project, they will likely have a blast with the sixth entry since one of its main criticisms is its map's visual similarities to its numbered predecessor.
  <em>
   Far Cry 3 Classic Edition
  </em>
  is also a decent option, but the beloved game shows its age by this point.

  <em>
   Far Cry Primal
  </em>
  takes place during an era when (gaming) conflicts were solved with bows and clubs rather than machine guns. The prehistoric setting was a refreshing change of pace in 2016, and that is still the case all these years later. While not a full-blown survival experience,
  <em>
   Primal
  </em>
  incorporates more elements from the genre than the license's modern main entries, and it strikes a nice balance between a traditional

  Part of PS Plus Extra and Premium's November 2023 lineup,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
  </em>
  is the upgraded version of a cult favorite open-world game that has garnered enough love to warrant Capcom to announce and develop a sequel. While the original title is still impressive to an extent,
  <em>
   Dark Arisen
  </em>
  is the definitive version since it adds a whole new area, one that naturally comes with a range of fresh equipment. More importantly, Bitterblack Isle is far harder than the base content, especially since the latter has a somewhat challenging opening but becomes fairly easy as it moves along.

  is all about its combat and customization, which both emphasize build variety and player freedom. While overpowered, the game's magic system is impressive and satisfying, especially once players really start to fine-tune and personalize their setup. Pawns are also one of the game's selling points, as these are AI-controlled support characters that players create and can share with other users. This mechanic allows players to form well-rounded parties as they can pick Pawns that make up for their own character's blind spots.

  When it comes to the open-world itself, Gransys is not particularly big, nor is it especially unique from a visual standpoint. However, the map can seem more expansive than it is due to limited fast travel and a lack of hand-holding.

  Co-op horror game
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Outlast Trials
   </em>
  </strong>
  has just released one of its biggest updates, which is no small feat considering the game's progress since Early Access. Project Lupara introduces the game's first new Prime Asset, Franco, who is also the game's first ranged enemy and drastically alters how players will think about the environment. Also included with the update is an all-new difficulty settings system that accommodates casual solo players and hardcore veterans alike, and there's even a daily and weekly task system to give players some structured goal setting.

  Game Rant sat down with
  <em>

  </em>
  game director Alex Charbonneau to discuss all the new content in the update. He spoke about how the team is thinking about its solo audience, how they approach adding new Rigs, enemies, and maps, and some ideas the team has for a potential future game mode.

  <strong>
   Charbonneau:
  </strong>
  It's funny you spotted that because not many people mention it. I think a lot of our users come for our co-op, but we do have an audience that is old-school
  <em>
   Outlast
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Outlast 2
  </em>
  fans, and they want to play
  <em>
   Outlast Trials
  </em>
  . From the very beginning, it was always clear that this also needed to be a perfect solo experience, as much as possible. That's why the entire game is fully playable solo, and this was always something we wanted to respect.

 <p>
  However, after releasing the game and watching people and looking at the data, we realized it was a bit tedious and sometimes challenging for solo players. Patch after patch, behind the scenes, we’ve been tuning the game more and more for solo players who encounter difficulties while they are playing.
 </p>

 <p>
  Ultimately, we always wanted to hold the players by the hand with the programs in the sense that it's Murkoff who's creating the program with the Trials, so they should be the ones in charge and also in charge of the difficulty curve, so to speak. But we concluded that our audience is vast. We have people who just pick up and play and want an intense horror experience, and we have other players who just want an extreme challenge.

 <p>
  We decided that it would be better to let the player decide between a bunch of difficulties. The difficulty that we call “Introductory” is the easiest way of learning the Trial, so it might not be for everyone because it's way easier. It's more like a story mode if you really want to enjoy the trial and learn the objectives. When you're ready, you could increase the difficulty based on your tolerance to pain if you want.

  To answer your question, solo has always been a feature we wanted to have in the game, and we always want to respect that. You also asked, “What's the challenge of designing for both situations?” One thing we didn't want is to have a solo player play with bots. Many co-op games turned to this solution, and that's a cool solution in those games. For us though, the
  <em>
   Outlast
  </em>
  experience is about you alone, so we always wanted to respect that. The game does tune itself a little bit considering the amount of players, but we also discovered that when you're alone, you're more in control.

 <p>
  If you're with another player or a group of players, they can f*ck up. You're stealthy, but your friend makes a mistake and runs in front of you and now suddenly you have an enemy you have to deal with. Naturally it gets harder. Also, with more players, it's more chaotic, which also creates more memorable moments. It's a fun game. People are screaming and laughing, and we love seeing it.

   I’ve been playing with a good friend of mine who’s not a huge horror fan, and I love those moments where one of us accidentally screws the other over by shutting a door or alerting an enemy. I’m looking forward to the new Barricade Rig bringing more moments like that.

  The Barricade became a natural choice for a new Rig for us because we're watching a lot of new players who struggle with completing an objective because an enemy always comes in and patrols around and players have to go away and come back. The rig was a natural thing for us to add because it’s this tool where you can say, “Okay, we're going to delay the enemy for a moment while we finish the objective.”

 <p>
  It's more situational as a tool than the Stun Rig or various other Rigs, but it has its uses and it's impressive to see how players are using it. I cannot wait to watch the streams of our players. When I say “players” internally, we notice how we use it when we play, but I cannot wait to see what real players are going to do with it.

  We have a bank of ideas for enemies, Trials, Prime Assets, and game modes. In terms of Rigs, there were a bunch of tests that maybe at the time didn't really work, but now that the foundation is solid and we know our game loop and everything, they might have a comeback in the future. We don't want to introduce too many new gameplay elements at once, so it's certainly stuff we're going to introduce in future updates.

  It's true. We have the privilege of being a small studio and our proximity to the players is key to our success. It's critical for us to listen to them, and we take action very quickly. There's one layer between the players and us, and it's the screen. It doesn't go through a committee of people deciding whatever. We watch people and we have some data, so we can see, “Oh, it's true, they have this struggle at this point in the game,” or “They would like this thing” and so that guides us a lot.

  With feedback, we fear that something could be too easy or too hard, so it might sound like a small thing to add a difficulty setting to a game, but it is game-changing in our situation. You mentioned your friend may not be a huge fan of horror games. A lot of people might have skipped
  <em>
   Outlast 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Outlast 2
  </em>
  because it's too intense for them. They're like, “Oh, I dropped within the first 10 minutes.” But now you can bring your friend and you can share the experience together, so it's truly important that we nail it so that even the “noobest” person has a good time.

  Also, our thing with

   Outlast
  </em>
  is that it’s very pick-up-and-play; you don't have to be good at
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  to enjoy our game. It's not about shooting, it's about acting naturally in the game, hiding, running away, making mistakes and trying to fix them, understanding the objective, and things like that. We really wanted to make sure that any player would be able to jump in.

  After that, there's the regular balancing thing stuff. People are going to say a Rig is too powerful or not powerful enough, so we pay attention to that and we take actions very quickly after. I guess the biggest feedback we always receive is that people want more stuff. We try to give them more stuff, but it takes time to build new Trials and new enemies. It takes time, but that's the number one feedback and that's our focus. We’re trying to provide as many new things as we can with this release, and I think it's a pretty packed update with a lot of cool stuff.

  We didn't want the players to struggle with the game mechanics. When you hold the controller or mouse and keyboard, we wanted it to feel very natural, like you said. In terms of what creates intensity, it's to keep the players on their toes to surprise them. That's where it can become a bit more difficult.

  There might be many layers of things at the same time, like enemies chasing you, you're out of battery, you have to complete that objective, you're not sure where the generator is, and it’s dark. So it's more of those elements that create the difficulty. It was important for us to make sure that you don't struggle with the controls or the core mechanics of the game.

  It was a huge revelation. To be honest, we wanted to do this type of infinite mode for a while; it's just that you need a certain amount of content to be able to do it. We felt that now was a good moment to introduce that. Internally, when we play every week, it’s the number one thing people want to play. It's so fun because it's like a mixtape of the content because it's random. There are random Variatiors, and just like roguelikes, before you enter a Trial, you're going to be offered a selection of upgrades and you can only pick one. Your loadout is building up as you're going through the Trials, and it creates moments that are so exciting and unpredictable.

  Also, one thing that players have been asking for in our game is that when you're killed in a Trial, you return to the sleep room, and then you can try again and keep your progression. We had people asking for a permadeath situation in our game. In the roguelike, it's not going to delete your character–you're going to keep her progression in the normal Trials–but in this game mode, when you start it, you start at level one, you build up your character, and you go as far as you can.

 <p>
  It's also a nice way to discover a lot of the upgrades and the Rigs that some players might have never really noticed before, or they're not there yet to unlock them. It gives them a sneak peek at what the game has to offer. We see it as our first iteration of this. After it is released, if people really like it, we're going to listen to the feedback and, for sure, it's going to evolve over time.

  You’re nailing some excellent points with the roguelike mode. We did think about that because, in our first iteration internally, it would only offer you things that you would have unlocked permanently in the sleep room. This was interesting, but it limited the choices quite fast for or early on in the game. After that, we tried it with the entire loadout available, and it offers you things randomly even if you don't own them in your main character progression. We decided to go with that just because it's a lot more fun and much more accessible for everyone at first.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":13,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":13,"nbrPlacementsScanned":13,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":959} -->

  One thing we're toying with in the future is maybe we could do an “Escalation mode hardcore version” or something like that, where maybe there's more connection between your permanent character and what happens in Escalation. To be honest, it's super open. We're going to see how people react, listen to the feedback, and for sure we're going to keep iterating on this.

  The Trials are random among the pool of Trials we have in the game. We have 20 Trials and then we apply Variators. We have many, many Variators that sometimes drastically change the way you do a Trial. The layout itself is never going to change–we're not there yet–but you're going to revisit the Trials and MK Challenges that you are familiar with, but because of the modifiers, you have to play differently.

 <p>
  Also, because the loadout you have is unique to your run, you might have to make decisions or behave differently than you usually do. We’ve tuned the difficulty curve because we didn't want to slap someone right at the first Trial. At first, it's a random Trial with just one or two Variators, and as you go on, there are more and more Variators and enemies are stronger.

 <p>
  Internally, I think the maximum Trial is around eight or nine because it gets really hard. I truly cannot wait to see streams of players try to go as far as they can, because I'm going to be surprised how far they're going to be able to go. But ultimately, they could play for a full week. There's no limit, it's endless. Maybe someone will do a marathon on Twitch for three days straight of just one escalation. We’ll see.

  Generally speaking, it just gives such a fun spectacle when you watch players because it's multiplayer and it's very systemic. We don't control a lot. Once the players are playing, we cross our fingers that they have a good experience. The timing of the enemies or patrolling or anything they do is completely systemic. We don't know what's going to happen, and I would say my favorite moments are the first time someone experiences psychosis. They get all f*cked up, the voice chat changes, they're freaking out, they don't know what's going on, and they have all those hallucinations.

  Also, the impostor is always very funny for new players. I've seen people get so confused. They're like, “What?! It's a PVP game? Are there weapons like this in the game? Who is this guy?” After a few minutes, they realize that it's the game that fooled them, and it’s so funny to see. Those were moments that were very memorable for us.

  Charbonneau: There's one or a few letters that can change in the name, but to be honest, in the heat of the action, you might never notice. Sometimes it's just this coincidence, but it's a perfect match. You're talking to your friend and the impostor is coming near you and you're certain that it's your friend, but suddenly it's not. He's like, “No, I'm elsewhere. What are you talking about?”

  I was scared for a second because we don't want to piss people off. I remember seeing one stream where the guy was like, “What is this?” He was very surprised and upset, but soon after, it changed when he realized that this was an NPC. Those are cool moments for us to watch.

  There are multiple angles to the creation of a Prime Asset. The Prime Assets in
  <em>
   Outlast Trials

  are like our main characters. They’re like a Joker or a major villain, so there's the whole artistic side and the narrative side to it.

  As far as gameplay, we wanted to bring something completely fresh and new to the game. With the fact that there are zero ranged weapons in the game and people got used to that, we felt that now was a good moment to introduce this kind of enemy and weapon just because it changes the way you play completely. Everything you assumed was safe is not anymore. Running away in a corridor, you're basically exposing yourself. Suddenly you have to take cover behind the obstacles and objects, which is something you've never done before unless you wanted to play stealth, but now it's for your survival.

  When the update releases, there's a new Trial with Franco, but we're also going to be running a special event for the first month where Franco also appears in any other Trial. Even in Trials that you are very familiar with, when Franco shows up, it's completely different. This is the first time we’ve added a new Prime Asset, so it's going to be very interesting to see how the players react.

  That’s a valid point. We're not a shooter game, so a lot of the mechanics didn’t exist before. There were no projectiles of this type, there was no recoil, and there were no bullet tracers. None of this was in the game, so we had to build it just like if we're building an enemy in a
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game, let's say. It's something that we're familiar with due to our experience elsewhere on other games we've done in the past, but for this game specifically, we had to start from the bottom and then build the whole fact that there's now a ranged weapon in the game.

  It was part of the balancing. One rule we have is that every Prime Asset needs to be working correctly in any Trial, so when we were balancing his range and his bullet spread and things like that, we paid attention to the metrics we already had in the game. Obviously, there are moments where he gets an advantage, like I said if it's a long straight corridor or open area you have to be more careful. It's also a cool twist because normally you will not care if Coyle is at the other end, he sees you and you can run away. But if Franco sees you, he is going to shoot you.

 <p>
  It works very well, to be honest, in any Trial even outside The Docks which is the new Trial. It's impressive how when he's around his presence is very strong. It's very intense. Basically, the rule we have is, even in the future as we add more villains in the game, we want to make sure they can be used in any Trial.

  There's a lot of iteration internally from the very beginning. As we gain experience with the game, as our foundation is solid now, and we have a large community, we’re in a good situation to move forward.

We've added the fact that their attacks now do a special ability, like Gooseberry can cause bleeding or Coyle can disable your Rig. With Franco, we felt like just the fact that he has a ranged weapon is good enough of an effect, but it's getting clearer and clearer how we should be building them and how they can change the way people play in the various Trials.

  I would say it's challenging because we want to move fast, we want to provide new content to our players as fast as possible, but at the same time, we want to make sure it's well done and not buggy. But that’s part of the challenge of making video games.

  There's an ending in the game, which is something that we feel is special about
  <em>
   Outlast Trials,
  </em>
  because normally live service games don't have a conclusion or ending. For us from the beginning, it was important that the player had a goal to achieve even though it's multiplayer, and you can play every day if you want. In this update, the final Trial is different from what we had before. There's also a new conclusion.
 </p>

 <p>
  Other things might be seen as smaller, but they are significant. We have a new Task System, so this is another thing people wanted. “We love the game, we love the Trials, but we need more Trials, more stuff, more goals.” So now, when you go into the game, Murkoff is going to have tasks for you to accomplish every day and every week. We also have other tasks for onboarding, teaching the player a few of the mechanics in the game. Those are going to be refreshing every week, which is cool.

  It comes along with the new Catalog System, which is basically another thing players wanted because we have a lot of nice cosmetics in the game, but the way we were giving them away was through random rewards after you finish a Trial. It didn’t do the best job of exposing some of the cool things you have in the game. Instead, the Catalog is basically like window shopping: you go into this menu, you can see pages of all the stuff that are there to be unlocked, and we want to add more catalogs every season.

 <p>
  This one comes with the Project Lupara catalog, which is a bunch of new cosmetics, and then in the future, we want to add more and more. Once we have a seasonal catalog–that’s what we call them–they're there forever, so there's no time pressure. It’s not FOMO or anything like that. Players can take as much time as they want to unlock the stuff in it. I think it's going to hook them for a longer amount of time. Just internally, booting the game while reading the tasks, going into Escalation, trying to complete the tasks, going to pick up your stuff in the catalog, it’s a great loop.

  One thing I want to say is we never could have predicted that this would become a live service game. The only reason we're here today is because people demanded that. No joke, we had surveys where we were asking people “How often would you play this game?” and my expectation personally was maybe once a week at best, maybe once a month when they have friends around. No, the majority of the answers were “Daily.”

 <p>
  We have a lot of pressure. We had comments from people saying, “When I'm not in the sleep room or in my cell, I don't feel good. I want to go back in the game.” I'm super impressed as well, because as you said, this is a very specific kind of game, but our players want to have a reason to come back daily and weekly. That's what we're giving, and no one's pushing us to do that for business reasons. It's truly from the developers listening to the community. They just want more, so those systems work well. I think people are really going to enjoy them.

   You raised an interesting point there. This is a unique case because so many games are built from the ground up to be live service games for business reasons, while you did it because players asked for it. This is almost the opposite of what you usually see in the industry.

  You’re right, that’s a valid point. There's a lot of debate in the industry about all the big companies pushing for live games and players don't really want that sometimes. Personally, I'm a huge live game player. I love investing my time in a game that is maintained by the developers and there's this back and forth. But the original plan was that it was a multiplayer game with about four or five Trials.

 <p>
  That was the plan initially. It became crystal clear at the closed beta two years ago that we needed to provide a better game loop because we reacted to the fact that people were so happy with the game, and they just wanted more and more.

 <p>
  I guess it comes with the fact that it's a bit unique on the market. A game where you have no weapon, survival co-op, all of those factors. It really works. So yes, we became this game because people wanted it to become like that. Obviously, we do have people who are more solo players, they talk about
  <em>
   Outlast 3
  </em>
  for example, and we discuss it internally as well. We'll see what's going to happen in the future. But right now, our focus is on
  <em>
   Outlast Trials
  </em>
  . If someone really wants to play solo, the entire game will always be fully playable alone.

  I think a lot of businesses would like to be in this position. You hear the stories, and they twist a game towards live service and maybe the game wasn't meant to be like that.

  It is challenging. Players have high expectations, and we want to provide quality content. We were still learning to make sure that we could produce fast, but at the level of quality that we were happy with and that the players were happy with. Also, the twist with this kind of game is that you want to tease people, but you don't want to reveal too much. The whole point of playing a Trial is the surprise of discovering it. That's also why we try to provide regular updates, and we have special events in the game.

  At the same time, we talk about the roadmap, but we don't want to say too much because it's cool to have people speculate about something. We still want to surprise them with our new content. Yeah, we're there. We're adjusting, and I think we are in a good place now that we found our pacing and it should be good from now on.

  That's a good one. I think replayability was something that is a huge challenge for us because every Trial is a mini-scenario and players will want to come back every day. Right now, we don't have procedural levels, for example. It's something we did try in the past but wasn't nailed down. It might be something that we re-explore in the future.

  I would say sometimes we do balance changes for the best of the game. Like when we do a balance patch, for example, of a Rig, it's not like we get a complaint from Coyle saying “Oh, the game is now unfair against me,” he's an NPC. Sometimes we react to the feedback just because we don't want a situation to be ruined. because a Rig is too powerful and, therefore, the whole scare factor goes away.

 <p>
  Those were moments where we were a bit surprised. We did a change, and people might have been like, “Oh, this was unnecessary,” but after a few days, people realize and understand why we did it this way. So we acknowledge that, and it's cool and now that's how the game is. But in this map, there's not too much balancing. I think we are at a good place with the items and the Rigs.

   Q: Something I noticed about this new map is that it seems to have some verticality with stairways and multiple levels. How did you approach its design? Do you look at previous Trials and find ways to try something different?

  That’s exactly it. Every Trial, we try to have some twists either in gameplay or in the layout or the gruesome stuff that you're going to be doing. Yes, it's definitely an angle that we haven't fully explored yet. There's a place in the level where you do a lot of back and forth, and you have to go to a higher floor and then come back down. I think it's going to feel different and that's also part of the goal when we design a new Trial, too. We don't want to just copy-paste some formula, we want to bring something fresh, something new. The layout and the structure are definitely part of the process.

  We want to answer the number one request, which is that people want more of everything. We have a nice structure now, and it's even improved with the update. They want more stuff to do. They want to replay things, but with a twist, so Escalation is our first step towards this goal. But we're already talking about the next Prime Assets, the next Trials, and there are also things that we want to try.

  A funny thing with the game is that, narratively, Murkoff kidnaps those poor people, and they become test subjects and Murkoff tries stuff on them. Well, Red Barrels are Murkoff and the players are the subjects, and we have a nice platform to test things. One thing that we often hear and I think would also improve replayability is maybe something a bit more competitive. Not in the sense of having someone control Coyle, but what if multiple teams of Reagents have to complete a Trial? Are they going to disrupt the other team to make them fail in their objective or things like that? There are plenty of discussions like that. Our plan is just like Escalation. One day we might release it, observe what people think, and just bring them into the project of building this game mode.

  It's delicate because the game is PvE, right? People love it for this reason, and we don't want to go away from that. But if somehow we can find a twist where you’re like, “Oh sh*t!” because there's another team now so the same Trial is always different, it could be fun. So stay tuned, we'll see what happens.

  If you've played the game before and you’re coming back to it, it's going to be a completely new experience, to be honest. There are so many new things. I think it's going to really engage you back. If you've never played
  <em>

  , I think it's the best time to join because we've polished everything everywhere. I feel like the onboarding will be super smooth for our new players, and why not bring a friend along with you? It's such a fun experience to share.

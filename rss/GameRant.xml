      <title>Assassin's Creed Shadows Story Campaign Length Teased</title>

 <p>
  Ubisoft has given some insight as to how long the main storyline in the upcoming
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </strong>
  </em>
  might take to complete, and while the actual figure is somewhat hard to determine, it seems comparable to other recent entries.
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  is set to return the franchise to the action RPG formula of previous entries, which may justify its length.

  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  has evolved a lot as the gaming industry continues to grow and shift with time, going from a grounded retooling of a
  <em>
   Prince of Persia
  </em>
  prototype to a full-fledged action RPG franchise with its latest entries. With
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Mirage
  </em>
  taking things a step back to a shorter, more concise approach to storytelling and a smaller map, however, it has led to some questions regarding the scale of the series' latest entry.

 <p>
  Luckily, a Reddit AMA with some developers at Ubisoft served to answer some of these questions, one of which specifically regarded the length of the game's storyline as compared to previous games in the franchise. One developer responded to the question by stating that it is comparable to the average lengths of previous RPG
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  entries, but that the true length was hard to determine.

  According to the developers, the various open-world elements in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  make it difficult to tell exactly how long the story might take to finish, given how much there is for players to do in the game. Also mentioned is the incorporation of a "canon mode" option to play through the story without branching storyline choices for fans who want to play the original story without any role-playing consequences.

 <p>
  The Reddit thread also posed questions about the modern-day storyline in the new
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed,
  </em>
  something which has been a staple of the series since the original game back in 2007. While the developers did not provide anything concrete so as not to spoil the game, they did tease the beginning of a new storyline, seemingly moving on from the previous modern protagonist.

  The franchise has had an ongoing modern-day storyline since the original game,
  <em>
  </em>
  which followed modern assassin and fan favorite Desmond Miles, before concluding his storyline in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  From there, the series moved on with subsequent entries and eventually landed on a new protagonist, Layla Hassan, who fans last saw in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Valhalla,
  </em>
  but will seemingly not return for
  <em>
   Shadows.
  </em>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  loves to add limited-time items and other interesting collectibles and cosmetics that players might not be able to get anymore. The idea of owning something rare in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  adds to its value in the hands of players, and with multiple skins still awaiting release in the Item Shop after years, or other skins unable to be purchased in this day and age due to exclusivity, it's time to look at the trusty harvesting tool, and those that are a rare find indeed.

 <p>
  As players roam Battle Royale with their trusty harvesting tools, it's best to remember that some of the rarest pickaxes in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  might showcase a veteran status, so it could be a good idea to watch out for these rare finds or to marvel at something that for so long has been without an entry in the item shop.

   The Fortnite Item Shop constantly evolves, and each day will see returning cosmetics or new ones from Fortnite originals to amazing collabs. Yet, with so many pickaxes in the 7+ years of Fortnite's existence, it might be worth taking a look at some of the rarest pickaxes in Fortnite that have debuted through the Item Shop and challenges and have yet to return, despite their presence from years ago.

  Jinx in Fortnite is a highly desired skin thanks to her legendary status in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , and her recent Netflix acclaim with
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  Season 2. Despite the relatively new release of
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  's final season, Jinx did not return to the Item Shop, and as such, neither did her Pow Pow Crusher pickaxe.

  The Pow Pow Crusher is a giant hammer that looks great with Jinx, but sadly, it's a cosmetic that fans of
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  are going to have to do without, since it hasn't returned, and seems unlikely to return in the near future if it didn't with the hype around Jinx's own show.

 <p>
  There's something about the Gaming Legends Series in Fortnite that makes them resistant to return to the Item Shop, and the Gravity Hammer joins that growing list. Master Chief is an icon in the gaming world, and if he hasn't returned in almost 3 years, then it's unlikely that his pickaxe would either.

 <p>
  The Gravity Hammer has been left vaulted outside of the Item Shop, left to those who venture through the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  games instead of those who want to harvest materials in Fortnite. Master Chief's return is unlikely, and his powerful smash-and-grab hammer will stay gone with him.

  Denis Villeneuve's
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  is highly regarded as a masterpiece of cinema, so it comes as no surprise to see such a hit enter the Fortnite Item Shop with a
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  set that featured Paul Atreides and Chani alongside some
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  -themed cosmetics to wield in Battle Royale. One of their cosmetics was the Maker Hooks, which were Fremen tools used to ride the giant sandworms of Arrakis.

 <p>
  Yet, despite the importance of the Maker Hooks in the lore, and how
  <em>
   Dune: Part Two
  </em>
  was released in 2024, the skins did not return, nor did the pickaxe, so whoever has the
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  set can rest assured knowing this rarity is in their locker, with it being unlikely that it's going to come back since it's already been almost 3 years.

 <p>
  Chapter 1 Season X was when
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  really found its footing, and to boldly go with new collabs and new ideas, it was inevitable that some would be left behind. One such thing left behind is the Jagged Edge pickaxe, which has remained forever retired to Chapter 1 Season X, for no reason other than
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  might have just forgotten its existence.

 <p>
  With hundreds of pickaxes, it's not a terrible shock to see Jagged Edge left behind, with almost 5 years until its anniversary date. It's another pickaxe that isn't terribly special, but to those who own it, surely they are aware of its rarity.

  The dreaded Iron Claws might just be dual-wielded knives with a sharp handle, but they are certainly rare. Joining the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Summer Splash event with the Shore Leave Outfit back in 2020, these July cosmetics have not returned since, and there's no possible explanation as to why.

 <p>
  The Iron Claws were around for one Item Shop rotation before being removed, and they have never returned. Their one appearance in the store makes them extremely rare, even if they are dirt cheap with a cost of 500 V-Bucks.

  A pickaxe that prioritizes safety first, this odd-shaped back is adorned with spikes and two helmets strapped together. Bucky Bat comes with 3 variants, the default, the minty version, and the flaming. Yet, even with three variants, it seems the Bucky Bat has not been a popular choice among the community, especially not for 800 V-Bucks when other cosmetics are far cheaper.

 <p>
  The Bucky Bat hasn't even attempted to return past its initial release in 2020, so this 4-year-old pickaxe might go on to see yet another anniversary without purchases. Truth be told, it's not a terribly exciting pickaxe, but it is certainly rare.

  The iconic blade of the iconic Snake Eyes, this katana came as part of Snake Eyes' set, and it seems the years have not been kind, for it has been absent for over 3 years now. Despite how cool Snake Eyes is, it seems that younger audiences don't have a lot of love for the 80s
  <em>
   G.I. Joe
  </em>
  cartoon characters, leaving Snake Eyes as a flop.

 <p>
  Snake Eyes hasn't been back for a while, and whether it's due to licensing issues, or just a lack of interest, it seems that his cool katana is going to stay in the shadows for now, until something big comes up relating to the franchise.

 <p>
  Travis Scott and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  are two powerhouses of their industries that are often heard under the same breath because of a collab back in 2020. For over 4 years, players have wanted to see Travis Scott in the item shop, alongside his pickaxe, the Diamond Jack, which features plenty of glistening diamonds on a stick to hit things with.

 <p>
  It's an extremely fancy pickaxe thanks to the assortment of diamonds, gold, and a ruby, and not only does it look wealthy, but it certainly as a wealth quality to it, as it's an extremely rare pickaxe that not many players would have. After all, people have been waiting, and wondering, as to why Travis Scott in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  hasn't returned in 4 years.

 <p>
  When looking at the Rockbreaker, players might not know what to think. At first glance, it looks like a cluster of drills that have been stitched together on a stick to make a pickaxe that is capable of the same thing as all the others. Yet, despite its weird appearance, it's worth noting that it's one of the rarest pickaxes.

 <p>
  Whilst some pickaxes are Battle Pass exclusive, and others require codes, the Rockbreaker is nothing of the sort, but just hasn't been in the item shop rotation for 5 years. Has Epic Games forgotten it, or is it just not worth putting back in the shop?

 <p>
  For the undisputed greatest players in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , the FNCS Axe of Champions exists to prove their mastery over the millions of players in the game. This is perhaps the rarest pickaxe in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , and players can look upon it, but to wield it is equally as rare as actually seeing it in-game, as only 14 players have this pickaxe, and it used to constantly changes hands and lockers.

 <p>
  The Axer of Champions is a reward for those who win the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Champion Series in Chapter 2, and it has since been replaced, meaning those with this version of it, can proudly keep it in their hands forever, and that number is so few that they should be equally as feared as they are respected.

 <p>
  Whilst something as common as a crowbar might not seem like a rare find, in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , it most certainly is. The crowbar is a one-of-a-kind pickaxe that only featured in Chapter 1, with Season 5 and Season 8 receiving unique challenges in the new LTM, The Getaway. If players completed these challenges, they would receive the trusty crowbar as a pickaxe to wield and harvest materials with.

 <p>
  The Getaway hasn't returned since, and neither have the set of challenges, meaning that players who were not around in 2018 and 2019 will not have this pickaxe, reserving it as a special place for veterans of Battle Royale, so next time players see a crowbar, try to remember that it's not just a common tool.

 <p>
  One of the earliest collabs in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , the Lazer Axe came as part of the Lazerism set. Whilst first introduced as Rare, the Lazer Axe has joined the rank of the Icon Series, but even with this updated set, the pickaxe itself has not returned for quite some time. Despite releasing in 2019, and even having a shop day for 2020 and 2021, Lazer Axe has not returned, and neither has Major Lazer.

 <p>
  Those who enjoy Major Lazer might be disappointed to hear this, especially since the pickaxe is a pretty unique and cool-looking design. A golden battle axe with enough heat to make the thing glow is certainly a nice find, albeit one that has not returned in almost 5 years.

  A fan-favorite pickaxe, the Leviathan Axe was adorned not only for its bundle with God of War's Kratos, but also for its swing speed. Many fans believed that the pickaxe swung faster, giving them an advantage over others, but this has since been nullified, returning the Leviathan Axe to just another cool pickaxe that is a rarity.

  Whilst Kratos and his cosmetics were added back to the shop API during the most logical season for him to return in, the set still has not appeared, leaving the Leviathan Axe in the hands of those who purchased it over 3 years ago.

  It's been 4 years since the Psycho Buzz Axes have been in the Item Shop, and the fact that even when they were introduced, they could only be purchased in a 2,000 V-Buck set, might have thrown people off at the time. Even purchasing
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  on the Epic Games Store doesn't provide this cosmetic set anymore, so it's a pickaxe players simply have to hope to return one day.

      <title>Overwatch 2 Makes Charming Change to Two Maps</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  recently updated both the Dorado and Watchpoint: Gibraltar maps, moving Juno’s crashed space shuttle from the former to the latter, replacing it with a new monument. These map changes were not documented in any patch notes, but are live in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  right now.

  In the mid-Season 11 content update for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , a space shuttle containing a message in Morse code and an image featuring Mei and her friend Jiayi was found crashed into the attack spawn on the Dorado map. This was later confirmed to be the landing pod in which Juno, the Martian support hero added in Season 12, had first landed on planet Earth.

 <p>
  Now, it seems like
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  has continued the saga of Juno’s spaceship not only on Dorado, but in the Watchpoint: Gibraltar map as well. As of the Season 14 update in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , Juno’s crashed shuttle on Dorado has been removed and replaced with a monument commemorating the landing of the first natural-born Martian on Earth.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  content creator Hazelet shared images of the charming new statue on Twitter, along with the English translation of the Spanish engraving on it.

  Juno’s Shuttle Has Moved in Overwatch 2

 <p>
  As for Watchpoint: Gibraltar, Juno’s drop-ship has been transported into one of the map’s spawns. Recent lore revealed Tracer, Winston, and the other members of Overwatch were responsible for helping Juno after her crash landing, so as the organization’s current base of operations, it makes sense for her shuttle to be moved to Gibraltar. It seems like Juno has officially joined Overwatch alongside new arrivals like Lucio, Mei, Orisa, and Efi.

 <p>
  Fans were delighted to see these changes implemented to Dorado and Watchpoint: Gibraltar. The saga of in-game teasers for Juno was popular among players, fueling speculation ahead of her reveal. While it seems likely that more
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  PvE missions aren’t coming any time soon, many fans are delighted to see the story continue in other ways like this.

  Hazard, the new tank hero in
  <em>

  Season 14, also shook up a spawn room by wrecking the Oasis map in Season 13 ahead of his official reveal. Now that the hero is officially live, it is possible
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  might follow suit in Oasis by having the damage inflicted by him and the Phreaks repaired in some way. Players will have to wait until 2025 to see if
  <em>

  </em>
  does so – or if it adds more map teasers for upcoming heroes like these in the future.

  A Fire-type specialist based in the region of Hoenn, Flannery is the gym leader of Lavaridge Gym. Although she is not the strongest trainer in the region and by no means the mightiest gym leader, her team of Fire Pocket Monsters are some of the toughest in the games when rematched by players in
  <em>
   Pokemon Emerald.
  </em>

  Flannery fights with a level 50 Torkcoal and a range of other
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , such as Camerupt and Rapidash, in the high 40s — putting up a real fight in the heat of battle. Flannery is the weakest Fire-type gym leader on this list.

  Legend tells that Blaine, having nearly frozen to death atop a mountainous peak, was guided to safety by the legendary Fire
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , Moltres, cementing his passion for Fire types. Blaine shows this fiery passion in battle with a formidable selection of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  such as Arcanine, Rapidash, Houndoom, and Magmorter. Blaine's
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  reach the low sixties at his strongest, making him far more powerful than previous other Fire-type trainers on this list.

  Chili is a formidable Fire-type trainer and one of the gym leaders of Striaton City Gym in the Unova region. Fighting alongside his brothers in a unique triple battle, players are put to the test, having to deal with three skilled trainers rather than the usual one.

 <p>
  While Chili's original team in the Black and White games is much to be desired, his lineup of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  in
  <em>
   Black and White 2
  </em>
  is surprisingly strong, with three powerful Fire
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , such as Simisear, reaching the mid to high 60s, with his strongest being level 67 — a pinch higher than Mela's team.

  An astute member of the Kalos Elite Four in

  , Malva is a master of Fire types in every sense of the word, with a range of Fire
  <em>

  from Pyroar to Talon Flame that range in levels from the mid-60s to mid-70s, depending on where you battle her, such as in the games Battle Chataue.

 <p>
  Malva is one of the strongest trainers on this list but comes in slightly weaker than subsequent entries due to having so few
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  on her team, despite their individual strength. Malva's level 70 team consists of only three
  <em>
   Pokemon.

  The calculated leader of team Magma is Maxie, a strong Fire-type trainer with a mix of

   Pokemon
  </em>
  types on his teams. While Maxie comes in lower than some other entries on this list in terms of the power of his Pocket Monsters in games such as

  <em>

  such as Groudon in his appearance in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon as part of Team Rainbow Rocket.

  While looking less like a powerful trainer, Crispin is easily one of the strongest Fire-type trainers on this list. A member of the BB League Elite Four of the Blueberry Academy, Crispin is an exceptional trainer alongside his classmates who make up the BB League.

 <p>
  Crispin has six
  <em>
   Pokemon,
  </em>
  all in the high 70s, reaching up into the 80s when rematched.
  <em>
  </em>
  His
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  include Rotom, Talonflame, Magmorter, and the powerful Blaziken (a fan favorite). Crispin's
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  by level is stronger than pretty much all other Fire-type trainers, showcasing his talent as one of the best — though he's edged out by one trainer with more experience under his belt.

  The most powerful Fire-type trainer is Sinnoh Elite Four Member Flint. Donning a red afro and a powerful set of Pocket Monsters to match his bombastic style, Flint is the third Elite Four member players must face in the
  <em>
   Pokemon Platinum, Diamond, and Pearl
  </em>
  games and their remakes,
  <em>
   Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.
  </em>

 <p>
  The Fire master has an exceptionally strong suite of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  at his disposal. Notable Pocket Monsters include a level 83 Magmorter in the remakes,
  <em>
   Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl,
  </em>
  and other
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  in the high seventies to low eighties. Flint can also be battled alongside Gym Leader comrade Volkner, showcasing his fire mastery and the electrical proficiency of Volkner's team
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
  While Flint is not the strongest Fire-type trainer by sheer levels (Crispin has an average level Pokemon of ~83), Flint excels in his experience as a Fire-type trainer, having been an Elite Four member for years with far more knowledge than Crispin in the battling department. Hence, when it comes down to the heat of the combat, Flint has the edge, despite minimal level differences, placing him firmly as the best Fire-type trainer.

  Ballistic, and with
  <em>
   Fortnite

  primarily being a Battle Royale game, diving into this additional mode is sure to throw some players off. However, players getting used to the game may benefit from learning about the first aspect of the Ballistic loadout system, Flex Gadgets. Here is a deep dive into
  <strong>

  Flex Gadgets are a special part of the player's arsenal, each providing unique benefits. At the start of a game of Ballistic, players must
  <strong>
   select one of five Flex Gadgets
  </strong>
  during the "Flex Gadgets" phase. Only
  <strong>
   one player can have a specific Gadget at a time
  </strong>
  , so teams must coordinate to ensure everyone gets a Flex Gadget that suits their playstyle.

  Once selected, the Flex Gadget occupies the Kit section of the player's loadout and must be

  to be used. Flex Gadgets

  The
  <strong>
   Proximity Mine
  </strong>
  is one of the go-to Gadgets in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic. This powerful explosive device
  <strong>
   detonates without warning when an enemy comes within its range
  </strong>
  — dealing 50 damage. To use it, players can equip and then throw the device on any surface they desire. Unlike other Gadgets, players can also pick a deployed Proximity Mine by heading over to it and pressing the Interact Button.

 <p>
  The Proximity Mine is particularly
  <strong>
   effective when placed in key areas of interest
  </strong>
  , such as flank routes and spots that players cannot consistently cover with their crosshairs. It can also be
  <strong>
   effective for defending the Rift Point
  </strong>
  against attackers attempting to plant the device, or to stop defenders trying to defuse it after planting. If players encounter an enemy Proximity Mine, they can shoot it to safely detonate it.

  The
  <strong>
   Bubble Grenade
  </strong>
  is likely an item that players have used before, as it has been heavily featured in Battle Royale in the past. This nifty item
  <strong>
   deploys a force field bubble where it is thrown
  </strong>
  , creating a barricade that blocks incoming fire while it is active.

 <p>
  The Bubble Grenade works as an excellent form of mobile cover, great for throwing down to quickly avoid taking damage or for protecting others. In the right circumstances, it can be a valuable asset, especially for players looking to plant or defuse the Rift Point Device without being shot from a distance. While
  <strong>
   players cannot shoot through their bubble
  </strong>
  , players can peak to the right or left of the bubble to fire at enemies, though doing so may expose them to potential damage.

  The
  <strong>
   Recon Grenade
  </strong>
  focuses less on dealing outright damage or shielding players and instead offers the unique benefit of revealing nearby enemies. Players can throw the Recon Grenade in their desired direction, and once it hits a surface, it
  <strong>
   emits a pulse that live-pings any enemies within its radius
  </strong>
  for the entire team to see.

  The Recon Grenade serves as an effective tool for pinpointing enemies when audio cues or teammates' callouts aren't enough. It is particularly useful for tossing around corners where enemies might be hiding, or for aggressively
  <strong>
   revealing clusters of opponents
  </strong>
  early in the game.

  The

   Frag Grenade
  </strong>
  functions just like the regular Grenade in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  OG, featuring a fuse timer that will cause the grenade to explode, dealing 40 damage to any opponent it hits. The Frag Grenade's
  <strong>
   fuse time will begin the moment the player throws the grenade
  </strong>
  , and it cannot be cooked like those featured in other games. However, it can be bounced off surfaces.

  Last up is another item from the classic
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Battle Royale loot pool, the
  <strong>
   Impulse Grenade.
  </strong>
  As players might expect, this Gadget functions identically to its Battle Royale counterpart, serving more as a mobility item than a typical grenade. When thrown, the Impulse Grenade
  <strong>
   releases a shockwave that propels players in the opposite direction.
  </strong>

 <p>
  The Impulse Grenade is best used to propel the user in a specific direction, such as
  <strong>
   quickly rounding corners or escaping danger.
  </strong>
  It can also flush enemies out of cover or
  <strong>
   knock back opponents holding angles
  </strong>
  , creating opportunities to rush in and eliminate them.

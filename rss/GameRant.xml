    Hyper Light Breaker,
   </strong>
  </em>
  the newest entry in the
  <em>
   Hyper Light
  </em>
  universe following 2016's
  <em>
   Hyper Light Drifter,
  </em>
  is preparing to release into Early Access. This open-world roguelike game encourages players to team up to save the procedurally generated Overgrowth from the looming threat of the Abyss King.
  <em>
   Hyper Light Breaker's
  </em>
  developers, Heart Machine, have worked closely with the fan community throughout the game's development process. Following the Early Access launch, the team intends to continue to keep open dialogue with fans, communicate regularly about planned updates, and celebrate players' experiences in the world of
  <em>
   Hyper Light

  Game Rant, the
  <em>
   Hyper Light Breaker
  </em>
  development team, including lead producer Michael Clark and community/PR manager Yiyi Zhang, discussed the importance of the
  <em>
   Hyper Light
  </em>
  community. They discussed plans for maintaining communication after launch, short- and long-term plans during the game's Early Access period, and how they plan to celebrate
  <em>
   Hyper Light Breaker's

  Fan Community
 </h2>
 <p>
  The Heart Machine team sees maintaining a real relationship with their fans and players as key. They look forward to receiving fan feedback that will help
  <em>
   Hyper Light Breaker
  </em>
  develop as it begins its journey in Early Access. Yiyi Zhang also highlighted the team's plans to continue openly communicating with the players as new bosses, biomes, upgrades, and other features are added throughout the Early Access period.

  <strong>
   Q: Heart Machine is known for closely engaging with its community by taking feedback and providing steady updates. What are some of the advantages (or disadvantages) to this more transparent approach?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clark:
  </strong>
  The major advantage is fostering a real relationship with our fans - they’re not metrics, KPIs, demographics, “market share” or whatever - they’re people. Likewise, the more we interact with them, the more they know us as people, as artists, designers - creators, and not as a faceless corporation. We’re people, making games for people, and interacting with our community as people keeps that in everyone’s minds. The major disadvantage is that the more available you are, the more people expect you to be available, and we’re a small team with a lot of game to make, so we can’t be available to everyone.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Zhang:
  </strong>
  Community has always been core to our success. Given our studio’s grassroots beginnings as a small Kickstarter launched by a group of artists operating out of Alx’s garage, we know we wouldn’t be where we are today without the support of our fans and industry colleagues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keeping an ongoing dialogue with our players enables us to make informed design choices that really resonate with our audience. Our supporters become stakeholders in our projects because they're able to feel the impact they've individually made to the games we're making. And as stakeholders, they feel excited to share our games with their communities. The relationship we have with our player base gives us a huge advantage in this increasingly competitive market, and will ultimately be critical to our post-Early Access launch plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: As an Early Access game, what can you say about the team’s current plans to continue its development after this launch? What are the biggest priorities?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clark:
  </strong>
  Our top priorities for the game after Early Access launch on January 14th are pretty straightforward: First, we’re focused on adding a lot more content (we want to double-to-triple most types of content, like player characters, gear, boss fights, narrative systems, etc.). Next, we’re adding more variety and depth to the world and gameplay (we want more to change between runs in the same cycle, add end-game difficulty systems, add more unlocks and progression mechanics).
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, we’ve protected time in our schedule to account for fan input, expecting that our audience will have feedback, suggestions, and improvements that we’ll want to incorporate into our game. Early Access is a way for developers to include their fans in the development process, and we want to take full advantage of the amazing community we have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: What should players expect regarding communication after this Early Access launch?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Clark:
  </strong>
  Players should expect frequent updates of varying sizes - some updates will be small, with large updates every few months.

  Honoring Themes And Taking Time To Celebrate
 </h2>
 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Hyper Light Breaker
  </em>
  is neither a sequel nor a prequel to
  <em>
   Hyper Light Drifter,
  </em>
  it takes place in the same world as the 2016 game.
  <em>
   Hyper Light Drifter
  </em>
  featured a major theme of living with a potentially terminal illness, a story inspired by Heart Machine founder Alx Preston's own experiences with heart disease. The
  <em>
   Hyper Light Breaker
  </em>
  team has confirmed that this theme will appear in some context in the new game, although they did not share details. They also confirmed that they will celebrate the game's launch by playing the game themselves, observing fan streams and reactions, and, of course, taking some well-deserved time to relax.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: One of the key things about
   <em>
    Hyper Light Drifter
   </em>
   is that the Drifter is sick and is a representation of people with chronic illnesses who really speaks on a beautiful, profound level to people going through similar stuff in the real world. Is this referenced or reflected in any way in Breaker? Does the Breaker “represent” anything like this? Do we see any other characters experiencing the Drifter's illness or references to it?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CLARK:
  </strong>
  I don’t believe we could remove illness as a theme from
  <em>
   Hyper Light
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Can you talk about your plans for launch day? How is the team celebrating?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CLARK:
  </strong>
  Most of the team will be spending the day watching folks stream and play and frantically refreshing and sharing community feedback. A large number of us are looking forward to playing the game with our families and friends.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  is undoubtedly one of the most highly anticipated games of 2025, despite the year being immensely stacked with other big titles as well. While
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is following
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  , it's technically a successor to the 2018 hit that brought the franchise into the mainstream,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter: World
  </em>
  . Ultimately,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is an action RPG that builds upon the foundation established by
  <em>
   Monster Hunter:
  </em>
  World, with its seamless open world and lifelike ecosystems, alongside some new mechanics like the Seikret mount and a Focus mode designed to help players target their attacks more efficiently. However, despite in every way being an action RPG and in every way also being a
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  game,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  has been tagged as a dating sim on Steam.
 </p>
 <p>
  To put it plainly,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is not a dating sim, nor has any
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  title before it ever been a dating sim. Appropriately defined, a dating sim (short for dating simulation) is a type of video game that focuses on building romantic relationships between the player character and potential love interests. Obviously, this is a far cry from what
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  has ever been and most likely ever will be. After all, the name of the game is
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  , not "Romance Finder." In light of that, why is
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  tagged as a dating sim on Steam?

  Steam Tags Are a Folksonomy
 </h3>
 <p>
  Steam tags can be extremely helpful for those looking for a specific genre or type of gameplay, and with how many different layers there are to games these days, it makes sense why the system still exists. However, at the end of the day, Steam tags are a folksonomy, meaning they are a user-generated system of classifying and organizing online content into different categories. This ultimately means that users can log into Steam at any point, navigate to the platform's tags section, and then add a custom tag.

  As long as a tag adheres to Steam's community guidelines, it can then begin receiving upvotes from other users if they agree with the tag. While approved tags will continue to stick around, even if they don't receive votes, they're unlikely to appear more prominently on Steam's store page. As such, Steam users are encouraged to add tags that actually apply to a video game or can at least offer substantial help to other users who are attempting to locate a particular game on the platform. This is where
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  comes in, which has been humorously categorized by users as a dating sim.

  Why Users Tagged Monster Hunter Wilds as a Dating Sim
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' dating sim story dates back to June 2024, after one of its first gameplay trailers shown off during a PlayStation State of Play revealed a first look at the character Gemma,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' Smithy. For only around 12 seconds, Gemma gets the spotlight in said trailer, but that was more than enough time for fans to become smitten with her. Within a week,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  was tagged as a dating sim on Steam, as fans took to social media to express their playful affection for Gemma.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some Steam users who aren't aware of how its tag system works are likely to be in for a big surprise after
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  launches in February and is absolutely nothing like a dating sim. Of course, that's probably reaching, as the joke about the game being a dating sim is almost common knowledge at this point. Still, it shows both how humorous the Steam community can be and probably gives a decent indication of how much time some
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  players are going to spend watching Gemma craft their weapons and armor.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  has a large variety of weapons and playstyles to choose from, straight swords continue to be a solid option, though not quite as overpowered as they were back in
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  . Still, the variety in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is excellent and there are many options for varied builds. Some weapons will be increasingly more difficult to obtain than others, while some can be found quite easily.

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  These weapons will work for a variety of builds, and none of them will work as an overall choice for all builds, as each has utility in its own way and there are a ton of different weapon options to find. Players will be able to easily see, however, the value that each of these one-handed swords gives.

    Updated September 14, 2024 by Erik Petrovich
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   : Because you can just about any weapon in one hand, the best one-handed Elden Ring weapons are quite varied. In fact, one of the best one-handed swords Elden Ring players can now collect in the DLC is the Carian Sorcery Sword, which isn't great as a melee weapon, but doubles as a Sorcery Catalyst. This guide to the best one-handed swords in Elden Ring has been updated to include this powerful hybrid weapon that can be found about a third of the way through Shadow of the Erdtree – one that just about every Sorcery caster build will want to go out of the way to get.

  </span>
  is far from the best
  <em>

  </em>
  one-handed sword. Its damage is split between Physical and Magical damage evenly, but it does not have a heavy attack. Because it scales between three stats and doesn't offer much total damage (even when fully upgraded), there are a lot of better Intelligence weapons to use as one-handed weapons.

 <p>
  However, the Carian Sorcery Sword has a secret: instead of a Heavy Attack players can press the Heavy Attack input to cast whichever Sorcery they currently have equipped in the top slot of the quick menu. That's right – the Carian Sorcery Sword is a combination of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  Catalyst and one-handed sword, and is able to cast Sorceries just like a Glintstone staff just as well as it can be swung at melee enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  This weapon saves a good amount of Weight on your character, but it's also one of the best-scaling Intelligence Catalysts in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . The Carian Sorcery Sword outclasses several other Glintstone Staffs when upgraded and with a high enough Intelligence stat when it comes to Sorcery Scaling.

 <h3 id="how-to-get-the-carian-sorcery-sword">
  How To Get The Carian Sorcery Sword
 </h3>
 <p>
  You must have the
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC to get the Carian Sorcery Sword. The sword can be found in Castle Ensis, but you can't get to its location from inside the castle. Instead, head to the Scadu Altus Site of Grace and head north. Look for what looks like an island just north of the western side of Castle Ensis on the world map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Get to this island and jump southeast down to the top of a tower in Castle Ensis. Jump down onto the upper rampart, where you will dismount Torrent. Continue around the ramparts and open a chest to find the Carian Sorcery Sword.

   Star-Lined Sword
  </span>
  is a new one-handed Sword in
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  that essentially performs the same role that Moonveil did in the base game. It's a Katana that deals passive Bleed buildup, and splits its damage evenly between both Physical and Magical damage. It doesn't scale evenly between its three required stats, but like Moonveil, its real draw is its Ash of War.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Onze's Line of Stars weapon skill sees players rapidly extend the reach of their sword and slash several times in quick succession, followed up with a jumping overhead slam. Though Moonveil has the potential for ranged play, Onze's Line of Stars is great for closing the distance without sacrificing damage.

  The Star-Lined Sword is dropped by the world boss Demi-Human Queen Marigga in the Cerulean Coast. From the Cerulean Coast Site of Grace, head north east and look for the Demi-Human Queen from afar. She should be surrounded by an army of Demi-Humans.

   Noble's Slender Sword
  </span>
  is one of the rarest weapons in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , as it can only be found on the loot table of one enemy type and has an extremely low drop rate. Once acquired, though, it's one of the best
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  one-handed weapons throughout the whole game because of its reach.
 </p>
 <p>
  Straight Swords are best when wielded in tandem with one another to access a Power Stance dual-wielding moveset. The Noble's Slender Sword is notably longer than any other Straight Sword in the game, though, and starts with a base C scaling in Dexterity. If you have the patience, and play a DEX or dual-wield build, you can acquire this
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  straight sword very early in the game.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-get-noble-39-s-slender-sword">
  How To Get Noble's Slender Sword
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Noble's Slender Sword only drops from Noble enemies throughout the Lands Between. Though Nobles can be found wandering in almost every area of the game, the best farming location for the Noble's Slender Sword is right at the start. Head across the bridge heading east from the Lake Agheel North Site of Grace, and look for the Caravan being pulled by two Trolls. Kill wandering Nobles in the group that follows the Carriage itself, then reset at the Lake Agheel North Site of Grace. It has a less than 1% chance to drop, so be prepared to farm for a few hours.

   Zweihander
  </span>
  is a weapon that appears several times throughout From Software's catalogue, and it returns once again in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Typically thought of as a two-handed weapon, the Zweihander is perfectly usable as a one-handed weapon if you can meet its stat requirements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you get a handle on its slow animations, the main benefit of the Zweihander over other one-handed weapons
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  players can get becomes clear: its reach is unparalleled. If you Block and initiate a Guard Counter with the Zweihander, too, it deals an immense amount of Poise damage, and will have a better chance to reach opponents who move out of your melee range.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-get-the-zweihander">
  How To Get The Zweihander
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Zweihander can be acquired very early in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  from the Isolated Merchant in the western Weeping Peninsula. Head to the beach in the Weeping Peninsula and look for his shack, then talk to the Merchant to purchase the Zweihander for 3,500 Runes.

   Broadsword
  </span>
  might seem like a run-of-the-mill weapon, but it's secretly one of the most efficient Swords in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . It has excellent Strength scaling when made Heavy via the Ash of War menu, and the default Weapon Skill Square Off is one of the best for the early game.
 </p>
 <p>
  It swings horizontally for many of its attack animations, which makes it just as efficient at taking out groups of enemies as a single opponent. It's a weapon that doesn't require much of its wielder, but the damage output, relatively low weight, animation hitboxes, and ability to be infused and buffed makes it a standout "vanilla" weapon.

  How To Get A Broadsword

 <p>
  The Confessor starting class begins the game with a Broadsword, but one can also be bought from a Nomadic Merchant in Limgrave. He sits under a piece of ruin next to the Coastal Cave, which is just below the First Steps Site of Grace. It costs 1800 Runes, a not-small amount early in the game, but it's well worth the investment.

   Carian Knight's Sword
  </span>
  is a very good weapon choice for players dedicated to Intelligence and Sorceries. It splits its damage type between regular and Magic Damage, which makes enemies take more damage than weapons with only one damage type most of the time (though resistances can make overall damage output lower, a more common factor for Holy weapons).
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ash of War allows players to summon and charge a gigantic Glintstone sword above their head to smash down on their target. It can be charged a few times, and when the player lets go it slams into the ground dealing damage appropriate to how long the Skill was charged for.

  The Carian Knight's Sword, appropriately, is found a short way south of the Carian Manor in western Liurnia of the Lakes. Starting from the Lunar Estate Ruins, head south until you see a Carriage being pulled by two Trolls in the distance.Either attack the Trolls to get them to stop or carefully jump onto the back of the Carriage to find one of the best one handed weapons in

   Godskin Stitcher
  </span>
  is a mighty thrusting sword that shows its value in the hands of an elite PvP enthusiast. Thrusting swords are typically not
  <em>
   great
  </em>
  in FromSoftware games, as they struggle in PvE when groups of enemies are common, and fencing one at a time isn't always an option. But, when facing down an opponent one-on-one, it's hard to go wrong with a weapon that can strike quickly from afar like the Godskin Stitcher.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a weapon with great damage scaling at its higher improvement levels, and the Ash of War Impaling Thrust can take out – or at least stagger – all but the highest-HP foes in one go. It can also be infused with new effects for massive damage gain, like the Flame modifier that adds 242 Fire damage at +25, and can be imbued with new Ashes of War to fit one's build.

  How To Get The Godskin Stitcher in Elden Ring

 <p>
  The Godskin Stitcher is wielded by a number of Godskin enemies throughout the Lands Between, but the only one that players can actually acquire is in the Volcano Manor. About halfway through the Volcano Manor players can lower a bridge shortcut and progress into the Church of Eiglay. Defeat the Godskin Noble found within to get its Godskin Stitcher – and don't forget to get the quest item on the altar, too.

   Rotten Crystal Sword
  </span>
  edges out its very similar Crystal Sword variant due to the scarlet rot passive buildup with each hit, as well as the Spinning Slash weapon skill. Straight swords have always had useful and efficient swing patterns and can deal a hefty amount of physical damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of this, the Rotten Crystal Sword gets additional magic damage making it a solid choice for a variety of builds. Its one downside is how difficult it is to acquire, and how late in the game it can be found – it isn't until players get to the Haligtree that the Rotten Crystal Sword can be found.

 <p>
  This sword can be found in Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree in a chest guarded by three Crystalians. The Crystalians are found just after the Erdtree Avatar that stands next to a group of ballistae, guarding the entrance to the inner wall. Head through this entrance, light the Elphael Inner Wall Site of Grace, and turn left to climb over a large root.
 </p>
 <p>
  he three Crystalians are sitting on the other side of this root, and can be lured one-by-one.

   Sword of St. Trina
  </span>
  is a fantastic choice for PVE though not quite as useful against other players. What makes this sword unique is that it is one of two melee weapons that make use of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's sleep mechanic. The Ashe of War called Mists of Slumber causes a wave of sleep powder to wash over an area in front of the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  This can be especially useful for those duo boss fights such as the Godskin Duo, allowing players to knock out one of the bosses and focus on the other without interruption or having to split aggro. Though its uses are relatively limited, when it puts an enemy to sleep in a boss fight, it makes things much, much more manageable.

  The sword can be found in the Forsaken Ruins, a location in northwest Caelid. Here, at the eastern base of Caelid's western cliffs, there are a few ruins that dot the surroundings. The Forsaken Ruins are the northernmost, and the Sword of St Trina can be accessed by opening a sealed door with a Stonesword key.

   Antspur Rapier
  </span>
  is its scarlet rot buildup. As a passive perk, it can be massively helpful in both PVP and PVE.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pairing this with a great shield such as the Fingerprint shield can make many bosses easy work, as Thrusting Swords can be used from behind Shields in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It is limited in its ability to take on groups, but it's hard to beat in a one-on-one fight. Scarlet Rot is an incredibly deadly status effect, and its Impaling Thrust Ash of War deals insane damage alongside this status effect buildup if its relatively long animation hits.

  This Legendary weapon will be familiar to most players at this point, as it has been showcased as one of the
  <strong>
  </strong>
  best straight sword
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has to offer due to its dual weapon arts and varied damage. The first weapon art is a scaled-down version of the Comet Azur sorcery, albeit for a significantly cheaper FP cost, and the second is a sweeping flame arc in front of the caster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each is triggered either by using the Light or Heavy attack button when using the Night And Flame Stance skill. The

   Sword of Night and Flame
  </span>
  does require the Tarnished's Intelligence and Faith stats to be at a 24 minimum, which makes this weapon more suited for Spellcaster than others. There is something to be said for giving other players access to these spells, though.

 <p>
  The Sword of Night and Flame is found in the Carian Manor in northwest Liurnia. To find it, start at the Manor Lower Level Site of Lost Grace and navigate across the Ramparts, taking the left-most path, and look for a series of cascading rooftops to drop down to on the left. Jump down here, avoiding the spirits that periodically get summoned, and drop down into a room containing the Sword of Night and Flame.

   Rivers of Blood
  </span>
  was a decent weapon but nothing special mainly due to the fact that it scaled with Arcane and unfortunately, that scaling was bugged and did not work properly. Post-patch, however, it became a force to be reckoned with. Then with the 1.06 update, with specific updates for PvP play, it went back to being just "ok."
 </p>
 <p>
  In the end, Arcane scaling was fixed, and the bleed scaling makes it a force to be reckoned with, despite the nerfs. Rivers of Blood has a 66 passive bleed buildup with a weapon art, Corpse Piler, that stacks even more on top and gives a slight extra attack range to the weapons swing set.

  To obtain the Rivers of Blood katana players must defeat Bloody Finger Okina at the Church of Repose in the Mountaintops of the Giants region. This must be done before the Fire Giant boss is killed however as the invader will not invade after the Giant is defeated.

   Hand of Malenia
  </span>
  (47 to be exact), it will be worth it for most players. Alongside being the second biggest katana in the game after the Nagakiba, it has a passive 50 bleed buildup and is easily the best bleed weapon art in

  .

 <p>
  The skill titled Waterfowl Dance is incredibly aggressive and impossible to interrupt after the initial wind-up. It allows the player to unleash a flurry of slashes in a three-tiered combo that absolutely melts most health bars in PVP and PVE. Its range also makes it great for dual wielding if you obtain a second.

  The Moonveil Katana is found at the end of the Gael Tunnel after beating the Magma Wyrm boss. The Gael Tunnel can be accessed from Limgrave, but to get to the boss you must take the Caelid entrance. From any Site of Grace in northwest Caelid head to the base of the cliffs and look for an entrance to a cave. On the map, the Gael Tunnel is on the border of Caelid and Limgrave, but the entrances on both sides don't quite line up. Be sure to ride Torrent through the Scarlet Rot pools while looking for the entrance to avoid damage.

      <title>Every Returning Wonder From Civ 6 in Civilization 7 So Far</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sid Meier's Civilization 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  is right around the corner, and fans of the franchise have good cause to get excited. Though there's been some trepidation about how much this new entry appears to be changing from
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  , there's just as much excitement about such deviations. After all, there was once a time when
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  was heavily criticized for not adhering to established tropes and series trends, so this sort of experimentation may just be par for the course when it comes to the
  <em>
   Civ
  </em>
  franchise.

 <p>
  But for all the ambitious changes to things like leaders and Ages,
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  is still looking like a
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  game, through and through. That is to say, it will be built around many of the same fundamentals as its predecessors, including
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  . There will be several parallels when it comes to things like resource management and warfare, and the Wonders system also appears to be the same as in
  <em>
   Civ 6
  </em>
  , at least on a fundamental level. This is true in more ways than one; even without knowing
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  's full list of wonders, it's clear that it will have considerable overlap with its predecessor in this area.

 <p>
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  will retain a number of
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  's iconic man-made wonders, which should come as good news for those who love the frantic race toward constructing these useful tools. In
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  , these structures are placed on tiles, sometimes removing any improvements built beforehand, and provide valuable benefits to a given civilization. For instance, the Hanging Gardens will increase population growth in all cities, while increasing Housing in the city in which it is built. It's not clear whether these Wonders will function in the same way when they appear in
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  , but it will nevertheless be interesting to see them crop up in this new, visually enhanced title.

     <em>

     will reverse these changes or come up with something new entirely.

  When it comes to confirmed, pre-launch information, the overlap between Natural Wonders in
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  is much smaller. Natural Wonders are much like their man-made counterparts, in the sense that they provide powerful bonuses to civilizations that acquire them, but they are found by exploring the map rather than building. For instance, if a player expands their city's boundaries to the point where they now encompass Mount Kilimanjaro, they will gain ownership of it and receive its associated bonuses. They are as strategically valuable as regular Wonders, but serve as rewards for players looking to expand rather than densely build within individual cities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Again, it's not completely clear if, and to what extent, Natural Wonders will be changed from
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  , but it's nice to know that there will be at least some similarity here. It's also worth noting that the aforementioned wonders are, for one thing, only the ones confirmed
  <em>
  </em>
  to be reappearing in
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  , and second of all, that there are many new Wonders being added to this game. New Wonders, like Pyramid of the Sun and Redwood Forest, are sure to deepen
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's city-building and exploration in exciting ways.

  Before the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series made a huge splash in the West, Square was brainstorming the best way they could market this series to international audiences. This culminated in a weird attempt to make a
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game that lacked a lot of the complexities that made the series so much fun to play in the first place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest
  </em>
  is as generic as they come, reducing the number of playable party members to two and letting players enjoy a by-the-numbers story that doesn't bring anything new to the table. The very idea that this is a part of the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series is weird to fathom for many players.

  After the hit success of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  , Square decided to experiment quite a bit for its sequel. This led to one of the weirdest and most maligned progression systems in the series that is needlessly complicated and rewards puzzling behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since stats leveled up based on a party member's actions and performance in battle, it was possible to game the system and hit friendly players to increase their HP. This was just one of the many weird ways to exploit this leveling system, turning
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 2
  </em>
  into the black sheep of the series that hasn't been able to shake off this reputation ever since.

  Most people wondered how
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  would stretch out a ten-hour introduction into a fully-fledged video game. This was achieved with a massive helping of sidequests coupled with the game's tendency to lean towards the weird side of things more often than not.
 </p>
 <p>
  Somehow, acquiring a dress for Cloud becomes more bizarre than ever before, with the game featuring its fair share of oddities that will leave many people puzzled. However, this is all just a part of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  's charm, making it clear why fans were happy with the direction the
  <em>
   Remake

  took despite featuring way too much filler for their liking.

  There's a reason why the Squall is Dead fan theory has gained so much steam. After his fight against Edea in Deling City, Squall is impaled by an ice spike that looks fatal, only for the character to be alive in a prison not long after.

  After this point, the story is so over-the-top that it feels like a dream at times.

  It's hard not to look at the structure of

  is a magical adventure full of moments that hammer in the sadness of Spira's world. However, Tidus and Yuna combine their efforts and take the help of their friends to reject the destiny imposed on them and take out Sin once and for all.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast,

  From the very moment Jack revealed his obsession of Chaos in the preview trailer, players knew they were in for a weird time if they gave
  <em>
   Stranger of Paradise
  </em>
  a shot. For what it's worth, the game is more serious than it's made out to be and features a fun combat loop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, it's hard to take things seriously when the main cast is dressed like they're heading out for a night on the town instead of trying to contain a great evil. This clash of ideals makes
  <em>
   Stranger of Paradise
  </em>
  one of the weirdest
  <em>

  games ever made, even if the gameplay is solid enough to keep fans entertained despite the bizarre nature of its story.

      Melee builds in Path of Exile's 3.25 update are getting major changes with the removal of Melee Totem Skill Gems.
     </li>
     <li>
      GGG aims for melee damage to be player-driven, reducing reliance on unique items and set-and-forget skills like totems.
     </li>
     <li>
      The changes in patch 3.25 encourage players to focus on build variety, while also reducing reliance on guides and wikis.

  Although the highlight of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Path of Exile
   </em>
  </strong>
  's upcoming Settlers of Kalguur expansion is almost certainly its city management league mechanic, patch 3.25 is also introducing some substantial changes to melee builds, removing an entire mechanic in line with GGG's new philosophy toward melee combat.

 <p>
  Ahead of
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  's Settlers of Kalguur announcement, Game Rant asked game directors Mark Roberts and Jonathan Rogers about their approach to the sweeping changes in this update. They weighed in on why they felt that melee builds needed an overhaul, and they also spoke about how GGG hopes that players won't have to rely so much on guides and wikis to create strong builds in
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  One huge change that
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  is making in the 3.25 update is the complete removal of Melee Totem Skill Gems. Moving forward, Roberts told us that GGG's philosophy toward melee builds in
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  is for damage to be dealt specifically by player actions rather than set-and-forget totems like Ancestral Protector or Ancestral Warchief. It's not a complete loss, as this change does come with some massive buffs to melee skills, in some cases more than doubling their damage. It's probably safe to say that melee builds in
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  will similarly adhere to this philosophy.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There's a lot to figure out since balance can be a pretty touchy subject when it comes to these things, but honestly, the amount of awesome stuff that we've done goes a long way toward making it feel like rare items matter and that a lot of the mechanics behind what makes melee great isn't just hidden behind some niche combination of unique items. It's all in your face and quite understandable, and I think that is very, very huge because you certainly see a lot of the "meta builds" so to speak that people play are very much gated behind mechanic A or mechanic B and we're getting away from that.

 <p>
  It's certainly a tough call to make, as such mechanics are a valid playstyle. Some players may thoroughly enjoy plopping down a damaging totem and luring enemies into it, and an increase in melee damage might not be enough to make up for having one less avenue for build crafting.
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  's developers have their work cut out for them as they continue to work on the game's balance, and more changes will surely follow once player feedback comes along.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  is lauded for having unparalleled build variety, the dizzying number of choices at players' disposal also mean it's a bit of a "wiki game." Part of this comes from the fact that the things that make a player's build function aren't necessarily right in front of them, and build-defining effects might come from unique items that players don't even know exist. Roberts says that patch 3.25's changes to melee place more emphasis on the passive tree, where players can formulate a more complete build on the spot without needing to consult a guide.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We're trying to make it so that you can be melee, you can take a pretty regular passive tree, invest in a number of things that are your choice, use rare items, and you'll have a great time as opposed to "I need to follow this exact build guide." So hopefully melee and more of the game moves towards less build guide-driven gameplay in order to really succeed, and you can get there with just playing and not really having to go to the wiki so often, which is kind of where Path of Exile has ended up especially if you want to play at the high end. Obviously, it's not necessary, but that is kind of how it ends up being.

 <p>
  Guides and wikis will always have their place in a game as complex as
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  , but they should be reserved for more high-end decision-making. After all, making one's way through the game's legendarily labyrinthine skill tree is part of the fun. Hopefully, with these changes, inexperienced
  <em>
   Path of Exile
  </em>
  players will be able to come up with a build that suits their playstyle in a less roundabout fashion.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead by Daylight
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the top dogs of asymmetrical horror, and that's largely due to the game's great crossovers with major horror franchises. Whether it's Ghostface from
  <em>
   Scream
  </em>
  or the Demogorgon from
  <em>
   Stranger Things
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is filled with some of the biggest names in the genre.

 <p>
  As the game continues to evolve,
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's crossovers bring fresh content to the game. Although there is a solid blend of both classic horror and modern franchises showcased in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  , one recent trilogy to enter the genre has gained a cult following that makes it perfect for the game's next collaboration.
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pearl
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   MaXXXine
  </em>
  form the trilogy of camp horror films brought to life by director Ti West and actress Mia Goth, and these movies would feel right at home in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  .

  The Perfect Source For New Survivors and Killers
 </h3>
 <p>
  When it comes to Ti West's
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  trilogy, all three movies feature characters who would be perfect in the roles of Survivors or Killers.
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  could, of course, feature Maxine as a Survivor, but there are various side characters that would be fun additions. Kid Cudi's performance in
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  as male porn star Jackson Hole would be a fun option, while Halsey's character Tabby Martin from
  <em>
   MaXXXine
  </em>
  would be fantastic as well. The entire cast of victims from
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  in general would be perfect as Survivors, but the strongest characters would play the role of Killer.

 <p>
  Pearl plays a massive part in both her standalone prequel and
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  as a violent and unpredictable woman. The backstory given to the titular character in
  <em>
   Pearl
  </em>
  showcases where her tendency for violence started, and
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  demonstrates how the same character still craves fame and youth as an old woman.
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  introducing Pearl as both an old woman and her younger counterpart would be incredibly fun. One of the most gruesome scenes from
  <em>
   Pearl
  </em>
  involves her goring a man with a pitchfork, which would be a perfect weapon to feature in the game.

 <h3 id="x-and-pearl-39-s-classic-farm-setting">
  X and Pearl's Classic Farm Setting
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   MaXXXine
  </em>
  takes place in 1980s Los Angeles, but
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pearl
  </em>
  both take place on a remote Texas farm. The stereotypical setting is a fun callback to 70s horror, specifically
  <em>
   The T
  </em>
  <em>
   exas Chainsaw Massacre
  </em>
  , and it's an ideal addition to
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's maps. Coldwind Farm is a farm-based realm in the game that could easily add some
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  trilogy-inspired Easter eggs during a crossover event. One of the scariest moments in
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  is when Brittany Snow's character, Bobby Lynne, is eaten by an alligator, so a gator-infested swamp on Coldwind Farm could be a fun nod to the films.

  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is no stranger to featuring modern horror properties.
  <em>
   Stranger Things
  </em>
  is one of the most popular crossovers to be featured in the co-op title, but Ti West's
  <em>
   X
  </em>
  trilogy is now front and center in pop culture. Now that the trilogy has come to an end with
  <em>
   MaXXXine
  </em>
  , it's the perfect moment for developer Behaviour Interactive to jump on the bandwagon. If
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  waits too long, the publicity surrounding the trilogy will likely die down, and it would be disappointing to see such a perfect crossover go to waste.

  Although it's unknown whether
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight

  will feature the

   X
  </em>
  trilogy is at the top of the list.

   Blasphemous Blade

  , created as a birthday gift for their boyfriend.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has plenty of weapons for players to collect over the course of the game, but the Blasphemous Blade is one of the most visually interesting to use, and it looks awesome in this recreation.

   Remembrance of the Blasphemous

  with Finger Reader Enia at Roundtable Hold. To get this, players must first defeat Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. While it's a tough fight, the reward is well worth the effort, with the Blasphemous Blade proving to be an incredibly powerful Greatsword that players can create a strong build around. It even deals additional fire damage, for those wanting to heat things up a little.

  In a series of TikToks from user kaypeon, the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  fan showed off their process for recreating the Blasphemous Blade as it appears in-game. According to the user, they're creating it as a birthday gift for their boyfriend, which is really sweet, especially if he's a huge fan of the game. It starts off with a cardboard base, which was layered with putty before being spray-painted multiple times. The bloody veins on the sword were created using plastic tubes which were spray-painted and glued to the main sword in a careful fashion. The end result is an extremely impressive recreation of one of the best Greatswords in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  .

  Since its release in 2022,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has amassed a massive fan base. This has only grown bigger due to the recent launch of the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC. As a result, the game is often the subject of amazing fan creations like this, showcasing how creative the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  community is. There was even one
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  fan who spent 70 hours creating a Malenia miniature, and there will no doubt be many more fan creations based on the game for a very long time yet.

  FromSoftware is yet to talk about its next project post-
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . Most assume that the expansion will prove to be the only DLC pack for
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , with a fully-fledged sequel feeling more likely at this point. While it's quiet on the game side of things, George R.R. Martin recently hinted at an
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  movie or TV adaptation, which would be an interesting place to take the franchise. Hopefully, the studio will be able to talk about its upcoming projects more openly soon enough.

  To begin with, it is necessary to understand that players who want to achieve success must complete many quests. Players can find them in the city. A very important aspect of the game is the selection of enemies by level. Initially, it will be difficult for players to deal with enemies of a higher level, so choose carefully. Using additional skills such as Smash is also very important for victory.

  About the King Legacy Developers
 </h2>
 <p>
  King Legacy was created by a group of developers called Venture Lagoons. They are pretty popular, and their group on the
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  website currently has 621K members. Unfortunately, King Legacy is the only game from these developers that is so popular.

      Leaker suggests the Halo: Combat Evolved remake is in full production, with hiring waves.

 <p>
  A prominent leaker has given a massive update on the rumored
  <em>
   <strong>
    Halo: Combat Evolved
   </strong>
  </em>
  remake, which is sure to be great news for fans of the franchise. Rumors of a
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved
  </em>
  remake have been flying around for a while now, but Halo Studios has never confirmed either way whether they're true or not.
 </p>
 <p>
  If true, releasing a
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved
  </em>
  remake would be an interesting first project for Halo Studios. When 343 Industries confirmed it was rebranding to Halo Studios, it also stated that it was moving to Unreal Engine 5, sharing several renders that featured key
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved
  </em>
  iconography. It didn't confirm any remake rumors, of course, but it did lend some credence to the possibility of them being true.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to prominent leaker Rebs Gaming, the rumored
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved
  </em>
  remake began pre-production in January 2024, offering a glimpse into the development cycle for the game. He also claims that the remake is now in full production, with the proof being that the studio claimed it would ramp up its hiring processes as its projects move further into the development cycle. In the time since making this statement, Halo Studios has since publicly made several hiring waves, with Rebs Gaming pointing this out.

  Halo: Combat Evolved Remake Now in Full Production According to Leaker
 </h2>
 <p>
  On top of the
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved
  </em>
  remake details, Rebs Gaming also shared a few details about a project rumored to be in development at Certain Affinity, codenamed
  <em>
   Ekur
  </em>
  . He believes that
  <em>
   Ekur
  </em>
  has been in development since 2022, and that there are dedicated testing servers for the project that were created back in June 2024. Because of how these dates line up, Rebs Gaming believes that
  <em>
   Ekur
  </em>
  will be the next released
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  game, as opposed to the
  <em>
   Combat Evolved
  </em>
  remake. It should be stated again that right now, this is all just a rumor, so it should be taken with a pinch of salt.

 <p>
  When looking at what to expect from the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise in 2025, it would certainly be a surprise if a new game in the series were to be released. However, as work continues on projects, an announcement certainly isn't out of the question. Gamers will just have to be patient to see what Halo Studios is working on in relative silence at the moment.

  A new report from an industry insider suggests playtests for the next
  <strong>
   <em>
    Battlefield
   </em>
  </strong>
  game are "ramping up" with some big announcements expected from EA in the coming months. The next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game, which is currently being referred to as
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  by most fans, was announced by EA back in September 2023, with the studio reportedly holding massive playtests for the upcoming shooter to ensure it does not meet the same fate as recent entries in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to first-person shooters, it doesn't get much bigger than
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Call of Duty.
  </em>
  While both titles have had their ups and downs over the years, EA took a huge hit in 2021 when
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  was
  <em>
  </em>
  released to massively negative reviews. Fans blasted the series' latest entry as a step back for the franchise, with missing core features from previous games, poor optimization, bugs, and more. While EA remained committed to the title and has managed to claw its way to a "mixed" review rating on Steam thanks to numerous updates, the studio is apparently taking the relevant steps with its next title to ensure a similar incident doesn't occur.

 <p>
  With development on the title ramping up, 2025 is shaping up to be a big year for
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  fans. According to an updated report from Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, EA is once again ramping up playtests for the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game as the studio is reportedly preparing to make some "big announcements" in the coming months. There was no word from Henderson on what these announcements could be, but with official concept art already being revealed last year, there's hope that the community could receive some screenshots or possibly even a first trailer. For now, however, that remains simply speculation.

  Back in November 2024, Insider Gaming reported that playtests for the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  were underway. While Henderson has since updated the report on January 24 to state that even more playtests were underway, it was claimed that playtests with external players are "happening much more frequently" than past installments, with the amount of data and feedback collected being the most in franchise's history. Although the
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  series is often considered to be one of the best franchises in the first-person shooter genre, with titles such as
  <em>
   Battlefield: Bad Company 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Battlefield 3
  </em>
  being critically acclaimed, recent entries have been a huge miss, which is likely why EA is heavily committed to fan feedback and playtests.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's hope among the community that the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game will be a return to form, and while that will be decided by fans when the game launches, EA has already attempted to hype fans up for the title in the past. Back in August 2024, EA CEO Andrew Wilson briefly touched on the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  game and said it was one of the studio's top priorities and is also "one of the most ambitious projects in [EA's] history." Unfortunately, there's no official word on when fans will get their first glimpse at the shooter, but with "big announcements" rumored for the coming months, fans might not have to wait long.

      <title>FromSoftware Soulslikes May Want to Keep an Eye on One Doom: The Dark Ages Feature</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/doom-the-dark-ages-fromsoftware-soulslikes-difficulty-accessibility/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  FromSoftware games are infamously challenging. In a FromSoft action-RPG, it's not just bosses that will one-shot players, it's regular enemies too, and that high level of challenge has caused a bit of a stir in recent years. But
  <em>
   <strong>
    Doom: The Dark Ages
   </strong>
  </em>
  , surprisingly, might have the key to solving this ongoing FromSoftware difficulty debate.

 <p>
  First announced back at Xbox's June 2024 Showcase,
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  is the next mainline entry in the long-running Sci-Fi shooter franchise, and this time, things are getting a little more fantastical. During the recent Xbox Developer Direct, id Software shed some more light on
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  ' combat, story, and exploration, providing plenty of gameplay footage for each aspect. id Software also showcased a new custom difficulty setting for
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  , which could be something for FromSoftware to consider in the future.

  FromSoftware Games Need to Strike an Impossible Balance
 </h3>
 <p>
  While FromSoftware games have been challenging since the studio's debut (1994's
  <em>
   King's Field
  </em>
  ), a discussion surrounding that high level of challenge has continued to grow louder over the last decade, usually resurfacing with the launch of a new FromSoftware action-RPG. On one side of the fence, some FromSoft fans believe that the high level of challenge is an inherent part of the experience, and that removing it would remove a core part of the developer's unique identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  While that might be true, it's undeniable that FromSoftware's higher level of difficulty can often be a major barrier to entry for newcomers. Contrary to some fans' beliefs, this isn't always a "skill issue." There are many gamers out there who experience physical disabilities that affect their reaction timing or ability to perceive minute changes in enemy attack patterns. These gamers have frequently discussed how FromSoftware's games are simply inaccessible to them due to the lack of any difficulty options. This is where
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  ' difficulty customization could offer a solution.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-doom-the-dark-ages-39-difficulty-system-could-work-in-a-fromsoftware-game">
  How Doom: The Dark Ages' Difficulty System Could Work in a FromSoftware Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  Though it's certainly not the first AAA game to offer custom difficulty options,
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  ' mechanics do share some clear similarities with FromSoftware's action-RPGs, making a direct comparison between them appropriate.
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  ' custom difficulty settings will allow the player to manually adjust individual components of the game, such as enemy aggression, projectile speed, parry windows, damage to the player, and general game speed. Those who don't want to adjust any of these values can simply choose one of
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  ' preset difficulty options, just as they would in any previous entry in the franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  This might be a good way for future FromSoftware games to strike a balance between the two aforementioned schools of thought. The players who want to experience FromSoftware's intended experience could simply play the game like normal, while those who want to adapt the difficulty to best suit their needs or desires could. The introduction of accessibility options doesn't mean it would inherently detract from the experience for some fans, or even affect their experience at all.

  Another way to rack up EXP is by hopping into Missions. These tasks pop up at the Missions station in Zen Forest. You’ll get to choose from three missions displayed on the board. Once you’ve completed them, you can reroll for new options. As you progress, you’ll also unlock access to four new towns in the Missions station. For an easy boost, Capture A Point is the best mission to tackle since it’s the simplest one to complete.

  Investigations allow you to clear out curses from an upside-down world in return for lucrative rewards, including tons of EXP. Each investigation comes with easy to hard difficulty levels, and picking the hardest one gives the most experience points. You can also level up by entering rifts, which spawn in Zen Forest and towns—but you’ll need a Dimensional Finger to enter.

  Players can also level up quickly by taking on bosses in Boss Mode. The game has six bosses that become available as you reach the required levels, including Finger Bearer, Ocean Curse, Soul Curse, Volcano Curse, Sorcerer Killer, and Heian Imaginary Demon. Choosing hard difficulty and higher-level bosses will earn you much more EXP.

  Last but not least, you can upscale your rank fast by using limited-time EXP boosters in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  . Since they only last for a short time, you can jump straight into combat and earn double EXP from taking down curses, mobs, and bosses. Here are all the available options:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Daily Login
  </li>
  <li>
   Consumables
  </li>
  <li>
   EXP Boosters
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The game has a reward system where players get prizes for logging in daily. One of these rewards includes 2X EXP for some time, which you can claim from the main screen. For consumables, you can try the Doroyaki, which gives you 25% EXP for 10 minutes and can be crafted at the crafting station. You can also buy EXP Boosters from the game shop.

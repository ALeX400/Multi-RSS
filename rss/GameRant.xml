  developer Mojang Studios is potentially teasing a new feature for the smash hit sandbox game, sending fans into a rabbit hole of speculation and theories after posting a picture of a Lodestone on the game's official Twitter account. While Lodestone is already an obtainable block inside
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
   , some fans believe the studio is hinting at a major new content update to
  </span>
  provide more uses for the block.
 </p>
 <p>
  Towards the end of 2024, Mojang announced some major changes to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's development schedule. After 15 years of improvements and new content updates, the studio confirmed it would be ditching the usual release schedule of one major update in the summer in favor of regular smaller updates throughout the year. Mojang noted that the size of the updates would vary, but would bring players more features to explore more frequently, as opposed to leaving the community waiting an entire year for a major update.

  Mojang Seemingly Teases New Minecraft Feature
 </h2>
 <p>
  With fans loving
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's smaller and more regular updates, Mojang now appears to be teasing another major feature for the game's next patch. Over on Twitter, the official
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  account surprised and confused fans by posting a picture of a Lodestone with two rocks and two side-eye emojis as the caption. Although the image could be any old rock to most people, the alt text on the post confirms that this is, in fact, a Lodestone. But what the studio could be teasing in regard to the Lodestone remains up for debate.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the time of writing, Lodestone blocks in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  serve one purpose: they allow the user to alter the direction of a compass to always point toward it. The lodestone block can be used in all three dimensions and can be obtained via chest loot or crafted by the player using Chiseled Stone Bricks and a Netherite Ingot. The block was included in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's 1.16 patch, also known as The Nether Update, and hasn't been touched since. But it looks like that could be about to change.

 <p>
  Speculation on what Mojang could be teasing varies, but many believe the studio is teasing the addition of Megnetite, which is the mineral that Lodestone comes from. If so, that could mean the recipe to craft a Lodestone block could be adjusted to include Magnetite ore instead of the current Netherite ore. The last major
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  update came at the start of December 2024, adding a new eerie biome filled with new blocks, flowers, and a creepy hostile mob known as The Creaking. There's no word on when the next update will arrive, but with Mojang already teasing new additions, an announcement could be coming soon.

      <title>Palworld's Bounty System Should Just Be the Tip of the Iceberg</title>

  The islands of

   <strong>
    Palworld

  </em>
  have seen some interesting new additions lately, making Pocketpair's creation more engaging. The game got the major Feybreak update in December 2024, putting in new things like a much bigger island, more Pals, new dungeons, and more. While all of these are great, one of the more noteworthy implementations would be the bounty system, allowing players to take on jobs that involve eliminating high-value targets for rewards. The new experience is fun and challenging, but it has the potential to be more.

  The introduction of the bounty system through
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  's Feybreak update has changed the game in a way that benefits both its world and players. For instance, there is now another incentive for encountering Alpha Pals aside from making them potential partners, as the bounty tokens they drop can grant access to new dungeons. Feybreak also features new human targets that are incredibly tough if not prepared for, making the islands feel more dangerous but also more exciting to explore. The bounty system has indeed changed
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  for the better, but Pocketpair could give it an update that will allow it to do more than requiring players to take on specific individual targets.

  Taking down
  <em>
   Palworld'
  </em>
  s extremely tough Alpha Pals or the new human overworld enemies can make for exciting times, but even that can tend to grow stale if those are the only targets of the bounty system. A good way to improve it is by having more options for the bounties, and there are a few things Pocketpair should consider adding if it were to make the update:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Having players capture a certain number of specific Pals
  </li>
  <li>
   Requiring players to capture human bosses instead of eliminating them
  </li>
  <li>
   Putting a timer on targets that must be captured or defeated before they disappear
  </li>
  <li>
   Making players take on any of the grunts or bosses of the factions of
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
   in specific ways, such as with a certain Pal or weapon
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As it stands, the bounty system is a fun new way of giving life to the islands of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  , but the changes mentioned could help make it into something that players will keep wanting to use. Hopefully, Pocketpair will consider updating with a future patch, as it could become one of the game's biggest features that can attract even more people into playing.
 </p>
 <h3 id="why-pocketpair-should-focus-on-improving-the-bounty-system">
  Why Pocketpair Should Focus On Improving the Bounty System
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  's Feybreak update is a big success in part because it gives players more to do and look forward to through features like the bounty system. If it's only going to be limited to taking down strong individual targets for limited reward choices, however, then players might lose interest in it as it gets repetitive. Pocketpair has to ensure that doesn't happen, and one of the ways to do that is by giving the system proper updates. Aside from having more types of bounties, another good way of improving it is by expanding its reward options. If bounties offer things like exclusive armor and weapons rather than just resources that can be obtained through regular play, then players are better incentivized to utilize the bounty feature even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there's already a lot of variables in terms of what to expect from
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  in 2025, the improvement of the bounty system is hopefully among them. It has the potential to be much more than it already is and if Pocketpair provides it with certain changes, it could become a feature that every person enjoying the game will want to utilize constantly.

  A nice and easy start to the challenge, blind moles running around in Precursor Basin's first section who need help getting back to their holes. Naturally, the best way to do this is by driving at them with the Zoomer to spook them into running. Chase them around and take advantage of the hop to turn sharply and stay on their tails, driving them back to their holes. Once you've herded four of them back into their holes, you can head back to the Geologist in Rock Village to get a Power Cell. Might as well finish up everything else in this area before we leave though, eh?

 <p>
  Hanging around in the same area as the moles, you'll find Flying Lurkers that flee as the Zoomer approaches. You'll need to chase them down and ram into them to complete this objective, and they take some pretty tricky routes around the Precursor Basin. Your best bet with these guys is to cut them off when they make turns, such as at the locations shown in the images above, so you can take them out. The last one will drop a Power Cell.

  The Gambler in the Village is hoping to recoup his losses, so he needs us to beat the record time for the Gorge. This short but tricky racecourse can be found near the entrance to Precursor Basin, by hugging the right wall of the area until you find the turning.

  The time we need to beat is 45 seconds, which is tight but entirely doable once you've got the hang of the Zoomer. Starting the course you'll likely immediately hit a Lurker, teaching you that Lurkers can be used to launch the Zoomer into the air for a higher jump. More importantly, for the moment, you'll then need to drive past two pillars with some Blue Eco between them. If you can thread between the pillars and grab the Blue Eco it will give the Zoomer a speed boost for a short time, though you should be careful as there's a sharp turn coming up. Keep left and use a hop-turn to the right to quickly get onto the slope past the pillars and drive up.

  Ride up and around the slope to get to the upper section of the course, where you'll need to thread between moving Pistons, with Blue Eco available halfway through a tunnel and also just past the end of the tunnel, to the left. You'll also encounter several Dark Eco Crate obstacles, which will damage you and slow you down if you drive through them, though they're usually on the left and right sides of the course and can be avoided by sticking to the middle.

  You'll drive right into a pit past the last pair of Dark Eco Crates. To make this turn effectively, you'll want to hop just as you reach the edge of the pit and make a 180 turn, so you land facing the next stretch of the course. There's also Blue Eco available at the bottom if you hang to the left of the pit (So it'll be on your right after the 180.) Weave between the pistons past the pit, and then you have a choice. If you're feeling confident, you can use the Lurker here to hop onto the raised area and grab some more Blue Eco for a speed boost, though this can easily backfire and ruin a good run if your aim is off. Alternatively, take the safer and lower, but slightly slower, path to the right. Either way, you'll want to stay as far to the left as possible so you don't have to deal with the Dark Eco boxes further down the course, then thread between two more sets of pistons to cross the finish line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you head back to Rock Village after beating the time, you can talk to the Gambler to get a Power Cell. Once again, I suggest clearing out the rest of Precursor Basin first. If you can beat 40 seconds on the course then you'll get a trophy too, so it's worth doing some extra laps if you're close.

  The Power Cell floating over the lake is easy enough to spot, but reaching it requires careful driving and good timing. Beginning from the slope shown in image 1 (Which you may recognize from chasing the Lurkers earlier), you'll need to head up and around the hole. Drive over the narrow bridge and use the hop to get over the gap between the two islands (Image 2 &amp; Image 3), then hop using the ramp on the second island to get over to the spot shown in image 4. From here, head up the slope, making the 180 halfway up, and then hop from the top across the three islands shown in image 5. This will get you to one final pair of islands connected by another narrow bridge. Drive at top speed and jump from the second island towards the Precursor Orb to grab it.

  This one's a nice and easy one, perfect for a breather after some vehicular platforming. You'll need to charge up with Green Eco and then drive through the purple plants to cure them. If you take too long, they'll start growing back, but as long as you drive quickly, and carefully, you should be able to diminish them until they're all gone at a steady pace. Remember to use the hop to make sharper turns, and use the Green Eco Vent to top up if you start running low. It often takes a few runs to cure the whole lot, but you'll get a Power Cell for your trouble.

  Next on the list is the Purple Precursor Ring challenge. When you fly through the first ring, it will cause a new one to appear, and you'll have to race to pass through every ring before time runs out. The Purple Ring challenge is the easier of the two ring challenges here, so I'll just cover the trickier spots on the course.

  The first slightly scary moment is when a ring appears in the air off the side of a natural bridge, as shown above. Take the plunge and hop right off the bridge and through the ring, since the next ring will be at ground level. You'll have to do the same a little later after avoiding a hole in the middle of the raised track, but hitting this one ends the course and gets you the Power Cell.

  The second set of Precursor Rings, the blue ones, are much more difficult to deal with. This course begins near the slope you have to go up to get the Power Cell over the Lake, but instead of going up the slope and hopping across three islands you instead need to head to the left and slightly down to find the first ring.

  The first place where things get tricky on the route is when you reach the pillar shown above. You'll be driving right around it and then back towards the lake, hitting three rings along the way. The ring over the lake is high in the air, so you want to hit the rocks and hop as you hit them to bounce the Zoomer into the air and through the ring.

  After looping around the Zoomer Trans-pad (make sure not to accidentally drive into it and get off, since that can ruin your attempt), and heading back through the Precursor archway, you'll be near the Dark Eco Infected Plants (or the flower that replaced them if you've already healed them) and need to make a tricky hop off a hill to hit a ring in the air.

  The next place you're likely to slip up is after zipping across the lake to pass through another ring, since there's a crossroads here and the next ring only spawns once you've passed through the last. You need to turn right to swing around the pillar on the right to hit the next ring, then keep turning right to head back past the pillar and turn left to hit another ring. After passing over a hill and through another ring, make a sharp right and then turn left after a moment to pass through another ring.

  The ring after that is on the edge of the lake, and once driving through it, you'll want to head up the slope to hit another ring as you move onto higher ground. You'll have to move around the left of the hole, driving carefully on these narrow paths, to get the next ring after that.

  From here, it's a winding but easy path to the finish, with the last ring hanging over the edge at the top of a slope. Ride through it to get a Power Cell.

      <title>Freedom Wars Remastered Review</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/freedom-wars-remastered-review/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The unique gameplay loop popularized by Capcom's
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise has inspired many other games to varying degrees of success. 2014 PlayStation Vita game
  <em>
   Freedom Wars
  </em>
  is one such game, with the original release earning mixed reviews from critics, yet standing out as one of the more notable titles ever released for PlayStation's ill-fated handheld.
  <em>
   Freedom Wars
  </em>
  being a PlayStation Vita exclusive limited its audience, and that, combined with the fact that the servers for the original game were shut down years ago, has always made it ripe for a port or remaster.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Freedom Wars Remastered
   </em>
  </strong>
  makes the game available to a much wider audience, and it does so without forsaking what made the original popular to begin with. However, some may come away feeling as though
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  doesn't do enough to bring the 2014 Vita game to modern home console standards.
 </p>

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  is almost identical to the original game, but with improved textures, new difficulty settings, and a refreshed crafting system. Still, the game looks dated. While
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  supports 4K resolution, the character models and mission stages are bland and lack details. And despite the upgraded textures, there are many instances where the game looks flat-out ugly.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a little disappointing that
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  didn't do more to take better advantage of the newer hardware it's releasing on, but while it's very unimpressive graphically, it at least delivers solid performance and the actual gameplay is mostly quite fun. For those unfamiliar with the genre,
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  's gameplay loop revolves around completing missions to earn materials and weapons that can then be used to tackle more challenging missions. Oftentimes, this means taking on a large boss enemy, with players able to target specific body parts to get specific crafting materials. These battles are long and can be stressful at times, but there's something undeniably addictive about these kinds of games, and the same holds true for
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  .

  <em>

  </em>
  can be hard to put down. The mission environments are repetitive, and the human fights are annoying because they can constantly interrupt your attacks and movements, but the fights against the larger-scale Abductor enemies are a blast. The combat itself is very button mashy, but it's rewarding when all those attacks finally pay off and an enemy's body part is knocked loose. I wish there was more enemy variety, but even fighting the same handful of Abductors never got boring. A big part of that is the Thorn weapon, which adds an interesting wrinkle to the combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  's Thorns come in a variety of options with their own special gimmicks, but they are primarily used to zip around the environment in a manner not unlike
  <em>
   Attack on Titan
  </em>
  's ODM Gear. Thorns can also be used to drag large enemies to the ground, rendering them defenseless against a barrage of attacks. The missions with big boss fights may take a while, but they are usually a lot of fun. It's safe to say that anyone that enjoys
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  's battles will have a great time with
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered

  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Many
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  missions are tackled in groups.
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  supports online co-op, but for the purposes of this review, I was mostly stuck with AI-controlled companions. Luckily,
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  's AI helpers are extremely useful. They sometimes need special instructions if players hope to complete certain missions (they do a terrible job at capturing the flag if not explicitly told to do so, for example), but most of the time, they do a great job of whittling away at enemies' health and reviving their fellow teammates whenever they're knocked down. At times, the AI companions made some of
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  's battles almost trivial because of how effective they were, but I certainly prefer that to NPC partners that get in the way, like what happens in some other games.

  has a variety of NPCs that players can bring on their missions, but players are also assigned their very own AI companion that accompanies them by default in almost every mission in the game. This companion is known as the player's "Accessory." Similar to
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  's Palicos, these companions have customizable appearances and loadouts.
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  Accessories also serve a story purpose, as they are essentially there to babysit the player and make sure that they aren't doing anything that they are not allowed to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  is set in a dystopian, almost Orwellian world where so-called "Sinners" have to complete dangerous missions in an attempt to reduce their prison sentences.
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  players are slapped with an eye-watering 1 million year prison sentence at the start of the game, and not only that, but many of their privileges are restricted as well. Until players earn their privileges back by donating resources to their community, known as the Panopticon, they can't do things like rest, fast-travel, or even sprint for more than 5 seconds. Committing these actions results in penalties that see more time added to players' sentences. In one instance, I accidentally talked to an NPC of the opposite gender without buying that entitlement back first and had 20 years added to my sentence. Choosing to recline without the right entitlement added another 10 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it can be a little annoying at the start of the game when you have to slowly walk everywhere, I found
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  's prison setting and associated gimmick to be fascinating. The story in general is fairly engaging for the most part, though it's often dragged down by generic anime characters and dialogue. There are also long stretches of story dumps between missions that don't do
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  any favors, but I was still invested in the overarching mystery and always curious to see where the story was going to go next.

  One's time in

  is mostly spent fighting Abductors and running around talking to NPCs, but there are also stealth missions thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Freedom Wars Remastered
  </em>
  's stealth missions are a complete waste of time. They lack any kind of challenge and feel like an after-thought. When these boring stealth missions show up in the middle of a long stretch of talking, it can seriously hurt the game's pacing and will leave players anxious to get back to the fun, action-packed Abductor missions.

  Season 15 is on the horizon, following an unusually long duration for Season 14. Specific details regarding Season 15 are scarce, but Blizzard will likely reveal pertinent information in the coming weeks. Notably, with the debut of Hazard, 6v6 playtests, and

  Going into Season 15, fans hope that 2023's Ultimate Valentine event will return, though it didn't resurface in 2024. Even if
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's popular dating simulator, Loverwatch, doesn't return, Team 4 should continue to build on important character dynamics like the one between Genji and Mercy. For lore enthusiasts, in-game interactions are a fun way to immerse oneself in the world of Overwatch, and both Genji and Mercy deserve fresh dialogue.

  Mercy and Genji Haven't Reached the Same Level of Dialogue in Overwatch 2 as They Did in the First Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  It's no secret that Blizzard is placing its PvE missions on the back burner, but that doesn't mean Team 4 can't explore other methods to continue its narrative. The recent release of the
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  comic "Together" is a great start. However, considering that Mercy and Genji have a fresh interaction in Season 14, which confirms that they are still friends despite their past, players have been eager to see more dialogue between them. Sadly, after the transition from
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  in 2022, many of the original exchanges between the Swiss medic and younger Shimada have been erased.
 </p>
 <p>
  In particular, some of the iconic dialogue from
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  's third Archives event, Storm Rising, which included the two characters flirting, is no longer particularly relevant in the sequel. Other affectionate voice lines, which die-hard fans often record and publish on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or Reddit, are also missing. For some Mercy and Genji shippers, the erasure of some of these exchanges has been disappointing.

With this being the only dialogue between the pair in the PvE mode, some took to Reddit to express their displeasure, labeling the voice lines disrespectful and out of character.

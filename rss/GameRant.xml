  There are a lot of strange regions in the Pokemon World, and many mysteries waiting to be solved. But among all the strange locations that Ash and his crew have visited along their journey, there are some that are purely anime-exclusive places and will not appear in the games under any circumstances.

  This list has five points of interest that fans of the franchise will never be able to visit in future iterations of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  video games. From the birthplace of one of the most famous Mythical species to a place that makes the Shiny Pokemon gimmick look like a joke.

  The beach of Acapulco, which is named Aopulco in the original version, is a nice wordplay between Ao (blue) and pulco from the actual place. This region was featured when Ash, Brock, and Mysty arrived at the shores of Kanto. After wrecking the boat of a local fisherman and restaurant owner, the trio tries to help him earn enough sales to repair it. Afterward, they continue on their journey through the coasts of Kanto to a nearby town where the famous episode when the giant Tentacruel attacked the team happens. The whole region seems to be a tourist resort, full of restaurants that serve seafood, though made with unknown ingredients.

 <p>
  This is an anime-exclusive location, and unlikely to ever appear in the games since it was solely crafted for the purpose of narrating a conflict between Pokemon and humans that led to the destruction of said place by the furious sea
  <em>
   "
  </em>
  monsters
  <em>
   ."
  </em>
  Curiously it was one of the first times (but not the last) that they witnessed Prof. Oak and Ash's Mom having a (elopement) vacation together. That Samuel Oak is a menace.

 <p>
  Perhaps one of the eternally unsolved mysteries of the world of Pokemon is the sole mention of the region of Guyana South America in the original Game Boy games. Said to be the place where scientists found Mew and the genetic samples that led to the creation of Mewtwo, it was showcased in the movie
  <em>
   Mewtwo Strikes Back,
  </em>
  and after that, never mentioned again. The Pokemon Company never clarified the specific location of the Guyana Jungle and its ruins.

 <p>
  Maybe it was another breadcrumb thought to present a future new region of the world that fans haven't discovered yet (not in the series nor the anime). Needless to say, this place will never appear in a future Pokemon game, since it is believed the devs opted out of the real-world references besides the classic namesakes like the ones used for the Kanto and Johto regions.

  The secret base of operations of the heinous Team Rocket is located somewhere around the Kanto Region, and according to many clues spread around among the episodes and the
  <em>
   Mewtwo Strikes Back
  </em>
  movie. It has been discovered that its location lies somewhere around Pallet Town, a fact that adds fuel to the Pokemon conspiracy theory about Giovanni being Ash's dad.

  This is not the same place as the Team Rocket Academy, where Jesse and James trained, nor the Johto and Kanto bases located in the game, but a whole different place. It is said to be the hideout of the big boss, and the center of command of operations for the criminal syndicate.

  Below the Kanto and Johto twin regions, a series of islands of various sizes and shapes form the Orange Archipelago, a location that appears only in the anime series and acts as a middle act between
  <em>
   Pokemon S1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pokemon Johto.
  </em>
  It was created with the sole purpose of extending the airing of the anime while the producers prepared the next generation of Pokemon, and also gave time for the new iterations of the
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold/Silver
  </em>
  game to settle with the audience.

  The main characteristic shared by the many colorful islands that compose this place is that they're named after different citrus fruits or related regions where they cultivate them, like Valencia Island. Many of these Islands had rare and unusual variations of Pokemon, like the Pink Pokemon Island, and the Crystal Onyx, and also, an unusually strong and tanned Nurse Joy that acts as a wildlife ranger around the islands. Another interesting fact about this region is that they have a separate League from the main lands, and Ash was actually the champion of this contest, lifting the cup for the first time in his career.

  Perhaps one of the most incredible places in the world of Pokemon that fans will never see in the games, is the Island of Pink Pokemon. Part of the Orange Archipelago, this remote island is a natural reserve kept safe by Officer Jenny and her crew of Pokemon Rangers. In this incredible place, all the Pokemon that inhabit the island are from a particularly pastel tone of pink.

 <p>
  But this phenomenon has an explanation: Berry trees that grow on the island and that Pokemon feed on make them mutate and acquire that pinkish tone in their fur/skin. Even Ash's Pikachu was discovered eating the berries and his tail and cheeks already had changed colors. Obviously, this region will remain forever locked to the players, since it would totally ruin the Shiny Pokemon mechanic. Besides, if trainers want to catch a pink Pokemon they have various species like Chansey, Clefairy, Slowpoke, and even Shiny Heracross, Vaporeon, Mareep, Hypno, and Aerodactyl. Boy, they sure love that color palette.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Spectre Divide
   </strong>
  </em>
  , the newest game from Mountaintop Studio, adds a unique twist to the traditional first-person shooter genre. The game's unique gameplay features, particularly using Spectre to defeat enemies, have won over many shooter fans since its early access release.

  In addition to its casual mode,
  <em>
   Spectre Divide
  </em>
  features a ranked mode, just like many other competitive shooter games. The ranked mode offers more grueling combat and matches, where the players fight for the ultimate glory of climbing through the rank ladders.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   competitive mode
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Spectre Divide
  </em>
  is called Ranked Mode, and it will be accessible in the game starting on
  <strong>
   September 6, 2024
  </strong>
  . However, players won't automatically be able to access the mode, as you need to win
  <strong>
   five casual matches
  </strong>
  before getting access to this mode.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":778} -->
 <p>
  To begin playing ranked matches, navigate to the game's main menu and select the match mode from the menu. To start the matchmaking process, choose Ranked from the list of options and click the Compete button.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":993} -->

 <p>
  Once the Ranked Mode is unlocked, you must place
  <strong>
   five placement matches
  </strong>
  to get your first rank in the game. All ranked matches have a win-by-two round requirement, similar to titles like
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  . Once you have unlocked your first rank, you can start grinding out in either
  <strong>
   Solo Ranked
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Team Ranked
  </strong>
  mode with your utmost effort to reach the top rank of the game.

 <p>
  Although two different ranks are available, there is only
  <strong>
   one matchmaking queue
  </strong>
  for ranked matches in
  <em>
   Spectre Divide
  </em>
  . This means players competing for team ranking can face opponents playing solo-ranked. But when you play the solo rank, the opponents you face will be chosen according to the size of your party.

 <p>
  Playing and winning the matches will provide you
  <strong>
   Santai Ratings (SR)
  </strong>
  , advancing your ranking. However, only winning matches get you Santai Rating points, and losing any ranking match can also cost you SR. The SR has the potential to shift between
  <strong>
   +40 and -40
  </strong>
  based on the outcome of each game.

 <p>
  One unique aspect of Spectre Divide’s rank system from the other FPS titles is its separate rank category for solo and team players. The solo rank is similar to the rank system of most other FPS titles, where your ratings can increase or decrease based on your performance in a match. The solo ranks are:

 <p>
  In contrast to the solo rank, the team rank assigns you a rating based on how well your
  <strong>
   three-man team performed as a whole
  </strong>
  . This ranking differs from the solo rank, and you must climb these ranks separately by selecting the Team Rank mode before entering the ranked queue. The team ranks are:

  Every rank in
  <em>
   Spectre Divide
  </em>
  has a
  <strong>
   0-200 SR threshold
  </strong>
  , meaning that if you surpass it, you advance to the next rank; conversely, if you go below 0 SR, you are demoted to the lower rank. You will receive
  <strong>
   50 SR for every promotion
  </strong>
  you get, which will help you acclimatize to the new rank and avoid being dropped immediately. If you earn more SR than is necessary, it will all be
  <strong>
   carried over
  </strong>
  and added to the following tier.

     <li>
      Some Gods are better suited for the Support role than others, like Athena, Ares, Ymir, and Bacchus.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Smite 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  has a wide range of Gods that will be perfect for players looking to dive into the Duo Lane along with a Carry. Having a skilled player take up
  <strong>
   the Support role
  </strong>
  can be a massive help to a team. However, some Gods are just
  <strong>
   better at filling this role
  </strong>
  than others.

 <p>
  Gods that are easier to play than others can also let a player have a much easier time playing for a more consistent win rate, so it definitely comes down to a mix of multiple factors. Players should experiment to find the balance that works best for them.

  Athena can be built into a full-strength character, a full-intelligence character, or a hybrid of the two. She is also able to pull her weight in every role, making her a great choice for players looking to have a single main character who can do it all in all of the game's roles. Athena is an exceptionally tanky God who can dash forward and pull enemies toward her to keep them locked in battle against her.

 <p>
  After using an ability she can throw a projectile at her target to relentlessly pursue enemies that try to run from her. Using taunts and slowing enemies can keep the aggro of enemies on her, but when an ally is in danger, Athena can give them a shield and teleport to their side to take the focus off their allies. This makes her a very combat heavy support that is more about aggro management, rather than providing healing. Allies don’t need healing if someone else is taking all the damage.

 <p>
  Ares is a melee-focused God who will lock down enemies to keep the focus on him. His Ability Aptitude is fully focused on Intelligence, but he can be built as a hybrid thanks to some Strength scaling. Building into protections and cooldown rates will give Ares passive bonuses, making these focus points when building him. He is also able to fire out up to three shackles that will slow his enemies and continuously deal damage to them. Ares will also grant protection and damage buffs to his allies to both keep them alive and contribute to felling enemies before any of them can fall in battle.

 <p>
  He can use his ultimate to chain enemy Gods, which he then pulls toward him for high damage and stunning — Ares will be immune to Crowd Control while he channels his ultimate. Just like Athena, Ares is very tanky and can be a great option for players who want to try out a hero who is like Athena, but also plays differently. Both Ares and Athena are also able to hold their own quite well when taking up the Solo role.

  When Ymir uses his abilities, his targets will receive Frostbite. This causes them to deal less damage to Ymir, and increase his damage against them. He is also able to create a structure that blocks off enemies' escape routes and stops them from being able to engage their targets. Ymir also has plenty of means to slow and stun his enemies to keep them in an unfavorable situation — all while applying Frostbite. There are many different game modes for
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  , and players looking to learn Ymir should take him into Arena.

 <p>
  This makes Ymir a God that becomes more dangerous the longer enemies are forced to engage him, and one that can shut down their escape attempts. When partnered with a Carry, this can mean isolating a God in the Duo Lane and ganging up on them. While many Gods are now much more flexible, Ymir is not the first option for players looking to learn the Jungle role.

 <p>
  Some Gods are the perfect candidates for learning how to play a role, and Bacchus is one such God. Just like Ymir, Bacchus has a massive focus on his defensive capabilities. This can be credited to his passive, which sees him getting more buffs the more drunk he gets. While Tipsy can help players when they need it, going all the way to Smashed will send this God over the top in terms of performance. Players will want to use Chug to keep pushing his Drunk-O-Meter up to Smashed — and following up with a basic attack for increased damage.

  He has plenty of options to disrupt enemies, stun them, and prevent them from being able to heal. A lot of players may think that good support is all about healing, but when debuffing and controlling are pushed to the points these Gods use them, opponent teams who have invested heavily into healing options other than consumables are not able to keep up. He is also a great option for players who have never played the original Smite.

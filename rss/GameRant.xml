  In the grimdark future of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40K
   </em>
  </strong>
  universe, there is only war. Entire worlds and sectors have been engulfed in flames or have become new battlegrounds. Progress and peace are relics of the past, and the line between good and evil is lost, leaving numerous groups to their devices in a galaxy-wide war seemingly without end. Such conditions have birthed many powerful factions with skills and abilities far beyond comprehension. However, which of these factions is the strongest?

 <p>
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  fans participate in great debates on forums and discussion boards everywhere, disputing which factions are the most powerful, with disagreements abounding. Many factors and events go into deciding which side of this galaxy-wide war is the best, and the ever-growing universe of
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  always seems to rock the power balance. This trend of shifting scales has caused some fans to separate the factions into two categories, those that appear to be growing or evolving and those that are shrinking or regressing —making allocating each faction's power somewhat easier. Yet, one thing is sure: each side has the potential to overcome the other, and no faction shows signs of backing down.

    Space Marine 2
   </strong>
   has brought legions of new fans to the hobby, who are discovering the vast lore and history of the grimdark setting. Warhammer 40k can be an all-consuming hobby, from the must-read Black Library novels to the addictive video games like
   <strong>
    Boltgun
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Rogue Trader
   </strong>
   . The tabletop game itself has grown in popularity, with new players discovering a love of collecting and painting Warhammer 40k miniatures. This article has been updated to include more factions in the vast Warhammer 40k setting.

  These ancient war machines tower above battlefields, destroying humanity’s enemies with devastating power and weaponry. While they are dedicated servants of the God-Emperor, the
  <strong>
   Imperial Knights'
  </strong>
  true legacy stretches back before the imperium and into humanity’s golden age. Each of these colossal robotic machines is piloted by a single human who comes from a different aristocratic family, who can often trace their lineage back thousands of years.

 <p>
  When humanity first stretched out into the galaxy and began to colonize millions of worlds, many found their new homes extremely hostile. To protect themselves, they used AI-based technology known as STCs, or Standard Template Constructs, to develop enormous machines capable of protecting the human settlers. Over time, these planets would come to revere these machines, as well as the pilots who controlled them. When the Emperor of Mankind reunited humanity and started his Great Crusade, many of these noble families were brought into the imperial fold, lending their strength against humanity’s enemies. In the modern setting, these ancient machines are maintained by the Adeptus Mechanicus but are still piloted by the same noble families who march to war representing both the honor of their family and the might of the imperium.

  One of the most insidious dangers that threatens the safety of Imperium is from within.
  <strong>
   Genestealer Cults
  </strong>
  have become a common occurrence across the vast reaches of the galaxy. Worlds are suddenly going dark as cells become active and destroy populations. The Genestealer Cults are secretive societies of humans that have come to worship a xenos god. Controlled by a powerful breed of Genestealer known as a Patriarch, which can lie dormant for generations, the Cults slowly infect a population. It can take generations for a cult to be ready, with the cell growing and spreading year after year into every echelon of a planet’s society. Some members within the cults will eventually deform, becoming more like the xenos they worship, with new arms growing, and their heads becoming bulbous and alien. Although most appear like any other citizen.
 </p>

 <!-- Zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->

 <p>
  Once the Genestealer Cult has grown to a large enough size, they will attack at once. When there are cultists in every part of society, a planet can fall overnight. Once they have successfully taken over a planet, the psykers within the Cult will send out a call to their xenos god. The tragedy of the Genestealer Cults is that the god they worship is the Tyranid Hivemind. The psychic call reaches out to a hive fleet, which descends onto the planet and proceeds to devour all organic life, human and cultist alike. Genestealer Cults have spread to every sector of the Imperium and are slowly weakening the foundations, ready for the great devourer to come.

  From the deadly killers of the Officio Assassinorum to the feared agents of the Inquisition, to famed Rogue Traders, forging new paths through the galaxy: the
  <strong>
   Imperial Agents
  </strong>
  often work from shadows but wield immense power. The Imperial agents are not one unified faction, but rather a collaboration between the many departments of the Imperium of Man. Imperial Assassins are some of the deadliest killers in the galaxy and can efficiently deal with any single threat, while the Rogue Traders carve new paths through the galaxy with unprecedented freedom.

  Inquisitors are the front line of investigation, often working alone or with a small retinue. They seek to uncover treachery, heresy, or xenos plots against humanity. They answer to no one but the Emperor himself and can call down the vast strength of the Imperium if they see fit. These forces can include elements of the Astra Militarum, the planet’s local defense force, sisters of the Adepta Sororitas, and in extreme cases, the Adeptus Astartes Deathwatch chapter. This unique force is made up of the elite veterans from other Astartes chapters and serves the Ordo Xenos of the Inquisition. The Deathwatch is the last resort for Inquisitors, who only call upon them in their greatest need.

  The Aeldari race once ruled the galaxy. Their vast empire rose to such technological advances that nothing was out of their grasp. Morality and ethics would be forgotten as the Aeldari continued down its dark road of depravity. As this continued, some would oppose the excesses of their race and travel to the galaxy's far reaches in continent size Craftworlds. Others, who sought the darkest forms of entertainment would travel into the Webway, where every sadistic dream could be fulfilled.

  When the Aeldari fell, with the cataclysmic birth of Slaanesh, those living in the Webway would escape death, but be forever cursed by the Chaos God. They became the
  <strong>
   Drukhari,
  </strong>
  and to save their souls from She who Thirsts, they must continue to inflict pain and torture on innocent beings. The Drukhari are not interested in expansion or domination, their lives revolve around pain. From the dark city of Commorragh, bands of Drukhari raid with lightning speed. After each raid, their unlucky victims are taken back into the webway, where they will experience years of pain and torture at the hands of Dark Eldar. While this faction is the most sadistic of all the races and enjoys powerful ancient Aeldari technology, they are much smaller than most. The Drukhari are content to hide away in the webway, safe from the glare of Slaanesh, to continue their their monstrous lives of torture.

  The
  <strong>
   Adeptus Mechanicus
  </strong>
  , or Cult Mechanicus, is a highly advanced civilization of humans on Mars that work symbiotically with the Imperium of Man yet are their own entity. Originally a colony from Terra, this faction evolved into a theological group that revered the Omnissiah — an obscure mechanical deity — with a penchant for maintaining and constructing machines. Although they worshipped a god, a practice deemed unacceptable by the Imperial Truth, the Emperor of Mankind accepted the Adeptus Mechanicus, granting them immunity so long as they equipped the Imperium of Man with the technology necessary for their galaxy-wide conquest. Few factions come close to the engineering prowess and intelligence of the Adeptus Mechanicus.

  The Adeptus Mechanicus boasts access to one of the greatest armories in the galaxy, alongside powerful cybernetic enhancements that replace their weak flesh with technological wonders. So long as it is a tried and true invention that is not an innovation or abominable intelligence, it is at this faction's disposal, granting them countless options and implements of war. With their superhuman smarts, the Adeptus Mechanicus can use these technologies to their fullest, making them dangerous opponents. But, while they are brilliant and with many devices of war, they are also independent, meaning their numbers and reach are comparatively small; moreover, they believe innovation to be heresy, preventing any advancement. Should the Adeptus Mechanicus bolster its numbers and innovate, little can challenge them, let alone stop them.

  The
  <strong>
   Adepta Sororitas
  </strong>
  is a religious order of warrior nuns within the state church known as the Ecclesiarchy, and are some of the most devout and fiercest followers of the God-Emperor of Mankind. Both feared and respected by millions of the Imperium’s subjects, the Sisters of Battle are a frontline defense against heresy and rebellion. While the women of the Sororitas have no genetic augmentation and are all baseline humans, their immeasurable faith often manifests into minor miracles. Their prayers can heal wounds or miraculously avoid damage in battle altogether.

  Unlike the standard Astra Militarum, the Adepta Sororitas goes to war in specialized power armor, giving them a higher level of protection over the common soldier. Their holy hymns are sung loudly as they storm their enemies, giving joy and hope to all who follow them. While they are some of humanity’s greatest warriors, they can also bring fear wherever they go, burning any they deem heretics. Over the millions of worlds that make up the Imperium of Man, it is often the Sororitas that are sent to put down the many uprisings that appear. The Sisters of Battle are some of the most elite warriors in the Imperium, and spread the faith of the Emperor wherever they go.

  <strong>
   The Death Guard
  </strong>
  , led by their Daemon Primarch Mortarion, are a scourge on the galaxy. One of the original 18 Space Marine legions, the Death Guard, would follow Horus into rebellion. Their true fall, however, would come later during the Horus Heresy, when First Captain Typhus would trick his legion and trap them in the warp. Here, Mortarion and his legion would succumb to the will of Nurgle, mutating into the horrific Plague Marines of Chaos.

 <p>
  Mortarion still leads his legion from his personal plague planet, now a powerful Daemon Primarch of Nurgle. While they often join forces with Warmaster, Abaddon the Despoiler, the Death Guard are a power unto themselves and seek only to spread Nurgle’s gifts of disease and rot around the galaxy. However, Mortarion has recently fallen from the favor of his patron god after failing to kill Roboute Guilliman. During the War of Ultramar, Mortarion would open a portal to the Garden of Nurgle, trying to corrupt his former brother. Before this could be accomplished, the Emperor possessed Guilliman, bringing him back to life, healing his wounds, and sending purging flames into the Realm of Chaos. This act would greatly weaken Nurgle.

  After the galaxy-spanning destruction wrought by the Horus Heresy and the forces of Chaos, The Emperor and his right-hand man, Malcador the Sigillite, formed a new and highly secretive Astartes chapter known as
  <strong>
   the Grey Knights.
  </strong>
  These powerful warriors were created for one purpose: to be the last line of defense against the daemonic forces of the warp. The Grey Knights, however, are far greater than the average Space Marine. Their gene-seed comes not from one of the 18 Primarchs, but from the Emperor himself.

 <p>
  This super-powered enhancement allows the Grey Knights a higher level of protection against the forces of chaos. While every member of the Grey Knights is a powerful psyker, no Grey Knight has ever been corrupted in their long history. Based in the Sol System itself, on Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, these daemon hunters are the powerful weapon of the Ordo-Malleus, the secretive chaos-fighting wing of the Inquisition. They are led by their Supreme Grand Master, Kaldor Draigo, who has been lost within the warp for a century. Draigo is a psyker of incredible power and can occasionally return to realspace to aid his brothers in battle.

  The
  <strong>
   Aeldari
  </strong>
  were an exceptionally proud and powerful race believed to be created by the Old Ones. They were part of a once-great empire that spanned the galaxy and achieved all-manner of accomplishment, such as overcoming the seemingly unstoppable Necrons. However, due to a prolonged period of blissful peace, the Aeldari found no adversity or need to progress, which led them to a path of indulgence. Although innocent pursuits of joy initially, their lust for stimulation became demented and extreme. Their empire shattered into several groups when their continued decadence birthed the Chaos God Slaanesh and, consequently, the Eye of Terror. Those Eldar who saw the coming storm or eluded the cataclysms became the Eldar fans recognize today.

 <p>
  Although divided and a shadow of their former selves, the Aeldari remain highly mobile and mysterious to other factions, boasting expertise in manipulation, guerilla warfare, and developed psychic abilities. Using their webway gates, the Aeldari can move about quickly to accomplish their goals and execute decisive strikes against enemies. Even though much of their empire and its advances were lost, the Aeldari maintained many magical devices and perplexing abilities, giving them an edge in the ambiguity surrounding them. Even so, they are a shell of their former glory on the cusp of extinction, preventing them from winning battles of attrition and making every casualty much more devastating. Should the Aeldari, the Craftworld Aeldari specifically, find some way to outpace their losses and find footing in the galaxy, they can become an unstoppable threat.

  Residing deep within the resource-rich galactic core,
  <strong>
   the Leagues of Votann
  </strong>
  are a numerous collective confederation of abhuman clones who refer to themselves as The Kin. Often known as Squats by the larger Imperium of Man, The Leagues are a secretive race who are led by ancient self-aware machines known as Votann. Knowledge of the Votann is strictly guarded, as the existence of AI is heretical to the rest of humanity. The Kin themselves are often mistaken as a xenos race by some in the Imperium. The true origin of the Kin is lost in time, but there are references that claim the starfaring race settled in the core around the same time that humanity spread out into the galaxy. The Kin share their society with other self-aware machines, known as Ironkin. These AI are considered equals among the Leagues and bolster their armies in times of war.

  During the current Indomitus era and the opening of the great rift, the Leagues have found themselves beset by more enemies than ever. Being led by hyper-intelligent AI machines allows the Leagues to wield highly advanced technology. The Kin are a tough and resilient people who have survived the dangers of the galactic core for thousands of years. They possess powerful weapons that can lay waste to any foe in the galaxy. They may not have the numbers of the Imperium, but any who anger the Kin will be facing one of the most formidable forces in the setting.

  <strong>
   The T'au Empire
  </strong>
  is a young civilization — having only been around for 6000 Terran years — experiencing growth far beyond many of the other sentient factions in the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  universe. Not long ago, the T'au mastered fire and the wheel, yet swiftly developed into a space-faring species with technology on par with, if not more advanced than, other civilizations. Such impossibly fast development has made the T'au Empire a threat to all others, a threat made far more severe with their plight for Tau'va or "The Greater Good." This seemingly altruistic mission to do the greatest good for the greatest number of intelligent beings has propelled them on a campaign to dominate the universe and "invite" others to join their philosophy; all who refuse are dealt with harshly.

 <p>
  The Tau Empire's strengths lie in their expertise with mid-to-ranged combat and highly adaptive technology, using pulse firearms and advanced battlesuits. Their strong beliefs and ability to "befriend" other races and members of the galaxy, a rare occurrence in
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  , have allowed them to bolster their ranks with numerous able-bodies of various species. Organized and determined to spread their cause, the Tau and their respective allies have spread across the galaxy and have since been fighting tirelessly. However, their number is comparatively small, and they have yet to master faster-than-light travel, keeping them from effectively expanding while leaving them beset by their enemies. The T'au Empire shows promise, and should they be allowed to progress unhindered, they will undoubtedly surpass other factions.

  <strong>
   The Thousand Sons
  </strong>
  were one of the few traitor legions that should never have turned to Chaos. Through world-changing mistakes and malicious manipulation, the legion was ensnared by the power of the Chaos God of Change, Tzeentch. Magnus the Red, the powerful psyker Primarch of the Thousand Sons, would attempt to warn his father, the Emperor, of Horus's betrayal through warp magic. This act would be his ultimate downfall. The magic he used ripped a hole in the webway project the Emperor was working on, causing a massive daemonic incursion on Terra.

 <p>
  The Emperor would send his loyal son, Lemon Russ, and the Space Wolves to bring Magnus to justice. However, through enemy trickery, Russ would receive a kill order instead. The Space Wolves attacked the Thousand Son's home of Prospero and burned it to the ground. In a last effort to survive, Magnus pledged himself to the dark powers and transformed into a Daemon Primarch, damning himself and his legion forever. While the Thousand Sons now fight for ruinous powers, they remain a legion apart from the other Chaos factions. They are forever delving into the secrets of the warp, gaining knowledge and power to further their own goals.

  Considered one of the greatest threats to the galaxy, created and sustained by the emotions and desires of all creatures, the
  <strong>
   Chaos Daemons
  </strong>
  and the Ruinous Powers that oversee them wreak havoc on countless worlds and minds through the powerful and corrupting influence of the Warp. Mighty, resilient, destructive, and seductive, the Chaos Daemons are a relentless and infinite force that has and continues to endanger all that lies beyond their reach. Following the commands of their respective Chaos God, the Chaos Daemons wage war mindlessly against the galaxy, and all who they cannot overcome are turned to their cause, making them an evergrowing and insurmountable threat. Even those who are most capable or those of the strongest will find themselves struggling against the sheer might and compelling lures of Chaos Daemons.

  The greatest strength of Chaos Daemons is that they are infinite and various. A Chaos Daemon is purely psychic power drawn by the Ruinous Powers and given form, meaning that — so long as there is the Warp and the emotions and desires that fuel it — there will be Chaos Daemons. The forms Chaos Daemons can take are limitless, only restricted by the imaginations of the Chaos Gods, who have a twisted and dangerous sense of creativity. Yet the Forces of Chaos are prone to infighting as the Ruinous Powers seek to undermine one another. Each Chaos God — Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, and Slaanesh — has its own end goal and beliefs that conflict with others, causing bitter hatred and hostility that diverts their attention from dominating the galaxy. Even so, if the Chaos Daemons and their overlords cooperate, as they have before, nothing will stop their conquest over all outside the Warp.

  Once a proud and noble legion of Space Marines, the
  <strong>
   World Eaters
  </strong>
  would descend into madness, following their tortured Primarch Angron into damnation. Cursed with the Butcher’s Nails, an immovable implant that causes intense pain unless engaged in bloody combat, Angron led his World Eaters into battle with little love or regard for his legion. To please their Primarch, the World Eaters would inflict the Butcher’s Nails on themselves, turning the elite fighting force into crazed berzerkers.

  The Primarch would eventually ascend to Daemonhood, becoming a Daemon Primarch of Khorne. Angron and his World Eaters are now very active in the galaxy on a constant mission of destruction. Their goal is to spill blood for Khorne, endlessly killing in their Chaos God's name. Angron is still cursed with the Butcher’s Nails, forever pounding his head and calling for more blood. His warriors are some of the most dangerous beings in the galaxy, highly skilled and bloodthirsty. They are some of the most commonly found Chaos warriors and are always at the forefront of any battle.

  These golden armored warriors of legend are some of humanity’s greatest fighters, after only the Primarchs themselves. They represent the highest peaks of excellence, beyond even the famed Adeptus Astartes. The
  <strong>
   Adeptus Custodes
  </strong>
  are the Emperor of Mankind’s bodyguards and have been since before the Great Crusade. They are both his fist and shield, and are ruled by none but the Emperor himself.

  These genetically engineered superhumans are tasked with guarding both the imperial palace and the God-Emperor's mortal body, forever encased within the golden throne. Over the ten thousand years since the Emperor fell, they have stood vigil, rarely venturing away from Terra. On the rare occasions when they have appeared off-world, their prowess in battle means humanity’s enemies are quickly put down. Since the opening of the Great Rift and the return of Roboute Guilliman, the Custodes have taken on a larger role in the ongoing Indomitus Crusade. This large-scale campaign is attempting to push back against Chaos and reunite much of the Imperium that was lost after the Cicatrix Maledictum split the galaxy in two. In this endeavor, the Custodes are some of humankind’s greatest weapons, standing resilient and determined against the might of ruinous powers.

  A mysterious faction of robotic skeletal warriors that were once the xeno Necrontyr, the
  <strong>
   Necrons
  </strong>
  are a species that recovered from an unthinkable tragedy better than ever. Although tricked by the deceptive C'tan and forced into metal bodies, they have overcome the odds and shattered their deceivers into shards that now fuel their machinery, yet the losses they faced forced them to slumber for sixty million years. But recently, pockets of the almost undead Necrons began awakening sporadically from their Tomb Worlds to conquer the galaxy and restore their Empire to its former glory. Ruthless and unrelenting — death now a near impossibility — the Necrons have zero empathy and compassion, only a drive to take what was lost and lord over the galaxy.

  The Necrons stored powerful old technology before going into an inert state, maintaining the devices necessary to claim their place as rulers over the galaxy, devices that they now power with the remnants of their old and terrible masters, the C’Tan, powerful ancient beings that would consume entire stars for energy. United in their will, impervious to the effects of Chaos, disdained by Tyranids as they have no biomass, able to regenerate even lethal wounds, and unable to die with their Tomb World intact, the Necrons are unstoppable. Yet, keeping them from achieving their mission and coming out on top is the truth that many of their ranks are still dormant, and many of those awake have differences that prevent cooperation, if not cause infighting. The Necrons may be a little late to the party, but should they all wake up and unite, they would pose an unconquerable threat to any who would stand in their way.

  The poster boys for
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  are undoubtedly the
  <strong>
   Adeptus Astartes
  </strong>
  , also known as the Space Marines. Often, the first faction hobbyists will collect, the Space Marines, are the power-armored superhumans that protect humanity from the daemons of the warp and the countless xenos threats. Created by the Emperor of Mankind to reunite humanity in the galactic-spanning Great Crusade, the Astartes are some of the most skilled and deadly warriors in the setting. Of the original 18 legions, created by the Emperor, only 9 remain loyal to the Imperium. After the devastating civil war, known as the Horus Heresy, turned brother and against brother and shook the Imperium to its core.

  After this catastrophic event, the legions of Astartes were split into smaller chapters, to prevent such a destructive rebellion from happening again. In the modern setting, there are countless chapters, often numbering around 1000 Space Marines, but sometimes many more. With the addition of the Primaris Space Marines to the setting, these warriors have grown in power and strength and are as formidable as ever. With only a few of these elite warriors, entire campaigns can be won. While the Astartes are humanity’s greatest warriors, they are not a unified force, and chapters can be wiped out entirely by larger forces.

  <strong>
   Orks
  </strong>
  are the fallen-from-grace descendants of the Krorks, the smarter, more advanced, and larger species created by the Old Ones. None know whether the Orks are better or worse than their ancestors, especially considering how effective they are in combat, but what is certain is that they are dangerous. Barbaric, chaotic, and ever-hungry for conflict and battle, the Greenskins are perhaps the most bloodthirsty faction in the galaxy, seeing war as a stroll in the park or a stop by a shop, an everyday occurrence. They know little else, which makes them proficient killers that do not think much of their losses or victories, just how bloody a battle is and how strong they can get.

 <p>
  Being good at killing things should be enough, but Orks also have partial immunity to Chaos, the ability to reproduce quickly through spores that emerge from dead Orks, a negligible maturity rate, and ever-growing strength and size when overcoming powerful threats. That should be enough, right? No. Orks also possess the unique ability to make impossible things true so long as enough of them believe it is, such as the common belief that purple is the color of stealth because no one has seen a purple Ork. So, what flaw do Orks have? Well. Like the Forces of Chaos, Orks suffer from much infighting, sating their bloodlust by turning against their own. Most WAAAGHS! (Ork Crusades) typically end with Orks attacking one another as the number of enemies dwindles. However, should the Orks ever unite as one, no other faction in the galaxy can hope to stand against the unstoppable green tide.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Astra Militarum
  </strong>
  , also known as the Imperial Guard, is one of the largest fighting forces in the galaxy. Unlike many factions active in the
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  setting, they are not superpowered killing machines, but everyday soldiers fighting for the Imperium. While each soldier may pose little threat to the many monsters that inhabit the galaxy, the untold billions that make up the Guard are. These are not the highly trained elite soldiers of the Astartes or even the Sororitas, they are the everyday heroes who are thrown into the meat grinder that is the far future.

 <p>
  The Astra Militarum is the first line of defense for humanity and is an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction once turned towards an objective. Countless regiments make up the Guard, with soldiers from every corner of the galaxy, from a million different worlds. From the elite Jungle Fighters of Catachan to the fearless Death Korps of Kreig, or the iron-willed Vahallan Ice Warriors, each regiment has a unique personality and history. Few factions in the setting could withstand the never-ending onslaught of the Astra Militarum at full force. However, with the outbreak of war in every sector and the galaxy split in two, even the might of the Imperial Guard is stretched to breaking point.

  <strong>
   Chaos Space Marines
  </strong>
  , popularly known as Heretic Astartes, are former legions that served under the Imperium of Man yet allied themselves with the Ruinous Powers of Chaos following the Horus Heresy. Many of its members are from the original Nine Traitor Legions that sided with Primarch Horus against the Emperor of Mankind, giving themselves wholly to Chaos and now residing in the Eye of Terror. Some legions serve the Ruinous Powers indiscriminately while others devote themselves to a specific Chaos God, but regardless of their allegiance, all share the same desire for revenge against the Imperium of Man. Chaos can grant them this and something else they never had while serving the Emperor, free will to do what they want.

 <p>
  The Chaos Space Marines are a heretical combination of humanity's finest and Chaos Gods' worst, unifying the martial prowess of Space Marines with the volatile influence of the Warp. This meeting of two dominant forces into one faction makes the Chaos Space Marines incomprehensibly dangerous, especially when noting that many of their ranks lived through the Horus Heresy, experiencing one of the deadliest conflicts in history and living to seek revenge. Yet, even with their superhuman nature, control over Chaos, and insatiable desire to take vengeance against the Imperium of Man, the Chaos Space Marines cannot overcome any other faction, as they are too preoccupied with fighting each other over old wounds or differences in their allegiances. But, as history has shown, should and when Chaos Space Marines unite, they are capable of galaxy-wide destruction.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan recreated Ada Wong in
  <em>
   Dress to Impress,
  </em>
  the popular
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  dress-up game. Ada has caught the attention of many fans because of her enigmatic personality and her ability to handle difficult missions, notably helping
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  protagonist Leon Kennedy and secondary character Ashley Graham.

 <p>
  Apart from Ada's skills and personality, many
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  fans also remember her for her style. She's always dressed in red and sporting a bob haircut, which has inspired many cosplays and custom character creations in other games, such as in
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  In a Reddit post, a
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  player named ccy0s5 shared a screenshot of their avatar dressed as Ada. They pulled off the character's long-sleeved turtleneck outfit from the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  remake and her signature bob, complete with boots and the gun holster on her thigh.

 <p>
  Although the
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  fan didn't share the theme they followed to create Ada, they still received a good number of post impressions. In
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  , players receive a theme and only have 325 seconds to complete an outfit and get hair and makeup done. They will then have to vote for their favorite looks based on the given theme, and the players with the highest scores in the end are named the top three of the round.
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  players can also use codes to unlock specific pieces and get additional money to spend on in-game cosmetics.

  Ada is just one of many characters that

  <em>

  's Yor,
  <em>
   Monster High
  </em>
  characters, and many more. Plus, the fact that it's easily accessible through
  <em>

  </em>
  has made it a popular title among kids and adults alike, even receiving a major collaboration with Charli XCX.

 <p>
  Biomes in survival games play a crucial role in the overall gameplay, with different biomes offering their own sets of challenges, rewards, and difficulty. From dense forests filled with resources to enemies to icy wastelands where even the NPCs struggle to survive, biomes in survival games are more than just visually pleasing locations.

 <p>
  With each new biome, a new set of challenges arises. It's these new obstacles that make survival games so fun to replay time and time again. Whether it's a sandbox-style survival game with randomly generated biomes or a more linear experience with a predetermined map, unique biomes can leave a long-lasting impression on the gaming community.

  <em>
   State of Decay 2
  </em>
  combines survival and horror with a dose of realism to create a unique zombie-based experience. Set in the USA,
  <em>
   State of Decay 2
  </em>
  has four main locations:
  <strong>
   Cascade Hills, Meagher Valley, Drucker County,
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Providence Ridge
  </strong>
  . The game's developers tried to them as real as possible.

 <p>
  Unlike similar games,
  <em>
   State of Decay 2
  </em>
  tries to stay within the realm of realism by incorporating rural farmlands, dense forests, rivers, deserts, urban areas, and suburban neighborhoods. Although this may not seem overly unique, these biomes create a more gritty and grounded experience.

  <em>

  more difficult and enjoyable. The Abrassar Desert, for example, has scorching heat during the day and subzero temperatures at night, meaning players need to prepare for two vastly different experiences.

  Valheim has seven unique biomes: Meadows, Black Forest, Ocean, Swamp, Mountain, Plains, and Mistland. Each biome gets harder, but resources grow more plentiful, pushing players to continue exploring this vast world. As
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  is based around Viking mythology and history, the biomes, although quite standard, are unique and filled with Viking-based structures and items.

  Set in the Exile Lands,

  Although the biomes themselves aren't anything groundbreaking, the additions like creatures, cities, and vast cave systems make the biomes truly unique within the survival genre. Players need to prepare and plan their trips into certain biomes like the Volcano or Snow biomes, which have extreme temperatures that can drain players' resources and equipment quickly.

  In
  <em>
   Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey
  </em>
  , gamers play as a family of apes through multiple generations, learning new skills and abilities, essentially playing through the evolution of humankind. Because the game takes place over millions of years, the biomes see significant changes, creating a one-of-a-kind experience.

 <p>
  The biomes vary between dense jungles, vast savannas and lush islands, but what makes the biomes stand out is how they adapt over the course of the game. Each time players take control of the new generation, key differences can arise in the biomes, such as new and improved vegetation, rock formations, rivers, and streams.

     <li>
      Some CAMP items passively produce key resources, like the Motorized Butter Churn for cooking oil.

  Building a CAMP is a must in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Players can build their CAMP almost anywhere they like. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of different items that players can build, but knowing what to build can be a bit tricky, especially for new players.

 <p>
  When building, there is a whole section dedicated to resources. This section is filled with items that players can place in their CAMPS to generate certain things passively. Some of the items are obtainable through quests, others via event drops, and some are only available in the Atomic Shop. Out of all the CAMP resource generators, there are a handful that are really worth investing in.

   Fallout 76 gives players the ability to earn, buy, and find all sorts of CAMP items. While most of the items available are decorative, some are used to collect resources. The original list contained a lot of the best CAMP resource items to own. That said, it didn't cover all of them. With each update, Bethesda releases CAMP resource items for players to get their hands on. With so many options, it can be hard to know which ones to unlock first. This update will bring in three new entries to the original list while also updating some of the existing entries with additional information.

  <strong>
   The Motorized Butter Churn produces cooking oil.
  </strong>
  This is a very useful resource, not only for cooking items like Fasnacht Donuts but also for crafting things like energy ammo. When it is broken down into its core components, cooking oil provides the player with plastic and oil. These are both key resources, but oil in particular is incredibly useful for crafting ammo such as fuel.

 <p>
  The Motorized Butter Churn will generate one bottle of cooking oil every 10 minutes, and it can hold a total of 12 bottles, making it a great way of passively farming oil and plastic from the comfort of the player's base. While the plan can only be earned during the Fasnacht event, it is tradable. If the player wants to get the Motorized Butter Churn at their base, then they can check out online trading forums to find someone willing to set up a trade.

  Raw Radstag Meat can be grilled to make Grilled Radstag Meat. Grilled Radstag not only satisfies the player's hunger level and gives them HP, but it also boosts their carry weight by 20 for a limited time. Managing carry weight can be quite a challenge, so anything that gives the player a boost is always a valuable tool to carry.

 <p>
  Acid is a core component of various items. Players will need acid to craft a plethora of CAMP items and things like serums and meds. It's impossible to have too much acid. For 700 Atoms, players can purchase the plan to craft a
  <strong>
   Butterfly Sanctuary
  </strong>
  at their CAMP. This can
  <strong>
   produce 1 acid every 3 minutes and can hold up to 10 acid
  </strong>
  . It's certainly not going to break the bank, but it's a little extra that can help players out in a pinch.

 <p>
  This probably isn't for everyone as it is quite a costly thing to purchase, but for those who find themselves running out of acid regularly, the Butterfly Sanctuary can be very helpful. Acid is a key resource that high-level players need in large quantities. So the Butterfly Sanctuary can really come in handy when it comes to farming a little extra acid.

  Purified water is not only good for drinking, but it is used for crafting various consumable items. Not only that, but in large quantities,
  <strong>
   purified water can fetch a pretty penny

  when sold to one of

  There are lots of different
  <strong>
   Purified Water Collectors
  </strong>
  that players can build at their CAMP. Out of all of them, the most popular is the Vintage Water Cooler. While it can only hold up to 2 bottles of purified water, these units are very small. So, it's possible to place a lot of them in a small area. This is great for those wanting to farm some Caps.

  <strong>
   The Weenie Wagon
  </strong>
  was a rare reward given out by Grahm during Meat Week. While it is no longer available to earn, there are lots of players who are willing to sell the plan to craft it for some Caps. This fun little food stand
  <strong>
   produces Canned Dog Food over time
  </strong>
  . While it doesn't sound particularly appetizing, there is a perk that increases the benefits of eating this tasty treat.

  Also, there are daily and weekly challenges that require the player to chow down on some dog food, so this machine can be incredibly useful.

  <strong>
   The Turbo-Fert Fertilizer Collector
  </strong>
  was introduced to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  during the Wastelanders update. This was also the update that brought NPCs into game
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  This item can be purchased from Samuel for 750 Gold Bullion once the player has reached max affinity with the faction.

 <p>
  When placed in a CAMP,
  <strong>
   the Turbo-Fert Fertilizer will passively produce Turbo-Fer Fertilizer Grenades.
  </strong>
  When used, these will
  <strong>
   instantly regrow any crop
  </strong>
  that the player has harvested in their CAMP. It's ideal for herbivores who rely on crops for buffs.

  Nuka-Cola is featured in every
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  game. It is the preferred beverage of most Wastelanders, except for those living in New Vegas. Originally, this plan was a Season 14 Scoreboard reward, but it is now obtainable from Mortimer in the Crater Core. It costs 1250 Gold Bullion, and the player needs to reach the reputation of Cautious to be able to buy it.

  The machine costs 15 Caps to use, and it dispenses a random bottle of Nuka-Cola. The machine can be
  <strong>
   used every 5 minutes
  </strong>
  , making it a good way to complete daily and weekly challenges that require players to drink Nuka-Cola. It is also good for those wanting to build certain ammo types and grenades that require Nuka-Cola.

  <em>
   Fallout 76.

  All Power Armor sets rely on Fusion Cores to work. This can be fairly annoying as Fusion Cores tend not to last very long.

   The Fusion Core Recharger

  is exactly what it sounds like;

   it recharges the player's Fusion Cores

  However, the grind is worth it. While the machine doesn't generate thousands of bullets, it makes enough to keep players shooting. Just be sure to collect the ammo regularly, as if the machine gets full, it will stop producing ammo.

  <strong>
   They generate canned coffee at the player's CAMP.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak teased a potential new female character. Set in New Eridu,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  is a modern sci-fi RPG that follows the sibling protagonists known as the Proxy as they work with various Agents in combating evil forces in Hollows.

 <p>
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  is still a relatively young title that's still building its universe and character lore. In recent updates, it put the spotlight on various factions, such as the Sons of Calydon and Victoria Housekeeping, to showcase the Proxy's relationships with different Agents. As it
  <em>
  </em>
  continues to grow,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  will add quality of life updates, introduce more playable Agents, and compelling story missions.

  Meanwhile, a number of leaks have teased rumored characters coming to
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero

  , such as leaker Mero's claim that there might be a new female Agent. In a Reddit post, they said that Astra might be a "tall woman" similar to S-rank Agent Caesar King. Previously, leaker Cleo also teased an S-rank character named Astra Yao, who might debut in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  Version 1.5.

  According to an Inter-Knot news post in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , Astra Yao is a popular singer in New Eridu, with advertisements scattered around Lumina Square. Many eagle-eyed fans have also spotted these ads, which they speculated could be a foreshadowing of Astra possibly becoming playable in the future. This wouldn't be surprising considering that
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  has introduced characters like Lighter as NPCs hanging out in New Eridu before they were officially released.

  In the comments, many
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  fans expressed their excitement about pulling for Astra if she becomes playable, because they love seeing her movie posters around New Eridu. Meanwhile, some fans were already thinking of ways to save Polychromes as Astra might come after Hoshimi Miyabi's banner in Version 1.4.

  It's important to note that Astra's alleged release is still unconfirmed, so fans should take the information with a grain of salt. But if the leak is reliable, it would be interesting to see whether Astra is an independent character or will be part of an existing
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  faction. It's also possible that the game might introduce a new faction that includes celebrities like Astra, but it might be too early to do so, as it's still expanding the lore of certain factions.

 <p>
  The Zone is home to hidden treasures that are hidden deep within certain locations in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Players can only find these hidden away items if they take the time to explore every inch of a location and find hidden sections. One of these hidden areas can be found in the Cement Factory region while completing the Uninvited Guests side mission. The vaults are located in the underground facility where players search for Mytryk's gun.

  To reach the room with the vaults, players must first head towards the underground entrance inside the
  <strong>
   Concrete Forest location in the Cement Factory region
  </strong>
  of
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  . It's a desolated building with a ladder leading into the underground section of the location. After heading down the ladder, you'll need to reach the room with the two vaults. Here's how to find it.

  After exiting the first room, take a sharp right turn and continue running down the corridor until you spot a door to your left. Cross through the machinery room and into the underground facility section. If it's the first time players are visiting this location,
  <strong>
   they'll encounter two burers
  </strong>
  . After eliminating them, go up the flight of rusted stairs and enter the hallway on the first floor.
 </p>
 <p>
  After running down the twisting and turning hallway, you'll spot a metal gate on your left. Quickly go through it as the
  <strong>
   electrical anomaly will chase you
  </strong>
  . Right after entering the gate, you'll need to make another left turn to enter a doorway with lights spilling into the hallway. Following either the left or right corridor will lead you to the room in the middle with two vaults.

  Fortunately, there's no code or keys required to open the two vaults under the Concrete Forest in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  . Opening the left vault will reward players with some valuable consumables and a
  <strong>
   Camel Hydration System blueprint
  </strong>
  for the SEVA-D suit. Opening the vault on the right will let players pick up the
  <strong>
   Aeroprotection Gas Mask

  which comes with high physical and PSI protection.

  The process for fighting Destroyer Charadrius at full power begins right when you get to the Tyrant's Star, the final dungeon of the game. While here, you'll be able to fight powerful versions of all the main bosses in the game, and defeating them makes Louis weaker. To fight Destroyer Charadrius at full power, you'll instead need to
  <strong>
   skip all of these boss fights against the boss humans
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  While exploring Tyrant's Star,
  <strong>
   don't step on any of the circles taking you to another area
  </strong>
  as that will lock you into fighting and killing the human unless you want to reload an old save. The only circle you should step on is the one with the quest icon over it, as that just leads you to the second section of Tyrant's Star. As long as you don't defeat one boss on your way to Louis, Destroyer Charadrius's final form will be at full power.

  Trying to face Destroyer Charadrius will leave you at many disadvantages, no matter what difficulty you are playing on. When at full power,
  <strong>
   only Destroyer Charadrius's second form is strengthened
  </strong>
  , as you'll first need to face Archdemon Louis and Destroyer Charadrius's first form as usual. The changes of full power are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Destroyer Charadrius has
   <strong>
    eight Press Turn icons each turn
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   You won't have the ultimate weapon for each Archetype.
  </li>
  <li>
   He will have
   <strong>
    multiple boss-specific moves from each boss human
   </strong>
   that deal damage and usually have additional status effects.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While some aspects of the fight are the same as usual, you'll need to heavily focus on repelling or dodging to clear out his Press Turn icons, as you otherwise won't stand a chance. He also has access to
  <strong>
   Soul Scream which will give him four additional Press Turn icons
  </strong>
  , leading to a turn not many parties can survive. There's no shame in grinding for levels before this fight considering how one-sided it already will be. This fight can also be made a lot easier when playing in New Game Plus, as you'll at least have more tools to try and even the odds.

      <title>Switch 2's Mario Kart is Rumored to Have a Feature That Would Be Huge For Its Roster</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-24-player-races-big-roster-characters/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  After what feels like an eternity of waiting, the Nintendo Switch 2 has officially been revealed. Clocking in at just over two minutes, the Nintendo Switch 2's reveal trailer did a decent job of showcasing some of the new features that distinguish the console from its predecessor. And in between shots of the shiny new console, its sleek dock, and its innovative magnetic Joy-Cons, Nintendo subtely teased the next
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario Kart
   </strong>
  </em>
  entry.

 <p>
  Appearing on screen for less than 20 seconds in total, there's not too much fans can glean from
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  's sudden, surprising reveal. Some new character designs can be glimpsed, and the trailer seemed to be teasing a more open-ended track layout. But some eagle-eyed fans think they might have spotted what could be a franchise-first feature coming in the sequel, and it could mean big things for the roster if proven true.

 <h3 id="mario-kart-9-is-rumored-to-have-24-player-races">
  Mario Kart 9 Is Rumored to Have 24-Player Races
 </h3>
 <p>
  Right at the beginning of the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  <em>
   Kart
  </em>
  section of the Nintendo Switch 2 first look trailer (at around the 1:40 mark), fans can spot the familiar sight of some beloved Nintendo characters readying themselves at the starting line of a racetrack. But what's new here is that there are far more vehicle positions on the track than fans are used to seeing.
 </p>
 <p>
  A total of 24 individual vehicle bays can be spotted in this opening shot, appearing as four rows of six diagonally-placed bays. While there aren't 24 racers on the track, and their karts don't seem to be lined up perfectly with the grids, some fans have theorized that this could mean that
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  will feature 24-player races. This would be a major step-up from
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  , which featured a total of 12 racers, only 8 of which could be controlled by human players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Towards the end of the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer, a total of 14 karts can be seen racing at the same time. Mario, Bowser, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Princess Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, and Toad can all be seen clearly in the foreground of the frame, while Waluigi, Baby Luigi, and a few non-discernable racers can be seen in the background, lending credence to the 24-player theory.
 </p>
 <h3 id="24-player-races-could-imply-the-existence-of-a-big-day-one-roster-for-mario-kart-9">
  24-Player Races Could Imply The Existence of a Big Day-One Roster for Mario Kart 9
 </h3>
 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  does indeed feature 24-player races, then there's a chance that at least 24 different characters are on the roster at launch. While it's pure speculation at this point, it would make sense for
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  to include a large roster on day-one, with
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
  </em>
  setting some absurdly high expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon its 2014 launch,
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  shipped with 29 characters, not including the customizable Mii racer. Future DLCs added a few more along with color variations of Yoshi and Shy Guy, eventually leading to
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
  </em>
  shipping with 40 characters. And with the addition of the Booster Course Pass DLC,
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
  </em>
  's roster now sits at an impressive 48 individual characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be quite disappointing for
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  to launch with a significantly lower number of characters than fans are now used to. Of course, there's also a strong possibility that this footage isn't fully representative of the final product, which could render this whole discussion moot.

      <title>Dark Souls Remastered: The 18 Best Soul Farming Locations</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/dark-souls-remastered-soul-farming-locations/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Souls are an all-important currency in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Souls
   </em>
  </strong>
  . They are used to purchase items, upgrade equipment, and even level up one's character. With the ever-increasing difficulty of
  <em>
   Dark Souls,
  </em>
  however, players can soon find themselves struggling to get by as prices increase to buy the spells, infuse weapons, and buy armor.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  When this happens, players must resort to the age-old method of farming. But what are the
  <strong>
   best
   <em>
    Dark Souls
   </em>
   Soul farming areas
  </strong>
  at each point in the game? And, more importantly, in which areas can players easily get Souls without worrying something will come along and kill them? Players should prepare thoroughly, as they're going to need their Symbol of Avarice after this.
 </p>

  <em>
   There's no denying that there are many areas of the original Dark Souls that are not only extremely challenging, but frustrating as well. In many cases, players might be tempted to rush through said areas to forget all about them and never give them a second look. And while this is sometimes a good idea, in other instances they might need to be revisited, as they hold enemies that can be farmed for a pretty penny. Farming is, unfortunately, a tedious yet necessary process to level up in Dark Souls and make the challenges along the way more manageable and less frustrating.

  The New Londo Ruins isn't a particularly difficult area, even if getting to it is a challenge in and of itself. If players explore this little area, they will quickly come across the formidable Darkwraiths, which are no joke.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only do they hit like a truck and have a fast moveset, but they can also take a lot of punishment, which makes defeating them quite hard. On the plus side, each Darkwraith that players defeat yields 1,200 Souls, which can quickly turn into a small fortune after a little farming.

 <p>
  Lost Izalith is one of those areas in the original
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  that won't be winning any popularity contests anytime soon. The area is very difficult and full of challenging enemies that will make players die more than once. On top of this, there's a ton of lava, which can be an environmental hazard if players are not careful.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one upside about Lost Izalith is that it's full of
  <strong>
   Chaos Eaters
  </strong>
  , which can be killed for 1000 Souls a pop. This makes them ideal for farming, even when their location isn’t the best.

  There's a hidden bonfire near the door in
  <strong>
   Darkroot Basin
  </strong>
  that requires 20,000 Souls to open. Players should unlock this bonfire since this farming method becomes efficient that way. Near this door is an open area that is full to the brim with a variety of enemies that give varying amounts of experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players should efficiently clear the entire area in as little time as possible before running back to the bonfire and restarting the process. In some time, players will have more than the number of Souls required to buy the key from Andre!. If players ever get bored of this repetitive process, facing the Moonlight Butterfly boss in this area, and the Great Grey Wolf Sif might offer some variety. In NG, the former yields 10,000 Souls, whereas the latter will drop 3,432 for a grand total of 13,432 Souls.
 </p>
 <p>
  Defeating them won't be as easy as farming the spot mentioned above, but it's also an option players should take into account.

  To utilize this great farming spot, players need to defeat Seath the Scaleless and activate the bonfire that spawns right after. This gives them a quick spot to go back to after hunting down all the Man-Eater Shells that are present in the
  <strong>
   Crystal Caves,
  </strong>
  since players can easily bait them to fight one at a time before taking them out in a resounding fashion.
 </p>
 <p>
  These shells drop Twinkling Titanite and Purging Stones rather frequently as well, making this tactic great for players who may need both these items. Along with this, they'll drop 2000 Souls each, meaning that taking these six Man-Eater Shells out nets a great 12,000 Souls in no time at all. That being said, players should still be wary every time they farm and only bait these enemies one at a time since they're pretty durable, and trying to take down multiple enemies at once is more trouble than it's worth.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Firelink Shrine
  </strong>
  is one of the earliest areas in the game and acts like a central hub where most of the NPCs go after players convince them to travel there. This area is also good for soul farming early on in the game, especially for those who are new. There are easy-to-kill undead enemies here that players can use to practice their parrying, which will help them in the future. They can also make things a little easier when they unlock the aqueduct shortcut. Simply run back and forth between the bonfires, and players are good to go.
 </p>
 <p>
  One fairly risky yet lucrative way to get a decent amount of Souls early on is to farm the giant skeleton enemies in the graveyard nearby. Each of these big boney fellows drops 500 Souls and has a low chance of dropping a Murakumo curved greatsword as well. Since this area is so close to a bonfire, there's little trouble to retrieve one's Souls if a giant skeleton or one of their smaller allies defeats the Chosen Undead. It is recommended to use Fire damage or a Strike weapon on them as they have high damage resistance to pretty much every other type of attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  The original Dark Souls' version of the Firelink Shrine is a lot more friendly to players than the Dark Souls 3 version and is also arguably better for farming.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Undead Burg
  </strong>
  is another great opportunity for players to practice their parrying skills but this time on more enemies. Around the primary bonfire in Undead Burg are a bunch of enemies from which to reap Souls. All of these enemies are easy to parry or backstab to get the bonus Souls. If players open up the shortcut to the depths there are even more enemies to run around and kill. Granted, killing all these enemies won't provide very many Souls, but early on, every Soul counts.
 </p>
 <p>
  A remarkably easy and quick way to farm Souls is to use the Hellkite Wyvern as an unexpected ally. Once one finds the occasionally burning bridge where the draconic foe perches above, be sure to unlock the ladder shortcut on the right that leads down to a previously encountered bonfire. Since there are quite a few hollow enemies on this bridge that respawn, poking one's head out on this bridge will trigger the Hellkite Wyvern to unleash its fire breath and immolate all those in its path. Repeatedly using the bonfire and peeking out to trigger this attack can net players hundreds of Souls every minute.

 <p>
  <strong>
   The Depths
  </strong>
  are another great early farming location to get those extra Souls needed to get stronger. Once players get to the bonfire, simply run out and kill all the oozes, then take a turn down the stairs to slay a large group of rats. This is an extremely easy area to farm, especially if they are a spellcaster. All the rats also have a chance to drop humanity which is always useful, even for a seasoned
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  veteran. Even if players end up getting poisoned, the nearby bonfire can quickly remove it, leading to the Chosen Undead rarely dying with this method. Just don't get careless.
 </p>
 <p>
  The inky, black slimes that try to ambush the player from above rightly deserve the worst kind of death. Therefore, one should utilize their weakness to Fire damage when farming these sludge-like adversaries. It is much more worth it to focus on the slimes instead of the rats, as the former drops 100 Souls and the latter only 20. If one does not have pyromancies, Firebombs can make farming in the Depths less tedious.

 <p>
  Accessing the
  <strong>
   Darkroot Forest
  </strong>
  requires a few Souls, 20,000 to be exact, but it is worth it. Once players unlock the secret bonfire next to the massive stone door, unlock the door with the Crest of Artorias (which can be bought from Andre of Astora), and on the other side are three NPC enemies to kill. Each of these enemies grants 2,000 Souls and some good practice for PVP fights without being overly difficult. If they do prove to be too tough at the time, players can always bait them off the cliff as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is recommended to tackle each of these foes one at a time, as the abundance of trees makes it difficult to see if one is being snuck up on by another of the Forest Hunter covenant's warriors... that is, if one intends to face them in head-on combat. A far easier method is to draw the attention of these warriors and then head back to the stairs leading to the bonfire. Run up the stairs and then drop down the side, directly next to the cliff. The AI's pathing will take them up the stairs if they are close enough behind the player, but as they follow off the edge of the stairs, they'll most likely tumble down the cliff.

 <p>
  Once players have progressed a little farther into
  <strong>
   Anor Londo
  </strong>
  , they will find themselves at the
  <strong>
   castle
  </strong>
  surrounded by silver knights. These gleaming beauties provide about 1,000 Souls each. There is another great area to practice one's parrying skills since silver knights don't pose much of a challenge and, if necessary, are easily backstabbed. There are also other enemies further down by Smough and Ornstein's boss room, but players may need a homeward bone for that route unless they have the bonfire there as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another type of enemy that there is an abundance of in this area is the bat wing demons (sometimes called "imps"). These ugly, pink fiends grant 500 Souls each and also have a low chance of dropping the Demon's Spear, one of the longest and highest-damaging spears in the game. Despite having wings, these thin demons cannot fly and can be pushed or tricked into falling off the area's many ledges to their demise. Their frailty lets players easily push them around with the shield bash of great shields or even with standard kicks due to the bat wing demons' low poise.
 </p>
 <p>
  That said, even when imps are easily dealt with, this is only true when they come in smaller numbers. If players are not careful and trigger their attacks, others might join in, turning a simple Souls run into a losing battle for survival. The same goes for Silver Knights, so players must time their attacks correctly and ensure that they're not rushing for a backstab.

  In the
  <strong>
   Throne Room
  </strong>
  before the boss fight with Ornstein and Smough, players can fight two Royal Sentinels. These enemies only appear here and nowhere else, and can serve as a great source of Souls. However, they can be really tough to beat, and a melee build might face some issues while fighting this enemy... especially given the annoying archer that's present in this area as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, a mage can help players quickly farm these enemies without any problems. Players need to maintain their distance and pepper this enemy with spells to take them down before they can trigger their healing spell. Doing so efficiently will net players a cool 3,000 Souls per enemy, which is a pretty substantial number indeed.

  Another area of
  <strong>
   The Duke's Archives
  </strong>
  where players can farm souls efficiently is when they drop down and start making their way
  <strong>
   towards the entrance to the Crystal Caves
  </strong>
  . These open areas feature several Crystal Golems that look imposing, but telegraph their attacks quite obviously, making them easy pickings for players who understand how simplistic their attacking patterns really are.
 </p>
 <p>
  Killing all these Crystal Golems nets a decent amount of experience that players can farm over and over again. There are a total of ten Crystal Golems that players can farm before heading to the Crystal Caves, and the fact that they're spaced out pretty far apart makes them a really safe and effective farm indeed.

  <strong>
   The Tomb of the Giants
  </strong>
  is easily one of the most daunting areas to explore in
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  . The trek to the area is pretty challenging as is, and players will be greeted by pitch-black darkness that makes any step a dangerous one to take, unless players have a source of light to make things a little easier for themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once players manage to reach the
  <strong>
   second bonfire
  </strong>
  , they'll find themselves in a lucrative spot where they can farm souls from two Giant Skeletons nearby. These enemies are pretty challenging, but players should be able to take out these foes without breaking into a sweat once they get the hang of it, and they can return over and over until the Chosen Undead dwarfs their enemies in terms of Strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players want to avoid exploring this area in complete darkness, they can get the Sunlight Maggot, which they can wear on their heads like a crown to illuminate the path. This not only makes the area easier and less daunting to explore, but it can also prevent unnecessary deaths by taking one false step. To get the Sunlight Maggot, players can trade the Old Witch's Ring with Snuggly, an NPC located in the Northern Undead Asylum. There are two other light sources in the game: the Skull Lantern, which can be found in the Tomb of the Giants or obtained as a rare drop from necromancers in the Catacombs, and the Cast Light Spell, which can be obtained from Dusk of Oolacile in the Darkroot Basin.

 <p>
  This farming method is best done with Kirk's armor (Thorns set) because of the damage players can cause from rolling. Down in the
  <strong>
   Tomb of the Giants
  </strong>
  , players will find Nito's boss room, but that isn't what we care about.
  <strong>
   Right before the boss door
  </strong>
  is a room where tons of baby skeletons will spawn. That is the enemy they are looking for. These baby skeletons die fast and offer about 120 Souls each. That can quickly add up after a short while given that these little buggers spawn infinitely.
 </p>
 <p>
  As with other skeletal enemies, these creepy dead babies are weak to Strike and Fire-type damage, though be warned that due to their small stature, it is easy to completely miss them while attacking with some weapons. Pyromancies and Firebombs will be helpful here. Since the Covetous Silver Serpent Ring can be found in this area, it is recommended to grab it despite the ambush that awaits the player after they pick it up. This ring grants a 20% boost to Souls gained from killing enemies, making it incredibly useful for Soul farming.

  <strong>
   The Kiln of the First Flame
  </strong>
  is the end of a
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  run, which is unfortunate because it is a good area to get some Soul farming done. This area has a group of black knights that can net players a solid 10,000 Souls per run. Like the silver knights, they are rather easy to kill with parrying or backstabbing. Players just need to set up their spawn location in the area and use a homeward bone each time they finish off the enemies. Just be careful not to progress through the fog wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  It should be mentioned that every single one of a black knight's attacks can be parried except their shield bash (which is easy to see coming). Slaying them with a riposte will also grant more souls. Since this is the last area in the game, players will have had a chance to acquire both the Covetous Silver Serpent Ring as well as the Symbol of Avarice helmet, which, when stacked, boosts Souls gain rate by a massive 44%.

  The
  <strong>
   Demon Ruins
  </strong>
  is one of the most reviled areas in
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , featuring torrid copy-paste design and uninteresting levels which make it clear that FromSoft had run out of money while developing the second half of
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  . This area has its fair share of unique enemies to farm for Souls, with a surprising mention coming in the form of the Egg Bearers, and the Larva that come out of them if they aren't killed with fire.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Overkill mechanic, players can maximize the Souls they get from this weird enemy, with the trek to and from
  <strong>
   the first bonfire
  </strong>
  being forgivingly short. It may not be the most effective way to gain Souls, but some players may argue that it's the safest and most simple way for players to acquire a decent amount of the resource.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since this area is so uncomfortable to traverse, it's understandable that many players want to go through it as quickly as possible. In all honesty, there are better areas for farming that are much less inconvenient to explore, but if players want to visit every spot on this list, patience is advised for this one in particular.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Demon Ruins
  </strong>
  are a great place to gather a few extra souls if players want to venture around the hellish landscape. Nearby the second bonfire of the area is a group of Taurus Demons. These ugly brutes will provide 3,000 souls each. Plus, at that point in the game, they are pretty easy to kill. There are also Capra Demons in the area that will reward players with a little over 1,000 souls each. Players can quickly gather souls in this area, especially if they are a magic-user.
 </p>
 <p>
  These demonic foes can be defeated much like their boss counterparts from earlier in the game. Using a bow and some arrows to lure them out one at a time can make farming them a bit easier. Just be wary of the lava in this area, as even though one should be able to take these demons out fairly easily in one-on-one duels, their attacks can still push a player to their burning death if blocked while near a pool of lava.

 <p>
  To farm here, there are a few necessary steps. Return to the Asylum from the start of the game and return to the playable character's cell. Inside, players will find a strange doll. Take this doll to the massive cathedral in Anor Londo and they will be able to enter The
  <strong>
   Painted World of Ariamis
  </strong>
  . Once there, they'll want to traverse through the area until they find the Phalanx. These enemies are piles of goo with spears and shields that can be a bit annoying if players aren't used to them. Equip a weapon, preferably with lightning damage, and go to town on them. They can easily net players 10,000 souls each time they farm them. By far, the best area to farm souls in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, they are even weaker to Fire damage, so pyromancies and Firebombs once more can be very useful here. The Phalanx's 13 individual amorphous bodies will constantly try to poke the player to death, so be sure to utilize hit-and-run tactics if one is taking them on in a melee fight. Since they are very slow and don't leave their formation, the bigger, slower pyromancies can absolutely devastate them. In addition, immolating over a dozen enemies simultaneously with a single Chaos Storm's direct Fire damage, as well as the pools of lava it leaves behind, is immensely satisfying.

  The
  <em>
   Artorias of the Abyss
  </em>
  DLC is one of the best content packs released for any game, period. Not only does it have some great lore and bosses, but the areas present in the DLC are great for exploration and farming purposes as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  The twisted Bloatheads here are easy to kill and drop a decent amount of experience. Finding a decent bonfire in the
  <strong>
   Oolacile Township
  </strong>
  and quickly killing enemies around it over and over again is a great way to get a ton of experience in a very short amount of time.

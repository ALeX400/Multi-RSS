 <p>
  Rockstar Games has released a new weekly update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto Online
   </em>
  </strong>
  , adding six new vehicles to the game as part of continued content for the live service title's Money Fronts update, which launched last week. Ever since its release in 2013,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  has received a steady stream of new content updates to keep players busy, and its latest one has given fans even more ways to spend their in-game money.

  Every Thursday,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  receives a new weekly update. The contents of these updates vary, but fans can usually expect to find various discounts, event challenges, bonuses, and more. Between June 26 and July 2, for example, there are 2x GTA$ and RP on various different missions, including the new Higgins Helitours Money Laundering missions, Dispatch Work, Junk Energy Skydives, and more. Those who are subscribed to Rockstar Games' controversial GTA+ service will receive even more bonuses and benefits, with Higgins Helitours Money Laundering missions granting subscribers 4x the amount of GTA$ and RP instead of 2x.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last week, Rockstar Games released the highly anticipated Money Fronts update for
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  . The free content update brought some brand-new businesses to the game, which allows players to launder their illegitimate money through a completely legitimate business. Rockstar also released plenty of new vehicles in the update, but now it has deployed even more as part of a new weekly update for June 26. All of the vehicles range in price, with the cheapest addition being the Declasse Walton L35 Stock, which can be obtained from Souther San Andreas Super Autos for $1,303,700. Check out the full list of new vehicles below (thanks, RockstarIntel).

  Although
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  receives new updates weekly, any significant content updates are often released in the Summer and the Winter. With Money Fronts now available in-game, fans are patiently waiting to see what Rockstar has in store for
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  's Winter update. While it may still be a few months away, data miners recently uncovered in-game files that suggest purchasable mansions may be coming to
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  later this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Prior to the disappointing delay of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  , fans were expecting the recent Money Fronts update to be
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  's last major patch. However, with the highly anticipated title now set to launch on May 26, 2026, it looks like there will likely be one more significant update later this year. While the contents have yet to be confirmed by Rockstar Games, a recent leaks suggest players will finally be able to buy their own mansions. Something that has been highly requested for many years.

   <em>

  brings the vast, dangerous world of Arrakis into the survival MMO space, where players are required to navigate politics, brutal sandstorms, and the ever-present threat of sandworms. Apart from its striking visuals and massive scale, the game's soundscape plays a pivotal role in making its world feel as alive and unforgiving as it is.
  <em>

  's soundtrack, especially, stands out not just for how it accompanies players on their journey, but for how it gives Arrakis its own voice.

  </em>
  , about how he approached the challenge of scoring such an iconic world. During the interview, he opened up about his creative process, his early start on the project, and the delicate balance between creating something original while still honoring what most
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  fans might expect from it.

  <strong>
   Q: What were the core themes or emotions you wanted to evoke in your score to reflect the "depth and mystery of the lore, as well as the haunting majesty of Arrakis," as you mentioned in the soundtrack release?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I think it's not so easy to pinpoint exactly what they are. It's more my feeling of what Arrakis is. If Arrakis had a voice, or if Arrakis could make music, that's what I was after and what I'm meant to or try to explain with that comment. It's the feeling I get when I see the art, when I play the game, and the small parts that I have played. It's not concrete, it's just a feeling. I feel that it's warm, it's sandy, also in the air, it's filled with sand. It's connected to the mystery, the mystery of the Fremen, and there is a sadness about it. The Fremen are missing. There is something that has been lost. Arrakis wasn't always a sand planet. There are elements of all these things.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the things I tried to do was to give Arrakis a voice and make it into a character in the game. So, I worked a lot developing a musical language or what I usually refer to as "conceptualizing." When I start to score, I conceptualize. You have all the different musical genres in the world from different time periods, and the same with instruments, and I try to find things that give me the right associations and then combine them. And this is very instinctual.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the difficult thing is to make all of these things fit together, because they are normally not used together. It's difficult to put all of these elements together in a way that makes sense, and also sounds inevitable. Of course, this is
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  music. This is the sound of Arrakis. Obviously, no one questions that. That's the challenge. That's what's difficult. The questions you have to ask yourself to get to that point—it's difficult to define what they are or exactly what your associations were. At some point, this is how you feel it should sound.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's also about the musical language. It's not only about the choice of instruments and styles, it's what kind of melodies you write. Are they influenced by maybe some Chinese type of music or Arabic type of music? Maybe you hear a little bit of many things, but you develop a musical language that you can express yourself through. But this process is very important. It's the most important thing you do in the whole video game score, because when you have established this identity, this language, then everything you write is expressed through this language. If you don't do it, the score will sound very fragmented, and it will also not have an identity.
 </p>
 <p>
  You want it to be memorable and identifiable. First of all, identifiable, and then secondly, memorable. If you can make it iconic, fantastic. You know to make it as special and unique, and as good as possible. You basically make most of these choices in the beginning, before you even write any music. So, when you hear all the music, when everything is finished, it should sound like one long piece of music with different chapters, like almost a symphony with different movements. It should all sound consistent and homogeneous.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: And are you a
   <em>
    Dune
   </em>
   fan yourself?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  Well, I have become one. And I have to admit that the time when they approached me was actually quite a long time ago. It was before the first of the new movies was out. I think it was 2020 when I started. So, at that time, my knowledge of the universe was the David Lynch film from '84 or whatever it was. And I was vaguely familiar with some of the
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  games that had come out through the years, but I never really played them very much. I just knew of them. I tried them a little bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  And I knew about the failed Jodorowsky
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  project. I watched the documentary, and it was very fascinating. I would have loved to see Giger designing the Harkonnen and see how that would have turned out, but it was an impossible dream for that to become a movie. That was my knowledge of the universe, and when they approached me, I started reading the books. It was very important, I think, because it allowed me to dive deep into the world and to familiarize myself with it. That would allow me to go deeper with the music and avoid the music becoming superficial.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's a lot of reading to get to that point where it actually affects what you do with the music. There is no kind of direct relation there, but with all that information, it does affect you. It does make you think differently about certain things, and when there are choices, you think, "No, this would be more appropriate because of so-and-so." So yeah, I read them, but before, no, I was pretty green to the whole
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  universe.

  <strong>
   Q: Speaking of the timing of all this, with you being approached before the movies came out, did you honor Zimmer at all in your work, and if so, how did you balance your own identity with what he did?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  So, this is an interesting question because, first of all, I started before, so I had to develop an identity, like we talked about, the concept, I had to develop it before any of us had heard the music from the films. So then, I was quite nervous before I listened to the music for the first time, because if it was too far removed from what Zimmer was doing, people would say — well, Funcom included and Legendary and Tencent, they would all say, "No, this doesn't sound like
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  music anymore." Luckily, I wasn't too far away from what he had chosen to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  fans will obviously have watched the
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  movies before they play this game, so they will think the same. "This is not
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  music," if it were too different. So, luckily, it wasn't too far away and that's also a good thing. You're saying there is a balance, and you absolutely cannot get too close because then it's plagiarism, and you're copying someone. If you go too far away, it's no longer
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  music, so you have to find a balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  To be honest, I can see that, in some places, my music is closer, more similar, and in other places it's more different, and I think many things are very different. I do a lot of sound design, and there is a lot of treatment of sounds, like acoustic instruments which I manipulate the sounds and process the sounds. I also do the same with the synthesizer sounds. There's a lot of layering, both of synthetic sounds and live sounds with synthesizers. I combine them to create new sounds, things like that. There's a lot of that, and Hans Zimmer also does a lot of that.
 </p>
 <p>
  I use a lot of arpeggiators and the way I use the synthesizers, a lot of it is quite old school. It's what you would find Jean-Michel Jarre or maybe Tangerine Dream more than any. They did these things in the 70s, and you also saw it in the 80s. So, some parts of the soundtrack are quite vintage in terms of the synthesizer sound, and I'm using instruments that have a lot of that character, because I love them. I think it sounds so visceral and real, it's so imperfect. And it's never the same, it always changes. It feels like a real instrument, and I like that. It has a lot of texture, and I just love it. It just makes me happy to listen to it. I think it's so pleasing to listen to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another thing I think sets me apart from the scores of the films is that I use a lot of melody. I write very long melodies. There are melodies in
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  that go on for a minute, long melodic lines in the strings, for example, or in the vocals, which are quite different from what you will hear in the movies. There are lots of motifs, but you don't hear the same long melodies. Also, I put the orchestra a bit more front and center, to emphasize that the celli in the orchestra play these long lines, and I wanted to be able to hear that clearly. The same with the soloists, like the singers.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, there is a balance there. It needs to sound contemporary and modern, and progressive, and not old school. I didn't want it to sound old-fashioned, and there is a balance there as well. If you do too much of the orchestra, suddenly it sounds old-fashioned, and it doesn't work so well anymore. So, it's all about finding the right balance where it still has that contemporary feeling. But I was still able to use the orchestra to play these very expressive lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  In extension of that, I would like to say that melodic writing, I do it as much as I can, and I've always liked it very much. I think there's a lot of focus on ambient scoring nowadays. In video games, you have to make a lot of ambient music. It's just the nature of the medium. But also in films, good films, they usually have a very strong theme, obviously. They've probably gone hundreds of rounds with that theme before everyone is happy with it. They usually have strong themes, and many films have good melodies, and they use melody more frequently, but there is still an emphasis on ambient scoring.
 </p>
 <p>
  I think there are missed opportunities for melodic writing because melody can convey something difficult to say only with the soundscapes and ambience. Melody is in many ways a story, and I like to tell stories with the music. Of course, the most important function of music is to support the narrative of the film or the video game. Many times, I think you do that best if you are able to write melody as well. So, I really try to do that as much as possible, as long as it doesn't get in the way of anything, as long as I feel that it only benefits the narrative, and it doesn't take up too much space.

  <strong>
   Q: Speaking of that, one of my personal favorite things about the score is that you do a lot with so little. There's a lot that you communicate with so little, and it's very minimalistic. There's a lot of restraint at times. How did you balance that simplicity with the scale and size of not just the game, but of Arrakis itself?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I don't think they are contradictions, actually. If you want to translate scale into music, it's about something that is slowly moving, and also something that spreads across the frequency spectrum from the deepest bass to the highest frequencies. Then you feel it's big. So, you don't necessarily need so many instruments. You're right, there are many places where there might only be strings. Maybe strings with a synthesizer in the background or something. Maybe two or three elements, it's true.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a cliche that "less is more," but it's a cliche because it's true. And it's especially true when it comes to video games and films, because you are always there supporting something else, you're part of something else. It's not music that is written to be listened to alone. It's written to accompany something else, and it can very quickly become too much.
 </p>
 <p>
  I noticed this when I started working more than 25 years ago with video games. In the first years, I worked on games that were never released, but in the beginning, I wrote combat music or fighting music that was very busy. Of course, if there is a boss fight, I still do that, but the small fights, the kind of casual fighting that goes on all the time, I did very much. I thought that it was fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  But then I played
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  , and it was very similar to a game that I worked on at the time, which was
  <em>
   Age of Conan
  </em>
  . I remember how little music there was for the combat sequence, and I thought it worked a lot better because it creates the kind of tension that you need, but that's basically what you need. You just need to raise the tension level a little bit. It's a thing that everyone struggles with. You always think when you get into this line of work that you need to do a lot. Also, people are paying for your work, and especially in the beginning, you feel you need to give them their money's worth. So, you kind of do more than you have to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, maybe you are working with someone who doesn't understand this concept. They will see it when you try it out in the game, but many times there is no game. The game comes later. I usually write most of the music before there is a game. They are working with all kinds of tools that they're going to implement in the game, but the game, as it looks when it's finished, comes very late. If you work with someone who cannot see how the music works in the game, they will also think it's too little. It's a bit of a problem, but it's usually better to hold back and be a bit careful. It's much more efficient.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Regarding the tension, that's one of the main things to me about the
   <em>
    Dune: Awakening
   </em>
   score is the tension that it creates. The sandworm theme, anytime the sandworm comes out of the ground or whenever you go out into the open sand, and you just get that explosive synth, that's one of the most unsettling parts of the game for me and I know a lot of other players. How did you approach that?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I actually made three different themes for the sandworm in
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  . So, there is one where there is a choir, and there is a distorted sound when it comes up. It's like the music also grows out of the ground in a way. So, that's kind of the intention behind that. It just needed to be really big and intense.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then there is a more threatening theme that's going on when the worm is coming towards you. Then there is a cue that is supposed to start playing at the first sign of the worm. It's very rhythmic and has a lot of percussive synthesizer sounds. To be 100% honest, I am not sure if that is even there. But I made three different themes, and I know I've heard the other two.

   Q: Was there a particular sequence or track that you enjoyed working on the most, or that you feel best captures Arrakis and that
   <em>
    Dune
   </em>
   feeling?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  It's very difficult for me to name specific tracks that are my favorites. Of course, I have some favorites, and I think some tracks were more fun to write, and I felt they came together better when I wrote them. Some tracks, I like them because of how they ended up sounding in the end. Maybe surprisingly, they turned out better than I had hoped for. There is something that can be said about most of the tracks that I like, which was the reason why I wrote them in the first place. So, I like all the tracks more or less, with a few exceptions.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is another thing. The album is 90 minutes, but in the game, there are more than five hours of music. Cutting down the duration of the album was difficult, only 90 minutes when there is so much music. But if we focus on the music that is on the album, I remember the first time I heard Clara, the vocalist, when she sent me the recordings for the song that's now called "Sayyadina's Lament." And the first time I heard that, I thought, "Wow, that is so much better than what I could have hoped for."
 </p>
 <p>
  It just came to life, and it's so organic, and it's kind of floating, and you cannot really place the rhythm. It's just as if she's speaking, and it transcends the boundaries of the written music. You cannot really write it down because it goes across the bar lines, and the durations are not mathematical. It just flows very organically. She has this dynamic which is also difficult to notate. The swelling and the difference between the very soft whispering notes and the more pronounced notes. It just sounded like it came from another place. It just transcended what I had written, and it elevated the music in a way that I would never have imagined.
 </p>
 <p>
  I also have to say that the orchestra is so brilliant, it's so good. Everything they played came out exactly as I intended, only better, and that's how it's supposed to sound if you record something. You want them to do what you wrote, but then they make it better. So, I was extremely happy with the orchestra and what they did. Also, when we were there, I knew that they were fast, so I had prepared much more music than we planned on recording. And we ended up recording everything. They recorded 50% more than we anticipated because they are so experienced, so efficient, and so good. That was a fantastic experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, we talked about how the music is a kind of mix and match of a lot of different elements, stylistic elements, and instruments. The track "Welcome to Arrakis," I was very pleased to hear how all of that came together because it's an orchestra. There is a band, a drum kit, an electric bass, and there are synthesizers — there are so many things going on. All of this came together, and it made sense, and it felt like one coherent song.

  <strong>
   Q: So, how does this compare to your past work as far as what you've put together for
   <em>
    Dune: Awakening
   </em>
   ?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  First of all, this is very different from most of the work I've done before. I've touched on this way of writing before, but I've never done a big game like this. That said, I've always been a huge fan of synthesizer music and synthesizers, and it's maybe the first kind of music that I really liked and that I listened to very much. So, I went back to my roots in some ways to make the score, so it's not a new thing for me. It's not something that I've never done before.
 </p>
 <p>
  I've always had synthesizers. I've always worked with synthesizers and played in bands and things like that, but it was different to work like this, and there were many things that I hadn't done before. But, of course, I have to say that on this project, we were able to do things at the highest quality — the best studio, the best musicians, the best orchestra, the best people in the studio, and the best people to help with preparations and the post work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every part of the production was top, and it makes a huge difference, and you can hear it in the result. It's very solid. I'm not complaining about other orchestras or other studios or anything like that. It's just very streamlined when you work in London, and it helps the process. It makes it easier for you as a composer. It also became much more important for me to focus on mix and production, because it's such an integral part of this way of composing music for a video game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Previously, I felt in many ways that my part ended with me delivering the orchestrations and being in the studio and guiding them to perform it in the best possible way. That was kind of the end of my contribution. But now, my contribution also involved being very close to the mix process with the mix engineer, and also all the preparations made it different. Also, the way we recorded, we recorded the orchestra in elements according to the needs of the particular piece.
 </p>
 <p>
  For every piece, I went through them and wrote into the score notes on what needed to be recorded separately or in a unique way. In the case of "Welcome to Arrakis," it's actually two orchestras playing because we needed more instruments, so we recorded on top of each other. All of that planning and the focus on production techniques eventually give you other results. You need to be hands-on the whole way, and it feels very solid, the end result.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some previous times, it felt like an orchestra recorded in a hall, more like a classical performance in a way. Nothing wrong with that, but it's a very different sound, a very different feeling. So, the production is vastly different from what I have done before. There are definitely examples of times when it has been somewhere in the middle of the kind of pure orchestral thing and what
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  became. There are some scores that are in the middle there somewhere, and they also sound very good. It is such a big focus on the production that I had never done before.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Are you hoping to work more on the
   <em>
    Dune
   </em>
   universe in the future?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  Of course, that would be super fun if I got the opportunity to work more on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: And I'm assuming you'll continue to work with Funcom as they expand the game?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  Yeah, we haven't started talking about that yet, and I know nothing about any plans for the time to come. The release was not long ago, and the work doesn't really stop there, so it hasn't really stopped for me either. There are always some things to relate to, so I don't think anyone has really landed properly yet. I guess in the fall, people will start thinking more about what's next. We'll see then, I guess.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: What do you really hope players, fans, and anyone who hears the soundtrack will walk away with in terms of how the soundtrack relates to the gaming experience or how it impacts them?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A:
  </strong>
  I think there are two things that I hope for. One is that the players think the music works really well with the game and that they don't turn off the music, at least not until they have played it for a very long time. That's my hope. I actually heard some very good news from Funcom about
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  . They said that they had been told by many players who played it for 150 and 100 hours that they still played with the music on. And that is a really, really great compliment because that's what you want. You want the music to be part of the experience. And if the players keep the music, that means that it really works.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, that's my first ambition, and the second ambition is that the music also works on its own terms. We talked about how it's simple, and it's kind of less is more and all of these things, but I still like to write music that feels like music or is entertaining, and music that gives you something when you listen to it, even without the game. In this case, it's kind of a mix between the orchestra and synthesizers, but as a video game soundtrack, I really hope that people will like the music for what it is.

      <title>Xbox Game Pass Adds Day One Game and 3 Classic Blizzard Titles</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-against-the-storm-warcraft-remastered-reforged/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  June has been a great month for
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  members, and the subscription service is closing out the month with day-one title
  <em>
   Against the Storm
  </em>
  and the remastered versions of three
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  games. Xbox Game Pass offers a little something for most gamers, with four tiers to choose from. The Core package includes a curated catalog of 25 games that are regularly rotated out so the selection stays fresh.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <p>
  The Standard tier of Xbox Game Pass provides subscribers with access to a selection of hundreds of games, while the PC and Ultimate tiers offer the same, as well as an EA Play membership and the ability to play some titles as soon as they are released. All the tiers of an Xbox Game Pass subscription include online multiplayer and frequent discounts on games, DLC, and in-game items.
 </p>
 <p>
  The latest games added to Xbox Game Pass in June 2025 are Eremite Games’ dark fantasy city builder
  <em>
   Against the Storm,
  </em>
  which is already on PC Game Pass. On June 26, it launched on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox Cloud Gaming and was immediately accessible to Ultimate subscribers. Additionally, the remastered versions of the three original
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  games by Blizzard Entertainment are all joining the Game Pass catalog for PC and Ultimate members. These three titles were only released on PC and are therefore not playable on console.

  <em>
   Against the Storm
  </em>
  is a dark fantasy roguelite city builder that originally launched in December 2023 and received praise across the board. It is currently sitting at a 91 critic score on OpenCritic and an overall Overwhelmingly Positive review rating on Steam. Though it has a somewhat steep learning curve, many fans of the genre find the effort well worth it, as
  <em>
   Against the Storm
  </em>
  offers an addictive gameplay loop, a steady progression system, fun challenges, and of course base-building, all packaged in a charming setting.

  The enhanced versions of
  <em>
   Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness
  </em>
  were both released in November 2024. The remastered version of the third game
  <em>
  </em>
  came out in January 2020, and though it was embroiled in some controversy upon release, many thought that re-launching
  <em>
   Warcraft 3: Reforged
  </em>
  on Xbox Game Pass would be a good way to breathe new life into the poorly regarded game. People who perhaps didn’t buy it upon release due to the negative reviews might be willing to give it a chance if it is offered through the subscription service. And in the time since launch, Blizzard has continued to patch and update
  <em>
   Warcraft 3: Reforged
  </em>
  , with the latest build dating to April 2025.

  The Tycoon Express is centered around a grand train journey, where you upgrade from a basic cabin to a more luxurious one by earning Express Coins in

  players are always on the lookout for the next big event, and the Tycoon Express has quickly become a fan favorite. This seasonal feature offers a unique progression system, rewarding dedicated players with exclusive cosmetics like shield skins, profile frames, and dice skins.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next season of Tycoon Express in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  is going to start shortly after the current Star Wars GO album concludes. Each Tycoon Express season is designed to correspond with the ongoing sticker album.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Star Wars GO album is scheduled to run from May 20th to July 2nd, 2025. As such, the
  <strong>
   new Tycoon Express season will most likely commence right after July 2nd, 2025, aligning with the start of the new album.

 <p>
  To progress in the new Tycoon Express season in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , you need to earn Express Coins.
  <strong>
   You can get Express Coins by playing in the leaderboard tournaments that run for 1-2 days.
  </strong>
  Your placement on the tournament leaderboard directly correlates with the number of Express Coins you receive. The higher you rank, the more coins you'll earn.
 </p>
 <p>
  As you play in tournaments and earn coins, they will be automatically added to your Tycoon Express progress bar. Each class or cabin upgrade requires a specific number of Express Coins.

 <p>
  The Arbitrators of the Adeptus Arbites have arrived in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Warhammer 40K: Darktide
   </strong>
  </em>
  , and with them comes the long reach of the Lex Imperialis. These enforcers are frighteningly good at close-quarters combat, making them an excellent choice for players who want to play as a tanky frontline fighter.

 <p>
  There are multiple ways to build an Arbitrator in
  <em>
   Darktide
  </em>
  , and if you're looking for something simple but effective, then going the full melee route might be the best thing to do. This guide is for those who want to get into the thick of combat and dispense brutal justice upon the hordes of traitors and heretics in Tertium.

  Key Skills
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Voltaic Shock Mine (Blitz)
   </strong>
   - Useful for stopping hordes and reviving teammates.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Breaking Dissent (Aura)
   </strong>
   - Increases damage vs Staggered.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Lone Wolf (Keystone)
   </strong>
   - Removes your dog, but buffs your stats.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Break the Line (Ability)
   </strong>
   - Charge forward and knock everything down.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Terminus Warrant
   </strong>
   - Dealing melee damage grants stacks that boost ranged attacks and vice versa.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The images above show the
  <strong>
   bare minimum skills you need to get this melee Arbitrator build going
  </strong>
  . We'll be leaving our lovely dog behind in favor of bonus stats and an overall easier/simpler playstyle. Instead of micromanaging the Cyber Mastiff, we're just going to charge at the enemy and introduce their faces to our Shock Maul
  <strong>
   buffed by the Lone Wolf skill
  </strong>
  . Carapace armor is going to be a bit of a problem, but not so much that they'd make the build unusable in high difficulties.
 </p>

  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_8">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Spend your remaining skill points on what you think you need based on your playstyle. Although, we do recommend taking more skills on the right hand side of the skill tree, as they'll give you better melee damage.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  To summarize, the build does the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Increases damage and Impact
  </li>
  <li>
   Increases damage against Staggered and Suppressed enemies
  </li>
  <li>
   Increases survivability through bonus health and Toughness
  </li>
  <li>
   Provides excellent emergency crowd control via the Shock Mine
  </li>
  <li>
   Greatly increase the crit chance and weakspot damage of ranged weapons
  </li>
  <li>
   Greatly increases the damage, Impact, and attack speed of melee weapons
  </li>
  <li>
   Increases damage dealt to Ogryns and enemies above 75% health
  </li>
 </ul>

  This build's primary weapon will be the
  <strong>
   Shock Maul and Suppressor Shield
  </strong>
  . Not only does it give you
  <strong>
   protection from ranged attacks
  </strong>
  , but it is also
  <strong>
   insanely good at controlling crowds thanks to its Special ability
  </strong>
  , which stuns and suppresses all enemies in a large area in front of you when used.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Hammerblow
  </strong>
  increases your weapon's Impact, making it easier to stagger or knock enemies down. Meanwhile,
  <strong>
   High Voltage
  </strong>
  makes your Shock Maul deal more damage versus electrocuted enemies. Refine your Shock Maul with Damage (Maniacs) and Damage (Flak Armor) to
  <strong>
   better deal with Scab and Dreg Ragers
  </strong>
  (they'll die in four hits or so on Auric difficulty).

 <p>
  As for ranged weapons, you have two options:
  <strong>
   the Bolt Pistol and the Zarona Stub Revolver
  </strong>
  . These do the same job — take out
  <strong>
   ranged Elites and Specialists
  </strong>
  in one or two shots. Arbitrators have relatively low mobility, and without their dog or Break the Line, they'll be vulnerable to
  <strong>
   Machine Gunners, Snipers, and regular shooters
  </strong>
  , but if you play like an Ogryn, you'll be fine. These weapons will help you deal with those guys efficiently (except for the shooters since they're too many and you likely won't have enough ammo for all of them).

    <p>
     Bolt Pistols with 500 damage, Flak Armor and Unarmored damage bonuses, and stacks of Terminus Warrant with the Writ of Judgment skill can
     <strong>
      kill Auric-level Dreg and Scab Gunners with one non-critical shot to the face
     </strong>
     . They can also kill Crushers with a full magazine to the body.

 <p>
  If you're having trouble with Monstrosities like Plague Ogryns,
  <strong>
   use a Boltgun
  </strong>
  . However, since it's incredibly slow to draw, you won't be able to use it in the thick of combat. Still, with the right Blessings, it can deal significant damage to bosses with just one clip, especially if you've stacked your
  <strong>
   Terminus Warrant Capstone skill
  </strong>
  .

  fans have pointed out a weird issue with the benches in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends: Z-A
   </strong>
  </em>
  . The odd find has players making jokes and theorizing about the plot as they await further details about
  <em>

  </em>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  recently got its first real glimpse of story and gameplay in the form of February's Pokemon Presents. While brief, a teaser showed off the new starters for
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , detailed some new NPCs and groups, and gave a basic idea of what players could expect from the story. However, with a release window of late 2025, there's still a lot to be uncovered, and players have been poring over the teaser in an attempt to figure out more.

  fan projectmars pointed out something about the benches seen in Lumiose City in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , noting that the design of them is very similar to so-called anti-homeless benches found in some real world cities. The bench has two bars set in the center of it, which are presumably there to act as dividers to separate those who are sitting on the bench, providing an arm rest and giving a sense of separation from any strangers one might be sitting next to. However, these bars also prevent anyone from lying comfortably across the length of the bench, which is why these obstructions are sometimes placed on real-world benches.

 <p>
  Players have been musing about the benches since projectmars brought them to the community's attention. Some have theorized that they're just arm rests, or that if they're intended to prevent anything in particular, it may be to prevent giant or heavy Pokemon like Snorlax from sitting on and crushing the bench. Others have joked that the only "homeless" person in the games that would be impacted by something like this would have been
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  's AZ, who is now running Hotel Z in the upcoming game.

  While it's likely that the bench is just an aesthetic decision with no real reason for its bars otherwise, some have mused about the plot of the game and how it could be connected. Players are apparently suspicious of the new Quasartico Inc. that's behind the urban redevelopment of Lumiose City. Fans have suggested that perhaps they will turn out to be the villain of the game, and that their efforts to improve the city aren't as straightforward and honest as they're made out to be. Of course, this is pure speculation at this point, but it's clear that The Pokemon Company has gotten fans curious after its latest teaser.

  As a farming simulator, the seasons are incredibly important in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stardew Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Even setting aside growing periods, the game tracks NPC birthdays, festivals, and wild berry seasons. You'll need to keep an eye on these dates to see everything

  has to offer.

  sells a calendar at her shop for 2,000g. However, both calendars only show the current season, and they don't show birthdays for NPCs you haven't met yet or special foraging times like salmonberry season and blackberry season. This guide will fill in these gaps with the complete calendar, along with some helpful tips for new players.

    Updated by Usama Ali on Feb 27, 2025:
   </strong>
   In addition to all the new items and a new farm layout, Stardew Valleyâ€™s 1.6 update added a bunch of new events and festivals to the game as well. This means that the calendar just got a whole lot busier and more interesting. The festivals, in particular, offer new opportunities to interact with villagers, participate in fun mini-games, and earn valuable rewards. Nonetheless, players now have more reasons to check the calendar regularly and plan their activities accordingly. This guide has been updated to reflect the exciting new additions to the Stardew Valley calendar brought by the 1.6 update.

  Goro Majima, also commonly known as the Mad Dog by many characters in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Yakuza
   </em>
  </strong>
  series, may be well known for being a lethal fighter, but he's also an infamous trash-talker who loves nothing more than talking down to his opponents. Considering Majima has no filter when it comes to his speech, this ex-Yakuza is more than happy to say anything that's on his mind, no matter how outlandish or bizarre it might be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, when Majima wants to, he can also let out a pretty meaningful or even inspirational line now and again for fans to think about. Needless to say, this guy has had plenty of memorable quotes throughout the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series, and with Majima assuming the role of protagonist in
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  , it seems like the perfect time to reflect on the Mad Dog's many wise words over the years.

  After Majima earns the position of pirate captain near the beginning of the latest game, Noah, his newfound companion, asks him what he will do if his memories ever return while he's still a pirate. In an oddly thought-provoking response, Majima comments that the Yakuza and pirates aren't all that different, considering they both partake in killing, stealing, and plenty of other immoral acts.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, it also reminds players that, though Majima may seem a little goofier for his new adventure, he still has that merciless attitude that was born out of his time as a Yakuza. Majima provides some intriguing commentary on the Yakuza with this quote, while also embracing his new position as a captain of his own pirate crew.

  When Kiryu finds Majima at roughly the mid-point of
  <em>
   Infinite Wealth's
  </em>
  story, he finds that the Mad Dog, along with Saejima and Daigo, are in a pretty rough spot. With the group being cast out of society and forced to live in the middle of nowhere, the trio have a quick catch up with Kiryu, until eventually, Majima's itch for violence gets the better of him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Majima tries to provoke Kiryu in the only way he knows how, by saying in a nonchalant manner that the two should "throw a few punches", just like they would do as youngsters. Though it's certainly a pretty funny way to ask someone for a fight, it also makes fans realize just how much these two have grown, and that, despite their age, it's never too late for them to throw down one final time.

  While there are a ton of iconic Majima moments throughout the series, one that all longtime fans will remember is when the ex-Yakuza decided to start up his own construction business. During a rallying cry to his small pool of employees, Majima exposes that he really has no idea what he's doing when admitting that he's been relying on the internet to even get this new business off the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Majima's entire speech is packed full of hilarious quips and one-liners, but this line stands out for how well it showcases Majima's naivety. Though he may have lofty ambitions, he tends to go about achieving them in the wrong way, resulting in comical lines such as this one.

  Majima says this specific quote during
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  , after he barrels a truck into the side of a building and proceeds to take a hostage. After the woman turns down his advances, admitting she has a boyfriend, Majima, in an unusually somber moment for the Mad Dog, admits that he greatly appreciates honest people, which feeds into his entire persona of being fully open about anything and everything.
 </p>
 <p>
  While a simple quote, it's very important for highlighting that, underneath the bloodthirsty exterior, Majima still has a vague sense of morals that he believes in. It also calls back to his time as a Yakuza, where lying was a common practice among Majima's colleagues.

  It's not often that Majima is the one to give Kiryu a pep talk, but during
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  , there's a moment where he provides the Dragon of Dojima with a glimpse into his bleak view of the world, and more specifically, his lack of care for what the world thinks of him. Majma explains that having a "point" to justify every action will eventually end up breaking Kiryu if he's not careful, which is ultimately what contributed to Majima's own madness.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is probably the closest to a heart-to-heart Kiryu and Majima ever have in the early games, and it's an eerie reminder that, considering how little Majima cares about the consequences of his actions, he's got no problem causing as much chaos as possible.

  When Majima wakes up at the beginning of
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  , he struggles to piece together what happened to him, and more importantly, who he even is. After witnessing a young boy being attacked by pirates, Majima quickly realizes that, despite where he came from, one thing his body and mind simply won't let him do is sit idly while someone else gets hurt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Majima is known for being pretty violent and unpredictable, he has still shown numerous times throughout the games that he is willing to help someone in need if he feels they are being treated unjustly, especially children. Therefore, it's nice to see this character trait shine through at the beginning of his adventure, highlighting just how complex this guy truly is beneath the surface.

  Majima goes through a pretty hellish ordeal when he debuts in
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  . After having been manipulated and disregarded by his boss, Shimano, for much of his time in the Yakuza, and losing a ton of his own friends, and even a romantic partner, throughout the story, he eventually realizes that ideas of right and wrong don't exactly mean all that much in the Yakuza.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, Majima concludes that the only way to move on from his stress, pain, and trauma is to lose his mind completely, birthing the persona many fans are familiar with today. This memorable line stands out for how it manages to convey Majima's personal inner turmoil, while also providing a glimpse into why he decided to let loose in the first place.

 <p>
  Rather than greeting his on and off arch-enemy Kiryu with a simple handshake or hello, Majima instead prefers to scream his name at the top of his lungs any time he catches a glimpse of the legendary former Yakuza member. The first time Majima would say this now iconic line was at the very end of
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  , where he comes face to face with Kiryu, and shouts out his name with a giant grin on his face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since that point on, Majima has screamed out for Kiryu on many occasions, usually when he's trying to fight or stop him in his tracks. Including "chan" at the end of his name, which in Japanese usually refers to someone who is a close friend, is a subtle way to indicate Majima's obsession with Kiryu, which continues right throughout the entire series.

  The team behind
  <em>
   Civilization VII
  </em>
  has already made it clear that
  <strong>
   there'll be plenty of extra
   <em>
    Civ 7
   </em>
   DLC besides just Crossroads of the World and Right to Rule
  </strong>
  . The developers plan to continuously add to the game just as they did with its predecessor, so players can likely expect support for many years to come. If
  <em>
   Civ 6
  </em>
  is anything to go by, there should be a nice mix of paid and free DLC, providing players with plenty of reasons to keep coming back. By the sounds of it, there'll also be a bunch of new features and quality-of-life improvements that weren't quite ready for launch. These include adding teams to multiplayer and providing a wider variety of map types. Following a fan petition, Hotseat multiplayer will also be making a return at some point.

      <title>Overwatch 2 Making Big Changes to Perks</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/overwatch-2-perks-changes-refresh-season-16-buffs-nerfs/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  recently revealed some big plans for Perks in the future, including buffs and nerfs coming in the mid-Season 15 update, some new ones in Season 16, and a major refresh for Season 18. Though Perks only recently arrived in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , it seems Blizzard has no intention of letting the system stagnate.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Perks are a game-changing feature
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  added in Season 15. Each hero has four Perks to choose from â€“ two minor Perks at level two, and two major Perks at level three. These upgrades range from stat boosts and passives to completely reworked or brand-new abilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it seems like
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is far from finished with Perks. During a recent AMA on Reddit, several
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  developers, including lead gameplay designer Alec Dawson and senior game producer Kenny Hudson, fielded questions from the community, many of which pertained to Perks. Hudson confirmed there were some Perks balance changes coming in the mid-Season 15 patch, including buffs to Roadhogâ€™s Hog Toss and Junoâ€™s Re-Boots, and nerfs to Bastionâ€™s overperforming Self-Repair Perk in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  . Whatâ€™s more, Season 16 will start to see some less-popular Perks rotated out in favor of completely new ones.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <h2 id="the-future-of-perks-in-overwatch-2">
  The Future of Perks in Overwatch 2
 </h2>
 <p>
  Were that not exciting enough, Dawson revealed even more overhauls are already in the works.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is planning a major refresh for Perks in Season 18, with every hero getting at least one new Perk in the update. While the numbers are subject to change, he claimed 25-50% of Perks would be replaced at that time, aiming mostly at choices of middling popularity over fan favorites. Season 18 is also when
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  hopes to evaluate the Perks system as a whole and may include changes to catch-up mechanics, adjustments to progress gains, or a starting level choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  The AMA also covered several other topics involving Perks, including that counterswapping is down 25% since the inclusion of the system, and that
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is currently not planning on adding a way to change Perks once one has been selected â€“ though it could add safeguards for players who pick the wrong one in the heat of the moment. All considered, it seems like
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's current focus is to make Perks a way to keep character kits fluid, adjustable, and fresh, all while keeping hero selection impactful.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  mid-Season 15 patch will likely drop sometime in mid or late March, with Season 16 expected to arrive on April 22. This would put Season 18 â€“ along with the Perk refresh and the second hero of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  in 2025 â€“ in late August. Between Perks, Stadium mode, and all the other content revealed during the recent Spotlight, 2025 is shaping up to be a big year for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  .

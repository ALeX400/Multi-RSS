    Marvel Rivals
   </em>

  Team-ups represent the perfect balance of power, skill, and damage, designed to unlock bonus battle effects. From gamma-charged fighting to icy AoE blasts, the right team-up can change the pace of any game. Let's explore the best trio alliances and see which combinations are best for good battle strategy.

 <ul>
  <li>

   Best for players who enjoy crowd control, sustained fights, and teamwork.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Players can appreciate quick-thinking leadership, team-sustaining healing, and long-lasting gameplay with the Guardian Revival team-up. Mantis, Warlock, and Starlord appear as familiar heroes, putting enemies to sleep and manipulating the game. Warlock provides the team with both offense and defense, while Starlord brings quick reflexes, and his quick-fired pistol reigns brutal combat to ensure the team stays coordinated.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Warlock may be the hero to
  <strong>
   allow Mantis and Starlord to revive,
  </strong>
  Mantis is the team's backbone. Using her healing abilities to control the game, she can quickly put enemies to sleep while Warlock or Starlord does a secret revive. While enemies might be temporarily useless, the team-up gets to soak in a
  <strong>
   15% healing bonus
  </strong>
  the entire game.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Magik grants Black Panther and Psylocke some extra magic.
  </li>
  <li>
   Best for players who enjoy strategic gameplay, teleportation, and stealth attacks.
  </li>

 <p>
  Dimensional Shortcut takes advantage of Magik's abilities, allowing for quick strategic maneuvers across the map. With Magik by their side, Black Panther and Psylocke tap into Limbo, allowing
  <strong>

  and gain bonus health.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this bonus ability, with Black Panther's brutal tank strength and Psylocke's mental powers, this team-up can coordinate surprise attacks and move stealthily (and aggressively) through the game. The synergy between these heroes makes it a perfect choice for players who value mobility and the element of surprise in combat.

 <ul>

  <li>
   Best for players who enjoy AoE gameplay and disaster.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  With Thor's legendary hammer, Storm's weather manipulation, and Captain America's obvious leadership, this trio knocks back enemies easily. The team-up of Thor and Storm obviously brings lots of lightning and elemental fury, while Captain America's shield provides defense and offense to the fight. With Voltaic Union, Thor grants electrified enhancements to his allies, resulting in excessive damage output and AoE damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Captain America gains a movement boost, while Storm can unleash lightning chaos on enemies, making for a messy battle. The team is granted a

 <p>
  Luna Snow is taking
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals

  by storm (or snow!) with her high pick rate due to healing and damage output. Luna Snow and Namor are a frosty powerhouse duo, and with Jeff the Landshark thrown into the mix, this trio team-up brings players cold-blooded precision and quick, strikes. Luna Snow, already capable of freezing enemies in their tracks, infuses ice energy into Jeff and Namor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The team-up creates straight chaos in any mode or map, overwhelming enemies with physical and elemental attacks. Not only does this team-up deal devastating ice blasts, but they are also gifted with a

 <ul>
  <li>
   Hela can resurrect the dead (in this case, Loki and Thor) or grant bonus health.
  </li>
  <li>
   Best for players who enjoy healing and sustainability.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  When gods and goddesses come together, things get aggressive, and fast. Hela, Loki, and Thor make for a team-up with one clear purpose, destruction. Hela, the Goddess that brings back the dead, can resurrect her teammates while running through battles with her brutal abilities. Noted as one of the best DPS in the game, Hela holds the team-up down with her already devastating damage output and crowd control. As a powerhouse with single-target and AoE attacks, this team-up will shred through enemy defense while keeping them in check, keeping the pressure on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon a final kill, Loki and Thor will be revived from the dead
  <strong>
   after 1.5s with full health.
  </strong>
  If Loki and Thor are still in the battle, they will be granted bonus health to continue fighting. On top of this super cool bonus, the team-up is granted a
  <strong>
   20% damage boost
  </strong>
  to give their enemies hell. Loki and Thor stand tall as devastating enemies on their own, but adding Hela to the mix just amplifies the fun.

  </li>
  <li>
   Best for high damage, high intensity, and domination.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  With the magic touch, might, magic, and tech, this trio teamup represents raw power and ingenuity. Hulk, filled with strength, high health, and rage, is the frontline tank, able to absorb and dish out insane damage. Doctor Strange and Iron Man round out the team with high-power attacks and strategic defense, making for the perfect flank.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Doctor Strange uses
  <strong>
   Maelstrom, he is granted a damage boost,
  </strong>
  making him even stronger than he already is. Iron Man also gets a
  <strong>
   massive damage boost when using armor,
  </strong>
  making this team one of the strongest in the game. Together,
  <strong>
   Hulk gains 150 Max Health
  </strong>
  and this team-up can tackle any situation. These abilities combined make players a threat to any adversary, no matter how big they are.

   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s Tycoon Club is a loyalty program that rewards players with Diamonds for making purchases in the game. These Diamonds can then be spent on different Benefits in the game and contribute towards the ongoing
  <strong>
   Tycoon Pass
  </strong>
  . Additionally, the Benefits section in the Tycoon Club includes a free daily wheel spin and another free gift in the Tycoon Club shop.

 <p>
  The Tycoon Club can be accessed from the main menu in the game, but due to some uncertain circumstances, players on Android devices can no longer access the Tycoon Club in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  . While we wait for Scopely to fix this issue, we've found a workaround to open the Tycoon Club on Android Devices.
 </p>
 <p>

   <strong>
    Updated January 29, 2025, by Usama Ali:
   </strong>
   While Android users still cannot access the Tycoon Club directly within the Monopoly GO app, they can enjoy the benefits by connecting their Monopoly GO accounts to Facebook and visiting the official website. This workaround ensures that Android users don’t miss out on the exclusive rewards and can still claim daily wheel spins, shop gifts, and track their Tycoon stats. We’ve updated this guide with step-by-step instructions on how Android users can link their Monopoly GO account to Facebook and enjoy the perks of the Tycoon Club.

  As mentioned above, the Tycoon Club had a bunch of freebies, like the daily wheel spin and free shop gift, which could help players progress faster in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until Scopely resolves the missing Tycoon Club issue, here's an easy way to access the Tycoon Club on Android devices and claim the freebies:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Open
   <strong>
    Monopoly GO’s official website.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   Click on the green
   <strong>
    Login
   </strong>
   button at the top right corner.
  </li>
  <li>
   When prompted,
   <strong>
    sign in with your Facebook account
   </strong>
   . Make sure you log in with the same Facebook account as the one you use in your
   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
   account.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you’ve logged in, click on the
   <strong>
    Benefits
   </strong>
   tab from the drop-down menu on the left side of the screen.
  </li>
  <li>
   Scroll to the bottom of the Benefits section and you’ll find the
   <strong>
    Daily Wheel
   </strong>
   . Click on
   <strong>
    Spin
   </strong>
   to try your luck and win exciting rewards.
  </li>
  <li>
   After that, click on the
   <strong>
    Shop
   </strong>
   tab and scroll down to claim another free gift.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finally,
   <strong>
    open the Monopoly GO app.
   </strong>
   The freebies will immediately be added to your account.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_9">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     The daily wheel spin and free gift in the shop refresh every 24 hours. As such, make sure to access the Tycoon Club at least once a day to avoid missing out on these rewards.

  Unfortunately, there's no official word from Scopely regarding a fix for the Tycoon Club access issue on Android devices. While they are likely working on a solution, it's difficult to predict an exact timeframe.

  In the meantime, we recommend using the alternative method outlined above to continue enjoying the benefits of the Tycoon Club. This workaround allows you to claim the daily wheel rewards and shop gifts, making sure you don’t miss out on any perks.

 <p>
  An interesting revenue report has revealed that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  has managed to exceed expectations when it comes to sales, despite featuring two re-run characters in the second part of the update.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  runs on a gacha-based system, which means that the game's main source of revenue is the limited banners, which allow players to obtain characters and items by spending Primogems.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.3 is packed with content, including some of the most popular roster additions, such as the Pyro Archon Mavuika. The Natlan leader was released in the first part of the update alongside the famous fortune teller, the Cryo support Citlali. The second part of the update also introduced a new four-star character, Lan Yan, who is available for free as part of the Lantern Rite Festival.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second banner phase for
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.3 features re-runs for two five-star characters: Arlecchino and Clorinde. At the time of the official banner reveal, many fans were surprised to see that both new five-star characters were placed in the first banner cycle.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  usually tries to spread its five-star character releases over two banner cycles. However, it seems like HoYoverse knew what it was doing, considering that a recent revenue report shared by Reddit user Dramatic_endjingu has revealed that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  climbed to the top revenue spot for Android users in Japan.

 </h2>
 <p>
  While HoYoverse did not clarify the reason behind the unusual character release schedule, some fans suspected that the main reason was that the second part of the update hosts
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's Lantern Rite Festival, which celebrates the Lunar New Year. Other players claim that another reason both Mavuika and Citlali were featured on the first banner could simply be that HoYoverse anticipated the Fontaine duo, Arlecchino and Clorinde, were popular enough to be featured in a separate banner cycle.

  Since her first appearance, Arlecchino has quickly become one of the most anticipated characters in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . Since her release back in update 4.6, Arlecchino has not appeared on another banner, making this her first re-run. Arlecchino's release also introduced a new mechanic called Bond-of-Life, which, similar to Natlan's Nightsoul system, is exclusive to only a couple of Fontaine characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of these playable units is her banner colleague, Clorinde, who is considered an S-tier pick for the main DPS role in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . When it comes to other HoYoverse games, Zenless Zone Zero and Honkai: Star Rail took the 5th and 6th spots on the list.

  In
  <em>
   Hell Let Loose
  </em>
  , there are fourteen different roles that you can choose from, split into three divisions: Infantry, Armor, and Recon. Sniper is part of the Recon division, and each Recon squad is made up of two members:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Spotter:
   </strong>
   Acts as the squad leader, providing intelligence and reconnaissance support.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Sniper:
   </strong>
   A long-range marksman responsible for eliminating targets from a distance.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   To play as the Sniper, you'll have to join a Recon squad that already has a Spotter.
  </strong>
  If you create a new Recon squad, you will automatically be assigned the Spotter role. The Sniper role only becomes available once another player joins your squad and selects the Spotter position.

     If a Recon squad already exists and has an open Sniper slot, you can join directly as a Sniper.

 <p>
  Each team in
  <em>
   Hell Let Loose
  </em>
  is limited to a maximum of two Recon squads, meaning there can only be two Snipers per team at any given time. If both Recon squads are already full, you will have to wait until a slot becomes available before being able to play as a Sniper.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to play as a Sniper, try teaming up with a friend who is willing to take on the Spotter role. This ensures you both get the roles you want and can work together effectively. You can also create a locked Recon squad so that you can save the empty spot for your friend to join.

     If the Sniper role is taken, try playing another class. Other roles, such as Engineer or Machine Gunner, also play an essential part in battles and can still provide an enjoyable experience.

  The Sniper role in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hell Let Loose
   </em>
  </strong>
  is intentionally limited to ensure balanced gameplay and teamwork. If you want to play Sniper, make sure you find a server with an empty spot in the Recon squad. Inviting a friend to join the squad will also increase your chances of securing the role.

  Mydei is the Crown Prince and leader of the Kremnoan detachment in Castrum Kremnos, one of Amphoreus' major cities. He's also known as the undying Mydeimos, which hints at his in-game abilities. A recent leak by a reliable source named Hakush.in claimed that Mydei's kit uses his HP to enhance his attacks.

 <ul>

   <strong>
    Talent - Blood for Blood:
   </strong>
   Mydei gains an amount of charge when he loses HP. Once full, he will go into his "Vendetta" state, which advances his action immediately, makes him immune to crowd control, and enhances his skill to deal more damage. There will also be a separate tally of the HP he loses in his Vendetta state. When it reaches 180%, he advances and uses the most powerful enhancement of his skill, "Godslayer be God."
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Skill:
   </strong>
   This consumes a portion of Mydei's HP to deal a percentage of his Max HP in Imaginary DMG to an enemy and adjacent targets. There are three versions of this ability.

  Mydei Could be Blade’s Long-Awaited Successor
 </h3>

  </em>
  veterans may have noticed that there hasn’t been a strong HP-based damage dealer since Blade and Jingliu, who have both fallen off the meta. Mydei seems to fill this gap better than both of the previous units. His built-in taunt ensures that enemies prioritize him as a target so he can lose HP and improve his damage efficiently. This is an ability that Blade sorely lacks. Mydei also has relatively better multipliers for his enhanced skill compared to Blade’s enhanced basic attack. Mydei’s HP loss tally system is superior, as he can use its bonus damage more consistently through his skill, compared to Blade, who can only use his HP tally bonuses during his ultimate.

 <h3 id="mydei-could-be-a-great-answer-to-hsr-rsquo-s-fastest-bosses">
  Mydei Could be a Great Answer to HSR’s Fastest Bosses
 </h3>
 <p>
  It seems that
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  ’s bosses are only getting faster and tankier with every update. Mydei could be the answer to these tough enemies, as his damage output only gets better as his HP gets shredded. Players looking for a risky, but rewarding gameplay should save their Stellar Jades and Star Rail Special Passes for this unit. However, they should prepare to use him more in manual mode and get his ideal emergency healers like Luocha and Lingsha to maximize his damage without getting his HP into K.O. territory.

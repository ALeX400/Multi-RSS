      Some of the best games on the Switch are licensed titles, such as
      <em>
       Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance 2

  <strong>
   Licensed games
  </strong>
  have evolved over time. Typically, they weren’t very good in the 80s and 90s, although there were some standouts, especially when proven developers got on board. Konami and Capcom are two great examples who handled cartoon and movie games well.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, licensed games have improved, and some of the best games on the Nintendo Switch are licensed. From cartoons to movies, these are still some all-time greats that every Switch owner should cherish. They will be ranked according to their overall quality. They may not have originated on the Switch, but that doesn’t matter in the long run.

   <em>
    Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released in 2004 before venturing onto the Switch in 2022. Despite it being over twenty years old now, this hack-and-slash dungeon crawler based on the
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  license still feels great to play.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can choose from a variety of classes all aligned to a specific race. There are dialogue trees, but the story isn’t the important thing here. It’s all about going on an adventure, leveling up, and collecting tons of loot, either alone or with friends in the co-op mode.

   <em>
    Ghostbusters: The Video Game
   </em>
  </strong>
  was first released in 2009 before getting remastered in 2019 on the Switch. It’s still the best
  <em>
   Ghostbusters
  </em>
  sequel to follow the second movie, as it ties directly into where things left off with the original crew. Most of the cast returned to record lines, including the core four of Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players took on the role of the rookie just joining the crew as New York City goes into a panicked state when ghosts start appearing. The remaster itself is a bit clunky and didn’t add much to fix the original, but the core content is still rock solid for any
  <em>
   Ghostbusters
  </em>
  fan.

  <em>
   Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2
  </em>
  was released in 2009, and it took another ten years before fans would see a sequel.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still a console exclusive for the Switch, as Nintendo helped produce it along with Team Ninja who handled the bulk of development. It’s another great multiplayer game for those looking for some co-op brawling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Marvel fans will enjoy it as well, as there are tons of big heroes in it, like Spider-Man and Wolverine, along with more obscure characters like Crystal and Elsa Bloodstone. Hopefully, this won’t be the end of the series, but if it is,
  <em>
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order
  </em>
  helped end it on a good note.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Disney Illusion Island
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a fun surprise in 2023 when it launched on the Switch. Players could choose to play as Mickey, Minnie, Donald, or Goofy as they explore this new island to help its citizens.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a Metroidvania wherein players can get new powers that help with traversal, like being able to scale walls. Each power was unique to a specific character, with Donald often getting the more jokey power-ups. There are bosses, but it isn’t a battle-heavy game to begin with, which makes it easy for players of any kind to jump into.

   <em>
    Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still well-regarded as one of BioWare’s best games, along with one of the best
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  games. Players could create their character from a range of starter pre-designed classes and go through a dialogue-heavy adventure that took place way before the movies began.
 </p>
 <p>
  Combat felt kind of like an MMO in that it was automatic, but players could also execute abilities that ran on cooldowns. The main highlight was the story, which remains one of the best in any
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  medium. For
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  fans hungry for more on the Switch, they should also check out
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga
  </em>

  Like
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  before it,
  <em>
   South Park
  </em>
  quickly became a hit when it started airing on Comedy Central in 1997. With it came a cavalcade of quick cash-in games that ranged from okay to bad. It took decades, but finally, there was a
  <em>
   South Park
  </em>
  game that captured the spirit of the show in
  <strong>
   <em>
    South Park: The Stick of Truth
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It was a strong tie-in to the cartoon, but it was also a great turn-based RPG with a class system, character creator, and dialogue trees. While it didn’t launch initially for the Switch, the later port does run well, and it fits right at home on the handheld hybrid like a more adult version of
  <em>
   EarthBound
  </em>
  .

  . Coincidentally, the best-licensed game on the Switch is its long-awaited sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It was made by Tribute Games, who also worked on
  <em>
   Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game
  </em>
  while the team was still part of Ubisoft. After that brawling success, they branched off and formed Tribute Games officially, and have consistently put out great pixel art games like
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This game upgraded the brawler genre with six-player co-op, a leveling system, tons of characters, Easter Eggs, and more. Fans of the turtles should also check out
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection
  </em>
  on the Switch.

  The

   <em>
    Mario
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  franchise has expanded and changed a lot since its debut in the 1980s. From the visuals to the gameplay, Mario has continued to evolve and adapt as he enters each new era of gaming, with the developers at Nintendo experimenting with new concepts and mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the case of specific
  <em>
   Mario

  games, they have not only provided gamers with entertaining experiences but have left an impact on the series as a whole. They proved to be so innovative that future games would continue to take from them with each continuing title, whether it's the mainline games or the spin-offs.

    Super Mario Bros.
   </strong>
  </em>
  is where the franchise began, but that’s not entirely true. Mario and Luigi were the titular heroes of the
  <em>
   Mario Bros.
  </em>
  arcade game, which was only one screen that looped infinitely while players rack up points.
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros.
  </em>
  was the sequel, and it cemented the series as a side-scrolling platformer going forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros.
  </em>
  is where fans were introduced to now-beloved characters like Princess Peach, Toad, and Bowser. Not only did the 1985 game change the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  franchise forever, but it established a new norm for video games in general, with 2D side-scrolling platformers dominating the gaming market for years afterward.

  Despite being an overhauled version of what was going to be a completely different game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario Bros. 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  still delivered a memorable experience. It was the first time players could pick a character other than Mario to play as, with four characters available, and rather than a simple left-to-right structure, levels were sometimes non-linear to provide more of a challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iconic enemies and minions were also introduced in
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. 2
  </em>
  , with Birdo becoming a staple playable character in spin-off titles. Meanwhile, Shy Guys, Ninji, Bob-Ombs, and more made their debut and have remained part of the series ever since.

  Returning to the classic sidescrolling style of the first game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario Bros. 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  featured several revolutionary mechanics for the franchise. The first was a gauge that, when filled by running, could allow Mario and his little brother Luigi to leap higher into the air—or fly, depending on the power-up. This allowed for new ways of puzzle-solving and speedrunning through levels.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second revolutionary mechanic was that
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. 3
  </em>
  featured an overworld map. Instead of just moving on to the next level, the player can move their character around the overworld to find bonus levels, item houses, and more. The overworlds would become commonplace in
  <em>
   Super Mario World
  </em>
  and various other titles, most recently with
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  .

  The Game Boy
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games are often forgotten due to not being as popular as the console games. However, they remain quality
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games, especially
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which had its own set of unique worlds, power-ups, and a (then) new villain in the form of Wario, Mario’s greedy doppelgänger.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was his introduction in
  <em>
   Super Mario Land 2
  </em>
  that led to Wario getting his spin-off
  <em>
   Wario Land
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   WarioWare
  </em>
  franchises, and then becoming a recurring character in
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  , and the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  sports games. Additionally, without the creation of Wario, there would be no Waluigi as his partner in later games.

  <strong>
   New Super Mario Bros.
  </strong>
  set a new standard for
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games for a long time. It took the fundamentals established in previous
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games but expanded on them with a new visual style, additional iconic power-ups to enjoy, and an emphasis on co-op gameplay rather than competitively seeing who gets the most points in a level.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Nintendo had a hit with
  <em>
   New Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  . on the Nintendo DS, the game received sequels on the Wii, 3DS, and Wii U. It became the definitive form of 2D
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game for years, boasting quaint music, simplistic levels, and adding different characters to play with each title.

  At the end of the day,
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games are meant to be for all ages, and there is no better example than the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario Party
   </strong>
  </em>
  series. The original remains an iconic game thanks to its board game-like structure mixed with minigames where up to four players compete to see who comes out on top.
 </p>
 <p>
  The simple concept of
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  spawned its own franchise, which now has fans who don't even play the mainline
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games, both children and adults alike. As a result, there are over a dozen
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  titles, which is more than most of the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  spin-off games.

  The Mario franchise has stuck to a similar formula for decades, and there is nothing wrong with sticking to something that clearly works. However,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Bowser’s Fury
   </strong>
  </em>
  indicates new possibilities for the future as it is the first truly open-world
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game, built off the foundation of
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World
  </em>
  and using its assets to create an entirely new game.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not the longest game in the world, but many gamers found it refreshing to freely explore Lake Lapcat as Mario and Bowser Jr., solving every mission in any order, listening to tranquil music, and fighting Fury Bowser as a unique NPC. It showcases the possibilities of open-world
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  , with many fans hoping to see how Nintendo might expand on it with a new
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  sequel.

   <em>
    Mario Kart 64
   </em>
  </strong>
  was not the first game in the spin-off series, but it made the biggest impact. It was a sequel that took everything that the first game did so well and amplified it with new visuals, the inclusion of power-up attacks, and an even better roster full of characters, including Mario's old rival Donkey Kong, his friend Toad, and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  After its release in 1998,
  <em>
   Mario Kart 64
  </em>
  became the template for every subsequent
  <em>
   Mario Kart

  game. Whether it's the gameplay, the visuals, or even familiar maps making a return,
  <em>
   Mario Kart 64

  While it did not invent 3D platformer gameplay,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario 64
   </strong>
  </em>
  did revolutionize it thanks to its colorful and vibrant worlds combined with smooth and responsive controls. For 1996, it was unlike anything the fanbase had seen before, which led to it becoming a critical and financial success.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than levels,
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  introduced worlds that were accessed via a hub, and each world was filled with a collection of missions to accomplish. This beloved Nintendo 64 title became the template for the long line of 3D
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  games that followed, with Charles Martinet becoming the go-to voice of Mario for years.

  <strong>
   <em>

  ,
  <em>

  , or
  <em>
   Bowser's Fury

  has been one of Nintendo's most consistently good franchises, bringing together all their star characters and having them battle it out on courses filled with weapons, traps, and other drivers, all looking to finish in first place. Over thirty years later, the franchise is still going strong, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mario Kart 9
   </em>
  </strong>
  is poised to be one of the most hyped launch games for the
  <strong>
   Switch 2
  </strong>
  , which launches sometime in 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  With an eye to the future of
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  and its upcoming ninth entry, one can't help but think about what courses are going to be included, as the series tends to include a good mix of both classic and new courses.
  <strong>
   Older
   <em>
    Mario Kart
   </em>
   courses
  </strong>
  are constantly being brought back, and it's exciting to think about what these iconic tracks could look like with the improved hardware of the Switch 2. These courses run the gamut, chronicling a list from the long and storied history of this iconic racing series, as many of these haven't been seen since their initial game and would be a perfect fit for
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  .

  First appearing in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario Kart: Super Circuit
   </strong>
  </em>
  for the Game Boy Advance,
  <strong>
   Cheep Cheep Island
  </strong>
  takes place on a delightful series of land masses, all of them beset by a gorgeous sunset overlooking the sandy dunes and lighthouses. It is one of the best handheld
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  courses of all time, as Nintendo leveraged the power of the Game Boy Advance to create an experience similar to the original game on the SNES, but with remarkable graphics and some spectacular music.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be a perfect fit for
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  , as its lush landscapes, cozy tropical island vibe and gigantic Cheep Cheeps jumping in and out of the water would benefit greatly from the improved hardware of the Switch 2. As
  <em>
   Mario Kart: Super Circuit
  </em>
  was a 2D game, it would also be absolutely fantastic to see the course remade in 3D, which Nintendo is no stranger to, as they have done so with numerous tracks from the older games.

  Nintendo clearly still sees value in
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  , as they released it as part of a collection for the Switch to celebrate their mascot's 35th anniversary in 2020. So, with
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  on the horizon, it is the perfect time to continue that trend by including an updated version of
  <strong>
   Delfino Square
  </strong>
  , which incorporates all the charm and magic of
  <em>
   Sunshine
  </em>
  in a single course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Debuting in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mario Kart DS
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Delfino Square takes the racers through a seaside village that is loaded with shops, hazards, and an adorable cast of Piantas, the island locals. It has such a soothing vibe, and with a lot of rumors surrounding
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9's
  </em>
  massive player count and being somewhat of an open-world experience akin to
  <em>
   Forza
  </em>
  , it would make sense to bring Delfino Square back and really open it up to encompass more of
  <em>
   Sunshine's
  </em>
  environments.

  If there's anything that
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  always tends to have, it's a course that is covered in snow, embracing a chilly winter vibe and inviting atmosphere. With
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario Kart 64
   </strong>
  </em>
  , Nintendo produced what is still one of the best winter-themed tracks with
  <strong>
   Sherbet Land
  </strong>
  , a slippery jaunt that sees racers trying to avoid a large range of different sized penguins as they look to knock them off the track and into the freezing waters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sherbet Land would also appear in the Wii iteration of the series from 2008, and while it seemed like an obvious choice for the
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
  </em>
  booster pass, it has been absent from the series ever since. That said, it's high time to bring this delightful course back and see what it looks like on improved hardware, as the Switch 2 version of
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  is bound to feature some internal improvements that will make this winter wonderland shine like never before.

  For the next-gen version of
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  on the GameCube in 2003, the appropriately titled
  <strong>
   <em>
    Double Dash
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Nintendo added two drivers per vehicle and the ability to hold two weapons at once. It wasn't just about the new mechanics though, as
  <em>
   Double Dash
  </em>
  also features one of the best track selections in the entire series, and one of the best of those is
  <strong>
   Luigi Circuit
  </strong>
  , a traditional racecourse that unfolds with the classic
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  mayhem the franchise is known for.
 </p>
 <p>
  If rumors of 24 participants per race are true, then Luigi Circuit would be a perfect course to bring back in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  , as the wide open spaces of the track would be outstanding for the increased player count. Luigi Circuit is one of
  <em>
   Mario Kart's
  </em>
  all-time greatest tracks, and bringing it back with the enhanced power of the Switch 2 is an absolute no-brainer.

  The N64 iteration of
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  continues to be one of Nintendo's most timeless creations, and it's thanks to excellent tracks like
  <strong>
   Koopa Troopa Beach
  </strong>
  that it remains as such some twenty-eight years later. This bright, sunny beach is filled with dangers of all sorts, from gigantic leaps across treacherous rocks to hostile creatures emerging from the sand, and like any great
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  level, it uses them all to perfection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Re-introducing Koopa Troopa Beach, one of the franchise's most popular courses, would be a wise move for
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  . In addition to its spectacular design, it also has one of the franchise's most well-known shortcuts, as players can use a mushroom to leap off a ramp and dive into a cave that cuts through a waterfall and can save a lot of time. Recreating this iconic track in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  would also have to include this memorable shortcut, as this excellent course deserves a spot in one of Switch 2's most anticipated games.

 <p>
  Waluigi Stadium has the energy of a large motocross track, taking place on a dirt course that features jumps, fire hazards, and gigantic piranha plants. It shares some similarities with Wario Stadium from
  <em>

  </em>
  , but is much larger and features more traps, along with some excellent music. Waluigi Stadium is a must-have for

  and was remade for the
  <em>
   MK8 Deluxe
  </em>
  booster pass, but the original version is in need of an update, and the Switch 2 is the place to make it happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  This charming course takes place on a sprawling, wide-open farm that features one of the best pieces of music in the franchise's history and has some dastardly traps in the form of Monty Moles popping up from the ground. Of all the classic courses, Moo Moo Farm remains the one most in need of a return in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9

  and would be an absolutely perfect way to show just how far this franchise has come in nearly thirty years.

  Like most board games, the developers of
  <em>
   Dice Dreams
  </em>
  regularly introduce dice links for players running low on dice. These links can be helpful in continuing your progress and can be used to redeem various rewards, including rolls and Building Blitz, which can consequently help you build your kingdom. Moreover, these links occasionally reward millions of coins, but most of the time, you'll receive rolls. Below is a list of active links that
  <em>
   Dice Dreams
  </em>
  players can use to earn some free goodies.

  While weapons aren't as overpowered as they used to be, there are still a handful of weapons that can be used to take down some of the toughest enemies in the game with relative ease. From the Auto Axe to the Railway Rifle, these examples are some of the most overpowered weapons in the game.

   There are lots of fantastic weapons in Fallout 76. While the most recent version of this article did cover many of the most overpowered weapons in the game, a couple of weapons didn't quite make it onto the original list. Those weapons are the Chainsaw and the Cold Shoulder. While these weapons aren't as overpowered as many of the other items featured on this list, they are overpowered within their category. The Cold Shoulder is among the most powerful shotguns in the game. And the Chainsaw, while it's not as powerful as the Auto Axe, it's much easier to obtain, and it still slices through enemies incredibly fast. This update will introduce the two aforementioned weapons to the list.

   <strong>
    How To Get:
   </strong>
   A former scoreboard reward. Available in the Atomic Shop.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  When it was released, it was available at rank 5 on the Rip Daring scoreboard. While this scoreboard is long gone, players can still get their hands on this weapon via the Atomic Shop. This shotgun is incredibly powerful. It also has a rare ability. It deals cryo damage which slows down enemies. While this isn't the only weapon that deals cryo damage, most other cryo damage weapons don't have high damage output.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Cold Shoulder is a devastating shotgun that can one-shot many enemies with its icy blast. For those who enjoy using shotguns, this is a must-have weapon. While it doesn't appear as a legendary weapon, it is in fact legendary. First is the cryo damage. This slows down enemies while dealing damage. Second is its bonus damage to cryptids.
  <strong>
   It deals an extra 50% damage against all cryptids
  </strong>
  . Its final effect is its ammo capacity.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  It has the quad effect, making it an incredibly hard-hitting and surprisingly fast-firing shotgun.

   </strong>
   : This weapon can't be crafted. Players instead need to either find one out in the world, trade with other players for one, or receive one as an enemy drop.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Chainsaw isn't as powerful as the Auto Axe. However, it comes in close behind.
  <strong>
   The Chainsaw is much easier to obtain than the Auto Axe,
  </strong>
  making it a great weapon for players who don't have a lot of Stamps to spare. With the Vampire's effect, the Chainsaw becomes a very overpowered weapon that slices through enemies with ease while also ensuring that the player's health doesn't dip too low.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the right build, the Chainsaw can be used to take down most enemies in the game. This includes various bosses, such as Earle Williams and the Storm Goliaths.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    How To Get
   </strong>
   : The standard variant can be purchased from MODUS inside the Whitespring Bunker. It can also be given as an event reward or purchased from another player.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Enclave Plasma Flamer has always ranked among the best energy weapons in the game. It has a great damage output and a fantastic fire rate, and it melts most enemies in a matter of seconds. Unfortunately, players will need to get hold of some rare mods to turn an Enclave Plasma Gun/Rifle into a flamer.
  <strong>
   Enclave weapons really need to have both the Reflex Sight and Stabilized Stock mods attached to make them more accurate and easier to handle
  </strong>
  . Also, they need a flamer barrel. Without a flamer barrel, the weapon can still be powerful, but to make it great, players should do what they can to get a flamer mod.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a couple of ways of getting Enclave Mods. The first is by completing "Cop A Squatter." This daily quest awards players with a random mod. There's a small chance for that mod to be an Enclave Flamer Mod. The other ways are either by trading with other players or by visiting the Vendor Bots in Watoga and the one in Berkeley Springs Station. The chance for one of the aforementioned vendors to sell an Enclave Box mod is very low, so players will need to hop from server to server in the hopes of finding one. Players will also need to try to get their hands on some good legendary effects, like Bloodied, Vampire's, or Anti-Armor, to make this weapon shine.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    How To Get
   </strong>
   : The plan to craft the Tesla Rifle can be found in various loot containers across the map, several vendor inventories, and on the bodies of downed enemies. It is a pretty easy plan to find.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Unlike the other entries, the Tesla Rifle, while powerful, isn't overpowered in terms of damage output. Instead,
  <strong>
   it is overpowered due to how much extra XP players can earn by using it
  </strong>
  . When fired, the Tesla Rifle's beams will bounce around and not only hit the intended target but also any other enemies who are nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  This weapon gives players the ability to level up much faster than normal. This weapon shines during Radiation Rumble as there are lots of tough enemies nearby, meaning that players can earn tens of thousands of XP in just a few minutes. While effects like Bloodied and Vampire's are pretty good primary effects to have on a Tesla Rifle, Quad is by far the most beneficial effect to have. Being able to fire off more shots before needing to reload can help players earn lots of extra XP.

  <li>
   <strong>
    How To Get
   </strong>
   : A possible reward for completing the event; Beasts Of Burden. It can also be purchased from other players.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  By default,
  <strong>
   the Holy Fire comes with the following effects; Vampire's, Rapid, and Durability
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  While these effects are great, unlike some of the other named legendary weapons in the game, the legendary effects that are tied to the Holy Fire can be changed to suit the player's build. The desirable effects will depend on the player's perks, armor, and taste. But, regardless of the legendary effects, the Holy Fire is a very powerful flamer variant that, much like the Enclave Plasma Flamer, can burn through enemies with ease.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because enemies drop contextual ammo and the Holy Fire does quite a lot of damage, more often than not, players will find themselves finding more ammo on enemy bodies than they used to take down the enemy in the first place. While this doesn't make a lot of sense, players won't need to worry about running out of fuel very often.

 <ul>

   <strong>
    How To Get
   </strong>
   : The plan to craft the Auto Axe can be purchased from Giuseppe in the Whitespring Refuge for 500 Stamps.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Auto Axe is a powerful weapon in itself. That said, if the player uses either the electric or poison mods, then this weapon becomes much more powerful. Add that to some good legendary effects, sturdy armor, and two-handed weapon perks, and the Auto Axe can slice through almost every enemy in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it is a rather costly investment, it is more than worth it due to the incredibly high damage output. Since it has a very fast swing, the damage stacks up very quickly. Also,
  <strong>
   if the player is lucky enough to have one with the Vampire's effect, then they can become borderline invincible while attacking enemies
  </strong>

 <p>
  <strong>
   The Cremator, like the Auto Axe, is incredibly powerful without any effects or mods
  </strong>
  . That said, with the right setup, the Cremator becomes one of the most overpowered weapons in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Newer players will have to wait a while as they'll need to reach the rank of ally with the raiders before they'll be able to purchase the plan to craft this untradable weapon. Almost all of the mods for this weapon are powerful. That said, there are a few mods that players tend to prefer. Mods like the Heavy Barrel, Multi-Shot Barrel, Fast Propellant Tank, and the Slow-Burning Tank are among the most popular mods. As legendary effects, Instigating, Vampire's, and Quad are pretty popular for the first star. But the best option will depend on the player's build and preference.

 <ul>

   <strong>
    How To Get
   </strong>
   : The plan to craft this weapon is a fairly common drop on enemies and events in the Savage Divide, Ash Heap, Mire Region, and Cranberry Bog. It can also be purchased from other players and various NPC vendors.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Despite being nerfed not long ago, the Railway Rifle is still a very overpowered weapon that can take down boss enemies such as Earle Williams and the Scorchbeast Queen with relative ease. This weapon does come with a couple of drawbacks. First, the recoil makes it almost impossible to use outside of V.A.T.S. and the ammo is pretty weighty. But those are small drawbacks when compared to the damage output of this weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the right build and effects,
  <strong>
   the Railway Rifle can take down most common enemies in just a couple of shots
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  As for legendary effects, Quad is by far the most desirable legendary prefix on this weapon due to its somewhat limited standard ammo capacity. While it does take a bit of time to master using the Railway Rifle, it is a truly devastating weapon.

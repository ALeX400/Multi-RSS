  's fifth chapter takes us to the Flaming Mountains, home of the King Ox and countless deadly bosses. One pair of bosses that can be quite troublesome to deal with is the deadly duo of Cloudy Mist and Misty Cloud. The former is a three-headed spellcaster that uses homing projectiles, while the latter takes a direct approach with incense sticks bundled together into a burning club.

 <p>
  When heading into this fight, the Immobilize and Pluck of Many spell combo is going to be your best friend. By immobilizing either of the bosses and sending in the clones, you can shred their health bar very easily. This is a mana-intensive but highly effective means of dealing damage in this boss fight.

   Rock Solid

  is a very effective means of parrying Misty Cloud's fiery melee attacks, which can open them up to counterattacks if you get the timing right.

   Ebon Flow

  are excellent options when selecting a transformation. Both will provide you with the means to tank Cloudy Mist's homing projectiles and Misty Cloud's melee combos, while also dishing out a ton of damage in return. Azure Dust is the easiest to use and is likely to stun the bosses with its spell after you've tanked a few hits to charge it up, while Ebon Flow requires a touch more precision and can tear through their health with heavy attacks after building up focus by blocking.

 <p>
  The fight begins with Cloudy Mist firing a beam of light, sweeping horizontally. With good timing, you can dodge through it by dodging in the direction it's coming from, though jumping over it will also work if you can nail the timing. Once you close the distance on Cloudy Mist, they'll start using melee combos with their staff too. They'll raise their staff, before swinging it back and forth. After the second swipe, Misty Cloud will dive in to perform a third hit, so watch for them to appear and then dodge to the side of their leaping attack. This is your chance to take a few swings at one of them since there'll be an opening before they start their next attack.
 </p>

 <p>
  When Cloudy Mist slowly sweeps their staff, creating motes of light as they do, be prepared to dodge. These motes will split into fast-moving homing projectiles after he's done conjuring them. Dodge towards them as they get close to roll through them, but be cautious. They turn quickly and are very hard to shake. Cloudy Mist will usually try to follow up this attack with a heavy swing before Misty Cloud jumps in with an overhead slam a moment later. Dodge the heavy swing, then dodge through Misty Cloud's slam and don't go on the offensive just yet because Cloudy Mist conjured a few more motes with that heavy swing, and those motes will flash and fire beams of light at you. You'll need to dodge a split-second after you see the flash to avoid these beams, and then you can go on the offensive again.

  Another attack Cloudy Mist likes to use begins with them hunching over as light begins to build up inside them. Get ready to dodge when they lurch upright again, as they'll fire out three consecutive beams of light very quickly. Dodge to the side and don't stop until the third beam has fired. You can get in some hits after they stop firing.

 <p>
  When Cloudy Mist has lost at least a quarter of their health, they'll start using a new attack where they plant their staff in the ground and begin waving their arms. Retreat as far back as possible to avoid being caught in the stunning flash the staff emits a moment later, followed by Misty Cloud joining the fight in earnest (This flashbang attack is used by Cloudy Mist to tag out to Misty Cloud). Cloudy Mist will follow the staff flash by hurling a large projectile at you, which can be dodged by moving to either side.

 <p>
  After using the flashbang move for the first time, Cloudy Mist will turn invisible and Misty Cloud will take point. Misty Cloud favors melee attacks that inflict burning, and jumping lunge attacks to close distance. They can also swap Cloudy Mist back in briefly to perform their ranged attacks, including the triple laser. When using the triple laser attack like this, Cloudy Mist will swap to Misty Cloud right afterward, who will jump at you to catch you off guard. Stay calm, dodge the lasers, then dodge the jump attack and attack Misty Cloud. When Misty Cloud hefts their burning club in both hands they'll prepare an overhead swing. Dodge to the side, then dodge through the horizontal swing that they follow this with (don't dodge backward as it launches a fire trail ahead mid-swing). They'll then do another small horizontal swing before two overhead slams, so wait for the second slam and then attack.
 </p>

 <p>
  When Misty Cloud pauses after an overhead swing with the club still on the ground, they'll kick up a blast of smoke and momentarily stun you. You can avoid this stun by dodging just as the club emits the blast. After the blast they'll tag Cloudy Mist back in to create a volley of homing projectiles, with Misty Cloud charging at you for an overhead slam as the homing bolts fire. This can be difficult to dodge, but if you time it right you can dodge through the projectiles and the slam at the same time with consecutive dodges. You can also use Azure Dust to tank it if you have it equipped.

  When Cloudy Mist says something about "Show Him Our Teamwork", Misty Cloud will appear suddenly and launch into their melee combo again. Be cautious and look for Cloudy Mist as you dodge Misty Cloud's attacks, as the former is preparing a big ranged blast while Misty Cloud tries to distract you. Once Misty Cloud's combo ends, watch Cloudy Mist and dodge to the side when their blast gets close to you. This is a good time to use Immobilize on them and dish out some damage.

 <p>
  They'll switch the "active" boss regularly and mix up their combos, making it hard to focus on a single target, but as long as you stay calm and wait for the openings, you'll be able to whittle them down. Once one of them goes down, the remaining boss won't learn any new tricks and can be taken down quite easily.

 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Risk of Rain 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  has 7 different types of items in its arsenal. Players can get normal white items, rare green items, legendary red items, purple void items, blue lunar items, orange equipment, and gold boss items. Teleporter bosses will always drop a green item when killed, but there's a 15% chance that they will drop their specific gold boss item instead.
 </p>

 <p>
  These items aren't as powerful as legendary items but are rarer than the normal green items. Though they don't offer a lot of options for the player, they are quite useful in the right situations. Players can also gain a gold item if they use the Trophy Hunter's Tricorn.

 <p>
  There's no doubt that drones are some of the least productive ways to use gold in
  <em>
   Risk of Rain 2
  </em>
  . They die easily, don't have a very intelligent AI controlling their actions, and cost a lot of money to bring back to life. However, Empathy Cores gold boss item spawns two drones called Solus Probes, which gain more damage the more allies that the player has.

 <p>
  Allies include any entity that has a health bar on the player's UI, including ghosts spawned by Happiest Mask, a legendary item that doesn't work well on its own. If the player has Empathy Cores, it makes sense to revive as many drones as possible to increase the damage dealt by the Solus Probes.

 <p>
  There's no doubt that critical hits are the most powerful effect in
  <em>
   Risk of Rain 2
  </em>
  . Therefore, it stands to reason that an item that improves the effect of critical hits is powerful as well. However, that isn't necessarily the case for Shatterspleen. It is decently powerful, but not as good as one might think at first.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1024} -->

 <p>
  The item makes critical hits bleed enemies, causing them to explode right after. This item gives the player a good AoE option, but there are many other items, such as Will-o'-the-wisp, which has a similar effect and are much easier to find. If players don't have guaranteed crits, they can utilize normal bleeds, caused by the Tri-tip Dagger, to trigger an explosion as well. If the player is doing a run with the Artifact of Command, getting the Shatterspleen to complement their already existing critical hit build is a good option.

  The best way to ensure long runs is to do a lot of damage and dodge every attack possible, living long enough to kill everything. However, nobody is perfect, and mistakes happen. That's where the healing items come in, increasing the survivability of the player after they get hit, letting them recoup from damage and come back even stronger.

  The Mired Urn drains the health of one enemy (per stack) near the player, dealing 25% damage every 0.25 seconds in the process. All the damage dealt counts towards the player's healing, making it one of the best healing items in the game. The higher the player's damage, the more healing they receive.

 <p>
  The most common thing that players will do during any given run is to run away. The most important part of the
  <em>
   Risk of Rain 2
  </em>
  is to not get hit. Tanking hits is a surefire way to an early grave, so dodging is extremely important. Sprinting is a good way to dodge many attacks, since it buys time to refresh survivor abilities, letting the player start the offensive anew.

 <p>
  However, Little Disciple makes even sprints deal damage, spawning a homing wisp every 1.6 seconds when the player is sprinting. These wisps do decent damage, and their spawn rate increases the more movement speed the player has. Since only the sprinting movement speed matters in this case, the Energy Drink synergizes extremely well with this boss item.

  The Molten Perforator is just another item that the players can create proc chains with. Each hit that the player does has a 10% chance of spawning three magma balls, each of which has a proc coefficient of 0.7, which is incredibly high. If all three magma balls hit a target, there is a high chance that they'll start a proc chain. These magma balls deal 300% damage and ignite enemies.

 <p>
  Since the magma balls spawned from the Molten Perforator don't have any tracking, they tend to miss a lot against small enemies. However, they show a great effect against large enemies, like the Grandfather or Elder Lemurians.

  With the Charged Perforator in the inventory, every hit that the player does has a 10% chance of calling down a lightning strike which deals 500% damage against the enemy. The best part is that the lightning strikes have a 1.0 proc coefficient, so they can trigger on-hit effects like Bleed, AtG's, Kjaro's, Runald's Bands, etc.

 <p>
  The high proc coefficient and high damage output of this item make it extremely attractive. Though the Molten Perforator is better against larger enemies, the Charged Perforator is great against smaller enemies as well as larger ones, making it the better choice in most situations.

  The quest starts right after you launch
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley

  with the new Act III: Treasures of Time update. You’ll see a cutscene where
  <strong>
   five weird Time Rifts
  </strong>
  appear across Eternity Isle. What's even more concerning is that Mickey is shown stuck between the past and present.

  First, find Merlin and talk with him. He’ll explain that Jafar’s magic is behind the strange things happening on the isle. The oddest of all is Mickey being stuck in time.

  After having a quick chat with Merlin, head over to Mickey and check out what’s going on with him. He will tell you that both he and Eternity Isle seem to be switching between a
  <strong>
   black-and-white world
  </strong>
  . Take this surprising news back to Merlin, and he’ll show you a hidden path that leads to Jafar’s palace.

  As you head toward the palace, a huge time rift will block your way. Merlin will explain that Jafar created this rift to prevent anyone from entering his palace, and to get past it, saviors will need to
  <strong>
   close all the other rifts around the Isle
  </strong>
  by using their imagination.

   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  shifts quickly compared to the state at release. For instance, Seele was an insane single-target DPS, and Jing Yuan was a top-tier AoE DPS. However, the meta soon changed with the release of powerful Destruction characters such as Blade, Jingliu, and Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae. Later on, it keeps shifting to comp such as the follow-up attack meta, especially with the release of units like Dr. Ratio, Robin, and Feixiao.

  In
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  2.5, HoYoverse potentially teases a plan for the future where players can focus on the summon niche. Characters who summon are those who have a companion that attacks on their own turn from the action order bar. For example, Topaz's Numby, or Jing Yuan's Lightning Lord. To emphasize this idea,
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  releases a Planar Ornament called The Wondrous BananAmusement Park. If players are wondering, here's

 <p>
  Equipping the The Wondrous BananAmusement Park Planar Ornament on your character will
  <strong>
   increase their Crit DMG by 16% without any requirements
  </strong>
  . However, during combat, if the character has their Summon active on the map, The Wondrous BananAmusement Park Planar Ornament will grant them an additional 32% Crit DMG. The only requirement here is to have the character’s Summon on the field with their own turns and actions.

 <p>
  Having an extra 48% Crit DMG is extremely beneficial for DPS units that have their own Summons in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . While there aren’t many characters who have this niche ability, it seems that the game is heading that way by releasing more characters that have their own Summons in the near future.

  Topaz summons Numby as soon as the battle starts, which immediately activates the full effect of The Wondrous BananAmusement Park set. As a Hunt unit in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , Topaz and Numby definitely need Crit DMG buff to their stats. Since the senior manager of the IPC will have a decent amount of Crit DMG, players can focus more on stacking Crit Rate while building her.

  Just like Topaz, Jing Yuan will summon his Lightning-Lord at the start of combat, which will also immediately activate the full passive of the Wondrous BananAmusement Park Relic Set. The Lightning-Lord will inherit Jing Yuan’s Crit, which will make the Summon hits hard for Jing Yuan in

  Although Lingsha is an Abundance unit in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , she still has an arsenal of AoE fire attacks. She also has a Summon that joins the field every time she uses her Skill, which makes it easy for her to get The Wondrous BananAmusement Park’s Crit DMG buff. Although Lingsha and her Summon, Fuyuan, heal based on her ATK%, it’s not ideal to maximize her ATK since she will be healing through every single attack she does. So, you can still build her with more Break and Crit DMG to ensure she’s as deadly as her sustainability.

      <title>6 Call Of Duty Games With Underappreciated Single-Player Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-call-of-duty-games-underrated-singleplayer-campaigns/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There are well over 24
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty
   </strong>
  </em>
  games, and it seems that the
  <em>
   COD
  </em>
  train isn't going to slow down anytime soon with the release of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  and beyond. Whilst
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is often known for its engaging and addicting multiplayer experience, and the electrifying Zombies mode,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  also deserves respect for providing players with some of the best stories ever put into gaming.

 <p>
  With so many eras to cover, and so many games in the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  series, it's no surprise that some titles have gone under the radar when it comes to their single-player campaigns. Some of the best
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  campaigns are lurking within hidden gems that some players might have avoided or not been familiar with.

 <p>
  A bold new future that does away with wars of the past and those of the modern variety.
  <em>
   Advanced Warfare
  </em>
  was Sledgehammer Games's debut into the
  <em>
   COD
  </em>
  life-cycle, and they did a great and innovative first job of ushering in a new era of combat with exo-suits. With a focus on the future,
  <em>
   Advanced Warfare
  </em>
  lost a few hardcore fans who preferred boots on the ground, and most players were too focused on the multiplayer to notice the campaign.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  The campaign itself is a chilling version of a future, ruled by powerful men and weapon manufacturers to keep the currency of war flowing. With Private Military Corporations becoming the dominant armed forces of every nation, players embark on conspiracy and security in the name of advancement.

  <em>
   Infinite Warfare

  takes players even further into the future than the series had ever seen, and players become captains of their own space vessels as they attempt to do battle with fanatics and ensure the safety of Earth with their defeat.
  <em>
   Infinite Warfare
  </em>
  excels at a campaign, especially in the relationship between the protagonist and E3N "Ethan", who has a few emotional and comedic moments to show that brotherhood grows in war even with machines.

  People have had enough of the futuristic wars and battlegrounds, so
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  decided to go back to its roots with World War 2, an oversaturated but pivotal war.
  <em>
   WW2
  </em>
  takes players across Europe as they engage in iconic WW2 battles with boots-on-the-ground gameplay. The locations are stunning, the adrenaline is pumping, and the respect for World War 2 is commendable.

 <p>
  World War 2 is monumental, and
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  respects the foundation of war and takes players across integral battles like D-Day to overthrow tyranny. Yet, most didn't even embark on
  <em>
   WW2
  </em>
  's story, as they were far too excited to get back on the ground with classic multiplayer and engage in the horrific twists of the zombie mode.

  One of the earlier iterations of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  , and its most important, is
  <em>
   World at War
  </em>
  , which took players across the World War 2 setting with two distinct storylines. The first, followed an American unit across Japan and the Pacific as they battled the Japanese Imperial Army against ambushes and unforeseen tactics that show the gritty realism of WW2.

 <p>
  The Eastern Front has the Soviet units of Russian soldiers battle their way to victory, with the Red Army fighting through German soldiers to capture the Reichstag through Berlin. It's an underrated
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  story, left forgotten mainly because of the debut of Nazi Zombies and its fun multiplayer on PS3 and Xbox 360 consoles.

  Taking to the future,
  <em>
   Ghosts
  </em>
  stays original to itself with a new story of a new timeline, leaving behind
  <em>
   Modern Warfare
  </em>
  to fight underwater and in space. A tale of predictable betrayal might not be the most memorable, but a cliffhanger ending always lingers on with
  <em>
   Ghosts
  </em>
  's focus on bringing realism to the near future.

  Many were disappointed upon the release of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Ghosts
  </em>
  when it was realized that it wasn't set to follow the iconic Ghost, everyone's favorite character from Infinity Ward's
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  . That, on top of a lackluster multiplayer that included strange DLCs like the Predator and Michael Myers, were key reasons why the campaign was forgotten.

  One of the more recent
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles brings players back to the
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  franchise, where once more they involve themselves with conspiracy and the brewing dangers of a Cold War with familiar faces like Woods and Mason. This time around, Bell takes center stage, a quiet operative with a blurred past that might unravel through the course of the campaign's length with MKUltra ties.

  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  has a decent campaign that goes through a different set of pathways depending on player choices, but it's a campaign that might be less memorable or forgotten by others due to being overshadowed by its next-gen potential of multiplayer and even more Zombies content.

  <strong>
   The stealth genre
  </strong>
  has come a long way, from its earliest incarnations in 1981's
  <em>
   Castle Wolfenstein
  </em>
  to contemporary efforts like
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Hitman
  </em>
  . One aspect of the stealth genre that has improved over the years is the way it tells stories, and specifically how it uses stories to drive its own gameplay systems.

 <p>
  These games use the game design philosophy of hiding from enemies to inform and drive their narrative, contextualizing the reasons that the player needs to stay hidden. These are games that rely on the content and narrative of their stories to push their design forward, and ones that have used stealth gameplay to compliment their epic tales.

   <strong>
    Alien: Isolation
   </strong>
  </em>
  takes place 15 years after the events of the first Ridley Scott-directed film, starring Ellen Ripley's daughter, Amanda, on a quest to find out what happened to her mother. Driven into the shadows by one of gaming's most terrifying stalker mechanics, the Xenomorph targets and hounds the player as they try to stay hidden.

 <p>
  Amanda's need to hide from the outrageously powerful and intelligent Xenomorph is what informs her quest, as staying alive in the dark, claustrophobic halls of the
  <em>

  is crucial to uncovering the secrets of Ellen's disappearance at the end of

  <em>
   Isolation

  replicates the raw need for survival and hiding within the confines of a story that moves at a wonderfully brisk pace, and this outstanding game is readily available on every platform today.

  Initially conceived as a sci-fi game intended to compete with
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell
   </strong>
  </em>
  eventually morphed into a cutting edge stealth title focused on real-world geopolitical events mixed with its own unique narrative. Protagonist Sam Fisher isn't designed to take a lot of damage, as he dies from two or three gunshots, so his efforts to stay hidden via the game's incredible light and shadow system become vital to survive.

  The ongoing story unfolds over nine missions, and it leads into each new level in such a wonderfully organic way.
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  features some phenomenal stealth systems, with an impressive mechanic that allows the player to be completely hidden by shadows. Its systems tie directly into the story, as Sam's presence in certain territories can be construed as an act of international war, which makes the need to stay hidden even more important. A
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake is currently in development at UbiSoft Toronto, where it will hopefully retain these brilliant aspects.

  was pretty quiet after the release of
  <em>

  in 2012, but developers IO Interactive targeted a soft reboot in 2016 that took Agent 47 back to the roots of the series. Known simply as
  <em>
   Hitman
  </em>
  , this globe-trotting tale focused on Agent 47's attempts to complete a series of assassinations in various parts of the world, such as Thailand, France and the United States.

  Using an episodic model,
  <em>
   Hitman
  </em>
  places the player inside an expansive sandbox where their ability to stay hidden from the wrong people falls to their own discretion. 47's mission plays out across these episodes in some of the finest forms of writing and dialogue in any game of the decade, as the narrative gives way to new targets, challenges, and uprooting of the player's plans.

  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  was a fairly high priority for UbiSoft back in the 2000s, as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Chaos Theory
   </em>
  </strong>
  saw a massive team work on it at various stages. Improving on the series' already fantastic mechanics,
  <em>
   Chaos Theory
  </em>
  adds a sound monitor that can trigger enemies based on Sam's movements, and refined lighting that further enhances the shadow system. All of these new systems work in tandem with the old ones, as series protagonist Sam Fisher's decidedly dark third chapter explores the sinister underworld of terrorism and political intrigue.

 <p>
  In the middle of growing tensions between China and Japan, as well as North and South Korea, an attempt to trigger a full-scale global war sends Sam to various locations such as New York, Peru, and Panama. The story is the tightest and most expertly written in the entire franchise, as Sam's quest to weave between these international conflicts in order to prevent all out war is at the center of the tale. It perfectly balances the tightrope act of telling a compelling story that intermingles in genius ways with its gameplay systems.

  After taking a break from his stealth-action simulation following
  <em>
   Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake
  </em>
  in 1990, series creator Hideo Kojima would bring the franchise back with the power of the PS1 in 1998. With new, advanced hardware at his disposal, Kojima sought to create a game that showcased feature film-levels of story and acting within the structure of a brilliant stealth-action experience.

 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>

  sees Snake come out of retirement to stop an armed terrorist group that has overtaken a base full of nuclear missiles, equipped only with his wits and a long list of skills. Snake's journey through Shadow Moses works brilliantly with Kojima's trademark writing style, as the story shifts from high-stakes drama to smaller, more personal beats in order to accommodate the game design systems.

  Taking influence from similar games like
  <em>
   Thief
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Deus Ex
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dishonored
   </em>
  </strong>
  was an attempt to revitalize the immersive sim genre and all the intricacies that come with it. Built on player choice and freedom,
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  is a game that takes place in a wonderfully unique world and sees Corvo Attano, the bodyguard of the Empress, betrayed and left for dead. Now on a quest for revenge and to rescue the Empress' kidnapped daughter, Emily, Corvo's journey takes him through the impressive and visually stunning city of Dunwall.

 <p>
  Developer Arkane Studios conceived a game that would task Corvo and the player with using a vast array of powers and skills, in conjunction with clever weapons, in order to tackle intense challenges. Backing all of this is a story built on intrigue, betrayal, and loyalty, and similarly to
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  , the player never leaves the first-person perspective of Corvo. Going on long, pensive boat rides as Samuel Beechworth gives updates on the ongoing tale is one of the highlights, while
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  uses a rich, highly detailed world in order to inform every aspect of its game design and push the player forward to its dramatic conclusion.

  Developed and published by China-based studio Game Science,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  was released for the PlayStation 5 and PC on Tuesday, August 20. The action RPG took no time to establish itself as a massive hit, especially in its home country.

  China Tops Steam Traffic Chart Following Black Myth: Wukong's Release
 </h2>
 <p>
  One data point indicative of its incredible success is the amount of traffic that China-based Steam users have generated since the game became available to play. According to Steam's global traffic map, Chinese gamers downloaded approximately 1.5 exabytes of data over the seven-day window ending August 25. That's the equivalent of 1.5 billion gigabytes, which accounted for more than 55% of all of Steam's global traffic during the observed period. For reference, China is already one of the platform's largest markets, as it is normally responsible for roughly one-third of its global download activity. But since
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  hit the market, the Steam traffic originating from the Far Eastern country has jumped by roughly 50%.

  This upward trend is consistent with what Game Science itself recently said about the commercial success of its latest title. Specifically, the Chinese studio revealed that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  surpassed 10 million sales just three days following its debut. While the developer did not provide a breakdown of this figure by platform, estimates from VG Insights and Gamalytic suggest that Steam alone is responsible for at least half of the game's lifetime sales as of this writing. The PC version of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is also available on the Epic Games Store.

  The ARPG has already become the most popular single-player game in Steam's history based on simultaneous player counts, having peaked at 2.415 million concurrent players two days following its release. This record was previously held by CDPR's
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , which had 1.054 million players shortly after its December 2020 debut. Another indicator testifying to its success is that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is currently the most streamed 2024 game on Twitch.

 <p>
  The RPG's critical reception has so far matched its early commercial success, as reflected in its "Strong" OpenCritic rating, which is derived from an aggregate score of 81 and a 73% reviewer recommendation rate. Its total sales are likely to be further bolstered by the Xbox Series X/S version of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , which has already been officially confirmed but is still lacking a release date.

    <ul>
     <li>
      Arkham Batman games are some of the best superhero video game franchise works, with Arkham Asylum being a classic revitalizing Batman's mythology.

     <li>
      Arkham Asylum's gameplay may not be as advanced as later games, but its immersive atmosphere and world-building are arguably unparalleled.
     </li>
     <li>
      While the Arkhamverse has evolved into open-world sequels and a live-service shooter, Arkham Asylum's elegance as a tighter Metroidvania entry remains satisfying and influential.

  Few superhero games have attained the same upper-echelon rank as the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  Batman installments. Not every
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  game has been fully beloved, particularly its spin-off companion pieces
  <em>
   Lockdown
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Blackgate
  </em>
  for
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham City
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  respectively, but the series as a whole is undoubtedly some of the best work in a superhero-related video game franchise, let alone superhero-related media overall.

  None of that would have been possible if
  <strong>
   <em>
    Batman: Arkham Asylum
   </em>
  </strong>
  wasn’t a classic revitalizing the World’s Greatest Detective’s mythology once more for a new audience, and everything that makes it a brilliant adaptation of
  <em>
   Batman: The Animated Series
  </em>
  through a 3D Metroidvania lens in a unique setting is even more appreciable a decade and a half later.
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  ’s gameplay may not be as all-encompassing as later games in the series and yet the amount of character, world-building, and atmosphere it evokes makes it instantly distinguishable from the rest.

  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  ’s treatment of Batman’s rogues’ gallery behaves like an
  <em>
   Animated Series
  </em>
  continuation without any of the baggage needed to know who any of them are. If
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  has proven anything in the last 15 years it’s that its world-building is phenomenal and plunges players into a deep well of lore by insisting that Batman has fascinating relationships with a handful of colorful villains already.

  Batman escorting an apprehended Joker to Arkham Island is one of countless times he’s probably had the pleasure of doing so, and how every villain incarcerated at the asylum responds to Batman illustrates the state their dynamic is in at the tail-end of the Caped Crusader’s sixth year of hunting criminals. This is where the rewarding collectible hunt for glowing green question mark trophies, scannable riddles, and chattering Joker teeth began, as well as the gruesome and enigmatic Chronicles of Arkham that unravel a mystery within the asylum’s walls and are exclusive to the titular game.

 <p>
  Interestingly,
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  ’s relatively truncated map debatably makes the pursuit of its collectibles more enjoyable due to them not being scattered over an open world, and the fact that they’re all tied to gadget-specific exploration, Easter eggs, or lore gives them substance. Moreover, the way lore is implemented is piecemeal and nourishing via patient interview tapes players can collect regarding each featured antagonist in
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  .

  The gloomy, archaic atmosphere baked into
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  ’s island courtyard, looming architecture backlit by an enormous moon, and dungeon-like facilities is complemented by a beautifully interwoven and artistic UI that future
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games would neglect for a more technology-focused aesthetic resembling the Batcomputer and Batman’s cowl capabilities. This is unique to
  <em>
   Asylum
  </em>
  and its art style, allowing it to remain an uncontaminated, singular, and timeless entry in the Arkhamverse that gushes with character in a way no other
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  game quite has—yet, anyway.

  How players might receive
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  ’s gameplay today is another question entirely and almost fully dependent on their fondness and memory of the sequels that followed it because
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Arkham Origins
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  adopted open-world formulas with dive-bomb gliding and grapnel-boosting to traverse interconnected maps.
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  is far more linear in its approach to objectives, what destinations players can or must reach, combat being simple with fewer gadgets and mechanics at Batman’s disposal, and Detective Mode investigations being more elementary.

 <p>
  Of course,
  <em>
   Asylum
  </em>
  is also the original
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  game and needed to plant its roots without an already seminal foundation to blossom from in subsequent Rocksteady releases and happened to do so with a fluid and gratifying freeflow combat system, an overwhelmingly immersive and engrossing atmosphere, and level designs heavily inspired by
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  in its 3D Metroidvania approach. Before its sequels could elaborate on combat further, Rocksteady’s rhythmic freeflow system in
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  was already galvanizing and emergent enough to inspire innumerable games that followed it.

  Rocksteady doesn’t have a patent on its iconic melee combat design; however, not many games can achieve anything as excellent without there at least being a mild, inescapable point of comparison to the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games. Even Camouflaj’s upcoming Meta Quest 3-exclusive
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  , knowing how paramount it is to the formula of an
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  game, is making a deliberate effort to adapt Rocksteady’s freeflow combat as well as every other feature that is intrinsic and invaluable to the Arkhamverse’s signature.

  Today, the Arkhamverse is nothing like its humble beginnings at the decrepit psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane. It would be a far cry from what
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  was even if the Arkhamverse had ceased at
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  thanks to the latter’s highly advanced freeflow, seamless Dual Play companion team-ups, and a fully functional and drivable Batmobile, too, but
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  has shifted Rocksteady in another direction completely.

  There are remnants of Rocksteady’s work on the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games in
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  , such as its famous blue counter prompts. Unfortunately, because the live-service multiplayer shooter is insufficiently tethered to

  </em>
  ’s events with hardly any exposition, it’s difficult to understand how the franchise landed where it is now as opposed to how it began.
  <em>
   Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  is thankfully shaping up to be a faithful return to what makes the
  <em>

  <em>
   Asylum
  </em>
  rare and authentic, though that hasn’t prevented studios from trying for the last 15 years.

  As long as Batman is popular, the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games will endure as a testament to how terrific
  <em>
   Asylum
  </em>
  is. Its influence is arguably as strong today as it was in 2009, which is demonstrative of how almost everything in
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum

  After redeeming the above-mentioned codes, players should try to earn Gems for achieving a certain speed, since this will also give them a good starting point. It is worth finding a slot machine with pets and buying some there, which will give players a little boost as well. After that, all they have to do is walk around and collect spheres, as well as jump through the rings. When players are confident enough in their abilities, they can participate in races.

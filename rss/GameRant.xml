   <strong>
    Alan Wake 2: The Lake House
   </strong>
  </em>
  DLC is a sizable expansion to the game with a new storyline, enemies, and weapons added in. Speaking of weapons, players finally get to use a grenade launcher against enemies in the game known as the "Black Rock Launcher." It's a powerful weapon that can obliterate painted enemies in the game. The best part about it is that you'll get it quite early in the DLC.

  <li>
   Go straight ahead, across the main hallways, and enter a corridor with glass offices on both sides.
  </li>
  <li>
   At the end of the hallway, make a left and enter an office with a save point. From here, head into the Control Center.
  </li>
  <li>
   Near the control panel, players will acquire the security level 02 keycard from the dead scientist.
  </li>
  <li>
   Proceed to clear out sublevel 2 (-2) by lifting the lockdown by using the code "220925" on the computer on the control panel. After the lockdown is lifted, escape the hoard of Taken and escape through the elevator.
  </li>
  <li>
   After reaching sublevel 1 (-1) through the elevator, head into the Panel Control Room.
  </li>
  <li>
   Here, interact with the switch to rearrange the paintings to open the path to the Inventory Management Office.
  </li>
  <li>
   Use the security level 02 keycard on the door and enter the office to grab the security level 03 keycard and the Black Rock Launcher.
  </li>

 <p>
  While playing
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a player created a mechanical rhinoceros, achieving impressive results. The
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  community enjoys testing the limits of the gameâ€™s building abilities, and this Rhino build is an excellent example of what is possible when using Ultrahand and a technique called quantum linking.

 <p>
  Despite being over a year old, players continue to return to
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , even without new DLC to check out. One reason for this ongoing relevance is Link's abilities in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , which allow players to build incredible contraptions. Long after the credits for the story roll, some players continue to engage with the game by creating new and inventive designs. Some of these creations even appear online, showcasing what can be made using various Zonai devices.

 <p>
  Recently, one player known as kmarkow on Reddit showcased their impressive rhinoceros built out of Zonai devices and other scraps found around
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  â€™s open world. Specifically, the player used things like Big Wheels, Stabilizers, and Queen Gibdo Wings to help create the machine. By utilizing these and other items, the player created a shape reminiscent of a rhinol, even including a horn on its head. In addition, kmarkow helped sell the look by creating a convincing walking cycle.

 <p>
  This unique design has caught the attention of other building enthusiasts on the Hyrule Engineering subreddit, with the post gaining hundreds of upvotes. In the comments, users complimented kmarkow on using Queen Gibdo Wings, saying it was a very creative yet suitable choice for the design. It is worth noting that the creator said quantum linking, a trick used to allow for better builds in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , was used to create the rhino.

  Beyond this recent Rhino build, kmarkow has built up an incredible list of creations in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . While the player has come up with all sorts of build ideas, they have created many other animal builds, in particular. For example, they previously built a mechanical kitten in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  that included feline features like pointed ears, whiskers, and a tail. Some other animal-themed creations they have shared on Reddit include a dinosaur, a bird, and a giraffe, to name a few.

  Hopefully, players like kmarkow will continue to create impressive machines in

  The third game in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  remake trilogy is in active development, a senior Square Enix official has revealed. This project status update was shared during a recent conference talk, which also yielded one more detail about what Square Enix has in store for the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  threequel.

 <p>
  The second entry in the RPG trilogy debuted in February 2024, releasing to widespread critical acclaim. And while
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  ended up being one of the highest-rated games in the long-running series, Square Enix said in May that the game fell short of sales expectations.

 <p>
  Nevertheless, the third and final entry in the trilogy is presently in the works and has already reached a significant milestone. During a recent appearance at the G-CON 2024 convention in South Korea,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  producer Yoshinori Kitase and director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that Square Enix mapped out the third game's plot and locked in its overall concept, marking the completion of its pre-production phase. As a result,
  <em>
   FF7 Remake Part 3
  </em>
  is already in active development, Kitase explained, as first reported by 4Gamer.

  FF7 Remake Part 3 Won't 'Cheat' With the Highwind Airship
 </h2>
 <p>
  While the company officials were mostly tight-lipped about the project's details, there was one aspect of the game that Hamaguchi proved willing to discuss during his convention appearance: the Highwind. Ever since Square Enix confirmed that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3
  </em>
  will feature the iconic airship, fans have been speculating about how the aircraft is going to be implemented. Some of the more pessimistic predictions were that the Highwind will simply be a substitute for a fast travel system.

 <p>
  Hamaguchi has now confirmed that this won't be the case. "We will not cheat with the system for the airship," he said, adding that the game will provide players with the freedom to actually fly around the map. Square Enix opted to take on this challenge largely because the Highwind will play an important part in the story of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3
  </em>
  , making it crucial to allow players to experience the game's world from a "higher perspective," Hamaguchi revealed.

 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3
  </em>
  still lacks an official release window. The first entry in the remake trilogy took roughly five years to develop, while
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  was completed in about four. The shorter development time is plausibly a result of Square Enix being able to reuse some of the
  <em>
   FF7 Remake
  </em>
  assets for
  <em>

  2004's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Half-Life 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is largely considered one of the best video game projects to ever come from Valve Software, with the title rightfully holding a place in discussion around the most influential first-person shooter releases of all time. The breathtaking graphical fidelity and physics mechanics of the title still hold up to this day, with the game doing a lot of work to solidify the wider franchise as an IP that is still the center of constant debate and anticipation.

  Despite the relative lull in Valve's gaming content in recent years, the studio still has a clear respect for the titles that helped place it firmly on the map of game development. For example, the original
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  celebrated its 25th anniversary last year, with Valve releasing a documentary regarding the game's development, as well as adding mini-campaigns, bug fixes, updated graphics, and brand-new multiplayer maps to the classic title.

 <p>
  This same treatment has thankfully been extended to
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  for its 20th anniversary, with Valve releasing another in-depth documentary about the creation of the 2004 title. In terms of changes to the game itself to mark the 20th anniversary, the most important is probably that Valve has made
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  free until November 18 at 10 AM PT, with players who grab the title before this date having permanent ownership of it through the Steam store.

  This generous celebratory offer just scratches the surface in terms of change, however, with
  <em>
   Half-Life 2

  on Steam including both the

  and
  <em>
   Episode 2
  </em>
  expansions, finally turning these three beloved
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  projects into a singular gameplay experience. Long-term fans of the title will also be thrilled to hear that the 20th-anniversary update has added developer commentary throughout
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  , being the perfect reason for returning fans to play through the game while occasionally hearing fascinating insight from Valve's original development team regarding the conceptualization and development of certain story elements, mechanics, enemies, and more.

  Another attractive addition for returning players is the fact that
  <em>
   Half-Life 2

  now has complete Steam Workshop integration, meaning fans can seamlessly download and experience a massive range of community-made mods and changes to create essentially endless new gameplay opportunities and perspectives. As expected, the 20th anniversary of
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  has also brought a wide range of fixes and improvements to general gameplay, with a massive list of UI, graphical, AI, audio, accessibility, customization, and rendering improvements creating the most complete and polished official version of

  </em>
  that fans have ever seen.

  </em>
  . While this sequel still seems as far away as ever, fans of the franchise and beyond now have the perfect opportunity to experience such an iconic title in the best state it has ever been in.

      <title>Why Fallout 5 Would Be the Perfect Time for a Fresh Take on the Brotherhood of Steel</title>

 <p>
  When
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 5
   </strong>
  </em>
  comes out, it might be good to see it provide a different take on the Brotherhood of Steel. Considering its history in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series, it feels like a virtual guarantee that the Brotherhood of Steel will make another appearance in
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  . For that reason, it will be important to make sure that the latest iteration has something special to offer. After all, the Botherhood of Steel has shown up plenty of times throughout
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's history.
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  will need to avoid its iteration of the group becoming a footnote in the long run.

 <p>
  Among the factions in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  universe, the Brotherhood of Steel has left one of the biggest footprints on the franchise. Appearing in every main game of the series as well as the TV show, the Brotherhood is a ubiquitous organization, operating out of seemingly every corner of the wasteland. The Brotherhood consider themselves to be guardians of technology, and can generally be seen wielding energy weapons and high-tech armor. How helpful or antagonistic the Brotherhood of Steel is has fluctuated depending on the game. However, players can always expect that wherever the latest
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  takes place, the Brotherhood will have a branch.

  The Brotherhood of Steel is Present Throughout the Fallout Series
 </h3>
 <p>
  Even new fans will likely know
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's Brotherhood of Steel thanks to its prominence in the Amazon Prime series. One of the protagonists, Maximus, is a member of the Brotherhood, and it plays a major role in his story as well as the overall plot. The same is true in other titles, even when the Brotherhood isn't a major player in the main plot. In
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  , a splinter faction of the Brotherhood were valuable allies, while in
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  , one of their leaders became a major villain in one of the DLCs.
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's Brotherhood of Steel always finds a way to be involved.

 <h3 id="fallout-has-already-told-a-lot-of-stories-about-the-brotherhood">
  Fallout Has Already Told a Lot of Stories About the Brotherhood

 <p>
  The Brotherhood's constant presence also provides a challenge. The story of
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  should seek to avoid retreading too much old ground, and the same is true for whatever the Brotherhood is doing in the game. Because the Brotherhood of Steel has been friendly, hostile, or anywhere in between depending on the game and the player's choices, they've already played several roles and tackled several plots. Players have seen defections, successions, and outright wars involving the Brotherhood of Steel in past entries. The return of the Brotherhood of Steel in
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  will need to show something new from the venerable faction.

 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  has plenty of new directions to take the Brotherhood of Steel.
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  could shake tradition by featuring a branch of the Brotherhood that isn't fully established, for instance. Whether it's a splinter faction or simply an area where the Brotherhood has yet to establish a presence, it could be interesting to see a version of the group that isn't yet entrenched. The player could even have an impact on the development of said faction through their actions during the game. This is only one of many options that
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  would have when it comes to its version of the Brotherhood of Steel.

 <p>
  The Brotherhood of Steel will likely return in
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  , and it could see an interesting new incarnation. The history of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's Brotherhood of Steel has been told throughout the series. The Brotherhood has offered both solid allies and powerful enemies to the series' protagonists in games past. After all, fans will have seen a lot of them by the time
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  comes out, especially after the TV series. It would be good to see
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  get truly creative with the Brotherhood of Steel.

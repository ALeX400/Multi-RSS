  Commendations are
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves'
  </em>
  equivalent of achievements or trophies. When a player does something that fulfills the specific requirements of a commendation, they will be rewarded one, just like an achievement would work. Sometimes, these may unlock titles or cosmetics that players can make use of. Other times, they may obtain Doubloons from completing them. This means that they are definitely something that players will want to make sure they are completing and keeping track of. That way, they can make the most of them.

      For example, a hilarious message in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC sees a player warned that they will be hit with an explosion after reading the message.

      In a video, the perfect timing of this player not is put on full display, as immediately after the message is read the explosion occurs.

  Player messages in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  sometimes turn out to be a bittersweet experience for those who come acros, and one user has highlighted a really hilarious one they found in one of the catacombs in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC. Messages have been a staple of the Soulsborne franchise for a long time, with players using the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  feature to help others or even deceive fellow Tarnished at times.

 <p>
  Many times, players use messages to give tips to others for fighting bosses or revealing hidden paths. One popular example of this is in one of the Crystal Tunnels in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , where one would find themselves dealing barely any damage to the area boss. However, numerous messages outside the boss arena suggest that players should try jump attacks, which end up quickly breaking the enemy's poise, making the fight a cakewalk. However, certain messages - like the ones around the fake invisible walls in
  <em>
   Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC - lure players to death.

 <p>
  In a new post on the
  <em>
   Elden Ring,
  </em>
  user ryuki987 showcases an extremely hilarious moment they experienced in one of the dungeons of the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC. In the video, the player makes their way through a stairway that has a couple of messages. The first one is merely a warning which asks them to "be wary of fire." However, it is the second one which is quite humorous, as the message is placed towards the end of the stairs and reads "First off, message, and then explosion!"

 <p>
  While it might sound like an innocuous message at first, it's the placement of the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  message that makes it so funny. Barely a few seconds after the player opens the message, they are hit by a fireball from the dungeon. The comedic essence of the moment is that the incident occurs slightly late after the message is opened, which pretty much coincides with the exact time a player would start reading the second sentence of the message which talks about the explosion.

  Just like the original poster, other players were quick to appreciate the comedic timing of the message, with some even calling it their favorite message in the game. This is not the only instance of players using messages in a creative way. In fact, players used something similar for one of the invisible bridges in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC. By placing messages at the edge of the bridge, they not only helped other players identify that it was a hidden path, but also marked the boundary to show others how to properly explore.

 <p>
  With summer underway,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
   </em>
  </strong>
  confirmed that players will face Sceptile the Unrivaled in Seven-Star Tera Raids running from late June to early July. The upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  Seven-Star Tera Raid boss is the final starter Pokemon from the Hoenn region to be featured as a challenge for seasoned trainers and their teams.

 <p>
  Known as the Forest Pokemon, Sceptile first appeared in
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire
  </em>
  . Sceptile is the fully evolved form of Treecko and Grovyle and is usually a pure Grass-type Pokemon. Unlike its counterparts, Blaziken and Swampert, Sceptile is a speed-focused special attacker, with access to moves including Energy Ball, Dragon Pulse, and Focus Blast that can take advantage of it. Sceptile can also use bolstering moves like Dragon Dance, Agility, and Double Team to give itself breathing room against strong foes. However, the lowest stats it has are in Defense and HP. Sceptile can be obtained in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk
  </em>
  by fully evolving a Treecko caught in the Terarium's Canyon Biome.

  As
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet players
  </em>
  dispatch Emboar the Unrivaled, a new challenge will soon appear for them to face. According to Serebii.net, the Seven-Star Tera Raid battle against Sceptile the Unrivaled will begin Thursday, June 27, at 8:00 PM Eastern, and end Sunday, June 30, at 7:59 PM Eastern.
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  trainers who miss the first round will get a second chance the following weekend, from July 4 to 7, at the same starting and ending times. Sceptile the Unrivaled will have the Dragon type as its Tera type, and it will grant the Mightiest Mark to all Pokemon that defeat it.

 <p>
  Sceptile the Unrivaled's Tera type is a callback to its Mega Evolution form, which first appeared in
  <em>
   Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire
  </em>
  . Sceptile's Dragon-type moves, including Dragon Tail and Breaking Swipe, will be amplified. However, the Forest Pokemon has a few flaws for trainers to exploit. Its Hidden Ability, called Unburden, will not be a factor, as Tera Raid boss Pokemon usually do not hold items. While Dragon Pokemon are formidable, Fairy-type Pokemon will render some of Sceptile's moves useless. With low physical defenses, Fairy attacks like Play Rough will also hit the Forest Pokemon hard.

  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  creative director and
  <strong>
   FromSoftware
  </strong>
  studio head Hidetaka Miyazaki has revealed that he'd like to take a shot at developing a traditional JRPG someday. The acclaimed game designer has largely been recognized for his work on Soulslikes in recent years, so seeing him express interest in making a title in a genre atypical of his past efforts is a bit surprising. Regardless, the prospect of a JRPG helmed by the creators of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  would likely set certain corners of the FromSoftware fanbase ablaze with excitement.

 <p>
  Although FromSoftware is nowadays best known for being the studio behind massively successful titles like
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , the company has a rather eclectic library of games in its lengthy development portfolio. FromSoft initially made its debut with the bizarre
  <em>
   King's Field
  </em>
  series of action RPGs. Afterward, the company branched out and worked on a wide variety of other games, like the 3D platformer
  <em>
   The Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream
  </em>
  and the cult-classic hack-and-slash
  <em>
   Otogi
  </em>
  . Ever since Hidetaka Miyazaki became president of the studio in 2014, though, FromSoftware has largely pigeonholed itself into a few genres. This hasn't necessarily been a bad thing for the company, but Miyazaki is nonetheless looking to shake things up.

 <p>
  During an interview with Rolling Stone, Miyazaki stated that he's interested in experimenting with new genres outside the Soulslike formula that FromSoftware established with its brutally difficult games. Specifically, he mentioned that part of him wants to create a traditional JRPG. While Miyazaki has yet to make such a game, FromSoftware itself has actually developed a JRPG before. After all, in 2006, the company released a Japanese role-playing game, published — oddly enough — by Ubisoft, for the Xbox 360 named
  <em>
   Enchanted Arms
  </em>
  . Though this particular title wasn't received all that well, if Miyazaki were to make a game in a similar vein, it could end up being something special.

 <p>
  Despite Miyazaki's interest in developing a JRPG, don't expect FromSoftware to release
  <em>
   Enchanted Arms 2
  </em>
  anytime soon. In fact, don't expect the company to return to the worlds of most old FromSoft games at all under Miyazaki's leadership, as the studio head isn't interested in creating new entries in franchises that he wasn't involved in the creation of. Explaining this stance of his, Miyazaki said that he thinks "a lot of these games are so intertwined with the directors who almost invented that style of game." As such, he doesn't see a scenario where he himself "would make a
  <em>
   King’s Field
  </em>
  . The same can be said about
  <em>
   Otogi
  </em>
  and

  FromSoftware's current approach of sticking to only a few genres has paid dividends for the company, as evidenced by the recent release of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's new DLC, the critically-acclaimed
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  expansion. Even still, it would be interesting to see
  <strong>
   FromSoftware
  </strong>
  and Miyazaki branch out by making a traditional JRPG in the vein of a
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  game.

  Among the games in the
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  franchise, the setting of each title is what attracts the most attention, changing with each new release. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  players are transported to the rural region of Hope County, which shares common geography with many interior regions of the United States, featuring vegetable pastures and beautiful landscapes.

 <p>
  Furthermore, Hope County is also marked by violence. This rural town is under the domineering control of the enigmatic Joseph Seed and his followers. Beyond the hidden dangers, the rural landscape of Hope County conceals deep secrets, with cults and conspiracies hidden in every corner. The natural beauty of the region strongly contrasts with the constant tension of imminent violence.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  stands out among games set in rural towns by portraying a post-apocalyptic scenario in a setting inspired by the interior of West Virginia, a region that was not as affected by the nuclear fallout, and thus maintaining part of its pre-war landscapes. This robust and detailed setting creates a sense of isolation for players, capturing the essence of small rural communities amid nuclear devastation.

 <p>
  The iconic soundtrack, "Country Roads," reinforces the emotional connection with the rural environment, serving as the game's theme. Although there are some cities, they are not the main focus, allowing players to explore vast countrysides and appreciate the true essence of games set in rural towns.

  Given the context, farming simulators are great games set in rural towns, but among the many options available,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stardew Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the one that best captures the essence of the countryside. Pelican Town is a small place, but it is full of interesting people to meet and plenty of content to explore.

 <p>
  Moreover, the game features some classic elements of farming games, such as inheriting the farm from a deceased grandfather and abandoning life in the big city in search of the peace that only the countryside can offer. The simplicity of Pelican Town offers a relaxing experience, allowing players to enjoy the best of country life.

  Few gaming genres are quite as addictive as the
  <strong>
   survival genre.
  </strong>
  They tend to be a singularly focused experience that boils down to one deceptively simple task: staying alive. When survival games are done right, they can be a uniquely immersive experience that appeals to some deep-down part of us which longs for a time before the trappings of modern life.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The truly great survival games, however, go beyond this simple goal to hook their players. For example, the best survival horror games use our fight or flight response and fear of things that go bump in the night to keep us playing. The same part of our brain that makes us watch movies that scare us to death. All that truly great survival games need, though, is
  <strong>
   a really atmospheric setting
  </strong>
  . Rather than relying on a good story, realistic systems, or scares in these games, it is the setting itself that drives the survival experience. All the games on this list are primarily survival games, although they might dip their toes into other genres. They've been ranked on a
  <strong>
   combination of their overall quality as well as how atmospheric their settings are.
  </strong>

  Looking at
  <strong>
   <em>
    DayZ's
   </em>
  </strong>
  screenshots, one could be forgiven for thinking it doesn't look terribly atmospheric. It's never been the prettiest game, and its Eastern-European Chernarus map doesn't look much different from the maps of countless other copycat games. Newcomers can expect plenty of open fields, dense woodlands, and spartan towns filled with scare-free zombies (this is a rare zombie game that isn't horror). Yet it can still be an incredibly atmospheric game.

 <p>
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  gets this atmosphere from its PVP element. One moment things are nice and quiet, and the next players are ducking for cover as an unseen enemy starts taking potshots from afar. Hiding in an abandoned building and listening to a squad of potentially hostile players loot the surrounding area can feel downright oppressive. The game's zombies can also be pretty creepy. Sure, they're little more than a nuisance for experienced players, but they're an ever-present threat capable of finishing off an unprepared wanderer. On the downside, extended periods with no enemy player interactions can sap the game's atmosphere, making it a drag. That and the fact that, even after all these years,
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  still feels unfinished, lands it in the bottom ranking here.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pathologic 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a survival game like no other. Technically a psychological survival horror, it features enough emphasis on traditional survival elements to earn a spot on this list. More structured than most survival games,
  <em>
   Pathologic 2
  </em>
  is a story-focused experience that is made up of four acts that are spread over 12 in-game days. Players must juggle thirst, hunger, infection, and exhaustion stats while trying to make sense of a story that is so complex it feels designed to invoke migraines (in the best way possible).

  <em>
   Pathologic 2's
  </em>
  survival mechanics are unforgiving, and the game is designed in such a way that making the "right" moral decision often comes at the cost of making survival even harder. What truly makes
  <em>
   Pathologic 2
  </em>
  so special, though, is the setting. Described by one of its creators as a "pain simulator,"
  <em>
   Pathologic 2
  </em>
  constantly generates a sense of dread and helplessness. The game is set in a bleak, decaying town in the middle of nowhere that is being torn apart by a mysterious plague. The town itself is twisted and unsettling in design, while many of the NPCs who inhabit it are exceedingly odd. The game's sound design adds to this crushingly disconcerting atmosphere, using strange ambient noises and weird music to add to the psychological torment. This all adds up to a unique survival experience that is arguably an undiscovered masterpiece. This being said, its brutal difficulty and unending misery aren't for everyone, and its brilliant use of atmosphere will likely be too much for some players. For these reasons alone,
  <em>
   Pathologic 2
  </em>
  gets a lower ranking than some may think it deserves.

  It's hard to come up with a survival game with a more interesting setting.
  <strong>
   <em>
    We Happy Few
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes place in an alternate history (1960s) England, where an authoritarian government has seized control and keeps the population passive using a drug called Joy. It's one of the best story-driven survival games ever made, featuring three protagonists, each of whom has a distinct but interconnected narrative. In a cool twist, each protagonist also comes with slightly adjusted survival mechanics that reflect their respective narratives. The first, Arthur Hastings, is the most vanilla, but his gameplay focuses on the repercussions of giving up Joy. The next protagonist, Sally Boyle, must look after herself while also caring for her newborn child. The most difficult is arguably the final character, Ollie Starkley, who is great in a fight, but his diabetes makes controlling his hunger meter a nightmare.

 <p>
  The game received mixed reviews, but most critics praised its 1984-flavored atmosphere of all-consuming paranoia. The NPCs of
  <em>
   We Happy Few
  </em>
  are relentlessly paranoid, and the player is always being watched — either by civilians, the police, or CCTV cameras that can detect Joy. Of the game's three main settings, the Village of Hamlyn is easily the most atmospheric. Inhabited by joy-addicted Wellies, it appears bright and cheerful on the surface, but there's no ignoring its rotten core. The Garden District, on the other hand, reveals the game's biggest weakness. Placed on the outskirts of Hamlyn, it's where the poor and rejected live and is in a constant state of disrepair. It could have been deeply atmospheric, but the game's use of procedural generation means the area is often empty, forcing the player to trek miles from one interesting place to the next. This over-reliance on wonky procedural generation, and the fact the DLCs abandoned the survival element altogether, mean
  <em>
   We Happy Few
  </em>
  receives a lower ranking.

  Both
  <strong>
   <em>

   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Sons of the Forest
   </em>
  </strong>
  are similarly atmospheric, so we've included them as one entry. Both feature similar settings that don't look all that atmospheric at first glance. The coastlines, forests, and snowy mountains of both games look much the same as many other survival titles. In the opening hours, these games can almost feel relaxing as the player takes in their seemingly idyllic surroundings, focusing on the usual busy work of finding food and water and building a simple base. Then the enemies start showing up.

  Both games excel at mimicking the feeling of being watched. Initially, enemies don't just turn up and attack. The player will start spotting scouts in their peripheral vision, watching from a distance. Then those scouts call in friends, and before the player knows it, they're slowly being surrounded. Both games' cannibal monsters are pretty much always hunting the player, and use some impressive AI to do so. This constant sense of unease is reinforced with some impressive environmental storytelling and gloriously unsettling interior environments. Both islands feature labyrinth networks of caves full of not just cannibals, but also their leftovers. With limited light sources and scarce resources, each cave dive is a journey into the terrifying unknown. Unfortunately, both games in the series fail to keep their use of atmosphere going. These might be some of the best cannibal horror games early on, but it doesn't take long for the player to start feeling empowered. Once that happens, the cannibals stop being scary, and much of the atmosphere starts to fall away.

  A survival game set in someone's backyard doesn't sound particularly atmospheric, let alone like one of the best survival games for nature exploration. However, it turns out that shrinking the player to the point that they're smaller than an ant so that blades of grass resemble skyscrapers, even the most mundane garden can appear denser and more atmospheric than the Amazon. The premise behind
  <strong>

  opening areas excel at making the player feel small. The areas are relatively open and bright, revealing massive structures in the distance. Just a little bit off the beaten track, the player will find giant ants, spiders, and other bugs that dwarf them. Other areas — especially interiors, with their cramped conditions and dark lighting — make for deeply claustrophobic atmospheres that make the player yearn for the expansive outdoors. Wherever the player may be,

   <em>
    This War of Mine

  </strong>
  is an endlessly bleak and depressing game where every decision the player is forced to make is designed to leave a knot in their stomach. Inspired by the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War (1992–1996), it's dedicated to accurately depicting what it feels like for the innocent civilians who get caught up in wars not of their making. Plenty of games have paid lip service to accurately recreating warfare, but
  <em>
   This War of Mine
  </em>
  is the real deal.

  Players spend the game controlling a group of survivors who are holed up in a procedurally-generated building. They must keep these survivors healthy, fed, watered, and psychologically stable, which is easier said than done. Survival means making tough moral decisions that will leave survivors psychologically scarred. The game's muted, monochromatic art emphasizes the its depressing setting. Every building is dilapidated, and often the only thing that can be heard is either weeping, or the sound of distant gunfire. Other survivors the player meets while scavenging will either beg for pity or attack on sight. The tension is constant and the game's dedication to its oppressive atmosphere is emotionally draining. Even if the player "wins" by surviving until the end of the war, the game makes sure they feel like they lost.
  <em>
   This War of Mine
  </em>
  is one of the best survival games set in a city, but it's also a harrowing experience many gamers will never finish.

  When it comes to atmosphere,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Subnautica
   </em>
  </strong>
  pulls off a balancing act that few other survival games have managed to achieve. At any given moment, it can feel immersive, wondrous, mysterious, or simply terrifying. The shallows of planet 4546B's vast ocean are bright and beautiful. There are few threats, resources are plentiful, and ignoring the ticking time bomb that is the Aurora, the atmosphere in the game's early hours is one of relaxed exploration.

  The deeper one gets into
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  , though, the more its atmosphere begins to change. It gradually becomes clear that there is a greater mystery at play, and a general sense of unease begins to permeate the environment.
  <em>
   Subnautica's
  </em>
  deep-sea areas are vast, dark, and full of ominous silence. The sense of ease fostered by the early areas is replaced with foreboding. Much like in
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  , these areas do an excellent job of making the player feel small. The only stumbling block comes on the odd occasion where the player is forced to step foot on dry land. These areas just don't feel as atmospheric, making exploring them more of a drag than an exciting change of pace.

  Thankfully, most of us will never get stranded in the Amazon Rainforest. For those who are curious, though, there's always
  <strong>
   <em>
    Green Hell
   </em>
  </strong>
  . One of the best co-op survival games ever made, it uses its realistic setting and hardcore survival mechanics to create a deeply immersive atmosphere that brings the Amazon to the player's living room. For a start, the game is gorgeous to look at. Its Amazon is lush and densely populated with real-world flora and fauna that pop visually.

 <p>
  This is backed up by some clever sound design. The rainforest is full of ambient noises like wildlife in the brush, rustling leaves, and distant flowing water, all of which add to the sense of being lost in a real environment. It sounds idyllic until one remembers the constant threat from wildlife, and the predators that think the player is dinner. If those ambient sounds go quiet, it's probably time to run.
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  is a survival game that prioritizes realism in almost every aspect of its gameplay, which is reflected in its atmosphere. Richly atmospheric and thrilling to play, only one other game can keep it from the top spot.

  In many ways,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Long Dark
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an inferior survival game to other high-up entries on this list. Its graphics are more simplistic, the survival mechanics lack depth; it's a survival game with no base building and, after seven years of constant development,
  <strong>
   it still isn't finished
  </strong>
  . Despite these flaws, it deserves the top spot thanks to its brilliantly atmospheric setting and accessible take on survival gameplay.

 <p>
  The game is set in Canada's frozen wilderness. Some mystery apocalyptic event has plunged the world into a seemingly endless winter that has also cut the area off from the outside world. The player must keep protagonist Will Mackenzie alive while he tries to work out what is going on. Survival means scavenging for food and water, crafting, and doing one's best to stay warm. The game's setting excels at making the player feel alone, and makes good use of environmental storytelling to hint at what happened to both the world at large and this region's missing inhabitants. The game's graphics are simple but highly stylized, while its spartan sound design emphasizes the sense of isolation. More than anything, though, the game excels at making the player shiver. Its use of atmosphere is so convincing that every time the player is forced to send Will out into the cold, they'll find themselves shivering.

  One clever
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player paid tribute to a legendary figure in the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  community with a customized in-game costume based on the now-iconic player Let Me Solo Her. Before appearing in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  courtesy of one of their fans, Let Me Solo Her gained fame in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  for their activities surrounding one of the game's most challenging boss fights.

 <p>
  The legend of Let Me Solo Her continues to spread, with their influence even leaving the game in which it was built. Also known as Klein Tsuboi, Let Me Solo her is famous not just for mastering the notoriously difficult battle against Malenia, Blade of Miquella, but for helping many get past her. Using
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's unique multiplayer features, Let Me Solo Her challenged and defeated Malenia thousands of times in other players' games, wearing nothing but a pot and no other gear in a classically silly-looking "naked" build.

 <p>
  Now
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  player Working_Long_5931 has attempted to capture some of Let Me Solo Her's selfless spirit using armor parts and shaders meant for a
  <em>
  </em>
  Titan Guardian. They shared their costume with the DestinyFashion Reddit community, delighting its members. Their costume falls in line with other similarly silly costumes, like one that turned a
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Titan into a giant banana.

 <p>
  Working_Long_5931 did admit to running into some limitations in their attempt to capture Let Me Solo Her's appearance using
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  's transmog system. Though it's surprisingly versatile, the
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  armor customization system greatly favors fully clothed characters, and nearly every

  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  Naked Build wearing almost no gear bar a pot helmet and a default loincloth.

 <p>
  Given the need to have clothes, Working_Long_5931 tried their best, using the Bungie 30th Anniversary armor ornaments for their organic, skin-like appearance. They used the
  <em>
   Marathon
  </em>
  -like Pforian Plate and Greaves, and the form-fitting Augmented Auspice ornament for the Synthoceps Exotic Arms. These pieces were given a "skin tone" courtesy of the plain Desert Matte color shader. Meanwhile, the Knightly Noire mark approximated a loincloth. Finally, though
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  has no pots to put on as a helm, the Halloween-like Festival of the Lost provided a Jack-o'-Lantern mask that proved useful. Working_Long_5931 also suggested that players that own it can substitute using the using the Traveler Mask, which is featureless and thus closer to Let Me Solo Her's head-pot.

 <p>
  Players were amused by the attempt to bring a touch of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's community into
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . One suggested that the Cauldron Head mask available would be a good alternative, while others thought that the bone-like textures and Jack-o'-Lantern face might also work for a player looking to cosplay as Jack Skellington, protagonist of
  <em>
   The Nightmare Before Christmas
  </em>
  . Others joked that any player attempting to capture Let Me Solo Her's brilliance in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  must now defeat the raid boss Riven "1,000 times" to pay tribute.

  <strong>
   Strategy games
  </strong>
  are some of the most popular among the gaming community. They've earned this title not only because they've been around for decades, but also because they're very interesting and fun to play. From the different strategic approaches players can take to defeat their enemies in battle, to the enticing stories most titles tell, there's always fun to be had.

  Games like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Age of Empires 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  laid the foundations for many other strategy games that would come in later years. And while resource management, harvesting and observing the growth of civilizations is fun, the stakes are raised when a strategy title is focused on war, specifically in a tumultuous period like World War 2. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best strategy games that focus on wars.

  Diving into the grand strategy aspects of World War 2,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hearts of Iron 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  allows players to control any nation involved in the conflict and influence the war on a worldwide scale. Unlike other strategy games that only look at certain aspects of war, this title places full focus on conflicts of this nature, showing every gruesome detail that takes place on the battlefield. To survive and defeat the enemy, players will have to manage their resources carefully and allocate them to different areas to keep them from being damaged or taken.

 <p>
  Players can also choose to avoid engaging in open combat and opt for diplomacy, exchanging deadly bullets for a sharp silver tongue. Decision-making is key, as one false step can detonate a large armed conflict that costs the lives of hundreds of soldiers and precious resources.
  <em>

  When most people think about great empires and unstoppable forces, the first thought that likely comes to their minds is the Roman Empire. This is not thanks to the 2005 series
  <em>
   Rome,
  </em>
  or Ridley Scott's blockbuster
  <em>
   Gladiator
  </em>
  , but rather to the astounding historical evidence of Roman prowess.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Rome: Total War
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the perfect tribute to the massive fallen empire of the ancient world, as it accurately depicts Roman commanders and their legions of soldiers as they marched to conquer new territories.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rome: Total War
  </em>
  combines real-time warfare tactics with turn-based game mechanics and has a strong focus on expansion through war. Players will no doubt spend hours devising different strategies to lay siege to any opposing forces and eventually bring them to heel under the rule of the one true empire.

  <em>

  also features elements of trade and politics that add another layer of complexity to the game and provide players with additional hours of fun. Unlike some other games in this genre,
  <em>
   Europa Universalis 4
  </em>
  stands out because it focuses on territory expansion over the centuries, rather than remaining in a single era. Granted, this isn't anything new, as
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  popularized the concept several years ago, but can there ever be enough games revolving around the advancement of civilization? Probably not.

  An
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan shares a helpful video that shows numerous ways that Cassidy is a vertical hero. Many
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  characters are vertically focused like Pharah and D.Va, but some players may not realize that Cassidy is among them.

  When
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  was released, it added some new characters alongside the heroes from the original game. As
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  switched from a 6-player system to 5-players, some of the originals received nerfs and buffs. Among the heroes that received drastic changes were Doomfist, Orisa, and Bastion. Damage hero Cassidy also saw changes to his Combat Roll and Deadeye Ultimate Ability, and his Flashbang Grenade was replaced with a Magnetic one. Because these characters saw a few key adjustments, some fans of the first game have struggled to adjust to their new styles. One gamer has discovered a way to utilize his abilities to make him a vertically-based hero.

  Reddit user EdenGLHF recently shared an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  clip highlighting various ways that players can use Cassidy's Combat Roll to play vertically. The video starts by showing the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Damage hero near the Attacking team's entrance on the Dorado map. The player faces a column that leads down the stairs to the nearest door, using the Combat Roll to reach the roof of the main building the defenders shoot down from. Gamers will know when they've successfully performed the vertical Combat Roll when Cassidy jumps to a higher platform at its conclusion. The montage subsequently shows the player using the same trick on different obstacles to reach high areas of Nepal, Hollywood, Rialto, Route 66, Eichenwalde, and King's Row.

 <p>
  Beyond reaching higher places in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  maps, this video highlights ways that Cassidy can get out of trouble. The player utilizes Cassidy's Combat Roll to climb to the second floor from the small room next to the Nepal Sanctum capture point, which has a Health pack. A major advantage to getting Cassidy higher is the ability to highlight more enemies using his Deadeye Ultimate ability. Some players below may not expect Cassidy to be in high areas, causing them to scan the standard playing field as his dialogue plays. This could result in multi-kills or even team wipes if players effectively utilize the Combat Roll strategy.

 <p>
  While Cassidy's roll ability doesn't initially seem like it can be used to reach higher places, EdenGLHF's video highlights its potential utility. Although this doesn't allow Cassidy to rival the verticality of Pharah or D.Va, it may help some players gain an advantage over their opponents. As Blizzard regularly updates
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , this aspect of Cassidy's Combat Roll may be nerfed in the future.

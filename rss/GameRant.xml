      <title>Koei Tecmo’s AAA Growth Plans Could Be Great News for Fighting Game Fans</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead or Alive
   </em>
  </strong>
  was, at one point, one of the most popular fighting game franchises on the market, alongside the likes of
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  . When the first entry in the series was released internationally for arcades in 1996, it took the gaming world by storm. The game sold so well, in fact, that it saved its publisher, Tecmo, from going bankrupt. Later installments in the
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  franchise also had similar commercial success.
  <em>
   Dead or Alive 3
  </em>
  , as an example, was one of the top 10 best-selling games on the original Xbox, while
  <em>
   Dead or Alive 4
  </em>
  and its free-to-play counterparts were downloaded more than 12 million times.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  series technically isn't dead, but it hasn't received a new mainline installment in quite some time. The last proper fighting game in the franchise was 2019's
  <em>
   Dead or Alive 6
  </em>
  , which garnered a somewhat contentious reputation among fans due to its excessive monetization. Aside from the occasional Asia-exclusive spin-off title like
  <em>
   Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Scarlet
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Venus Vacation Prism: Dead or Alive Extreme
  </em>
  , the franchise's lead developer, Team Ninja, has largely shifted its focus towards other intellectual properties within the last few years. That being said, some recent news regarding Koei Tecmo, the Japanese firm that owns Team Ninja, suggests that the next chapter of
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  may happen sooner rather than later.

  Koei Tecmo Wants to Move Away from Mobile Games and Double Down on AAA Releases
 </h3>
 <p>
  During a shareholder Q&amp;A session, Koei Tecmo shared its outlook on the future of the gaming industry and its plans to adapt to market trends. One of the major topics that the company discussed at the event was mobile gaming. While Koei Tecmo isn't a major player in the mobile game market, it has adapted several of its flagship franchises for iOS and Android in recent times, including
  <em>
   Atelier
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Nobunaga's Ambition
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Romance of the Three Kingdoms
  </em>
  . In spite of these efforts, Koei Tecmo intends to scale back its investments in mobile gaming because, according to the firm, "significant growth is unlikely to be seen" in the field.

 <p>
  Instead of trying to increase its presence in the mobile game market, Koei Tecmo wants to double down on AAA video game development. Due to the recent success of big-budget video games from China and Korea (presumably
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  , among other titles), Koei Tecmo believes that the console and PC game market will grow in the near future. Because of this, it aims to release AAA video games on an annual basis going forward. In order to achieve this lofty goal, the company intends to double its employee headcount from 2,500 to 5,000 in the coming years.

  Bringing Dead or Alive Back Makes Sense, Considering Koei Tecmo's Current Plans
 </h3>
 <p>
  Given how much renewed interest Koei Tecmo is showing in the AAA game market, the release of a new mainline
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  game seems more likely than ever. In fact, a recent statement from a developer at Team Ninja adds further credence to the idea. In an interview with TouchArcade from February 2024,
  <em>
   Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty
  </em>
  director Masakazu Hirayama was asked if Koei Tecmo had any interest in reviving the
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  franchise. While Hirayama did state that the company didn't have plans to bring the series back at the time, he said that it was "always considering the possibility" of making more
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  games.

 <p>
  The fighting game genre is currently undergoing a bit of a renaissance, in no small part due to the release of critically-acclaimed games like
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  . Since Koei Tecmo is so adamant about expanding its footprint in the AAA market, it would be wise of them to capitalize on this resurgence by bringing the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead or Alive
   </em>
  </strong>
  series back with a new, numbered installment.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario Party Jamboree
   </strong>
  </em>
  's initial sales figures are in, and it took no time at all for the game to become October's best-selling Nintendo title. Switch-era games like
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
  </em>
  have set a trend of taking Nintendo's long-established series to new heights, both in terms of scale and popularity. It seems like
  <em>
   Super Mario Party Jamboree
  </em>
  will keep the streak going as it rockets to the top of Nintendo's sales charts.

  This latest entry in the series that will break people apart as quickly as it brings them together is its biggest yet.
  <em>
   Super Mario Party Jamboree
  </em>
  has seven boards, 22 playable characters, and over 100 mini-games, all available at launch. The title also allows players to compete against up to 20 other gamers via online matchmaking, introducing a whole new level of challenge and excitement. It's only natural that such a massive step for the franchise would spur equally huge sales figures.

  Nintendo released
  <em>
   Super Mario Party Jamboree
  </em>
  on October 17, and it didn't take long for people to jump on the chance to play it. According to a BlueSky post by gaming industry analyst Mat Piscatella,
  <em>
   Jamboree
  </em>
  was the number-one-selling game for Nintendo systems in the U.S. for October. That's an impressive climb to the top, considering the title was only out for half the month and had other big recent releases like
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shadow X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  to compete against.

  Rounding out the top 10 is a mix of new and old Switch titles. Unsurprisingly, Nintendo mainstays
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  made up the rest of the top three, the former of which was September's number-one bestseller. Being able to beat that one out for the top spot is no small feat, but it may have helped that
  <em>
   Super Mario Party Jamboree
  </em>
  leaked ahead of its release, giving some people the chance to play it and build excitement before it was officially out.

  The latest
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  is a success in more than just its initial sales performance, too. Right now,
  <em>
   Jamboree
  </em>
  is the best-rated
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  title on OpenCritic, boasting an impressive score of 81. That may not be all that impressive for video games as a whole, but it's new ground for Nintendo's board game-inspired series. Considering all this, it's safe to say that
  <em>
   Jamboree
  </em>
  isn't just the biggest
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  yet, but may be one of the best.

  Christopher Judge, the actor behind Kratos in the most recent
  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War
   </em>
  </strong>
  games, recently clarified comments he previously made surrounding a possible announcement for the beloved franchise. Santa Monica Studios’ Norse-based
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  games have helped bring the franchise to new heights, with both 2018’s
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  and 2022’s
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  earning near-universal acclaim. Last winter saw the release of
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla
  </em>
  , a DLC expansion that gave players a roguelike experience in which Kratos confronted his violent past once more.

 <p>
  Over the past month or so, rumors started to spread that Sony is getting ready to make a new
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  announcement, with insiders claiming that this announcement will happen at either The Game Awards 2024 next month or a subsequent PlayStation State of Play or Showcase. This speculation would only intensify after current Kratos actor Christopher Judge hinted that certain “announcements” would be made soon, with his use of Kratos’s “Boy” line causing fans to instantly speculate that more
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  news was on the horizon.

  However, Christopher Judge recently clarified his past comments in a Twitter post, saying that he currently knows nothing about any kind of
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  announcement. Judge added that he was simply referring to some personal announcements he will make in the near future that aren’t connected to “our
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  ,” and that he is just as in the dark about Santa Monica Studios’ plans as everyone else.

  There have been plenty of rumors about what the next
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  game will be about, as
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  served as the finale of Kratos’s journey through the lands of Norse mythology alongside his son Atreus. Some fans believe that a spin-off centered around Atreus will be the route Santa Monica takes next, while others would rather see Kratos venture off into a new realm. There are even claims that Sony is planning to re-release the original
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  titles on PS Plus Premium next year in honor of the franchise’s 20th anniversary.

  The
  <em>
   Bundles of Bravery
  </em>
  drop is finally here, and it has brought some cool new things to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  , including the mysterious Pale Garden biome. This new biome is packed with all sorts of resources, trees, and more. Among all the new additions, one of the most interesting is the Pale Oak Tree.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Pale Oak Trees are exclusively found in the Pale Garden biome, and surprisingly, you can also grow your very own Pale Oak Trees. Luckily, it’s not too complicated, and with a few simple steps, you’ll have these beautiful trees in your world. Stick around, and we’ll show you exactly how to do it.

 <p>
  First off, you can only find Pale Oak Trees in the
  <strong>
   Pale Garden biome
  </strong>
  . Players can easily get to this biome with the help of the locate command. Once you're there, look for the white Pale Oak Trees. When you find one,
  <strong>
   chop it down with an Axe
  </strong>
  . The Axe is an early game tool you probably already have, so no worries there.

 <p>
  Once you’ve done that, you’ll get a
  <strong>
   Pale Oak Sapling
  </strong>
  . With this sapling, you will be able to grow your own Pale Oak Tree in other biomes of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . You’ll need at least
  <strong>
   four saplings to get started with planting
  </strong>
  . If you want more saplings, you can chop down a few more trees.

 <p>
  Once players have got enough saplings, they will need to
  <strong>
   use a hoe to prepare a 2x2 patch of dirt or grass blocks
  </strong>
  . Any hoe will do the job. Then, place your saplings to grow your trees. And yes, you will also need to
  <strong>
   use some bone meal
  </strong>
  to help them grow faster. For those who don’t know, bone meal can be easily made from bones. After growing a tree, players can get more saplings from it and keep planting more trees.

 <p>
  While you are at it, make sure to collect some Pale Oak Wood as well. This wood is super handy for crafting all sorts of things, like stripped logs, fences, gates, and stairs. You can make just about anything you’d make with regular wood.

 <p>
  A quick heads-up: be extra careful when looting the Pale Garden, especially at night. This is because the Pale Oak Trees have Creaking Hearts, which start summoning the
  <strong>
   Creaking mob
  </strong>
  after dark. These creatures can be a real pain in the neck, and if you are not careful, they can catch you off guard.

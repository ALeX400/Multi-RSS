 <p>
  Support Cookies are a popular Cookie type found in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Cookie Run: Kingdom
   </strong>
   ,
  </em>
  as there are more than twenty Cookies in the game that fall under this category. Support Cookies are a versatile part of any team composition in both PvP and PvE modes, acting as a bridge between the Magic type and Healing type Cookies. They can heal, but can also provide buffs, remove debuffs, and target enemies with debuffs. Some of them can even attack enemies with their skills.

  As there are so many Support Cookies to choose from in
  <em>
   Cookie Run: Kingdom

  , we’re going to be looking at eight particularly noteworthy choices to help players decide who they want to add to their team.

  Cream Puff Cookie's skills revolve around using her budding magic abilities to protect her allies, heal and buff the team. She has a regular skill that focuses on healing and causing area damage. When active, the skill creates a tornado made of Jellie candies that restores the team’s health and causes area Light damage.

  When her Extra Cream Magic Candy skill is active, Cream Puff Cookie learns to buff her team, granting increased attack buffs, Stun immunity, and increasing critical chance. She’ll also start stacking up her Cream Buff skill, which increases her own damage resistance and makes her stronger.

  We’re putting seven Cookies into one next as the BTS Cookies all have the same skill, so players can use any of them within their team to the same effect. These Cookies were released as part of a special collaboration between Cookie Run: Kingdom and the popular South Korean boy band BTS. Unfortunately, the Cookies-based on each of the seven members of the band- could only be obtained in the limited-time Braver Together Gacha, so they are no longer available.

 <p>
  If players do have at least one of the BTS Cookies, they make for useful Support types due to their ARMY’s Wishes skill. The skill Safeguards the BTS Cookies, so they can’t take damage. It also provides a Stun immunity buff, heals allies, and makes the team resistant to debuffs. If a teammate gets hit with three or more debuffs, ARMY’s Wishes creates an HP shield for the whole team. The BTS Cookies are a must for fans of BTS, but they also make for great Supports.

 <p>
  Silverbell Cookie’s bow and arrow weapon might fool players into thinking he is a Ranged type, but he is a Support Cookie through and through. When his Gleeful Chime skill is active, Silverbell Cookie summons Silverbell flowers that bloom around the team and heal them periodically. Those healed get a bonus to the amount that they are healed if they have multiple active buffs. The flowers also give allies a damage resistance buff.

 <p>
  Silverbell Cookie inflicts some damage via his Silverbell flowers with their Silverbell Pollen. This debuff does damage periodically and when it ends, the final hit will apply the Stun debuff and do area damage. Silverbell Cookie is also immune to Mushroom Mutation and Spore Dispersal effects, making him a useful ally in battles where these debuffs are in effect. He also works well with Mercurial Knight Cookie, as when the two are in battle together, they will receive the Silver Knighthood effect, which increases their attack speed and maximum health points. Elder Faerie Cookie and White Lily Cookie will also receive buffs if they are on the same team.

  Next up is a merperson Cookie whose skills enable her to debuff and trap enemies with ease. Frilled Jellyfish Cookie uses her Frilled Snare to ensnare the enemy team with her tentacles (though she can only ensnare up to five enemies and will always target Cookies first). As well as trapping enemies, her tentacles reduce their movement speed, deal Sea Foam damage, increase the amount of Water-type damage they take, and give them the Zap debuff.

 <p>
  Frilled Jellyfish Cookie also protects herself by burrowing underground, creating a damage resistance buff for herself. Any changes in attack speed won’t affect her when she does this, and if she falls in battle, she will turn herself into several small jellyfish which heal the team. Frilled Jellyfish Cookie is a great choice of a damaging Support character that can debuff the enemy significantly and protect herself and the team while doing so.

  Next is a Cookie who is not only an excellent Support character, but also a novelist who uses her skills as a writer for her special skill. When her special skill is active, Linzer Cookie uses her Deduction abilities learned from her mystery novel writing. She starts earning Deduction stacks, and these stacks increase the critical percentage chance for her teammates. They also inflict the Suspect debuff on the enemy with the highest attack. The Suspect will receive extra damage and area damage will hurt enemies close by.

 <p>
  As Linzer Cookie’s Deduction stacks up, the Suspect debuff will become more powerful. If Deduction stacks to the maximum amount of seven, another defense lowering debuff will apply to the Suspect. Allies will also receive a critical damage buff at maximum Deduction stacks. Linzer Cookie is the best choice of a Support type for those looking for a Cookie that can apply massive debuffs and heighten the skills of the team at the same time.

  The sweet and peachy Peach Blossom Cookie is a Support Cookie that offers heals, buffs, and even a bit of damage to the enemy team with his skills. When using his Heavenly Fruit ability, Peach Blossom Cookie summons a healing Peach Tree. The Peach Tree heals the team and does extra healing for whoever has the lowest health, but it also creates Peach Bao fruits. The Peach Bao’s buff the team, offering resistance to enemy debuffs and damage resistance.

 <p>
  Peach Blossom Cookie’s damage comes from his Unripe Peach Bao fruits that also fall from his tree. He attacks the enemy with Unripe Peach Baos, debuffing them by reducing their movement and attack speed and causing damage. Peach Blossom Cookie can also protect himself from the Apathy debuff thanks to his Peach Fragrance.

  Much like Peach Blossom Cookie, Snapdragon Cookie is all about combining healing with buffs for teammates (and being super cute while doing so). They also have the same Safeguard immunity that the BTS Cookies have, meaning that Snapdragon Cookie can’t be harmed or attacked.

 <p>
  Snapdragon Cookie uses Arcane Blossom to heal the team and buff them with blooming snapdragon flowers. The buffs that Snapdragon Cookie gives their allies make them resistant to Stun, increase their resistance to damage and debuffs, and increase their attack. Not only that, but the team will also get an HP shield and have their maximum health increased due to Snapdragon Cookies Draconic Lifeforce passive skill. Despite not having any offensive abilities, Snapdragon Cookie is an awesome Support that can heal effectively and buff the team, making them a force to be reckoned with.

  Last but not least is Cream Ferret Cookie, a healer and buffing Support type that manages to earn the top spot on our list thanks to having three separate elements to their Snuggly Ferret special skill. When initially using the skill, Cream Ferret Cookie turns into ferret form and heals the whole team for 55% of their attack immediately while also offering periodic healing. Cream Ferret Cookie’s allies also receive critical damage, critical chance, and damage resistance buffs.

 <p>
  The next part of Cream Ferret Cookie’s special revolves around them jumping onto the back of the teammate with the highest attack and giving them a buff called Fuzzy Scarf. This buff gives the ally increased attack, even more critical damage, and more resistance to debuffs. The recipient of Fuzzy Scarf will also receive more healing and Cream Ferret Cookie will gain resistance to debuffs.

 <p>
  The final part of the Snuggly Ferret skill is Precious Friend, wherein Cream Ferret Cookie goes to the teammate whose health is at a certain level and creates an HP shield for them while recovering their attack. They will also grant this ally the Fuzzy Scarf buff too. Cream Ferret Cookie is one of the best Supports found in Cookie Run: Kingdom as they not only support the whole team but also hone in on certain teammates to give them additional buffs and support.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Meta Quest
  </strong>
  v68 update is rolling out to headsets, and it includes significant improvements to latency, contrast, screenshots, and more. Fans should expect the update to arrive in the days to come, as Meta rolls out updates in waves, rather than upgrading all Meta Quest headsets at the exact same time.

 <p>
  Although some VR enthusiasts are already looking forward to the Meta Quest 4, the Meta Quest 3 is currently the company's flagship consumer-level virtual reality headset. The portable and tether-free nature of the Quest has appealed to fans, though due to relying on onboard hardware, the Quest 3 has some drawbacks in comparison to its tethered, PC-dependent competitors. However, each update tends to improve upon the Quest headsets' capabilities in some way, and v68 is no exception.

 <p>
  Meta has revealed that the v68 update is rolling out to Meta Quest 3 headsets right now. The update adds a number of features and improves upon old ones. For example, the resolution of screenshots has been upgraded dramatically from 1400x1400 pixels to 2160x2160. The Meta Quest 3 update also adds improved latency, reducing the number of stutters and frame rate drops on the units. Content Adaptive Brightness Control has also been added in the device's Experimental Mode, giving users reduced contrast when scenes are particularly dark, improving visual clarity.

 <p>
  Meta Quests have received improved graphics performance, with smoother experiences in both virtual reality and mixed reality. Touch Controllers can now be paired through the headset rather than through the app, and the keyboard will spawn in a "more optimal position," without overlapping other windows. The headsets will also make a beeping sound when taken off if the battery is running low, as a reminder to charge it.

 <p>
  The most interesting addition to the devices may be the new Layout app. This system allows users to tap the mixed reality capabilities of the Meta Quest 3, allowing them to do things like measure the square footage of a room, or visualize what a large piece of furniture or a TV might look like in the space available to them. It even allows users to determine if things like wall-mounted televisions are level. This app could prove quite useful when shopping online, which may be part of Meta's plans for it.

 <p>
  In all, this update should make for a more pleasant and seamless experience for Meta Quest 3 fans. With no announcements made yet on when the next Meta Quest will launch, making the most of the current hardware is a wise choice.

 <p>
  A gamer has found a way to run
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Balatro
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  is one of 2024's smash-hit gaming success stories. Riffing off the main concepts of poker,
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  insists on breaking the accepted rules to succeed. The game was developed in two and a half years by one person known as LocalThunk. Of the many deck-builders that gamers can get their hands on, players love
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  because it has a simple premise that allows for deep and addictive gameplay.

 <p>
  On top of gamers loving and wanting to see what's next for the
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  franchise, many fans show their appreciation for the iconic original release by running the game on anything in sight. The origin of the meme is largely attributed to a 2006 video that shows Youtuber KevlarGorilla running the game on a Nintendo DS. At this point, the meme of being able to run
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  on something has been alive for nearly as long as the online gaming community itself has.

 <p>
  UwUDev on Reddit shared a video where they run
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  on their copy of
  <em>
   Balatro.
  </em>
  On a surface level, it seems to make sense that becoming one of 2024's most popular games entails a run-in with one of the biggest gaming memes around. The gameplay here shows
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  creatively running across a spread of cards that were originally all jokers. Although it stutters occasionally, having the game run at all is an impressive feat.

 <p>
  Part of this is possible because of just how small
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  is in comparison. While both games are quite small,
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  is approximately 2.4 megabytes compared to
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  's 150 megabytes. In their post, UwUDev states that they did not expect to see so many fans enjoy seeing what they achieved. Next, UwUDev says that they plan to do "something even more impressive and stupid." However, "stupid" is not the word that the gamers who have seen this post would use, as many
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  players acknowledge this as a stroke of genius.

 <p>
  At this point, LocalThunk has seen and shared the post, and excited fans have responded wondering what else
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  can run. Some gamers have joked, asking if it can run the notoriously graphics-intense
  <em>
   Crysis
  </em>
  series. Gamers appear to be excited to see what UwUDev does next. Whether it is still some fusion of
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  or something entirely new is still unclear, but there seems to be plenty more to come.

  There's an interesting variety of magical beasts in
  <strong>
   <em>
    World of Warcraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  , from the walking shrubs in the woods to massive, magical beasts of impressive size and power. Some of these are just part of the background, but others are recurring NPCs that are important enough to influence the course of Azerothian history.

  <strong>
   The dragons of the

  Also known as the Guardian of Magic and Hidden Arcanum,
  <strong>
   Maylgos
  </strong>
  is the dragon that most players have seen at least once thanks to his numerous appearances throughout the game world. In
  <em>
   Classic
  </em>
  versions of the game, he was one of the dragons that players had to find to finish part of the "Sceptre of the Sands" quest that was connected to the Gates of An'Qiraj event, which is what made him famous.

 <p>
  Malygos may not be the biggest dragon, but he's most definitely the smartest, at least that's what he says. His general attitude reflects the pride of the magic-users for whom he serves as guide and guardian. Run the Nexus in Northrend and face him as the final boss to get a realistic idea of his impressive size, and remember: He's one of the small ones.

  The progression to reach
  <strong>
   Nefaion
  </strong>
  , the boss who waits at the end of Blackwing Lair and is considered the lord of the highest part of Blackrock Mountain, is a long and arduous one. It requires an attunement process, rigorous gear checks, and some serious fire-resistance equipment. Hopefully, any players that face him have already faced his younger sister, Onyxia, because they can use some of the same gear to protect them.

  The versions of
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  post-
  <em>
   Cataclysm
  </em>
  have a second dungeon to continue this story called "Blackwing Descent", in which Nefarian teams up with his sister, Onyxia, although she was in undead form by this point. The pair have a lot in common regarding how they secretly worked behind the scenes to undermine their opponents, with Nefarion taking the alter-ego of Lord Victor Nefarious, and Onyxia disguising herself as a Stormwind noble.

  As Lady Katrana Prestor,
  <strong>
   Onyxia
  </strong>
  was able to infiltrate the human kingdom at the highest levels for decades, influencing the Stonemasons and Nobles to turn against each other and start a violent rebellion. This conflict led to the untimely death of the queen and further plunged the flagship Alliance members into a state of disarray.

  Prestor continued to flex her political muscles as the royal councilor to young Anduin Wynn, and used the Drakefire Amulet to control his guardian, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon. It was also this enchanted amulet that the player has to find to enter her lair.

  There are two versions of how Lady Prestor was found out and slain. The older version credits agents of the Horde with discovering her identity, but a newer version credits Varian Wrynn with killing her after returning to Stormwind.

  An example of the eternal feminine that often makes its way into fantasy stories,
  <strong>
   Alexstrasza
  </strong>
  is the guardian of all life in Azeroth, and it's a heavy burden to carry. One of her most important roles is her struggle against Deathwing, who was determined to destroy all of creation.

  Since the events of
  <em>
   Cataclysm
  </em>
  , she's passed on most of this responsibility on to the mortal heroes of
  <em>
   World of Warcraft,
  </em>
  but she still appears constantly in lore and quests. Alexstrasza is depicted in various places throughout the world that she rules, but players can find her elven-version on the top of Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight, a zone in Northrend. Ysera, another important Dragon aspect who has close ties to the Night Elves and the Emerald Dream, is her smaller younger sister.

  <strong>
   Deathwing's
  </strong>
  dark, massive visage that blocked out the sun and filled the air with smoke in the events of the
  <em>

  expansion. He literally broke the world, changing the geography of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, and Azeroth was changed forever. Under his guidance, the Horde was able to imprison Alexstrasza, the one dragon who could stand against him, and the other Dragon Aspects enlisted the help of some brave adventurers to help defeat him and free their mother.

   Galakrond
  </strong>
  was a proto-dragon, meaning he was untouched by the Titans and not reduced to an Aspect, and it was from him that all other dragons were born. He was bigger than all the other dragon Aspects combined, and when his nature turned from benevolent to hostile, they had to unite and battle against him.

  As he was driven deeper into madness, Galakrond consumed other dragons and grew even bigger, sprouting necrotic appendages and vomiting up his prey to become his undead minions. After the Aspects defeated him, he rose from undeath to attack Wyrmrest Temple in the
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  expansion, only to be defeated again. His massive skeleton rests at the foot of the temple, so anyone can visit and marvel at his massive size.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has won an award for their Viridian Forest Ranger cosplay. The impressive work utilizes more than just a costume, with the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan putting some tremendous effort into creating an animatronic Pidgey to accompany them and complete the look.

  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  cosplay is just one of many ways that fans of the series show their love for it. Whether players are costuming as the human characters and trainers or cosplaying the Pokemon themselves, the popular hobby lets fans represent their favorites. Players have been enjoying cosplaying as
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  characters since the series first premiered, and it shows no signs of stopping.

 <p>
  Reddit user Worldwarallen has shared their cosplay with fans in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  subreddit. A photo shows the cosplayer's ranger costume in detail as the fan holds their prize for getting second place at the competition. A Pidgey can be seen sitting on their right arm, which would pull the look together even if it were just a plushie. However, this fan went above and beyond creating this Pidgey, as it's actually an animatronic.

  How the Animatronic Pidgey Came to Life
 </h2>
 <p>
  A TikTok video shared by the cosplayer demonstrates how much work went into the Pidgey. Worldwarallen notes that they started working on the Pidgey back in April 2023, though it took a while for them to get it to where they were satisfied. The Pidgey can be seen before and after its body and feathers are applied, with its head swiveling around in a jittery fashion similar to real-world birds. As the player notes in their Reddit post, the handler glove that they wear actually houses the batteries for the popular bird Pokemon. Worldwarallen also went to multiple events in order to work on their puppeteering, adding further polish to the execution.

  Fellow fans have been extremely impressed with the cosplay, particularly the special Pidgey. A couple suggested that this fan could appear in a live-action
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  movie, while another said that they looked as though they were genuinely an experienced ranger with knowledge of the local animal life. Another congratulated Worldwarallen on the completed build, to which he teased that he's also working on a Charmander, which should be fun to see.

  <em>
   Pokemon

  fans have become adults, cosplay and other hobbies celebrating
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  have become more intricate and skillful. It will be interesting to see what Worldwarallen shares next with the community.

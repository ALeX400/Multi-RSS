  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Warzone
   </em>
  </strong>
  developer Raven Software has reverted a controversial loadout change that was supposed to go live with the game's Season 2 Reloaded update on February 20. The mid-season patch for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  is set to bring a plethora of different bug fixes, weapon adjustments, and quality-of-life improvements to the Battle Royale title, but one change proved to be so controversial that it has been removed before it could even see the light of day.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Season 2 Reloaded will be bringing plenty of new content to Treyarch Studios' latest
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  title,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , the same can't be said for its free-to-play counterpart. Ever since
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  was fully integrated with
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  at the beginning of Season 1, fans haven't been happy with the game's overall quality. From bugs and glitches to hackers in Ranked Play, many fans believe
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  is in one of its worst states to date. With a declining player count and unhappy community, Activision announced that
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  Season 2 would have less content than originally planned in order to focus on gameplay tuning, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements.

  Raven Software Reverts Controversial Warzone Change
 </h2>
 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's big Season 2 Reloaded update, developer Raven Software has remained committed to bringing new gameplay improvements and bug fixes to the title. However, one change was quickly blasted by the community and has now been reverted before the update's release. According to the patch notes, Season 2 Reloaded was originally going to remove the ability for players to access the same loadout drop after death repeatedly. This was something that would massively affect the game's Resurgence mode, as players have the ability to respawn after death if their teammates remain alive. However, fans were quick to blast the change, which has resulted in Raven Software reverting it.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  's Season 2 Reloaded patch notes, the change would have meant that players would be forced to either return to their dropped weapons or buy a new loadout drop after death. The studio said the change was part of its ongoing efforts to refine gameplay and address long-standing "cheese" mechanics in order to create a more balanced experience for all players. However, fans immediately took to social media to express their dissatisfaction with the change. Over on Reddit, user TheCrow13 said Raven Software was "purposely making the game less fun" and noted that loadouts are what make
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  unique, so they should not be tampered with.

 <p>
  This isn't the first time that Raven Software has received backlash for changing how loadouts work in
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  either. Back in 2021, the studio made a controversial change with the introduction of
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  's Caldera map that would prevent players from purchasing their own loadout drop until the first free one had landed on the map. Although this was a change that only affected the early stages of a game, it was met with massive backlash and eventually reverted. So, it's safe to say that
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  's loadouts should probably just be left how they are, as they are an integral part of the game.

  Blood Magic is a skill that lets players use their own health to fuel magical spells in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It may not seem like much, but since Essence can be difficult to maintain in intense combat situations, having the option to spill blood in exchange for power can be a game changer.

  While this build uses both magic and melee, it focuses more on the latter to deal high amounts of sustained damage. Magic here is mostly used for Status Accumulation, mainly for Shock, Freeze, Bleed, and Stun. This is essentially a hybrid version of a two-handed Fighter build, except it involves magic and quick-swapping to account for its lack of AOE and crowd control.

 <h3 id="playstyle">

 <p>
  Your main source of damage here is still going to be your two-handed weapon.
  <strong>
   Use Chill Blades and Returning Storm to initiate a fight
  </strong>
  and inflict status effects, then
  <strong>
   charge in with Barbaric Shout and Charge
  </strong>
  . When the status effects wear off, swap to your Grimoire and cast spells again. Keep in mind that Charge
  <strong>
   shatters
  </strong>
  Frozen enemies.

     You need to swap and cast spells with your Grimoire if you want to benefit from the +1 Rank bonus it provides for unlocked spells. Also, casting spells this way reduces their cooldowns and Essence/HP Costs.

  Since Blood Magic uses health to fuel spells, you won't need any Intellect for this build. Focus on getting
  <strong>
   10 Might
  </strong>
  for damage and
  <strong>
   8 Constitution
  </strong>
  for more HP. Then, pump up Perception for bonus critical hit chance, and use items like Painter's Brush for even more crit chance.

 <p>
  Od Caura's Grimoire is the preferred tome for this build, mainly because of its CC-heavy repertoire. Chill Blades can Freeze, Resting Storm can Shock and Stun, and if you get Grimoire Mastery 3, Pull of Eora can suspend enemies in a vortex. Use any of these abilities before a fight, then whack your enemies away while they're helpless. Make sure to bring a lot of health items to compensate for Blood Magic.

  If you need more damage, either Marius or Yatzli can fill in for Kai's role. However, you'll want to make sure that your team stays alive and healthy, especially in harder difficulties. Consider getting the

 <p>
  Sprawling 4X strategy games like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Civilization 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  throw a lot of complex mechanics at the player, often at the same time. In an average turn of
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  , players are expected to conduct diplomacy with other leaders, command their armies, establish trade routes, research new techs, and make sure all their cities and settlements are operating as efficiently as possible. That's a lot for even the most experienced
  <em>

  fans to keep on top of.

  To try and keep these overlapping systems from feeling too overwhelming,
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  fans have forged a set of natural guidelines over the years. These guidelines are rarely recorded in any official capacity, but they're widely accepted and used nonetheless. Despite its newness,
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  has plenty of these unwritten rules already, many of which revolve around the game's victory types.

 <h3 id="city-and-settlement-placement-is-key">
  City and Settlement Placement is Key
 </h3>
 <p>
  The very first thing players are prompted to do at the start of a
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  match is choose where to place their first city. This decision is incredibly important, especially if players are striving to achieve an Economic victory. Players need to make sure their city is located near resources, and that the tiles surrounding their city synergize with any unique leader bonuses. Placing any subsequent settlements is equally important. To make the process of settlement placement a little more efficient, players can send scouts around the world first to find the most resource-rich locations.
 </p>
 <h3 id="expand-expand-expand">
  Expand, Expand, Expand
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's Economic victory revolves around gaining resources and connecting them to the rest of the player's empire. The easiest way to collect resources is to have settlements surrounding them. As such, players are heavily encouraged to expand as far as they can, as soon as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is especially important in
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's Exploration Age, when players can journey to the Distant Lands. In this Age, players complete the Economic Legacy Path by sending treasure fleets back to their homeland. In order to unlock these treasure fleets, players first need to establish a settlement located near a treasure, which again encourages players to expand their empire as quickly as possible.
 </p>
 <h3 id="having-a-strong-military-presence-is-helpful">
  Having a Strong Military Presence Is Helpful
 </h3>
 <p>
  Though the player's main focus should be on gaining resources and establishing trade routes, the road to an Economic victory can be a treacherous one. merchants in the Antiquity Age and treasure fleets in the Exploration Age both need to be escorted to their objectives, and having a sizable army/navy obviously comes in handy here. The player's navy can also steal resources from an opponent's treasure fleet.
 </p>
 <h3 id="maintain-strong-diplomatic-relationships">
  Maintain Strong Diplomatic Relationships
 </h3>
 <p>
  Diplomacy plays an important role in the journey towards achieving
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's Economic victory. Throughout the Antiquity Age, players will want to make sure they're staying in their opponents' good books, as having a positive relationship with fellow world leaders is necessary for establishing and maintaining a lucrative trade network. Players can also use their Influence resource to use the "Improve Trade Relations" diplomatic action, which permanently increases the number of trade routes between the Civ and the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maintaining strong relationships becomes imperative again in
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's Modern Age, as the final objective of the Economic path sees players sending a Great Banker around the world to establish a World Bank Office in every Civ's capital city. Each leader will charge the player to build a bank, and that price changes depending on their relationship.

  Henry first gets access to guns in the Finger of God playthrough, although he can learn about gunpowder during the Opus Magnum side quest from the Miller in Lower Semine before that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Early on in the quest, players will meet up with Godwin at Nebakov to learn how to use handgonnes from one of the bandits at the settlement. Godwin and Hertel will show Henry a "diabolical" invention called a pistole. The pistole is a crude version of a handgun that uses gunpowder to shoot lead balls at targets.

  Henry will get a short tutorial from Hertel on how to use it. Then, he and Godwin will get to test them out. The pistole is challenging to aim and slow to load, but it significantly damages its targets when it hits. Follow the below directions to use a gun in
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Equip the handgonne from the inventory
  </li>
  <li>
   Load the weapon by holding down right-click. This will take several seconds, so be careful using guns in fast combat.
  </li>
  <li>
   Aim the weapon by holding down right-click. Aiming drains significant stamina and gets harder the lower Henry's stamina bar gets.
  </li>
  <li>
   Left-click to shoot.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Once Henry and Godwin are done practicing shooting, Hertel will give Henry the hand cannon and 20 lead balls for free.

  Guns are considered advanced technology in

   <em>

  , so players cannot find them from any merchant. Henry must go to Kuttenberg to purchase other handgonnes and their parts.

  Players can buy other guns and ammo from Gunmaker Prokop Eldris in east Kuttenberg near the Caslavska Gate. Guns range from about 200 to 1200 Groschen, and players can purchase or make their gunpowder using alchemy. Guns, like other weapons, get worn down the more they are used, but they can be repaired at the gunmaker's or fixed by Henry using a gunkit bought from the shop.

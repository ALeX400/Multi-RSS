  <strong>
   <em>
    The Plucky Squire
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not a game for those who want a massive-scale game filled with side quests, secret unlockable weapons, and multiple endings, as it's a very straightforward and linear game; a style that it handles incredibly well. Players will be delighted by the articulate narration that will guide them from page to page, and different parts of the game are separated
  <strong>
   through different chapters
  </strong>
  .

  However, the time to beat the game does fluctuate depending on the goal of the player. Some players will want to breeze through the game, some will explore every inch of the map, and others may find themselves struggling in a minigame for far longer than they’d like to admit — but feel a large sense of accomplishment after.

  Games come in a wide array of complexities, and some can take hundreds of hours to accomplish everything they have to offer. However,
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  is a linear game with a narrated story. While there are some hidden paths and collectibles, players going through the story will only find it takes them
  <strong>
   about 7 hours
  </strong>
  to reach the credits. Those who explore every corner and take in the world will see this increase
  <strong>
   closer to 8 hours
  </strong>
  . Lastly, players who have trouble with puzzles and boss fight mini-games can expect this to add even more time to the game.

  Achievement/Trophy Hunting

 <p>
  For players who plan on doing everything the game has to offer and getting their hands on every achievement/trophy, this timeframe can jump up. Having a guide for getting all the achievements/trophies in the game can
  <strong>
   bump this up by another hour
  </strong>
  . However, those that complete the game without collecting everything may
  <strong>
   need to replay the entire game again

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Backyard Sports
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise is officially returning after an extensive absence from mainline gaming.
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  kicked off with the release of
  <em>
   Backyard Baseball
  </em>
  in 1997, before spawning
  <em>
   Backyard Football
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Backyard Hockey
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Backyard Soccer
  </em>
  , and more on PC and consoles. Unfortunately, later entries saw a massive decline, with the simultaneous release of mobile-only titles
  <em>
   Backyard Sports: Basketball 2015
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Backyard Sports: Baseball 2015
  </em>
  putting the final nail in the coffin. With its official revival announcement in August 2024, the series seeks to make an impact on a new generation of gamers. Luckily for fans, the return of
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  is perfectly timed.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  games, particularly the original
  <em>
   Backyard Baseball
  </em>
  , were hugely popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Boasting a range of highly memorable characters and welcoming mechanics, the series offered young gamers an accessible entrance into both sports and gaming, respectively. When the series switched hands, many of its biggest fans were too old to play, leading later entries to experiment with new ways to connect with a younger generation. This plan did not work out, leading to a sharp and sudden decline in sales and quality that spelled the series’ end in 2015. However, sports games have seen a massive resurgence in recent years, and older fans, including former NFL star Jason Kelce, have been especially vocal about seeing
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  return. With last month’s announcement of an official reboot, that return is official, and the timing is sweet as candy.

  2024 has been an unusually great year for sports games.
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  lets players step into the ring as the referee, warning competitors and setting the count during spectacular beatdowns.
  <em>
   NBA 2K24: Kobe Bryant Edition
  </em>
  honored the legacy of an NBA great, allowing players to recreate some of Bryant’s most memorable moments. Most significantly,
  <em>
   EA Sports College Football 25
  </em>
  brought college football back to gaming after more than a decade-long absence, selling over 2.2 million early access Deluxe Edition copies. With the stage set, and sports games fans already enjoying an outstanding slate of titles, now is a great time for a fan-favorite non-licensed sports game to take a swing at making a comeback.

  While
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  was only just announced in August 2024, its reveal is already among the best sports game news stories of the year. It’s been quite a while since the golden era of non-licensed sports games, and players who grew up with them are undoubtedly excited to share their unique style with their own children. It remains to be seen what the new era of
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  will entail. However, the announcement’s visual aesthetic and reintroduction of fan-favorite characters have fans anticipating a return to form.

  The
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  franchise was hugely popular among millennials and acted as many players’ first sports games. The titles offered kids an accessible way to learn the basic rules of major sports and foster an interest in playing, themselves. Just as significantly,
  <em>
   Backyard Baseball
  </em>
  opened the door for sports fans of all ages to discover video games and foster their fandom in a new and interactive way, playing as everyday kids like themselves. With its revival, current IP holder Playground Productions hopes to inspire a new generation of sports fans to explore their interests in both sports and entertainment. To accomplish this goal,
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  ' newest iteration will offer more than just a rebooted game offering.

  While

  official announcement sent shockwaves through the gaming community, video games aren’t the only place fans can expect to see their favorite players. Playground Productions has announced that it will reintroduce
  <em>
   Backyard Sports
  </em>
  ’ iconic roster of child-athletes through games, TV, film, and other media, making the franchise reboot a multimedia event. It is currently unknown how or when the rebooted
  <em>
   Backyard Sports

  will make its first appearance. Until more Playground Productions shares more, fans of
  <strong>
   <em>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  . In this Battle Royale, the Storm Circle closes in as the match proceeds in order to bring the remaining players closer and closer to one another and see who gets the Victory Royale.

     In Chapter 5 Season 4, since there are only two towers, both of them will spawn every match. However, gamers might want to shield up and find good weapons before heading up there; they appear relatively early on into the match so several other players might have the idea to secure the same Forecast Tower.

  Forecast Towers have three stages, and since they're connected, they change according to the Storm Circle. When the match starts, the Forecast Tower computer will have a message saying "Awaiting Forecast," which means it's not ready to be used yet, and there's nothing gamers can do to interact with it.

  Once there's
  <strong>
   50 seconds until the first Storm Circle starts closing, the message will change to "Acquiring Forecast"

  Hardware manufacturer
  <strong>
   Logitech
  </strong>
  has announced Logitech G RS, a brand-new line of PC and console steering wheels for use with racing games and automotive sims. The new Logitech
  <strong>
  </strong>
  line also incorporates a partnership with Italian automotive design firm MOMO.

  Though many players know Logitech more for peripherals like headphones, keyboards, and mice, the company makes hardware and accessories for a range of game genres and activities, including racing. In fact, Logitech racing wheels are among the best gaming racing wheels players can find. This is particularly true in the pricey premium range of racing accessories, where Logitech's G Pro wheel has ruled the top-end market for racing sim and motorsport game enthusiasts.

 <p>
  Announced at the company's Logi Play event, the Logitech G Racing Series (RS) promises to build on that dominance by expanding the range of designs and choices available for players to choose from to match their preferences in highly realistic racing games. The new line includes two new Logitech G RS Racing Wheel designs, a Wheel Hub to hold them, and a pair of wheels that more closely match real-world steering wheels designed by partner MOMO. The Logitech G RS lineup is available for pre-order now, and starts shipping on October 13, 2024.

  In a spirit befitting the detailed car customization options in the best racing games, the Logitech G RS line is also further expanded by the MOMO x Logitech G partnership. MOMO is a Milan-based automotive design company best known for making real-world steering wheels. The line includes the SIM GT 320 and SIM GT-Racer 290, two wheels similar to the default Round and Track wheels, but which also include MOMO branding and other characteristic flourishes. The MOMO-designed wheels will launch in January 2025.

  With the Logitech G RS series almost ready for deployment, players on console and PC will have some new hardware to look forward to. PlayStation gamers in particular might even consider picking up the hardware to go with
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 7
  </em>
  , which may benefit from graphical upgrades coming with the PS5 Pro in November 2024.

  Another interesting game has been added to the
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  library, giving players the chance to try out
  <em>
   Wargroove 2
  </em>
  by Chucklefish and Robotality. September has already been exciting for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, with five day-one titles coming to the service in the first half of the month.
  <em>
   Wargroove 2
  </em>
  , which launched on PC and Switch in October 2023, will be making its Xbox debut on September 19 for Ultimate and PC Game Pass members.

 <p>
  <em>
   Wargroove
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Wargroove 2
  </em>
  are turn-based tactics games inspired by
  <em>
   Advance Wars
  </em>
  , the 2001 Game Boy Advance classic
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  Developer Chucklefish said about the first game that the goal was to bring the “simple yet deep” and accessible gameplay of that series to modern platforms. In that vein, both
  <em>
   Wargroove
  </em>
  games are also delivered in a charming pixel art wrapping that doubles down on those
  <em>
   Advance Wars
  </em>
  vibes.

  Set a few years after the first game,
  <em>
   Wargroove 2
  </em>
  takes players to the shores of Aurania. A new faction of scholarly rodents called the Faahri have come exploring and unearthed ancient relics whose forbidden technologies could lead to catastrophe. But they’re on a mission of discovery and won’t let anything stand in their way, and so the tactical battling begins.

  offers local and online co-op for up to four players, as well as a single-player campaign mode. The game also introduces Conquest, a roguelike single-player mode that dishes up bite-sized battles, and the in-game editor allows for the creation of custom rules, maps, cutscenes, and campaigns that can be shared with the community.

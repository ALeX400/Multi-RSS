  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has used their artistic abilities to create nine new variations of Snom, and the results are adorable. The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community often shows off fan art online, and these Snom variations reveal how creative some gamers can be.

 <p>
  With over a thousand Pokemon in the series, it is easy for some pocket monsters to get lost in the crowd. However, Snom's adorable appearance has helped it stand out among many fans since its introduction in the Gen 8
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games. As a dual-type Ice/Bug Pokemon, Snom features an adorable larva-like design. While it evolves into the impressive-looking Frosmoth under the right conditions, many fans also enjoy the cute appearance of Snom.

 <p>
  In particular, one fan of Snom recently decided to create nine variations of its design and share them on Reddit. Known as MunchyKu on the platform, the fan artist transformed the traditional icy shell of the dual-type Pokemon, imagining what it would look like with various typings. While the artist created all sorts of shell variants for Snom, all of them were adorable. A couple of examples of the redesigns included one with crystal formations and another featuring stars. One even set Snom ablaze, with its shell turning into what looked like a fiery inferno.

 <p>
  Unsurprisingly, this fan art has won the approval of many gamers on the subreddit. The post already has over 4K upvotes, and many fans pointed out some of their favorite variations in the comments. For example, one user enjoyed the Snom design that looked like a cherry blossom. Other popular designs among fans were lava, grass, and astral. However, most fans had a hard time choosing a favorite, evidencing the quality of the artist's work.

 <p>
  It is worth pointing out that this is not the first time MunchyKu has created variations for Pokemon. In fact, the fan frequently shares artwork that imagines new variations for popular pocket monsters. Some other art they recently shared included winter-themed Bulbasaur designs and Halloween reimaginings of Togepi, all viewable on their Reddit page.

  In addition to MunchyKu, the

  community has been busy making impressive homages to their favorite Pokemon, along with some more obscure picks. Recently, another fan paid tribute to Eevve by designing stunning Neon Galaxy Eeveelutions. With the end of the year wrapping up soon, it will be interesting to see if talented artists like MunchyKu use the holidays as inspiration for even more impressive
  <em>

  -themed artwork.

  The legendary
  <strong>
   FromSoftware
  </strong>
  is one of the most acclaimed video game developers in the industry. While its games have received considerable praise for numerous reasons, the two things they're most well known for are extreme difficulty and incredible spectacle. These two highlights frequently go hand in hand, especially when it comes to the developer's iconic boss fights.

 <p>
  The best FromSoft fights are dramatic, cinematic experiences, where the intense peril and high stakes are heightened by bombastic special effects, sweeping orchestral scores, and dramatic locales. These foes are massive and dangerous, bristling with powerful weapons and extreme, over-the-top attacks, which helps sell how deadly they can be in a fight. Here are ten of the most cinematic boss fights players can experience in FromSoftware games.

  The epic conclusion of the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy features some of the series' most explosive battles, and Yhorm the Giant is a particularly cinematic one. This titanic foe rests, forsaken and alone, in a tomblike throne room deep underground. When he rises to engage the player, he pulls out some truly thunderous attacks and shrugs off the player's best moves like they're nothing.

 <p>
  In order to defeat Yhorm, players should retrieve the Storm Ruler, a mythically powerful sword hidden behind the giant's throne. This sword's special weapon art is the only thing that can bring him to his knees, and the potent, magical strikes of the Storm Ruler ringing through the giant's hall add another level of spectacle to the battle. Furthermore, if players have advanced enough in Siegward's quest, he will appear to aid them, lending his own Storm Ruler to the fight and turning the battle into a truly epic culmination of his personal journey.

  The
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy is infamous for its proliferation of armored knight bosses, and
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  in particular has an abundance of these. The Looking Glass Knight still stands out, however. The arena, a rain-soaked castle promenade in the midst of a thunderous storm, is already a deeply cinematic setting for a duel, but it's aided by the Looking Glass Knight's own thunderous lightning attacks, which light up the duel with dangerous magic.

 <p>
  The Looking Glass Knight is aided in his attacks by warriors that he can conjure from his own mirrored shield. These fighters can be real players, conjured to battle in intensely heightened PVP combat. The intensity of fighting such a grand, cinematic boss, while at the same time fending off attacks from other real players, makes for a truly unforgettable encounter.

  's various shardbearers are legendary figures, semi-divine champions who are directly tied up in the brutal history of warfare that has torn the Lands Between apart. Praetor Rykard is a particularly unique shardbearer, as his quest for power led him to renounce his divinity entirely and give himself over to a massive, primordial serpent.

 <p>
  In terms of combat, the God-Devouring Serpent has a gimmick that should prove familiar to long-time Soulslike veterans. Players are all but required to equip a special spear designed to kill serpents if they want to stand a chance against the immense snake. Once they've damaged the beast enough to awaken Rykard himself, the blasphemous praetor will unleash explosive and devastating fire magic, tearing his own lair apart in a ferocious display of power that will likely leave players trembling even after they've put an end to his reign.

  Great Grey Wolf Sif is one of the most iconic bosses in
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  and with good reason. The basic premise of a titanic wolf with a sword in its mouth is memorable on its own merits, but there are numerous additional factors that heighten the spectacle and make Sif an iconic encounter for everyone who's faced her.

 <p>
  The moonlit grave where players fight Sif is a deeply cinematic locale, made even more intense if fans have played the game's DLC and learned more about the tragic legacy of the legendary warrior buried there. Sif's frenzied strikes and remorseless attacks make the battle a duel worthy of any warrior, and her increasingly battered state as the fight wears on adds a sense of tragic inevitability to this fearsome clash.

  The Soul of Cinder serves as the final boss of
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  's base game, and the culmination of the endless, tortured cycle that has ground on and on across the entire trilogy. This creature is the embodiment of every Lord of Cinder that has ever linked the First Flame, and it awaits in the broken, twisted remains of the world, fighting bitterly to keep its cycle alive.

 <p>
  The shattered and warped landscape surrounding the First Flame makes for a bitter and melancholic arena, littered with the weapons of past Lords and the ruins of an age stretched well past its breaking point. The Soul of Cinder fights ferociously with a wide variety of weapons, recalling attacks, movesets, and even leitmotifs from Lords of games past. This is a brutal and bitter send-off to one of gaming's greatest dark fantasy epochs, and it is not to be missed.

  The infamous Bayle the Dread is a legendary dragon, one of the strongest to exist in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's lore. In ages past he even challenged the legendary Dragonlord Placidussax, in a thunderous battle that left both of them scarred forever. When players ascend the treacherous, drake-infested slopes of Bayle's mountain lair, the cataclysmic dragon does not hesitate to display all the power and ferocity that let him challenge the dragonlord himself.

 <p>
  Among
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  fans, the fight with Bayle is most infamous for the maddened drake warrior Igon, who can be summoned to help bring an end to the fell dragon. His wild, exultant cries punctuate an already hectic battle as Bayle rains fiery destruction down on his mountaintop arena. This incredible battle is truly a fight for the ages.

  The clash with the Burnt Ivory King is a true battle in every sense of the word. In order to face this tragic, fallen ruler, one must first fight through his countless waves of loyal knights, each of whom has been burnt and charred by the same chaos flames that have claimed his once-noble soul. By journeying through the frozen city above, players can recruit untainted knights who will nobly give their lives in order to redeem the corrupted king's memory and bring them on a last march into the depths of his loss.

 <p>
  From the very start of the fight, the battle with the Burnt Ivory King is a memorable and cinematic endeavor. Players plunge into a deep pit, surrounded by their recruited knights, and the battle is instantly joined by the king's corrupted minions. The first phase of the battle is a true chivalric melee in the depths of a fiery abyss, and when the king himself arrives, he does so in grand, unforgettable style. The Burnt Ivory King's fighting style is unrelenting and brutal, with a sword massive enough to cut the player down from almost any distance.

  Depending on the choices the hunter makes during their blood-soaked journey through Yharnam's twisted streets, Gehrman is likely to be the final battle awaiting them at the end of the road. This elderly hunter, once a sort of mentor for the player, is finally revealed as a servant of the eldritch forces who created the dream that has trapped him and hunters like him. At the end of the player's brutal quest, Gehrman offers them freedom; a chance to escape the dream and return to the real world, oblivious of the horrors they've witnessed.

 <p>
  Refusing his offer leads to a tragic duel in the pastoral fields of the Dream which once served as home and sanctuary for the player. Gehrman's age belies a vicious, lightning-quick fighting style, amplified with a variety of devastating eldritch sorceries. In true FromSoft fashion, the intensity of the duel only heightens the sorrow of it, as two former comrades tear each other apart according to the inscrutable whims of a godlike alien mind.

  FromSoft is best known these days for the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy, as well as similar games like
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . But it has a rich history in mech combat games, and
  <em>
   Armored Core 6
  </em>
  is just the most recent and arguably most spectacular example. The game's war machines are titanic; even the smallest enemy would dwarf a warrior from
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  . But the Ice Worm is on another level.

 <p>
  This massive, serpentine foe is orders of magnitude larger than the player's mech, as well as the NPC-controlled mechs that join the battle. Despite its incomparable mass, the Ice Worm follows the pattern of gimmick bosses from Soulsborne games past. Players are all but required to equip the VE-60SNA Stun Needle and use it to pierce the Ice Worm's primary shield. Once this is accomplished, their ally Rusty will launch a massive Rail Cannon, staggering the great beast and shutting down its secondary shield. The spectacle of the rail cannon striking the worm, as well as its overwhelming size blasting across the wastes toward the allied mechs, makes it a cinematic showdown comparable to
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  itself.

  's final DLC, flings players far into the future, to see the inevitable end of the trilogy's unceasing Age of Fire. While the titular Ringed City first appears to be a gleaming metropolis, a haven from the decay that's afflicted the rest of the world, this shining glory is eventually revealed as a facade. Once players have revealed the city for what it is, they are left in an endless, ash-choked wasteland, alone with a civilization's worth of corpses, and Slave Knight Gael.

  This recurring character has been on an endless crusade, seeking the power to rebirth the fallen world at any cost. When the player encounters him at the end of all things, he is all but feral and attacks savagely on sight. In the endless, crumbling ruins of everything that's come before, three games' worth of decay and ash, the player must take Gael on in a devastating one-on-one duel, a clash of might like nothing the trilogy has ever seen. Gael's powerful magic and mighty blade make for an intense challenge and a perfect culmination of everything

  A dedicated
  <em>
   <strong>

  fan has put together an impressive life-size replica of the Mangler suit. This kind of suit can be seen worn by undead enemies featured in

  ,
  <em>

  Being one of the tougher foes to beat, the Russian Mangler Soldier, or simply the Mangler, is a Special Zombie type in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games. It is covered in protective armor and typically sports a hefty cannon in one hand, while boasting a blade or a sickle in the other. They are capable of dealing high melee damage and inflict considerable hits with their ranged attacks as well. In
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , which experienced the biggest release for a
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game on October 25, 2024, Manglers can be found in Liberty Falls and Terminus maps. These challenging adversaries appear once the player reaches Round 11 and can also attack in numbers as the game progresses further. Recently, the Mangler from the
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  games was brought to life via a fan-made costume.

  Reddit user Kyberr shared pictures wearing their Mangler suit, which was revealed to be inspired by
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  . From Mangler's cannon to the curved blade, the suit has all the armored zombie's weapons covered. They shared making a few touches, such as the updated look of the cannon and the helmet, based on the
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  versions of the powerful zombie. In one of the replies, they shared that the EVA foam-made costume took them "about 15 days" of on-and-off work to reach its present state. Moreover, the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  fan underlined that they are next looking to include "zombie face" prosthetics and glowing eyes, using red lens and LEDs, to finish off the look. Interestingly, they also said that this was their first time making a costume "from scratch."

  While most fans may not be able to transform into Mangler through a costume, they can surely step into the shoes of the cannon-toting beast in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's zombies mode. Excitingly, the devs are planning to roll out a new map for the game mode called Citadelle des Morts, scheduled to be released on December 5. Apart from the new
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies

  location, the forthcoming update will also include various additions, including new weapons and events, keeping things fresh for
  <em>

 <p>
  Eris, for as quirky and energetic as she seems in
  <strong>
   Hades 2
  </strong>
  , is actually a very fearsome combatant. Her boss battle fought up on the surface is pretty widely regarded as being very difficult, second to only Chronos, at least in the current state of the game's Early Access. There are a multitude of reasons as to why Eris' encounter is so hard, but one of the primary ones has to do with her range. She's using the Exagryph, otherwise known as the Adamant Rail, a weapon anyone who played the first
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  game is going to be more than familiar with already.

 <p>
  More specifically, she's actually using the Aspect of Eris version of the Adamant Rail in
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  , and this means she has ranged fire, area-of-effect explosions, and the ability to buff her own damage output by a whopping 100 percent. So, if you don't come into this fight with a whole lot of Health, a couple of Death Defiances, and some great Boons, you're going to struggle to send Eris back to Crossroad. With that in mind, let's break down her fight as a whole, list out all the moves she seems to use, and go over what ways you can directly counter her.

    Updated November 30th, 2024 by Jacob Buchalter:
   </strong>
   In the time between this guide first coming out and now, there have been a fair few updates for Hades 2. Supergiant Games is constantly working to improve, fix, and innovate on the beloved sequel game to their hit indie roguelike. However, the fight against Eris in the topside run hasn't really changed much at all, outside of the fact that there is now more content to be found once you manage to get past the fight. All that said, there are now more tools, Boons, and more to be used against Eris, so let's take another in-depth look at how exactly you'll want to approach this fight.

   Out of all the bosses currently available in
   <em>
    Hades 2
   </em>
   , Eris is the one who relies on ranged damage the most, and that's still true even after the Olympic Update.
  </strong>
  You could argue that Scylla and her Sirens have a lot of ranged attacks too, but even then those 3 Sirens use just about as many ranged attacks as Eris does on her own.

  More Info on Eris' Playstyle &amp; A General Gameplan Against Her

 <p>
  Eris being so built around her ranged attacks work both to your benefit and detriment, as it turns out. To be a bit more specific:

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    How It Benefits You:
   </strong>
   Eris being primarily ranged makes her very predictable, as her standard gunfire is always going to be fired directly in front of her and her AoE attacks have gigantic telegraphs that give you a decent amount of time to react to them.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    How It Hurts You:
   </strong>
   Going against Eris' ranged playstyle can also be very scary because this can make it difficult to 'go in' on her without taking a bunch of unnecessary damage and if you don't have a weapon or a specific Boon that helps counter enemy projectiles, you're going to have a tough time.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1255} -->

 <p>
  <strong>
   The general game plan for fighting Eris is pretty simple, despite the vast number of moves she has.
  </strong>
  You really just want to stick close to her, lay in as much damage as possible, then get as far away as possible or, better yet, directly behind her when she starts to wind up for any of her attacks. Because you don't really have I-frames after being hit, if you play it a bit too loose when fighting Eris and she gets you with her entire Salvo (shotgun or single shot) you'll find that your entire Health Bar can disappear in an instant.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Lastly, it's also worth mentioning that Eris' arena has some stage hazards and cover for you to use to your advantage.
  </strong>
  There are explosive barrels you can set off, oil next to these explosive barrels that you can light aflame, and there are those 2 'pillar-like' columns in the center of the arena that you can use to hide from Eris' gunfire or kite enemies around (though they do eventually break).

 <p>
  Now we can finally go into all the attacks this big-time litterer can use. Quite frankly, Eris is probably up there with Chronos and now Prometheus in terms of the number of attacks she has, but hers are a lot easier to read and a lot easier to avoid as long as you know which attack is coming ahead of time. Thankfully, the startup animation for all of these attacks is vastly different from each other, so as long as you know which animation is tied to which attack you can accurately respond to each and every one of her attacks.

 <p>
  You might notice in-game that some attacks mentioned here are slightly different than described, and that's because her attacks like Bombard or her Mob Summon have a couple of different variations such as Eris launches a bunch of Bombard grenades in unique patterns or Eris summoning enemies into the fight that you weren't at all prepared for.

 <p>
  All we can say in response to that is you're going to have to be able to adapt and adjust in the moment if you want to beat Eris, as the personification of Strife itself isn't (and shouldn't) be an easy opponent. Without further ado,
  <strong>
   here are all the attacks Eris has at her disposal:

       When Eris is about to be defeated (at about 8-15 percent HP left) she'll start using this attack where she flies off screen, comes back down, unleashes a rapid-fire of arrows at Melinoë, flies off screen again, and repeats this process. She'll do this infinitely until you finish her off.

       You don't have much of a window to actually hit Eris during this attack, so you'll likely have to attack mid-salvo. To do this, you'll want to get on her side as soon as she lands or use something like the Moonstone Axe's Ω Special or Soot Sprint Boon to approach safely and get your damage in.

  Reddit user CorruptedY discovered a dialogue in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  that seemingly references
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s Zhongli. As seen in the player’s screenshot, an NPC's voiceline goes: “Cossack vodka tastes the same as I remember… but where are those who share the memory?” This Easter egg pays homage to Zhongli’s iconic idle voiceline about osmanthus wine. In the early years of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , players considered Zhongli's voiceline too long and even felt that the character said it too often. It quickly became a popular
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  meme within the game's fandom and is still one of the most famous voicelines in the RPG.

  According to the
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  player, the NPC is a trader named Bobber and can be found in Shevchenko in the Zaton region. Traders in
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  let players buy and sell items to help in their mission. One of these items is vodka, which cleverly replaced Zhongli's osmanthus wine for the
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Easter egg. This isn't the first time that fans have spotted special references to other franchises in the FPS.
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  added a
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  Easter egg, as well as a
  <em>
   CoD 4: Modern Warfare
  </em>
  one. One fan also encountered an Easter egg that remembered the first
  <em>
   STALKER
  </em>
  game from 2007. As players continue exploring the
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  map, more Easter eggs are likely to be shared within the community.

  The long-awaited
  <strong>
   <em>
    STALKER 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  has earned generally positive reviews from critics. However, players have also encountered bugs and glitches that affected their gameplay experience. Developer GSC Game World has already launched a new
  <em>
   STALKER 2
  </em>
  update, so fans can expect smoother gaming sessions going forward.

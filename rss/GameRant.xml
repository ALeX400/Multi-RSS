    <ul>
     <li>
      Open-world games that give players a sense of being hunted include
      <em>
       Far Cry 6
      </em>
      ,
      <em>
       Middle-earth: Shadow of War
      </em>
      , and
      <em>
       Assassin's Creed Odyssey
      </em>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      Many open-world games feature similar police or law enforcement systems, such as
      <em>
       Red Dead Redemption 2
      </em>
      ,
      <em>
       GTA 5
      </em>
      ,
      <em>
       Cyberpunk 2077
      </em>
      , and
      <em>
       Mafia 3
      </em>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      Some titles, like
      <em>
       Star Wars Outlaws
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Red Dead Redemption 2
      </em>
      , also feature criminal syndicates or gangs that will hunt players under certain conditions.

 <p>
  Many open-world action games empower players to become ultimate predators — capable of single-handedly clearing enemy outposts, neutralizing any target they choose with little resistance, and walking away from the chaos they've created. However, some games also implement systems to punish such behavior or make it more challenging, whether through law enforcement, police mechanics or by making the player a target for elite NPC bounty hunters.

 <p>
  Often, even when players are being hunted by mercenaries or law enforcement, this can still be turned into an opportunity to unleash even more chaos — playing with the world's reactions to reckless behavior or encountering unpredictable events later on when least expected. Let's take a look at some of the most impressive open-world action games that provide players with a sense of being hunted through their sandbox systems, allowing them to feel not only like powerful bounty hunters but also like constantly pursued prey.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players assume the role of Dani Rojas, a native of Yara who initially just wants to escape the oppressive regime of Antón Castillo. However, as the story progresses, Rojas decides to join the Libertad organization to fight back against the dictatorship. As players aggressively clear enemy outposts to weaken Castillo's influence across different regions, they can trigger escalations — especially in cities or large settlements — leading to special units or mercenaries being dispatched to hunt them down.

 <p>
  This system isn't new to the series. In
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  , players can also provoke relentless bounty hunters and armed forces to pursue them across the map by completing certain story objectives or engaging in too much aggressive action. Fans of the series who enjoy this kind of dynamic, high-stakes gameplay can pick either game depending on their preferred setting.

  Both
  <em>
   Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Middle-Earth: Shadow of War
   </em>
  </strong>
  offer dynamic open-world action where the world and its characters respond unpredictably to player actions. As Talion, players wage a guerrilla war against the Orcs of Mordor, systematically eliminating Sauron's powerful generals to weaken his army. One of the standout features of these games is the patented Nemesis system, which adds a thrilling layer of unpredictability.

  Players can trigger various scenarios where once-defeated enemies grow stronger, angrier, and seek revenge later in the game, akin to a dynamic bounty hunting system but driven by personal vendettas. These unscripted, dynamic events can strike when least expected, creating memorable moments that feel deeply personal and directly linked to the player's past actions.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Outlaws
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the latest open-world action game to incorporate dynamic reputation and bounty hunting mechanics that react to players' actions. As Kay Vess, a young scoundrel, players navigate the dangerous world of four different criminal syndicates, shaping their relationships with each faction. Depending on how players approach these organizations, they can either unlock new opportunities or make things more difficult. A bad reputation with a syndicate will eventually result in kill squads being sent to hunt Kay down across various locations. The only way to escape this danger is to restore favor with the syndicate and improve the relationship.

 <p>
  Players can also attract the attention of the Empire by causing too much trouble at Imperial outposts scattered across different planets. Reaching the sixth wanted level with the Empire triggers elite black Death Troopers to be dispatched. These enemies are nearly impossible to defeat with standard weapons, so players are strongly discouraged from pushing the Empire to this extreme.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Odyssey
   </em>
  </strong>
  was one of the first Ubisoft open-world titles to experiment with mercenary gameplay and bounty hunting mechanics, drawing inspiration from the Nemesis system. As a Misthios (Greek word for a mercenary), players frequently encounter wanted mercenaries that can be hunted down for substantial rewards. Conversely, if players engage in too much chaos — aggressively clearing enemy fortresses, eliminating regional leaders, or causing trouble in peaceful settlements — they can attract bounties on their heads. This results in elite mercenaries pursuing them across the open world.

 <p>
  This relatively simple system adds an extra layer of engagement to the game, as players must monitor the level of the mercenaries hunting them. Facing enemies of a much higher level can be lethal. Additionally, every elite mercenary has unique combat abilities and drops valuable loot upon defeat, allowing players to strategically hunt particular enemies based on the rewards they offer.

  Set in the Wild West,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  predictably features one of the best open-world "wanted" mechanics, placing it at the heart of the game's story. After a botched robbery, Pinkerton agents relentlessly pursue the Van Der Linde gang, including protagonist Arthur Morgan. Throughout key story episodes, players must confront their pursuers directly. Furthermore, various enemy gangs scattered across the game's world will attack Arthur on sight.

  Breaking the law in different regions also attracts the attention of local sheriffs, leading to armed confrontations and subsequent chases.

 <p>
  Everything with a beginning must have an end. Some stories like to extrapolate this idea out to its most maximal possible version: the end of everything. Many video games feature cataclysmic disasters or near-apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic settings. There are a handful that take the player's hand and lead them to the edge, providing video games' own speculative vision as to what the end of the world might look like.

 <p>
  The result is a fantastically diverse array of games with visuals ranging from the bleak to the beautiful, some are all action with big implications and others focus on the minutiae such as talking and walking. Certainly, none of them shy away from the fact that the importance of beginnings is matched by their ending.

  A setting so far-flung into the future that advanced technology has been lost and rediscovered, much of it appearing akin to magic rather than science for many of the world's inhabitants. Mutated pockets of humanity, God (sort of), a story and lore that encompasses millenniums in the telling and is quite hard to comprehend the first time through; the list of Dying Earth genre hallmarks on display goes on.

  There is so much in here that most of the second disc is really the game sitting the player down and asking, "Do you see?", as it forces a long series of slides and scenes presented like amateur theater as it attempts to convey... a lot. However, it was well ahead of its time and even playing it today the sheer scope and experimentalist ideology of
  <em>
   Xenogears
  </em>
  is mind-boggling.

  Hideo Kojima has always been known for his unique stories and the bizarre yet heartfelt cast of characters populating them. His take on the Dying Earth genre presented within
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  is no different. The only game on the list explicitly dealing with extinction on Earth and, as is so often the way with Kojima games, whilst being absurdly fantastical, it manages to be eerily prophetic. The irony of playing a character who is rarely in proximity with others and dislikes being touched wasn't lost on anybody playing it through the COVID-19 pandemic.

  With gameplay focused on traversal through the terrifying version of Earth's extinction: bereft of animal life, devoid of company, where death causes huge explosions called "voidouts," and even the rain ages anything caught in it by years, it can be a somber and scary affair. Yet, at other times, slowly journeying across mountains as an ethereal track by
  <em>
   Low Roar
  </em>
  kicks in just as the destination comes into view, it can be painfully beautiful.

 <p>
  Like many children's classics,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  series isn't afraid of handling mature and dark subjects, none more so than
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  . Considered an S-tier
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game and also the series' darkest entry,
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  wastes no time in setting the scene. Link is stuck in a Groundhog day like scenario except at the end of each cycle the moon will crash into Termina and the player must restart the game; thus, truly making it feel like everything that was just there has gone.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1015} -->

 <p>
  Of course, this fate can be avoided. Link's quest is to stop this world-ending event from occurring and while this is the endgame accomplishment, it certainly isn't the lasting impression left on the player. There is an inescapable knowledge of the inevitable and a mistrust of the Moon while playing through this game.

  The set-up here is similar to a lot of dark fantasy stories: an ancient evil thought long gone has returned, turmoil between species (and the factions within), the gods are dead and the world seems soon to follow. However, it differs in three main areas. For one, it uses Norse inspiration but creates a completely unique world and lore, so the story is new to everyone. Two, it has a gorgeous art style reminiscent of Ralph Bakshi movies. Third and most importantly, how the story unfolds depends massively on player choice.

  Many games have boasted to have impact through player choice but few deliver so well and to such a scale as
  <em>
   The Banner Saga
  </em>
  . Characters may live or die, plot threads are revealed or remain hidden and the world may end or not, all depending on choices made by the player.

  Even Death is dead in The Lands Between. The player character, one of the "Tarnished", is a being resurrected by "Grace". Much of the world and populace of
  <em>
   Elden Ring

  gives the feeling of something dead, passed its time but forced to go on and remain in some sorry state or another.

  The first entry in the list directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki and undoubtedly the closest in parallels to
  <em>
   The Book of the New Sun
  </em>
  , a series of classic novels of the Dying Earth genre written by Gene Wolf. The slow reveal that the Lands Between is as much of a sci-fi setting as a fantasy one is masterfully integrated through the little details given away in item descriptions and progressively otherworldly foes.

  So often, the instigator of the dying Earth within the Dying Earth genre is the oncoming death of the Sun.
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  shares this scenario but expands the concerns of the player beyond the end of one measly planet to an entire solar system. Making space travel feel both comforting in one moment and terrifying in the next is already quite an achievement but even more impressive is just how much feeling is injected into such a large explorable area.

  uses its limited assets to the utmost, delivering tidbits of information through the scenery and side characters and then providing completely different takes on events through the subsequent replays necessary to see the different endings.

  <em>

  is the perfect example of the Dying Earth genre. A beautiful but fading world and the desperation to hold onto that, to hold onto something, is all pervasive. Everyone has needs, a quest, and a purpose. Without it, only hollowness awaits. In the end, everyone succumbs. The horrific holds a sense of tragedy and sometimes sensitivity, whereas nobility and extravagant beauty are often proved to be cruel and ostentatious. Everything once unquestionably true and solid is unraveling, laid bare for the player's eyes.

  Though there were two sequels, both striving to deliver the same message, nothing takes away from the feeling that this world is ending and that ultimately no matter the character build, which ending is chosen or that the player will not be there to experience that very final moment where the world no longer exists, that is still what will happen. It's all there for a moment, unlike any other, and then gone, forever.

   <em>
    Tales

  </strong>
  is one of the most popular and well-known JRPG franchises, next to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  . For years, the series' action-based combat set it apart from its turn-based rivals. Its fighting system remains among the best, even as other JRPG giants have adopted action combat over turn-based.

   ,
  </em>
  the first game in the long-running
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  series, established the many familiar and distinctive elements now synonymous with the franchise. The game kicks off with a bang as the protagonist, Cress, must deal with betrayals, death, and being sent back in time with his allies to thwart the evil Dhaos. It's an excellent late SNES JRPG and places among the best on the system alongside
  <em>

  Unfortunately, the Game Boy Advance port of

  is the only version for the West. Thankfully, a fan translation exists for the superior PlayStation version, allowing it to be played in English. This version is more accurate than the officially localized GBA port.

  Originally launched as
  <em>
   Tales of Destiny 2
  </em>
  in the United States,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tales of Eternia
   </strong>
  </em>
  was ported under its proper name to the PSP in 2006. The proper
  <em>
   Tales of Destiny 2
  </em>
  was never released outside of Japan, but there is a quality fan translation for the PS2. Nevertheless,
  <em>
   Tales of Eternia
  </em>
  was a step-up in visuals compared to its predecessor's SNES-like presentation. The cutscenes, voice acting, FMV cutscenes, and beautifully pre-rendered backdrops still hold up today.

  The game begins with the lead protagonist, Reid, encountering a young girl named Meredy from a world called Celestia. Reid and his friends discover that Meredy is there to prevent a collision between Reid's and Meredy's worlds. There are fewer playable characters besides guests, but the game works towards better character development and interactions. The overworld and dungeon exploration is better, too, with comparisons that can be made to the PS1
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Tales of Destiny
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the second game in the series and was a JRPG favorite on the PS1 in the late 90s. Like the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Tales of Destiny
  </em>
  is a standalone story unrelated to its predecessor,
  <em>
   Tales of Phantasia.
  </em>
  The acton-based combat system made the
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  games stand out from the crowd of turn-based JRPGs, and it’s a system that holds up well against modern titles. Moreover, the story focuses on the plucky hero named Stahn Aileron, who remains a favorite to
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  fans decades later.

 <p>
  Stahn begins his journey as a ship’s stowaway until he discovers a talking magical sword called Dymlos. There are some comical moments between Stahn and the sword, but
  <em>
   Tales of Destiny
  </em>
  finds a way to balance humor and drama in ways that don’t feel out of place, a staple for the series going forward. A Japan-only
  <em>
   Tales of Destiny Director’s Cut
  </em>
  launched on the PS2, which features improved graphics, music, character designs, and a second protagonist.

   <strong>
    Tales of Xillia
   </strong>
  </em>
  features two protagonists with interconnected storylines. Players can choose between Milla Maxwell, the lord of the spirits, and Jude Mathis, a medical student who packs a punch. The perspectives aren’t dramatically different, but they offer events exclusive to the protagonist’s viewpoint. The world-building and character development that
  <em>

  is known for is present as the characters explore the world map area between towns through skits and conserving with NPCs.

 <p>
  The pacing is more urgent than many other

    Tales of the Abyss

  is a stunning entry in the
  <em>
   Tales of
  </em>
  series, and the combat feels like a big step up from the
  <em>
   Tales of Symphonia
  </em>
  . The game features some of the best character development in the series but requires patience to put up with Luke, its lead protagonist.

 <p>
  In the beginning, Luke is a spoiled and entitled teenager, starting the game as one of the most unlikable leads in the series. However, the surprisingly well-told story of identity and finding one's place in the world drives Luke's redemption, and his destiny to become the hero he is supposed to be is gripping and enjoyable. Credit must also go to
  <em>
   Tales of the Abyss
  </em>
  ' world-building, the NPCs, and the distinct towns that still look beautiful on the PS2 and 3DS.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Tales of Berseria
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a prequel to
  <em>
   Tales of Zesteria
  </em>
  but can be played as a standalone title. It was a significant improvement over its predecessor and served to elevate the story of
  <em>
   Zesteria
  </em>
  by adding more context to its world-building.
  <em>
   Tales of Berseria
  </em>
  is the darkest game in the
  <em>
   Tales of
  </em>
  series, with its protagonist, Velvet, being hellbent on vengeance. Velvet's appearance and personality share similarities with Guts from the
  <em>
   Berzerk
  </em>
  manga and anime series.

  The supporting cast is just as compelling as Velvet, each with dark and powerful motivations that drive them. The combat system implements a modified version of the staple Linear Motion Battle System and is frantic and flashy.
  <em>
   Berseria

  is one of the most accessible titles, and its appealing visuals and character designs will attract new players. More importantly, its story is one of the best and most emotional in the series.

  With the best visuals and soundtrack in the series,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tales of Arise

  serves as an excellent starting point for JRPG fans. It has flashy but accessible combat, a good cast of supporting characters, and excellent villains. The environments and towns are stunning, and there are monster hunts, collectibles, and side quests to keep fans busy outside the main quest.

  The
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  games have often touched upon themes of slavery, prejudice, and oppression, and
  <em>
   Tales of Arise
  </em>
  is no different. The execution is implemented well but suffers from excessive exposition in the later chapters, derailing the pacing. Thankfully, it picks up the pace and delivers an excellent conclusion that fans will enjoy. The
  <em>
   Beyond the Dawn
  </em>
  expansion adds a satisfying conclusion to tie up some loose ends and give
  <em>
   Tales of Arise

  fans a reason to continue their adventures with the cast.

   Tales
  </em>
  game, but it features more depth than meets the eye. Moreover, it is home to one of the best antagonists in the
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  series. Moreover,
  <em>
   Tales of Graces F
  </em>
  shines with some of the best combat that
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  fans can discover.

  The character development is excellent as it follows the stories of five children until they become young adults. The prologue aspect is well-executed and lengthy as it develops the characters. However, the game opens up when they are grown up. Even without the main story, the solid crafting system, and the highly customizable characters, players are sure to be kept busy.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Tales of Vesperia: The Definitive Edition
   </strong>
  </em>
  made one of the best games in the
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  series available on other platforms after the original version remained an Xbox 360 exclusive for several years in the West. The art design and cel-shaded visuals hold up beautifully in the 4K remaster, and the new version features a new character included in the Japan-only PS3 version.

  The main protagonist, Yuri, is one of the best (if not the best) protagonists in the
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  series. Refreshingly, he's a mature and cynical character from the start and isn't afraid to take the law into his own hands. The supporting cast is terrific, and the story remains strong throughout. The combat takes the best elements of
  <em>
   Tales of the Abyss
  </em>
  and fine-tunes them into a better system overall with flashier Over Limits and Fatal Strike mechanics.

  For many,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tales of Symphonia
   </strong>
  </em>
  was the first game in the series, especially as it was the only title in many years to launch on a home console in European territories. Even after
  <em>
   Tales of Symphonia,
  </em>
  Europe was left out in the cold, missing out on
  <em>
   Tales of the Abyss
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tales of Legendia
  </em>
  on the PS2, forcing fans to import. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Tales of Symphonia
  </em>
  is more readily available due to the remaster launching on modern consoles.

 <p>
  <em>
   Tales of Symphonia
  </em>
  is a fantastic title that holds a special place in fans' hearts thanks to its character development and terrific story. The combat is excellent, even though it lacks 3D movement on the battlefield, and the cel-shaded visuals have a colorful and timeless look, making the characters and the towns look beautiful. Admittedly, the remaster didn't score well because it lacked modern enhancements, but it is a worthwhile game that's far better than its reviews suggest.

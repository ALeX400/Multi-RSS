  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has created a charming animation with realistic-looking Torchic. The cute
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  video is a play on televised nature programs, giving fans a look at Torchic at a Pokemon Day Care Center.

 <p>
  Torchic has been around since
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire
  </em>
  , where it premiered as the game's Fire-type Starter Pokemon. The small bird Pokemon has been well-loved ever since. Given Torchic's potential as a Pokemon partner, many fans may have brought a Torchic to the local Pokemon Day Care to boost its level or to breed the Pokemon. This video offers a glimpse into what that could look like.

 <p>
  YouTube channel Elious Entertainment has created a Pokemon nature program demonstrating what a bunch of Torchic staying at the Pokemon Day Care on Route 117 could look like. The cute video is narrated, describing the area and talking about the conservation of Pokemon. The video watches a number of Torchic who are contentedly exploring their environment in the outdoor area of the Day Care, while the narrator talks about the Pokemon species and its unique qualities. The lifelike motion of the Torchic really sells it, as it darts its head around to look at its environment like many small birds do.

 <p>
  The concept of the video is good on its own, but the execution is where it really shines. The fluff on Torchic's neck and its altered design to make it seem more like a cross between a real bird and a Pokemon help to increase realism. Meanwhile, the inclusion of a Ditto in the background of some shots of the Pokemon Day Care cleverly references one of the most popular methods of breeding Pokemon.

  Pokemon fans frequently think about what their favorite creatures could look like in the real world. Plenty of Pokemon fans have created artworks depicting Pokemon as more like their real-world inspirations, like more cat-like Sprigatito. Wishing that Pokemon were real is something that many kids may have felt while growing up with the games or anime, perhaps leading to some creative designs.

  The official series hasn't been shy about the concept of real-life Pokemon, either.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  uses AR to overlay Pokemon into reality, the
  <em>
   Detective Pikachu
  </em>
  movie combines footage of actors with CG Pokemon, and there have also been plenty of promos and ads that show real people interacting with Pokemon. It's likely the blend of the fictional franchise and the real world will continue in official and unofficial projects for a long time yet.

  Some
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  players are loving a new feature that allows them to see the health bar of their enemies.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  has a somewhat controversial history of introducing new features and changes that don't always get the best feedback. With the arrival of Season 11, it was no different, and the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  community found itself in the middle of a new controversy.

 <p>
  On July 9, Blizzard released the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  mid-season update, bringing a new crossover with
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  . But the collaboration ended up relatively overshadowed due to immediate backlash from players because the same
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  patch made tanks much stronger, even dominant names like Mauga and Sigma. On the other hand, Cassidy had his effectiveness reduced in long-range fights, which became a kind of indirect buff for the tanks. But despite the argument,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players agree that one of the changes made by the patch has had a positive impact on the game.

  <em>
   Overwatch 2

  players are praising the new quality-of-life feature that displays the health bar of enemies when they are low. One of these players is Reddit user Ts_Patriarca, who expressed surprise that "no one is talking" about the feature they call a "game changer." They point out that the change has helped them mainly because they play
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  as Tracer, whose main job is to reach the enemy back line to take out damage dealers and support.

  In the comments, other

  players echoed the OP's sentiment, with some defining the change as "the best addition of the mid-season patch." Another Redditor said that they play
  <em>

  as Winston, and because of this change was able to "finish off a few enemies that they wouldn't have killed otherwise." In another post by Ts_Patriarca, they show the health bar feature in practice by achieving an impressive team kill while playing as Tracer.

  As well as being a helping hand in confirming kills that would previously have been more tricky, other players have noticed how the health bar display of low enemies is a great help for those playing
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  solo, and even for teams with communication. It's important to note, however, that while the new feature allows one to play
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  more aggressively, the opposite can also happen. Since the player's health bar is visible to opponents, it will be important to learn when to play more defensively.

  datamining appears to have revealed that the games originally had different names. It's not clear if these alternate names were only intended for internal use, or if the games nearly shipped with different titles entirely. However, the
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire
  </em>
  files shed some light on the development process of the games and creates an interesting "what-if" scenario to think about.

  offered a major graphical leap over its core series predecessors.

  Dataminers KmiE_821 and Wobbuu revealed that they were looking through the

The data seems to indicate that the games may have been called Pokemon Indigo and Pokemon Crimson at one point. The names are in Japanese, written as "藍バージョン" and "朱バージョン," or "Indigo Version" and "Crimson Version."

 <p>
  KmiE_821 notes that "Indigo" and "Crimson" are their translations. There's no guarantee that Nintendo and Game Freak would have used those exact English words to title the two games, as there are many similar shades of red that might fit. For example, another vivid red shade like "Vermillion" also seems plausible. Interestingly, Indigo and Vermillion are both relevant to the series, with the Indigo League and Vermillion City. However, this could be pure coincidence.

  Outside of the file data itself, one can only speculate regarding what these alternate titles might have been for. While it's possible that the developers were at one time considering color-based
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game names, it's also possible that these were simply placeholder titles that were never intended to be used outside the developer team. In any case, it did ultimately stick with a similar color palette with the red and blue
  <em>
   Ruby
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sapphire
  </em>
  , respectively.

  While datamining and various leaks can reveal some development background of games, there are some uncovered secrets that might remain unexplained. Without confirmation from a developer, fans will likely never know if the third generation of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  would have had a completely different pair of names, but it's an interesting possibility to think about.

  Chances are you have already come across several blue helix-shaped flowers in the wild that contain personalized messages from other players. They are called Whispers in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Once Human
   </strong>
  </em>
  , a fairly charming and popular social element
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  that encourages players to interact with each other in the eerie post-apocalyptic open world.

 <p>
  Whispers work similarly to the Tarnished's Wizened Fingers in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , allowing players to leave messages on the ground for others to read. They can contain anything from a simple hello to welcome new players, a warning about a trap or a roaming boss up ahead, a helpful tip to solve a puzzle, or just plain ramblings.

 <p>
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , however, has a habit of letting players figure out things on their own. If you are wondering how to drop notes with personalized messages, here's what you do.

   Whispers have to be crafted from the Supplies Workbench
  </strong>
  . They cannot be purchased, which is a relief considering how even basic features such as changing names and appearances cost money in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . Whispers can also be crafted early in the game, so you can start dropping notes as soon as you complete the tutorial.

 <p>
  The first thing to do is fast-travel back to your base and interact with the Supplies Workbench. It should already be built as part of the starting objectives to expand your territory in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . If not, unlock Essential Tools from the Crafting Memetic upgrade tree and build a Supplies Workbench.

  The option to craft Whispers automatically comes with the Supplies Workbench. There are no other crafting requirements or recipes.
  <strong>
   Each Whisper item costs 5x Wood

  Using a Whisper can be a bit confusing in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . Unlike other items in your inventory that can be clicked to activate or consume, Whispers have no interactive prompt.
  <strong>
   You have to drag Whispers to your hotbar
  </strong>
  from the inventory screen. Then get back into the game and press the respective hotkey to get a pop-up screen where you can start typing a little note.

  Whispers can be written with a lot of detail. In addition to the title and 150-word body text, you can select pre-defined category tags and upload screenshots taken by your camera. Since any screenshot can be attached from your album, not just the one taken at the time, you can manually copy all sorts of images to the local folder and upload them with Whispers. All screenshots taken by the camera are saved in the following folder: steam\steamapps\common\once human\documents\res\

  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  can be pretty taxing on old hardware. Its PC system specifications state that
  <strong>
   you need an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 or better graphics card
  </strong>
  to maintain 60 frames per second. While recommended by the developer, using an Nvidia GeForce 1060 or even GeForce 1080 for that matter will result in frame drops and stuttering when there are too many things to render on the screen. Since players are spamming Whispers in every location, it can be cumbersome for your budget gaming PC to render them all. This can be frustrating when reaching a base or settlement where dozens of Whispers hinder you from smoothly doing the most basic tasks. Fortunately, there is an easy fix to the problem.

 <p>
  Head into the pause menu by pressing Escape, and then select Settings. Scroll down all the way in the Mouse/Display tab and turn off the Display Whispers option. When disabled, Whisper items will no longer be shown in the game. You can, however, still search for your notes and those left by other players through the Whisper screen.

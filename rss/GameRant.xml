  leak has provided information on Kinich's skill set, explaining how his elemental skill, burst, and talent work. Kinich will be one of the first characters that players will meet in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's Natlan region. He will arrive in version 5.0, which is set to be released next month. Drip marketing campaigns launched by HoYoverse suggest the character will become playable simultaneously with Kachina.

  The names of these Natlan-based characters may be unfamiliar to many

  players, as they were first revealed a few days ago. Details about their abilities and stories are scarce, but their marketing campaigns showed how their outfits would look. Kachina dons a brown skirt, a short wrap, and multicolored socks. Kinich, on the other hand, wears a pair of gloves, green trousers, a bandana, and a black shirt.

  version 5.0 leak from Foul has revealed details about Kinich, who will be a five-star Dendro user. This character performs up to three strikes with his normal attack. He fires a grappling hook to swing in the air upon using his Elemental Skill. When enemies are nearby, Kinich fires that hook at them and enters a combat state, during which he gains Night Spirit Value points. If the Dendro user collects enough points, he can launch a bomb attack on opponents.

  Kinich's elemental burst, Hail to the Almighty Dragonlord, allows him to deal AoE Dendro damage. It will reportedly have an 18-second cooldown and consume 70 energy. As per the leak, one of his passives lets him perform a second mid-air swing by consuming 10 Night Spirit Value points, while the other provides a temporary effect that lasts for 15 seconds.

  Kinich will allegedly specialize in

 <p>
  Aside from Kinich,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  will introduce Kachina in the version 5.0 update. Based on early leaks, she will have a four-star rarity and a Geo vision. Unlike Kinich, the upcoming unit will specialize in the Polearm weapon type. As revealed by prominent leakers, her kit will provide temporary bonuses and AoE Geo damage. It will allegedly allow Kachina to summon a companion and create a special area to turn the tides of battles.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  players can expect her to be featured on Kinich's debut banner in version 5.0.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>

  leak revealed that a new arcade mini-game might be on the horizon. Set in New Eridu,
  <em>

  has a number of interactive locations where the Proxy can get upgrades and rewards, such as the arcade.

  's Godfinger is an arcade on Sixth Street in New Eridu, where the Proxy can play mini-games, such as Snake Duel and Soul Hounds III, to kill time and farm Denny and other materials whenever they reach certain milestones. Fans can choose to play solo or match with a group of people in both mini-games, and they can also choose between Arcade Mode and Event Mode. The latter is a limited-time mode where players can win rewards, like Polychromes and Boopons, using vouchers.

 <p>
  Recently, a leak revealed that
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  might add a new arcade mini-game called Bizarre Brigade. A short Reddit video from leaker BabyMonsterTeam showed that the mini-game might be a bullet hell game inspired by
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  , which might also allow players to unlock different characters with different abilities. The leaker, however, didn't share when this rumored mini-game would come out, so
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  fans should take this news with a grain of salt for now.

  In the comments, many
  <em>

  fans expressed their excitement that there might be a new arcade mini-game coming because they love stopping by in between Proxy commissions. Plus, apart from comparisons to

  gives players a lot of opportunities to farm Polychromes and Boopons for gacha pulls and materials to build Agents through its many game modes. Arcade mini-games are just the tip of the iceberg, as players can do various side commissions and Hollow Zero challenges. All these options are useful in prepping Agents for tough battles as

  Since launching earlier this month,
  <em>

  has already teased future content featuring new characters, such as the upcoming S-rank banner characters Jane Doe and Qingyi and the A-rank character Seth Lowell. There are also several leaks already teasing future

  A new development has arisen on the official Discord channel for
  <em>
   <strong>
    The First Descendant
   </strong>
  </em>
  , with Nexon stating that the upcoming hotfix will nerf gold farms, after all. The new statement explains the lengthy director's comment on the state of Vulgus Strategic Outpost in

 <p>
  Korean Action RPG titles, especially the free-to-play ones, are known for their penchant for grinding. Similar to
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  is no different in this regard, but players have found a simple workaround to their troubles through the Strategic Outpost farming using Valby, also known as the "Valby Run". Due to the mobs spawning infinitely at the Fortress Outpost, players can easily farm up to three times more gold here than anywhere else, causing an extreme in-game imbalance.

 <p>
  As first reported in an article by PCGames, Nexon has issued a new statement on its official Discord. In this statement, Nexon explains that the farming efficiency of the Fortress Outpost will be made similar to that of other popular farming sites within
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  . This implies direct nerfs to the Fortress Outpost, which is not something the fans expected in the least.

  The statement is in direct opposition to the initial comment found on the developer's official website, where Nexon states: "We’re preparing a patch without completely blocking The Fortress Outpost issue", continuing on to say that it will be updating other farming locations only a few days after
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  hotfix 1.0.3 to match the efficiency of The Fortress Outpost, such as reducing the cool time for Vulgus Strategic Outpost and rebalancing the locations for collecting Void Fragments.

  The "Valby Run" has become a beloved part of
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  , and the plan to leave it as is with alternative solutions instead of the usual nerfs had the community in a positive uproar, singing Nexon's praises. As such, the company changing its tune and nerfing the best gold farm in
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  currently would go against all the hype the company has built up among the player base.

 <p>
  The ambiguity of Nexon's latest statement, and the straightforward official comment by the CEO where he states that the company has no intention to respond by outright nerfing certain content, still points to the direction that outright nerfs may not be the solution Nexon has in mind. After all, Nexon's response to
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  AFK farming was both prompt and effective. For now, fans will have to remain patient and see exactly what changes are made, but the new statement is worrying.

  When people think of the Poke Balls available in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the standard Poke Ball is what most people think of, alongside iconic colors such as the Great and Ultra Ball options. But, some casual players may not be aware that there are just an absolute ton of Poke Ball options out there. Each one has a different function, and they sometimes can be as rare as the rarest

  When it's sometimes a mad dash to try to catch a Pokemon, some pro players even get pretty picky about what ball they put specific Pokemon in for cosmetic reasons. Let's take a look at the 15
  <strong>
   best types of Poke Balls
  </strong>
  in the
  <em>
   Pokemon

  games, including some of the lesser-known catching devices out there.

  Instead of being in one of the ancient Hisui Poke Balls, it will instead be placed inside a strange ball. This is useful for getting one of the Pokemon exclusive to Hisui into one of the newer games. Perfect for Pokedex completionists. This teal-colored ball has no additional effects or anything else special around it other than its appearance.

  The Pokemon captured doesn't even remain in the Park Ball, it returns to the Pokeball that it was captured in in the Gen 3 game. As this feature is now obsolete, there is no need for the Park Ball. Although balls of this similar ilk have been repurposed, this one is left in Generation 4.

  For the purpose of this list, all Hisui base Pokeballs have been grouped as one, as they have no difference from their regular counterparts.
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  is set in the past; thus, in Hisui they did not have the technology to match the modern Pokeballs.

 <p>
  Functionally, they work the same as regular balls, with the Poke Ball being the weakest, the Great Ball having a better catch rate and Ultra Balls working even better. The Hisuian Poke Ball is weaker than the regular one, with a 0.75x catch rate as opposed to the 1x of the Poke Ball. They look perfect as an ancient Poke Ball and can be crafted in-game using materials found across the map.

  The Sport Ball, or as it was formerly known as the Park Ball, is a unique item in that it was originally only accessed as part of the Bug-Catching Contest in the Johto region. The Park Ball was renamed as the Sport Ball due to the Park Ball being used as the ball in Pal Park, a method of transferring Pokemon from previous games in

    Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl
   </em>
  </strong>

  In the anime, it has a very different appearance, but in modern entries, it is essentially just a Poke Ball with a design on the red part of it. Starting in Generation 8,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the Sport Ball was reintroduced in the franchise but with no additional effects. It functions the same as a regular Poke Ball.

  introduced a lot of different Pokemon Balls as part of the Apricorn crafting mechanic. Although a lot of these balls have tons of uses, the Moon Ball doesn't fit into this category.

  The Moon Ball gives a 4x boost to the catch rate if a Moon Stone can evolve the Pokemon. There are only six Pokemon that fit into this, and two of these did not even exist when Pokemon Gold &amp; Silver first came out. Given that G&amp;S introduced a day-and-night cycle into the franchise, the Moon Ball should have been the ball that boosted the catch rate at night. This was, however, given to the Dusk Ball in Generation 4. It is also worth noting that the Moon Ball only had a 1x catch rate modifier in Generation 2 due to a programming error. The ball was actually useless.

  The Level Ball may be tricky to work out, but essentially, it is a ball that works better the higher the trainer's Pokemon's level is than the Pokemon said trainer is trying to catch. If the wild Pokemon is level 2 then the trainer's Pokemon will need to be level 8 or higher to get an 8x catch rate.

 <p>
  Although the idea may be good in theory, there is no real use for this ball as Pokemon which require a ball with a higher catch rate are usually a higher level than the trainers, so it does kind of render the Level Ball useless.

  Originally introduced in generation 5, the Dream Ball was used exclusively in Entree Forest to capture Pokemon found in the dreamy world. But from
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield
  </em>
  , it was reintroduced as a Poke Ball to work better on Pokemon that have been put to sleep, already an effective method of catching Pokemon.

  With a very nice design, the Dream Balls are an effective tool in the player's arsenal as they have a 4x capture rate, much more effective than an Ultra Ball. Make sure to have a Pokemon with Hypnosis or Yawn and fire those balls away till the Pokemon is captured.

  Most special versions of Poke Ball work better on Pokemon under a certain criterion, and as the Lure Ball's name suggests, it works 4x more effectively when the Pokemon has been fished up. Fans of the anime may remember the Lure Ball as it held one of Ash Ketchum's Pokemon, Totodile. There was a whole episode around Ash and Misty fighting over who caught the fun-loving crocodile in a Lure Ball.

  The Gigaton Ball is an upgraded version of the Leaden Ball which is unlocked later in the game's story, the Leaden Ball is, in turn, an improved Heavy Ball. The Generation 2 ball is inspired by this older version of the ball, signified by the two smaller balls on top of the item. When using this in the game it will not fly too far, so it is ground because they can easily be snuck up on.

  Just like the Gigaton Ball, the Jet Ball is a better version of the Feather Ball and the Wing Ball, with a superior catch rate. The Jet Ball can fly far through the air, so it is used on Pokemon that are flying or far away, as players must aim and throw Pokeballs themselves in
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>

 <p>
  Unlike the Gigaton Ball, there is no modern incarnation of the Jet Ball, as there are no Poke Balls that work better on flying Pokemon. Perhaps this could be a feature used for future installments in the franchise.

  The ball's design is reminiscent of a Cherish Ball, using its ruby red color scheme, but it can also be seen as the first version of a Master Ball, as that is essentially what it is used for. Unlike the Master Ball, the player has no choice which Pokemon the Origin Ball can be used on. This spectacular item is also the only Poke Ball in the franchise that is registered as a Key Item in the games.

  Boosting a Pokemon's friendship can be a bit of a chore. It doesn't matter how many vitamins a Trainer feeds it or how many levels it gains, the process is still incredibly slow. The Luxury Ball helps to double the rate at which friendship is gained, but even that is not fast enough. If only there was a way to max out friendship from the start!

 <p>
  That's the purpose of the Friend Ball, added in
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold &amp; Silver
  </em>
  . It has the same catch rate as the basic Poke Ball but instantly sets the caught Pokemon's friendship to 150 (in
  <em>
   Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  ). For evolving Pokemon like Chansey or Golbat, this is a must-have Poke Ball. It also helps make Return a super-powerful move instantly, at least in the games that have the move. The Friend Ball's design isn't exactly aesthetically pleasing, but it does the job effectively.

  Players can snag a Friend Ball by capturing and registering approximately 260 Pokemon in the Paldea Pokedex and 160 Pokemon in the Kitakami Pokedex. Friend Balls can also be obtained as a possible reward prize from the Academy Ace Tournament. Players should note this tournament can only be accessed at the academy front desk once players have beaten the main game and conquered all eight gyms. Sometimes, Friend Balls will show up at the Porto Marinada Auction or the Item Printer as part of the Poke Ball Lotto.

  had a lot of water Pokemon and water routes. It also added a whole section of underwater areas using the Dive HM. So, these underwater areas needed their own special Poke Ball, one separate from the Nest Ball or the Lure Ball. When a Trainer goes diving, it only makes sense for them to bring a Dive Ball.

  The Dive Ball is incredibly situational. It has a lot of overlap with the Net Ball and the Lure Ball, with the Net Ball being just more versatile across the board. The Dive Ball is boosted while surfing, fishing, or underwater, giving a 3.5x catch rate modifier. For Pokemon like Dratini, who can be found through fishing and surfing, it's actually pretty useful. Its design is also blue and serene, like the ocean waves. Water-type Pokemon specialists may fancy this Poke Ball purely for its pleasant design.

Sometimes, patrons at the Porto Marinada auctions will offer up Dive Balls, and players can also find them at some Delibird Presents shops.

  There are a few Poke Balls that require the Trainer to have already caught the Pokemon. This seems like it would be entirely pointless, but there are reasons to have a whole collection of one species of Pokemon. For example, when Christmas is approaching, it only makes sense to punish the children on Wonder Trade with an armada of Delibird. In those situations, the Repeat Ball is ideal to have around.

  The Repeat Ball is boosted when used on a Pokemon that is registered in the player's Pokedex already. It is, in fact, designed for repeats. For most Trainers, this isn't that useful. However, its design is pretty distinct, with a bright red color being dotted by circles across the top. If the player is looking for a snazzy Poke Ball to catch a personal favorite, this is a good option.

  The Dusk Ball is possibly one of the most cost-effective and useful Poke Balls in the whole series. Introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon Diamond &amp; Pearl
  </em>
  , the Dusk Ball boosts catch rates when used in a cave or, more importantly, at night. The catch rate goes past the Ultra Ball and can be used in nearly every situation, meaning that night owls get a boost while catching Pokemon.

  Players of
  <em>

  <em>

  likely purchased these more than any other Poke Ball (aside from the Quick Ball) since they were incredibly versatile. On top of that, they also have a cool design, looking somewhat ghoulish and spooky. Fans of Ghost Pokemon or ghost-hunting in general probably like the vibe of the Dusk Ball.

  Similar to many of the other Pokeballs ranked here, Dusk Balls can be obtained by visiting Delibird Presents stores and are sometimes available at the Porto Marinada auctions. They're also available as a reward for registering 140 Pokemon in the Pokedex and become available to purchase at the Pokemon Center shop once players amass seven badges.

  When talking about situational Poke Balls, the Beast Ball is potentially the best example. The ball is specifically designed to capture the Ultra Beasts, which it does with relative ease. For other Pokemon, it makes catching them harder. Aside from the Heavy Ball, it is the only other Poke Ball that hinders catch rate.

 <p>
  Against a regular Pokemon, the Beast Ball reduces the catch rate to 0.1 of its base value. This makes it completely useless for catching pretty much anything. However, its design is one of the coolest, being a futuristic ball with cool gold accents. For Trainers looking to flex on their opponents, catching a regular Pokemon in a Beast Ball is a great way to show that they mean business.

  How To Acquire Beast Balls In Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are only four ways to obtain Beast Balls in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  , making them a relatively rare item. To get a Beast Ball, players will need to progress to the late game, as they're sometimes given as a prize for completing the Academy Ace Tournament that becomes available after beating the game itself and all eight gyms. Players will also get a Beast Ball if they manage to find and capture all 400 Pokemon and successfully register them in the Paldea Pokedex or for 220 Pokemon in the Blueberry Pokedex. They can also sometimes be rewarded with the Item Printer Poke Ball as part of the Pokeball Lotto.

But, a rarer version is available, known as the Premier Ball. Starting in the third-generation games, the Premier Ball could be obtained for free for every 10 Poke Balls purchased.

  This ball is effectively identical to the standard red and white Poke Ball, but the coloring is entirely white with a red band across the center where the Poke Ball is black. Cosmetically, it is entirely more appealing and stands out in a sea of ordinary balls.

  It would just be wrong to have a list of "
  <strong>
   best Poke Ball types

  " in Pokemon without mentioning the Master of them all. The Master Ball is meant to be a unique item in the Pokemon games in that it has a 100% catch rate. It doesn't matter if players throw it at a Magikarp (please don't) or a Mewtwo -- it will catch it.

  In the original games, Trainers earn a prototype model of the Master Ball as thanks for helping Silph Co. But, in later games, it's possible to obtain more than one. In fact, in

  , and

  Not to be confused with the Quick Ball, the Fast Ball is another one of the Apricorn exclusive items, first introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold &amp; Silver
  </em>
  . The red and yellow design just emanates speed and this ball gives a 4x catch rate for Pokemon with at least a 100 base speed stat. Back in
  <em>
   Gold &amp; Silver
  </em>
  , this wasn't too many, but still, it had a use.

  It was designed to capture Pokemon who are likely to run away; the roaming Pokemon Raikou in the Johto games, for example. But it was replaced with a better tool in the next generation...

  They can be found randomly at the Porto Marinada auctions. Players can also receive them as a reward for completing the Academy Ace Tournament and are guaranteed to receive them for capturing and registering 240 Pokemon. The balls can also be found as a reward in the Poke Ball Lotto at the Item Printers in the Blueberry Academy.

  Love Balls look adorable, sporting a heart on the front and a pink shell, but they can be utilized for people who are hunting for Pokemon they already own. The ball will have a higher catch rate if the Trainer's Pokemon is the same species but the opposite gender.

 <p>
  This knocks the catch rate up to 8x a normal Poke Ball, which could be useful when shiny hunting or just trying to find a mate for a Pokemon. These are also popular due to them being introduced in Gen 2 via needing to turn pink apricots into Poke Balls.

  How To Acquire Love Balls In Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet
 </h3>
 <p>
  Love Balls can be found in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet by visiting the Porto Marinada auction. They will sometimes show up as an offering and players can bid against NPCs to obtain them. Past that, the only way to snag a Love Ball is by entering (and winning) the Academy Ace Tournament, which is available after players beat the game and all eight gyms. Even then, players will only have a chance to obtain the ball and will need to keep checking both areas to farm them effectively.

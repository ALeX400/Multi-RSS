      The Borderlands film's separate universe allows for new stories to be told without adhering strictly to game lore.
     </li>
     <li>
      Familiar characters and Easter eggs cater to fans, but overall the film is able to provide an entry point into the franchise for a new audience.
     </li>
     <li>
      The film's existence in its own universe opens the door to future movies with entirely fresh stories instead of video game retellings, avoiding franchise fatigue.

 <p>
  Months ahead of its release, the live-action
  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands
   </em>
  </strong>
  film has significantly divided the fan base, primarily due to concerns about its treatment of the lore established by the video game series. In response to all the controversy, Gearbox confirmed that the film takes place in its own universe, but many longtime
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  fans have still neglected to give the film their support. Nevertheless, Gearbox remains committed to creating a separate cinematic universe for the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  film, which could be highly beneficial in the long run.

 <p>
  Cinematic universes are not uncommon in the world of adaptations. The success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example, has proven over time how a separate universe in which a pre-established world exists can differ from its source material and still be effective. Game Rant had the chance to interview the creator of
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , Randy Pitchford, about the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  movie and how it benefits from having a universe separate from the games.

 <p>
  While some die-hard
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  fans might want the live-action adaptation to be purely representative of what they've experienced in the games, that almost defeats the entire purpose of an adaptation — which is to adapt source material to fit a different medium. In that, some degree of evolution needs to take place, and the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  movie's cinematic universe allows for that evolution to happen. Regarding the film's separate universe, Pitchford explained,
 </p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   ...we kind of created an alternate universe with the film. We have our storyline, and we have where we've been and where we're headed [in the games], and that's really important to us. With the film space, instead of just recreating the exact same stories we've already done, we can play with it a little bit and try some different things.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  movie's separate universe allows the creators to use familiar characters like Lilith and iconic images from the franchise, all while creating new stories for a much broader audience to experience. Despite these new stories, the filmmakers have ensured fans will be served a hefty amount of Easter eggs throughout the film. When asked about how the film will bridge the gap between fan service and originality, Pitchford replied,
 </p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We did a lot of fun stuff. You'll see a lot of little nods and little tips of the hat. But we also know that there are a lot of people who are going to see this that have never played a
   <em>
    Borderlands
   </em>
   game before, and we need to give them an entry point.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>
  So, a brand-new universe for the world of
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  to live in allows for newcomers to the franchise to have a proper entry point, just as those who are now passionate fans of the franchise were once given an entry point into the bizarre universe of the game series with the release of
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  in 2009. However, one more purpose behind allowing the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  movie to exist in its own universe ultimately sets it up for the future, where the potential for more films can be realized. In the context of future
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  films, Pitchford explained,
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":558} -->
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We're not going to run into a
   <em>
    Lord of the Rings
   </em>
   problem or a
   <em>
    Harry Potter
   </em>
   problem, where once you finish the books, no more movies. So, we just completely avoided that problem, which gives a huge amount of liberty for the film universe to live its own life and the video game universe to live its own life.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>
  It's clear that the live-action
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  movie was not made solely for the fans, and that's okay. Instead, it was made to draw a new audience into its world, regardless of how unfamiliar they may be with the source material. This is the benefit of the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  games and the film living in separate universes, as they can thrive in their own spaces without depending on one another for life.

  's map is filled to bursting with secrets to find, stories to uncover, and items to find. One location you're likely to explore early in your adventure is Churchill Library, found a little way north of the Swan and Mitre. While most of the Library is easy to access, its lowest floor contains a sealed room labeled "Banned Books." Naturally, like any good explorer, you'll want to break in and see what the Library is hiding.

  To break into the Banned Books room in Fallout London, you'll need to find the corpse of the Head Librarian. They're the one who had the key, so hopefully they haven't gone too far. This guide will explain how to find them and what you can find inside the Banned Books section of Churchill Library.

  The easiest way to track down the Churchill Library is by starting "Sabertooth" Syd's Quest: Catching Up. You can start this quest after protecting the Swan and Mitre from an attack by the Isle of Dogs Syndicate, speaking to Yvette, and tracking down the scout who ran to call reinforcements. Once you've done this, Yvette invite you into the Vagabonds and you'll be able to talk to Syd about his request. He'll ask you to get him some Children's Books from the Churchill Library, marking it as a quest destination and thus revealing it on the map.

  To get into the Banned Books Room, you'll need to find the Head Librarian since all the evidence around the library suggests that they have a key. Luckily for us, they've not gone very far. Unluckily for them, they're extremely dead. You can find them by heading to the lowest floor and turning left at the bottom of the stairs, leading you to the bathrooms. The right bathroom contains a handy stash of explosives, while the left bathroom contains the corpse of the Head Librarian and an angry ghoul.
  <strong>
   In the sink, you'll find the key to the Banned Books Room.

 <p>
  With a backstory as deep as what has been presented in the base game of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  , there were plenty of opportunities for the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC to answer many open questions. The new boss, Metyr, Mother of Fingers may be one of the most influential additions to the game's lore, delivering much needed context to everything from a strange type of enemy mob to the nature of the God-like Two Fingers.

 <p>
  On top of the lore implications, Metyr also brings an impressive fight to
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  that follows in the footsteps of other FromSoftware designs that pit the player against a deity in an otherworldly lake. Combine this fight with an elongated quest that highlights the strangest aspect of the game world, and Metyr stands tall as a highlight of
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  .

  A Quest Across the Shadow Lands
 </h3>
 <p>
  To even find Metyr in the first place, players will need to explore the outer edges of the Shadow Lands. This starts with finding Count Ymir in the Cathedral of Manus Metyr before then heading out to find the three Finger Ruins scattered throughout
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . While it might originally feel like a lengthy series of trips to several strange locations, this quest does a lot of heavy lifting to expand the lore of the themes of fingers found throughout
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . In fact, it is through this quest that players can first learn about Metyr and what her title as Mother of Fingers really means.

 <p>
  As is explained by Count Ymir, and later expanded on with Metyr's Remembrance, the Mother of Fingers is the first envoy of the Great Will and created all of the Finger-themed creatures and items found throughout
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . These include the Fingercreepers, as well as possibly some of the furled finger items that connect worlds and allow for multiplayer. However, most important to the lore is the fact that Metyr is the source of the iconic Two Fingers that bind Empyreans to the Great Will. A great feat accomplished so long ago that Ymir believes it is time for both Metyr and her creations to be replaced.

 <h3 id="how-to-replace-the-mother-of-fingers">
  How to Replace the Mother of Fingers
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the case of replacing the Mother of Fingers for Count Ymir, this means heading into the final Finger Ruins and being transported into a space between worlds reminiscent of the fight against Rom the Vacuous Spider in
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  . Unlike Rom, though, Metyr displays
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's signature aggression from start to finish and doesn't rely on filling the arena with smaller enemies in order to win. That doesn't mean that Metyr won't summon little Fingercreepers to catch the player off guard, but simply that it isn't even close to being the most dangerous attack in the boss' arsenal. Although, it doesn't appear at first that Metyr's arsenal is really much to worry about during the initial phase of the fight.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1191} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Moving into phase two, however, Metyr quickly becomes one of the most demanding enemies in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . Having started with little more than a series of slams and the occasional laser attacks, Metyr begins to call upon the true power of the cosmos from the fingers arching up from the boss' backside, with a massive explosion and arena-spanning lasers. It is an incredible step up in difficulty, as Metyr continues to pile on the pressure and gives fewer opportunities to attack between the onslaught of cosmic magic and heavy slams. With the phase shift that showcases Metyr's power as the first envoy to the Lands Between and the direct expansion of the lore, the Mother of Fingers certainly makes a name for herself in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and its DLC.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  has an extensive range of weapons for players to wield, from simple knives to ornate swords and colossal axes. FromSoftware’s latest release is not lacking in choice. Including such a large selection of weapons in the game massively increases the replay value of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and allows players to experiment with builds and playstyles. Where one weapon may struggle against a particular boss, another may be incredibly effective.

 <p>
  Beating
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is no simple task, though, and with various build options available, weapon choice changes from player to player. While every weapon in the game is viable, some are just better than others. The weapons on this list can be effective tools against the many enemies of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , but for the most part, there are just too many better options available.

    Updated on July 31, 2024, by Andy Chapman
   </strong>
   : With the release of Elden Ring’s seminal DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, players have been busy discovering all the new weaponry now available in the Land of Shadow. With these latest additions, new weapon categories have been introduced that have changed how the game is played. As such, new favorites have emerged, creating exciting possibilities for victory. While many of these weapons are effective tools for defeating enemies, some are more underwhelming. Every weapon in Elden Ring is a viable option. However, certain weapons provide little benefit for a quick victory and are better suited to challenge runs. This article has been updated to include even more of the
   <strong>
    worst weapons in Elden Ring
   </strong>
   , and not even those found in Shadow of the Erdtree are safe.

   Moonrithyll's Knight Sword

  is a solid choice for intelligence-based characters looking for strong melee damage. However, players may feel a strange sense of deja vu when wielding this large sword. This is because it is a virtual copy of the

  While this doesn’t make it a terrible weapon choice, few players will pick the sword over more interesting options. The unique weapon skill found on Monirthyll's Knight Sword does nothing to elevate it above the largely forgotten colossal sword found in the base game.

  The weapon offers decent scaling but fails to impress much beyond this. In a weapon category filled with exceptional swords, the Troll’s Golden Sword will rarely be taken by most players. Although the damage output is good and has lower use requirements than most swords of its type, it just can’t compete with the

   Pest's Glaive
  </span>
  is one of the weaker halberd options in the game. For dex builds, the weapon can be effective against enemies with its fast slash attacks. It can also be improved with different ashes of war. With its stylish look, the weapon feels like it should be better. But with its standard weapon art, it's simply a better-looking Glaive that deals less damage.

 <p>
  The Pest Glaive may be a cool-looking weapon but is outclassed by stronger halberds in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . This could be an effective early-game choice for dex players willing to travel into the Caelid region, but for most, the Pest Glaive will likely never leave the inventory.

   Vulgar Militia Shotel

  is one of two weapons dropped by the Vulgar Militiamen, who are found throughout the Lands Between. The Shotel offers decent range and can bypass enemy shields, but it lacks anything more that would make it a weapon of choice.

  While the Spear does inflict blood loss on enemies, fewer players will choose the Bloodfiend's Fork above other armaments. Its low damage output, weak scaling, and generic weapon skill do little to excite. There are just too many powerful options for arcane players, making this one of the more forgettable weapons in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC.

 <p>
  Fist weapons in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  are generally best left for more experienced players. Their short range and low damage make boss fights difficult to win, especially in the late stages where the game’s difficulty increases significantly.
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  has introduced several new weapons to this category, with the

   Golem Fist

  scaling with Strength, rather than the more usual Dexterity.

 <p>
  While the Golem Fist deals decent damage, compared to other fist weapons, most strength-based characters are better off choosing a larger, more effective armament. While the weapon skill, Endure, is underwhelming, the Golem Fist does have the bonus of a ranged attack. However, this does not save the weapon from being underwhelming and easily bypassed.

   Eclipse Shotel
  </span>
  is one of the legendary armaments in the game but fails to live up to its status. The Shotel’s weapon art is effective at breaking an enemy’s stance but just doesn't offer the damage output of other weapons. In addition, it is also supposed to inflict deathblight on contact. Unfortunately, the vast majority of enemies in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  are unaffected by this effect.

 <p>
  The weapon is only effective in PvP scenarios, as other tarnished can be affected by deathblight. As a legendary armament, the Eclipse Shotel is let down by its poor range, low damage, and near-useless weapon art.

  Of all the weapon categories found in
  <em>

  While its unique weapon skill is fun to use, its slow wind-up leaves players wide open to attack. Many may miss this weapon altogether, as it is located in the often ignored Fog Rift Fort, in a well-guarded chest. However, with its unimpressive damage output, the Serpent Flail is probably best left there, as it will rarely find its way out of the player’s inventory anyway.

   Family Heads
  </span>
  is one of the creepier weapons in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . This bizarre-looking flail is wielded by the Necromancer Garris. The flail heads have been made to resemble the necromancer's wife and children, creating a truly morbid tribute. Found in a hidden tunnel in Sage's Cave, located in the Altus Plateau region, Garris will drop the flail upon defeat. With its low damage, poor range, and bad scaling, the weapon is likely to be only usable for a challenge run.

 <p>
  Its weapon art, Familial Rancor, is a decent attack that summons deadly spirits that chase enemies close by. Unfortunately, the attack falls flat when compared to other sorceries. For players looking for a mixed build of Dex and Int, there are just far better weapon options available.

   Coded Sword
  </span>
  should be a highly sought-after weapon; it's an unblockable blade that can deal damage even through the thickest shield. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Only usable with pure faith builds, the Coded Sword is best used in challenge runs.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The weapon can be found in Leyndall, Royal Capital, within the throne room of the Fortified Manor. Found later in the game, the Coded Sword is a rarely used weapon, as most players would have decided on their build by this point. The fact that the Coded Sword offers an underwhelming damage output doesn't help much either. The weapon requires a lot of points in faith to be effective, which is a stat worth leveling. However, there are just too many better faith weapons to choose from.

   Whip
  </span>
  is the most basic of this weapon type and offers the least in terms of damage output. With decent scaling in dexterity, however, the Whip can still be an effective weapon in the game, but it deals no critical damage. On the plus side, whips cannot be parried, and guarding is ineffective against them. This makes it a reasonable choice for PvP battles.

  For experienced players wanting a challenge, the whip can be a fun weapon to try, but few would take it to the end of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Unlike many of the other whip choices in the game, the standard version offers no blood loss build-up or additional effect, although the ash of war can be changed. For players looking to create a build based around a whip,

   Katar
  </span>
  is a fist-type weapon that deals slash and piercing damage. The weapon looks great when duel-wielded, with its two prominent spikes on each hand, but it ultimately does little damage. With reasonable scaling in strength and dexterity, players looking for a challenging run may choose these weapons, but with the extremely short range, defeating some of the late-game bosses will be a major hurdle.

   Varré's Bouquet
  </span>
  is an arcane-based weapon found at the end of White Mask Varre’s questline. After defeating him in Moghwyn Palace, players will be able to talk to him as he is dying. After players have exhausted all the dialogue, Varre will die and drop the weapon.

  The Bouquet inflicts a good amount of bleeding on enemies and can also be buffed with spells and consumables, making it only one of three arcane-based weapons that can. Unfortunately, its short range and very low damage make it a very underwhelming weapon to use regularly. As one of the most unique-looking weapons in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , it is a worthy addition to the player’s collection, but it is best left in the inventory.

  developers have multiple PvP leagues, and The Fantasy Cup is one among them. The Fantasy Cup has a 1,500 CP limit, meaning only monsters with 1,500 CP or less can participate. In addition, there are also restrictions on different Pokemon types.

 <p>
  Only
  <strong>
   Dragon, Fairy, and Steel-type Pokemon
  </strong>
  under
  <strong>
   1,500 CP
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  can participate in The Fantasy Cup. This restriction makes it a bit hard to compose a powerful team. You require extensive meta-knowledge and proper type-battle experience to win against the several monsters in The Fantasy Cup. This guide offers suggestions for crafting the best team for The Fantasy Cup.

 <p>
  While there are numerous powerful
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  monsters under the 1500 CP limit,
  <strong>
   Azumarill, Registeel, and
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Lucario
  </strong>
  perform the best in The Fantasy Cup. With these three monsters, most teams should be able to do some pretty good damage to their opponents during the event. Below are the best movesets for each of these Pokemon to give a bit more of a boost to the team.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":987} -->

 <p>
  Azumarill is a dual Fairy/Water-type with a stat spread of 112 ATK, 152 DEF, and 225 STA. Since it can resist Dragon-type moves, the monster can easily outshine others in The Fantasy Cup. The legendary Registeel is a Steel-type monster with 143 ATK, 285 DEF, and 190 STA in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Since the Pokemon can resist Fairy and Steel-type attacks with other types, it is among the best picks. Regarding Lucario, it is a dual Fighting/Steel-type Pokemon with a stat spread of 236 ATK, 144 DEF, and 172 STA. The monster can easily resist Dragon and Steel-type attacks.

 <ul>

  There are other alternative monsters if you do not have Azumarill, Registeel, and Lucario or if they exceed the CP limit. Multiple Pokemon can go toe-to-toe with these three picks, but they must be extremely close to 1,500 CP and not exceed it in

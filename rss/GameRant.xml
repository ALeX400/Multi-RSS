  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  has added new skins based on Dragon Ball Z's Android 17, Android 18, and Future Trunks. The cosmetics are part of the collaboration between
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  franchise, which has been bringing a variety of skins based on Akira Toriyama's work to battle royale players.

 <p>
  The crossover between the two franchises began in 2022 with the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  x
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  crossover. The event allowed
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  players to watch several
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  episodes in-game and added four cosmetics to the battle royale. With that drop,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  players had the chance to acquire skins of Bulma, Beerus, Goku, and Vegeta, with those of the Saiyan duo having variations based on their transformations in the anime. Now,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is again collaborating with
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  , and this time has added skins based on characters from one of the anime's most beloved sagas.

  <em>
   Fortnite

  has released three new Dragon Ball Z skins with which players can transform themselves into Android 17, Android 18, or Future Trunks. The Android 17 and 18 cosmetics cost 1,500 V-Bucks each, and the skins come with their respective back bling with the logo of the Red Ribbon Army. The Androids' skins and back blings are also available in a bundle for 2,300 V-Bucks. The Future Trunks skin is available in a bundle for 2,000 V-Bucks, and it includes two variants of the skin, the Charging Up emote, the pickaxe, and the back bling based on the iconic sword used by Vegeta's son.

  Androids 17 and 18 had their
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  saga when they became one of the threats faced by the Z Warriors before Cell. Formerly known as the Lapis and Lazuli brothers, they were androids created by Dr. Gero to serve the villain's revenge against Goku. Future Trunks is one of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  's most iconic figures, introducing

  fans to a version of Present Trunks who comes from another timeline and carries his remarkable broadsword on his back.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands 4

  </strong>
  . This little teaser was part of the industry veteran's reflection on the recently debuted

  Gearbox CEO Teases Borderlands 4, Says He's 'Super Flattered' With Poor Movie Reception
 </h2>
 <p>
  Some four months later, Lionsgate's
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  movie hit the silver screens, debuting to an abysmal critical reception. Reflecting on this turn of events, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has recently taken to Twitter to say that he was "super flattered" to learn that the series' fandom apparently likes the games even better than "what some of the biggest and best cast and crew of film makers [sic] on the planet have done." The executive concluded this optimistic train of thought by promising that Gearbox is "working extra hard four you on what's next," with the misspelled preposition "for" being a clear reference to the fourth entry in the long-running franchise.

 <p>
  While some fans responded to Pitchford's positivity in equal measure, others used his tweet as an opportunity to bemoan the decision to turn the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  movie into what they perceive is a generic PG-13 action comedy rather than something that caters to the series' fandom. Similar complaints have already been voiced en masse since the film's premiere, and help explain why the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  movie debuted with a rare 0% aggregate score on Rotten Tomatoes. As more reviews poured in over the last few days, its Tomatometer managed to climb to a still-meager 10%. Initial box office reports suggest that the film opened at under $10 million domestically against a $120 million budget.

  Although the movie's lackluster critical reception and box office bombing are unlikely to do the franchise any favors, that's not to say that fans are no longer excited about the next
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game. According to Google Trends data, worldwide search queries for "Borderlands 4" have more than tripled in August 2024 compared to the previous month.

  Borderlands 4 May Still Be Years Away From Release
 </h3>
 <p>
  Take-Two's March 2024 announcement merely mentioned that the fourth installment in the series is in active development, without clarifying when exactly it started this production phase, which nowadays takes at least five years for AAA games. Given that lack of information,
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  could still be years away from release. And if Gearbox and 2K's past marketing cycles are any indication, it is safe to assume that the game is at least 12 months away from hitting the market for as long as it remains unrevealed.

  Though there is plenty to love about the base version of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout New Vegas
   </em>
  </strong>
  , DLC for the game turns it from a great post-apocalyptic RPG into a legendary one. New perks, new skills, new items, and tons of other new content is added to the ultimate edition of the game automatically upon starting a new save. But to actually experience these DLCs, you'll have to find their start locations.

  There are a total of four story DLCs for
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  : Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Dead Money, and Lonesome Road. Each has a different recommended starting level and a different location where the Courier can begin each new story, typically set in completely unique locations from the Mojave.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Updated August 10, 2024 by Erik Petrovich
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   : The four Fallout: New Vegas DLCs are about as different as they can be, introducing a wide range of new characters, locations, and stories to the multifaceted Mojave desert (and beyond). But before you get too excited about heading beyond the borders of the base game, it's important to consider how well-equipped you are to take on the more challenging content of each DLC. Honest Hearts is easy enough, for example, and its recommended level of 10 is more of a suggestion, especially for players who want a bit of a challenge. But most of the Fallout: New Vegas DLC start locations should only be approached if you have the stats, passives, and gear necessary to survive their harsher combats. This guide has been updated to include more details on the requirements for each DLC, including how strongly we recommend reaching a certain minimum level vs how difficult each campaign can be.

  <em>
   Honest Hearts

  offers some of the most interesting expansions to the base game's lore, and it's got all the wackiness of the original setting. From drug-induced rituals to a burned man who used to be Caesar's second-in command,
  <em>
   Honest Hearts
  </em>
  is a great DLC that players can start relatively early.

  How To Start Honest Hearts
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   To start the
   <em>
    Honest Hearts
   </em>
   DLC
  </strong>
  for
  <em>
   Fallout New Vegas
  </em>
  , head northeast from the Westside West Entrance and onto the road that spans from each side of New Vegas' north side. The
  <em>
   Honest Hearts
  </em>
  start location is in the Northern Passage, a cave that can be found in the hills about halfway down this road.

 <p>
  Alternatively, select the quest "Happy Trails Expedition" on your Pip-Boy to track the
  <em>
   Honest Hearts
  </em>
  start location. This quest should automatically be added to your quest log upon creating a new character. Though we recommend getting to Level 10 as the minimum level for
  <em>
   Honest Hearts
  </em>
  , you can start the DLC earlier than that if you want a change of pace from the normal starter experience.

  The rest of the DLC sees the player try to get back their own brain and all the wacky science-adjacent activities that adventure could conjure up. Robot scorpions, a Mutant grandma, and the ability to convince your own brain to return back to your skull make this one of the best

  DLC to experience.

  The

  <strong>
   To start the
   <em>
    Dead Money
   </em>
   DLC
  </strong>
  for
  <em>
   Fallout New Vegas
  </em>
  , start from Nelson in the far east of the main Mojave Wasteland map and head northeast on the road. The

 <p>
  Though we recommend getting to Level 20 as the minimum level for
  <em>
   Dead Money
  </em>
  , you can start this DLC earlier than that if you want a challenge. The difficulty of enemies in this and
  <em>
   Lonesome Road
  </em>
  spikes a bit compared to the base game and other DLCs, so it's good to level up as much as you can and get good gear before heading to this area.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Dead Money
  </em>
  is a bit more of a divisive addon for
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  , the general consensus is that
  <em>
   Lonesome Road
  </em>
  is the best. The
  <em>
   Lonesome Road
  </em>
  DLC story sees the conclusion of the Courier's own story, one that began before they were shot in the head by Benny in the opening cutscene.

 <p>
  Long story short, the Courier delivered something that changed the course of history for one man in particular: Ulysses.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":904} -->

 <p>
  In this DLC, players are sent to The Divide, an area characterized by its harsh environment (tornadoes, earthquakes, destructive storms, etc). The Lonesome Road to meeting Ulysses is filled with strife and hardship – and lots and lots of nuclear warheads – but it's one well worth walking before you finish the game and head to the Hoover Dam for the final ending.

 <p>
  Alternatively, select the quest "The Reunion" on your Pip-Boy to track the
  <em>
   Lonesome Road
  </em>
  start location. This quest should automatically be added to your quest log upon creating a new character. We strongly recommend getting to at least level 20, but preferably higher (around level 25) before trying to take on
  <em>
   Lonesome Road
  </em>
  . This is the most difficult DLC, and the final DLC, so be sure you are good and prepared (and consider trying out other DLCs first) before jumping in.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been keeping fans waiting for any firm news regarding the future of the franchise since 2021's sixth main game. Previously, publisher and developer Ubisoft had followed a reliable pattern of releases, and was vocal in marketing and promoting its upcoming titles in the popular open-world series. This hasn't been the case for the assumed seventh entry in the long-running FPS franchise, and
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  has seen a swirl of leaked information and rumors attached to it that, depending on how accurate they end up proving, could also be quite divisive.

 <p>
  With these rumors about
  <em>
   Far Cry 7
  </em>
  's various possible changes in direction and design, Ubisoft hasn't been doing itself any favors by remaining tight-lipped about what
  <em>
   Far Cry 7
  </em>
  may actually be. In the meantime, speculation has picked up to fill the void in the face of a lack of official comment. One sure bet, though, is that when it does eventually release, DLC will follow, as the series has an established history of doing so. In light of that,
  <em>
   Far Cry 7
  </em>
  should look to one of the most well-received pieces of DLC from its past,
  <em>
   FC3
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Blood Dragon
  </em>
  , for how it might make the best use of additional content.

  Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon Was One of the Series' Best and Most Unique Expansions

 <p>
  On top of often being one of the highest rated
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  entries,
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  provided players with another treat following its initial success in the form of
  <em>
   Blood Dragon
  </em>
  . Coming somewhat unexpectedly as a standalone DLC expansion,
  <em>
   Blood Dragon
  </em>
  took a swathe of
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  's map, coated it in 80s neon cyberpunk trappings, and framed it around a perfectly campy campaign filled with fun and humorous references, all while giving players a set of futuristic weapons and tools to run wild with.

  and Lt. Hicks in

  , among others, portrayed protagonist Rex "Power" Colt, an even more exaggerated version of a gung-ho super soldier in the "dark distant future of 2007." With its over-the-top story excesses combined with the tight gameplay of

  <em>

  How Far Cry 7's DLC Could Follow in Blood Dragon's Footsteps
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Far Cry 6
  </em>
  's DLCs were an assortment of smaller scenarios that featured some notable crossovers with other IPs like
  <em>
   Rambo
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Stranger
  </em>
  <em>
   Things
  </em>
  . Both are heavily stepped in 80s culture and iconography as well, lending them a tenuous connection to the spirit of
  <em>
   Blood Dragon
  </em>
  . Its most substantial DLC explored the past three games' villains, Vaas Montenegro, Pagan Min, and Joseph Seed, in roguelike modes, and while these were interesting enough, they didn't offer as much in the way of breaking from
  <em>
   FC6
  </em>
  's core in the way
  <em>
   Blood Dragon
  </em>
  did for
  <em>
   FC3
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   Blood Dragon
  </em>
  's legacy remains strong, and with so much time passed since its release,
  <em>
   Far Cry 7
  </em>
  could look to emulate its vision for the modern era. A
  <em>
   Far Cry 7
  </em>
  DLC need not necessarily be a direct
  <em>
   Blood Dragon
  </em>
  sequel (though that would likely be welcomed too), but it should aim to recapture the creativity and energy of it in a way that showcases how a larger and more directed DLC could make great use of the building blocks of the main title, including any updates or shakeups to the formula, to create a fresh and fulfilling spin on them.

  Campaigns haven't been the strongest suit of the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  franchise for a little while now. Nevertheless, there have been some great single-player
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  missions over the years. While it's seen its fair share of controversial missions,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  has also had more than its fair share of genuinely great campaign moments that range from intense blockbuster action to meditative stealth. Hopefully,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  will have a few standout campaign moments of its own.

  Raven Software is leading the charge on

   Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War

  <em>
   Black Ops 6

  's pre-release trailers have teased that some of these standout ideas could be returning in new forms this year. In particular, there's one creepy moment from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

  's trailers that could hearken back to one of
  <em>

  's best missions, though it'll be difficult for the sequel to surpass it.

  Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's Break on Through Mission is One of CoD's Best
 </h3>
 <p>
  The vast majority of campaign missions in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's lengthy history have been very linear. Players are usually tasked with following an AI companion and completing objectives in a specific order, moving the narrative forward with each completed task. So, whenever a
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  mission comes along that adds a bit more player-freedom to the usual campaign formula, there's always some buzz.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  included several missions that delivered this higher level of player-freedom, with the mission "Break on Through" being one of its best.

  Kicking off
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  's final act in style, Break on Through sees players take control of the mysterious protagonist Bell as he's strapped to a chair and forced to consume some psychoactive drugs. As the drugs start to take effect, shady CIA group leader Russell Adler asks Bell to think back on his time in Vietnam, beginning a flashback mission that has some reality-shifting consequences.

 <p>
  Without spoiling too much, it's revealed during the course of the mission that Bell has been subjected to some highly advanced brainwashing, and Adler's goal here is to try and unscramble his brain and get the location of the antagonist's nuclear base. Bell's psychological turmoil is integrated expertly into the mission's gameplay, as whenever the player strays from Adler's directions, the environment, enemies, weapons, allies, and even the time of day changes around them, mirroring Bell's fractured mind. This all gives the mission a dark, foreboding atmosphere that leans into the
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  series' penchant for psychological horror well.

  How Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Could Improve on Break on Through's Formula
 </h3>
 <p>
  Before
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  was officially revealed in its post-Xbox Showcase Direct, it released a few short trailers that leaned into the theme of government deception and distrust. The "Open Your Eyes" trailer paired this theming with some psychological horror imagery, and fans caught a brief glimpse of what appeared to be a pink mannequin seemingly wrestling the player-character to the ground. It seems as though
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  could feature another trippy, twisted mission.

  In order to stand out from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  's Break on Through mission,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's reality-bending mission needs to go even further with its psychological horror. The mission should also provide even more choices and gameplay variations to encourage repeated playthroughs.

 <p>
  Niantic is bringing back a special variant of Pikachu in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  for a short period of time, albeit with a major caveat, as the returning event in question will only be available in a few countries worldwide.
  <em>
  </em>
  The hit mixed reality mobile game is notorious for its frequent implementation of region-exclusive events and offers, but despite drawing criticism from fans,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  developer Niantic is showing no signs of stopping the practice anytime soon.

 <p>
  One of the many aspects of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  that keeps players coming back are the in-game events that Niantic announces on a consistent basis, many of which involve the addition of new Pokemon types. Just recently, for instance, the developer hosted a promotion in the United States that added, among other things, a new, hat-wearing Pikachu variant to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  that's directly modeled after the Captain Pikachu mascot from the
  <em>
   Pokemon Horizons
  </em>
  TV series. What makes this Pikachu type especially unique outside of its cosmetic appearance, though, is that it brandishes an attack named Volt Tackle, a Generation 3 move that was previously not available in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Although the event that this Pokemon was obtainable from ended a few months ago, Niantic is actually bringing the Pikachu back, but with a big catch this time.

 <p>
  As revealed in a news post on the official
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  website, the "Pikachu wearing Cap's hat" is making its return to the massively successful mobile game, albeit only in Indonesia and India. In order to commemorate the
  <em>
   Pokemon Horizons
  </em>
  anime's recent launch in these two regions, Niantic is hosting a month-long event that'll last from June 15 to July 14, 2024. Like with the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Horizons Series Celebration that took place in the U.S. earlier this year, players will be able to capture their very own Captain's Cap Pikachu by completing Field Research Tasks. Additionally, they'll have the opportunity to experience surprise encounters with characters and other Pokemon from the TV series whenever they take snapshots in-game.

  Unfortunately for U.S. residents who missed out on claiming this Captain's Cap Pikachu earlier this year, it won't be possible for them to circumvent the region-lock for this event without traveling to Indonesia or India themselves. As such, the number of
  <em>
  </em>
  players that can take advantage of this
  <em>
   Pokemon Horizons
  </em>
  celebration is rather limited. This is especially disappointing for those who wanted a second chance at capturing the Shiny variant of the Captain's Cap Pikachu in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , as it's especially rare.

 <p>
  Although most players won't be able to take advantage of this celebration event, there are still many different Pikachu types to capture in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Some fans have expressed frustration over how often Niantic releases new variants of the electric mouse Pokemon, but it's clear that the mascot character is still a fan favorite among many
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  enthusiasts.

  Gamers online believe that they've spotted a controversial mechanic first featured in
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  for a return in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  Zombies. Fans are eager to hear more about what they can expect from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies, but not everyone will be pleased to see this particular feature return.

  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's Zombies mode was first featured in 2008's
  <em>
   World at War
  </em>
  , unlocked as a reward for completing the campaign. The wave-based survival mode quickly took on a life of its own, proving hugely popular with the community. Nowadays, the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies maps are more complex than ever, with Treyarch always finding new ways to keep returning players engaged. With Zombies returning in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , the expectations are sky-high. When Treyarch recently revealed
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies, it was confirmed that the mode would be round-based once again, taking players back to the classic style of play. Now, it seems there's even more than meets the eye in that initial reveal.

  Redditor DiscoCrows has posted a still image from the reveal of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies, which seems to confirm that Salvage will be returning from
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  . The screenshot shows multiple items highlighted in green, resembling the Salvage mechanic seen in the previous title. Gamers in the thread certainly agreed that it seemed to be Salvage, but the response was mixed, to say the least. One player even described it as "the mechanic that ruined
  <em>
   Cold War
  </em>
  Zombies for me," claiming it became "tedious to run around and collect it."

 <p>
  Salvage in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  was a collectible that players could grab around each Zombies map, which they could then use to acquire and repair their Armor. The Armor system itself was controversial, and Salvage being a part of that got plenty of flak as a result. Salvage was seen as tedious, cluttering the screen and taking away from the classic Zombies atmosphere. With
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies promising to return to round-based gameplay, many were hoping this would mean Treyarch would do away with newer features like this in favor of the classic stripped-back style. However, if this screenshot is Salvage as it seems to be, that might not be the case.

  It's important to note that the presence of Salvage in the new title is speculation at the moment. Gamers can expect to hear more about
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

  on August 28, where Treyarch will talk to players about the upcoming title at Call of Duty NEXT. Hopefully, Treyarch will delve a little deeper into the game's Zombies mode, giving players a closer look at what they can expect when
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  launches on October 25, 2024.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Soulmask
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players will need to adapt to survival in a wilderness filled with different creatures, traps, enemies, and elements that may harm them. As they make progress, players will be able to begin crafting themselves some shelter from these threats, and develop, and reinforce their buildings as more Tribe members are recruited. During this process, creating and maintaining a bonfire is key to success.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":412} -->

 <p>
  This is because the bonfire not only provides warmth to yourself and the members of your Tribe but will also prevent nearby buildings from decaying over time and becoming destroyed. For this reason, ensuring your Bonfire is always maintained by keeping it lit is very important. However, the methods by which you can do this are not super obvious at first glance. To help point you in the right direction,
  <strong>
   the best ways to keep your Bonfire lit in
   <em>
    Soulmask
   </em>
   have been identified and explained in the guide below.

  In
  <em>
   Soulmask
  </em>
  , players will learn how to craft a Bonfire during the tutorial stage. However, it can be quite easy to miss the indicators that advise how to keep your Bonfire running efficiently once built. Luckily, there are a couple of different methods that you can take to ensure that your Bonfire remains lit, even when you are out and about exploring areas away from your Base.

 <p>
  Firstly, you can enter the Bonfire's crafting menu by pressing E to interact with it. This will open an inventory and crafting menu that allows you to cook various animal meats and food items, as well as fuel your fire. To fuel your fire, you will need to navigate to the top right side of this menu and select one of the several burnable materials to use as fuel and keep your fire running for a long period.

  By holding the E key instead of pushing it on your Bonfire, you will be able to open a more complex Bonfire menu. From here, you can choose to allow or disallow different fuel types. This is quite important to check, as otherwise, you may lose valuable materials, such as the rare wood variants that are commonly used for crafting important items.

  Additionally, you can even ensure that your Bonfire remains tended to while you are outside of your Base completing objectives or exploring your surroundings. To do this, you will need to wait until you have at least one person in your Tribe who is available to work, and then assign them to tend to the Bonfire. This is best achieved through the Bonfire menu by
  <strong>
   holding E
  </strong>
  and then selecting the
  <strong>
   'Assign works to tribesmen' tab.

  Tribesmen assigned these work parameters will repair any decayed buildings while you are out, as well as ensure that your Bonfire and other lighting devices are stocked with fuel. If you wish to only focus on certain lighting devices, then you can disable others from being allowed fuel at all, rather than only specific types of fuel. As you gain more Tribesmen, this will also become much more efficient, as you will have more people to contribute to the fueling of your Bonfire and lighting devices.

      <title>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero: 5 Things You Might Have Missed In The Trailers</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-things-might-have-missed-trailers/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
   </strong>
  </em>
  trailers have been a blast to watch. Bandi Namco has been meticulous with its releases, slowly unveiling the game's characters, features, and mechanics with each new trailer. At first glance, fans might think that these trailers mostly focus on the game's graphics, animations, and characters, without offering much information about the finer details of the game. However, eagle-eyed viewers will notice that there's a lot more detail hidden within them, only apparent to those who watch closely.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":542} -->

 <p>
  The trailers reveal far more than just the characters and maps. Bandai Namco has cleverly sprinkled all kinds of details that hint at exciting new features, like a new story mode, improved cutscenes, and much more. When fans realize how much these trailers reveal about
  <em>
   Sparking Zero,
  </em>
  their excitement will soar to even greater heights.

  The previous
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  games had an amazing story mode that allowed players to experience practically every saga of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  . However, they fell short in one key area: cutscenes. The animations were minimal, with characters simply standing in their fighting stances for most of the scene while the dialogue played out.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":909} -->

 <p>
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is ready to change that. The latest trailers revealed that the game will feature animated cutscenes, akin to those in games like
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  This improvement will add a massive layer of depth to the game's story mode. Gamers can not only play through
  <em>
   Dragon Ball's
  </em>
  epic arcs, but also experience them through beautiful and dynamic cutscenes. Even more exciting,
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  boasts some of the best graphics ever seen in a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game. Fans will have the chance to see their favorite scenes from the show in a gorgeous new art style.

  Ever since
  <em>
   Sparking Zero's
  </em>
  announcement, fans have been curious about its story mode. Will it follow in the footsteps of its predecessors, or will it introduce something fresh? With the latest trailers, fans have finally gotten a peek at what
  <em>
   Sparking Zero'
  </em>
  s story mode aims to bring. The game will feature a "choose-your-own-adventure" type story mode, where players will have the freedom to make important decisions that will make significant alterations to the story.

 <p>
  For example, one trailer showed a what-if scenario where Goku gets the choice to either fight Raditz with Piccolo or battle him alone. The latter option completely deviates from the canonical story, and those who remember the Saiyan Saga know how big of a change this decision could bring. If players are allowed to make these types of decisions throughout the story mode, the possibilities for unique and engaging storylines will be endless.

 <p>
  A highly underrated feature of the
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series is the ability to summon Shenron.
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi 3
  </em>
  made the most of this feature by letting players unlock new stages, equipment, and even special characters using Shenron's powers. But since he hasn't made a direct appearance in the
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  trailers, fans may have believed that the Namekian dragon wouldn't be returning in the series' latest installment. For those fans, the release date announcement trailer brings some amazing news. At the very end, Shenron is advertised as part of the Season Pass Bonus. But that's not all — Shenron's much mightier counterpart, Super Shenron is advertised as part of the Ultimate Edition Bonus.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":924} -->

 <p>
  This fantastic news, as it confirms the return of Shenron and also introduces Super Shenron to the series. However, it begs the question: What will they offer? While it's likely that Shenron will offer similar perks to the ones he did in the previous games, Super Shenron opens up a whole new realm of possibilities. Fans can only wait until the game is released to see what the dragons have in store for them.

 <p>
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  's gameplay showcase gave fans a ton of information about the game's mechanics, but one key feature many fans missed in the trailers was the introduction of Team Ultimate Attacks. In the
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series, characters have always had a wide array of special attacks in their arsenal. However, previous installments never had a Team Ultimate Attack mechanic where characters could synergize together to fire off a combined attack. In the
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  trailers, fans can spot characters like Caulifla and Kale, as well as Goten and Trunks, pairing up to blast their opponents to smithereens with a Team Ultimate Attack.
 </p>

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":403} -->
 <p>
  It's impossible to overstate the excitement that this new mechanic brings, as countless possible character combinations could use Team Ultimate Attacks. Canonical pairs like Dyspo and Toppo, Android 17 and Android 18, and Piccolo and Gohan would only be the tip of the iceberg. Imagine the thrill of seeing non-canon combos like Frieza and Cooler teaming up to decimate their opponents with a combined attack.

  Up until

  most of the characters in the roster would be locked at the start of the game, requiring players to progress through the game's story to unlock them.

  But fans who watched
  <em>
   Sparking Zero'
  </em>
  s release date trailer all the way to the end will have noticed that the different forms of Gogeta and Broly appear as part of the game's Pre-Order Bonus. This hints that the game will likely reintroduce the concept of character unlocks. It may be a bit of a bummer for some fans, since it means that they might not be able to play with their favorite characters like Beerus and MUI Goku right from the start. However, does serve as a fun way to incentivize players to explore the game's campaign and other modes in hopes of unlocking new characters.

  As of right now, the Spiritborn class is quite mysterious.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  boasts some great classes, and the Spiritborn looks to be an incredibly unique addition to the game. There is only a little bit of information known about the nature of the Spiritborn, but more is set to be revealed on July 18, when the Spiritborn Class Reveal hosted by
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's developers gives a deeper look into the all-new class.

 <h3 id="what-is-known-about-the-spiritborn">
  What is Known About the Spiritborn
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Spiritborn is an original class that has never been seen in the
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  franchise before. One of the few things known about the class at the moment is that they are considered to be apex predators within the jungle. The Spiritborn are an ancient civilization that seem to be highly skilled and trained in battle in order to survive the harsh jungle environment in which they reside. Based on previews of the Spiritborn class armor, they seem to also have a great connection to animals, as the main image teasing the class shows a warrior wearing a leopard head helmet and leopard spot tattoos covering his body. The
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  franchise shines when it creates custom classes that are exclusive to the games, and the Spiritborn looks to continue this tradition.

  Origins of the Spiritborn
 </h3>
 <p>
  Despite the secrecy surrounding the class, it's been made clear that the Spiritborn are native to the new location featured in
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  , Nahantu.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has seen some great success recently, thanks to Season 4, and
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  promises even more content with Sanctuary expanding into the jungles of Nahantu. Blizzard has confirmed that the Spiritborn have mystical qualities that can only be activated within the region's jungles, confirming that the class is deeply tied to the area.

  Since its launch last year,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has come a long way, and
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  looks to be a thrilling and dark new chapter to the game's story. Based on early information, the Spiritborn class already seems like a wonderfully unique type of character to explore and fight with. Due to the important ties to Nahantu and battle-ready qualities that have already been teased about the Spiritborn, the class will likely play a major role in the story of
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  . Some of
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's best classes have been completely original creations for the series, like the Amazon and the Blood Knight, which makes the addition of the Spiritborn that much more exciting.

 <p>
  Although there isn't much known about the class at the moment, July 18 will change that, as more information will be given to those who are curious about picking up a new class to play as.
  <em>

  's classes bring unique challenges based on their specific skills, and it will be interesting to see how the Spiritborn holds up against the other classes.

   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  has experienced some trouble on Steam during release day, with many players reporting technical issues and other bugs while attempting to launch or play the game. The issues led players to submit negative reviews of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  on Steam, and Capcom released a PC troubleshooting guide to help those encountering issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Released on February 28,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  quickly reached an incredible milestone on Steam with well over a million players at its all-time peak. Heading into the game's launch,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  received widespread acclaim and earned a "Mighty" rating on OpenCritic, thanks to its 89 average score and 95% recommendation rate from critics. The game's launch was far from perfect for fans, however.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  faced scrutiny from its player base due to the game's microtransactions, and now, Steam players are unhappy with the issues they're facing in the PC version.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds'
  </em>
  review rating is now "Mixed" on Steam, with thousands of players sharing their experiences running into technical issues and other problems in the game's user review section and Steam forums. Many players are reporting instances of game crashes, shaders not loading with Nvidia and AMD GPUs, and even critical system crashes, which cause blue screen errors. Others cite a lack of optimization in the comments section under Capcom's troubleshooting guide for
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  on PC, with some wanting Capcom to remove the Denuvo anti-tamper software from the game.

  The troubleshooting guide for
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  on PC outlines steps and suggestions that players should follow if they face certain issues, such as crashes and graphics-related anomalies. Capcom recommends players update their graphics drivers, turn off compatibility mode, and add Steam and
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  to the exceptions list of users' antivirus software programs, to name a few. However, many
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  players are frustrated that they're still having trouble running the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Capcom hasn't shared a statement on
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds'
  </em>
  Steam issues following the release of the troubleshooting guide, the company did open its official "Monster Hunter Status" Twitter account on February 28. The Twitter account is dedicated to giving fans updates on server status and known issues in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  . It's also another avenue that fans have for sending inquiries to the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  support team. Despite the trouble that Steam players are facing, it's likely that Capcom is already working on major fixes, and
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  will receive multiple post-launch updates in the months to come.

  Frost Queen Cookie is a Legendary Magic cookie that places itself in the middle of the party in order to remain protected by the front while casting magic at all targets. Frost Queen Cookie was made available in part one of the Frost Witch and the Lantern in the Snow update. Seen as cruel, due to her harsh demeanor and strict morals, Frost Queen Cookie remains fair and just in her maintenance of what is right and wrong.

  Once known as Frost Cookie, Frost Queen Cookie's role in
  <em>
   Cookie Run Kingdom
  </em>
  quickly changed after her passing due to frost illness. Upon returning to the world in
  <em>
   Cookie Run Kingdom
  </em>
  , Frost Queen Cookie took on her new role and maintained the will of nature, the very thing that led to her demise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Frost Queen Cookie can be a lethal member of the team if properly equipped with the correct tools. She brings plenty of HP and Attack power, and has a Crystal Jam that can make her exponentially stronger when adjusted. However, if players wish to bring out Frost Queen Cookie's true power, Toppings are a must.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can pick up some Toppings by traveling around the World Exploration stages or taking a Balloon Expedition. Up to five Topping pieces can be equipped on one grid, and it's recommended to use five of the same type of Toppings in order to receive a supplemental bonus. This guide will help with the best possible build and what the crystal jam can do.

   <strong>
    Updated on February 28, 2025, by Mehrdad Khayyat:
   </strong>
   Frost Queen still remains one of the most powerful Legendary cookies in the game, thanks to her special ability that helps with almost every build of cookies in general. However, it is important to take Frost Queen to a journey with the right build.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   While decreasing a cooldown of 15 seconds for this cookie seems to be crucial, there are also other builds that can help with her damage output and other important stats. And at the end of the day, it really depends on the player's combination of cookies.

  Frost Queen Cookie earns her Legendary status, as she is one of the strongest Magic cookies in
  <em>
   Cookie Run Kingdom
  </em>
  . Her ability, Freezing Squall, casts an Ice-type attack that freezes all enemies on the field and gives them Frozen debuffs. While frozen, the enemies' cooldown is completely stopped, rendering them unable to attack. Not only is Frost Queen Cookie immune to the Frozen status, but when the ability is activated, she is also immune to interrupting effects.

 <p>
  Swift Chocolate is the ideal topping to build Frost Queen Cookie around, as its main priority is to reduce a cookie's cooldown. Frost Queen Cookie's Freezing Squall and Crystal Jam ability are devastating attacks that players will want to use often, and bringing down the cooldown as much as possible will guarantee multiple hits in one battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Frost Queen Cookie's defense is her biggest flaw, packing in some DMG Resist as a secondary substat is ideal, as it will keep her in play for as long as possible. Other secondary stats to consider are CRIT%, to land powerful blows that do more damage, and CRIT Resist, which goes hand-in-hand with DMG Resist.
 </p>
 <p>
  Any Swift Chocolate topping will do with these substats boosted, and using five in the grid will provide Frost Queen Cookie with an additional 5% cooldown decrease. Consider the Frosted Crystal Swift Chocolate, as these special Toppings have a better chance at increasing favorable stats.

 <p>
  Instead of spending all the toppings on Swift Chocolate to reduce the cooldown, players can also invest some of the toppings to increase the CRIT chance using the Juicy Apple Jelly toppings. This topping adds 3% to the CRIT chance at its base level of the Epic version, and upgrading the topping provides even more stat boost.
 </p>
 <p>
  One or two Juicy Apple Jelly toppings will be enough, with Searing Raspberry, Bouncy Caramel, and Swift Chocolate taking the other spots left. These will help with the normal damage output and attack speed of the game while reducing the cooldown to an acceptable extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing that Frost Queen usually stands in the middle line, it's not worth it to place any defensive toppings on the build, as she is not the center of focus against the incoming damage from the enemies.

  If Frost Queen Cookie's main ability wasn't enough for players, her Crystal Jam skill, Eternal Frost, is sure to leave all enemies caught in its blast frozen in fear. The attack sends a blizzard at all enemies on the field, causing Frost upon the final hit, and granting Frost Queen Cookie immunity against ATK Speed changes. Here is a full breakdown of Eternal Frost's abilities.

 <p>
  The CEO of The Pokemon Company recently revealed that he believes the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise will reach its 100th anniversary. These positive comments come as
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  recently celebrated Pokemon Day 2025, unveiling many announcements to look forward to over the coming year.
 </p>
 <p>
  As one of the most popular media franchises in the world,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  has experienced incredible growth over the last few decades. While the franchise began on the Game Boy in 1996 with the release of
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Green
  </em>
  in Japan, it quickly expanded in subsequent years. In addition to nine generations of mainline games and numerous spin-off titles,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  has branched into anime, merchandise, and much more. Thanks to its far-reaching appeal, even most non-gamers are familiar with the franchise and its recognizable mascot, Pikachu. With the 29th anniversary of the franchise having recently happened, the company has shared an optimistic view of the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a recent interview with the BBC, Tsunekazu Ishihara, CEO of The Pokemon Company, revealed that the franchise could have many more years ahead of it. According to Ishihara, “If we continue focusing on our mission,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  can probably continue to its 50th or 100th anniversary.” These predictions from the CEO seem viable, given the franchise’s success over the years. The mainline games continue to sell millions of copies, and mobile offerings like
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  have been very popular. However, Ishihara warned of the dangers of complacency, saying the franchise could “go downhill” if they “go with the flow” instead of innovating on the brand.

  These comments come as The Pokemon Company recently hosted a Pokemon Presents event. During the presentation, many significant announcements regarding the franchise were made. New content for existing games like
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  were unveiled, and more episodes of
  <em>
   Pokemon Concierge
  </em>
  were announced for Netflix. In addition, the upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  revealed a look at gameplay, revealing the starters and more. There was even a new game reveal in
  <em>
   Pokemon Champions
  </em>
  , a new PvP game focused on battling Pokemon.

  With much of the roadmap for the rest of 2025 laid out, it will be interesting to see how successful The Pokemon Company is in the year ahead. While time will tell if the franchise makes it to its 100th anniversary, it looks like The Pokemon Company has no intentions of slowing down soon. As a result,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans have lots to look forward to in the coming months.

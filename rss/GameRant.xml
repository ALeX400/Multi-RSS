  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  has been a runaway success, proving that raw power is not the be-all and end-all for consoles. Through a combination of Nintendo's first-party games, a solid selection of triple-A third-party titles, and all the indie projects anyone could ever want, the Switch has amassed a stellar library that can match most platforms in terms of quality and quantity.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Mario Odyssey
  </em>
  are two of the greatest games of the last decade, but there is always a chance that the best
  <strong>
   Switch game
  </strong>
  has yet to be released. 2022 and 2023 were overall pretty great years for Nintendo's platforms. In just 2023,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Metroid Prime Remastered
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Super Mario Wonder
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Advance Wars 1 + 2: Re-Boot Camp
  </em>
  were all console exclusives.

  Here's a look at all the major titles we can expect to see on the Nintendo Switch in 2024 and beyond. Which big
  <strong>

  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch's games lineup
  </strong>
  for July 2024 is solid for the most part, even if it is not packed to the brim with huge releases.
  <em>
   The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak
  </em>
  launched a new story arc in Nihon Falcom's beloved JRPG franchise, and the gameplay combines real-time and turn-based combat.

 <p>
  <em>
   Ace Combat 7
  </em>
  is making its way to the Switch, providing flight sim fans with (hopefully) a great option that can keep them entertained for a while.
  <em>
   Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus
  </em>
  also looks good.
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Bleach: Brave Souls
  </em>
  are also receiving Switch ports.

 <p>
  Like most of the year's months, August 2024 does not have much in the way of Switch exclusives; however, quite a few multi-platform indie games will be launching on Nintendo's console.
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Steamworld Heist 2
  </em>
  are arguably the most notable arrivals, and they both launch on the same day. If they maintain the high standards of the previous entries, they should both be charming and fun.
 </p>

 <p>
  <em>
   That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles
  </em>
  might also hit the mark with fans of the light novel, manga, and anime franchise, even if these types of licensed games tend to oscillate wildly in quality.
  <em>
   Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Farewell North
  </em>
  could also be neat.

 <p>
  It is still way too early to predict September 2024's biggest Switch games. So far, only a couple of titles have been announced, and they are fairly niche.
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  could be a fun sports game and a somewhat unique option for the franchise, at least compared to modern releases.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  <em>
   Death end re;Quest CodeZ
  </em>
  appears to be a stark departure from the previous two games, including a new combat system.
  <em>
   Earth Defense Force: World Brothers 2
  </em>
  should be a solid co-op shooter.
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  will also debut in September 2024. Finally, a new
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  will be landing on the Nintendo Switch, and
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  will feature Princess Zelda as its protagonist.

  October 2024 is a work in progress, and that will remain the case for a while longer. Still,
  <em>
   Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time
  </em>
  could be one of the more exciting end-of-the-year Switch releases. Level-5 regularly delivers top-notch RPGs, and the original 3DS
  <em>
   Fantasy Life
  </em>
  was pretty good.
  <em>
   Tintin Reporter: Cigars of the Pharaoh
  </em>
  could also be a charming adventure game.

 <p>
  Nintendo confirmed that a new
  <em>
   Super Mario Party
  </em>
  will also be coming out in October 2024, and
  <em>
   Jamboree
  </em>
  looks set to be the biggest entry in the franchise.
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  will offer Switch owners a chance to play an updated version of an early 2010s classic.

 <p>
  November 2024 is shaping up nicely thanks to a few announcements during the June 2024 Nintendo Direct.
  <em>
   Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership
  </em>
  is a new RPG starring everyone's favorite gaming brothers. In recent years, Nintendo has been going out of its way to highlight the franchise's RPG history, producing a couple of well-received remakes/remasters that mostly stuck true to the original games' visions. However,
  <em>
   Brothership
  </em>
  will be Mario's first fully new role-playing adventure in roughly a decade, not counting
  <em>
   The Origami King
  </em>
  (which is good but not really an RPG).

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Brothership
  </em>
  will almost certainly be the biggest Switch game of November 2024, it is hardly the only title worth noting.
  <em>
   Farmagia
  </em>
  looks like it could be an interesting blend of monster-training and farming, along with containing an army-based combat system that seems reminiscent of
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  . Square Enix has also confirmed that
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  will be launching within this month, and the JRPG looks stunning.

  While most months have taken shape by this point, there are still plenty of Nintendo Switch games that are tentatively targeting 2024 releases. Whether these projects actually end up releasing before the end of December remains to be seen, but there is a very good chance that at least some of them will target debuts in the last three months of the year.

   Marvel vs. Capcom FIghting Collection: Arcade Classics
  </em>
  comes packed with all the series' classic entries, along with a rare port of
  <em>
   The Punisher
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Fairy Tail 2
  </em>
  should be a solid JRPG, and
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of The Rings Game
  </em>
  looks set to be a cozy life sim.

 <p>
  2024 has only begun to take shape. Who knows what the year's best Switch game will be when all is said and done? It could be a project that has a confirmed release date, a game tentatively announced for 2024, or a title that has yet to even be revealed. While plenty of Switch titles are on the horizon, most of them have yet to commit to a release year.

  The industry has yet to get any concrete information concerning the following games, and it's unclear if any of them will be actually released on the Switch, but it's still fun to think about what players may see in the future. Hopefully, some of these potential rumors will become a reality in the next few years.

  Learning battle strategies in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  is incredibly important if you want to be successful in your adventures. Similar to many other combats,
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  allows players to parry attacks, known as Perfect Assists, which utilizes the multiple members that you will have in your team, such as Rina or Soldier 11.

 <p>
  Perfect Assists in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  are essentially a form of
  <strong>
   parrying
  </strong>
  in the game, but they utilize the multiple characters that you will have in your team. To be able to perform Perfect Assists, you will need to first garner
  <strong>
   Assist Points
  </strong>
  . You can see how many Assist Points you have currently by checking the bottom right of your screen, and looking at the button for the Spacebar. If this button is filled with orange, you currently have some Assist Points you can use.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1021} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  To get Assist Points, all you need to do is perform
  <strong>
   Chain Attacks
  </strong>
  , which can be done by repeatedly attacking an enemy. You can have up to six Assist Points at a time, and once you use a Perfect Assist, one point will be depleted. You can also use your
  <strong>
   Ultimate
  </strong>
  to get Assist Points.

 <p>
  Now, if you want to perform a Perfect Assist properly, you will need to press the switch character button, which is Spacebar on PC, and RB on Xbox. You will need to make sure you press it just
  <strong>
   before an enemy attack lands
  </strong>
  on you. There are two different Perfect Assists that can be done depending on your character and their class, including:

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Defensive Assist
   </strong>
   : The character being switched to will parry the enemy's attack

 <p>
  It will take some time to get used to Perfect Assists and parrying at the right time, especially as a beginner, since you will need to know exactly when an enemy's hit will land. A good thing to pay attention to is that most enemies will have a
  <strong>
   golden prompt
  </strong>
  just before they attack you, shown in the first image above, and you can use this to know when to properly perform a Perfect Assist and swap out your characters.

  After you perform a Perfect Assist, your character will have the chance to do an Assist Follow-Up just after. This process is much easier than that of performing a Perfect Assist, but it can only be done after you've properly completed a Defense or Evasive Assist.

  To complete an Assist Follow-Up, just after completing a Perfect Assist, you can immediately hit the
  <strong>
   Basic Attack or Special Attack button
  </strong>
  and your character will perform an additional attack on the enemy in front of them. This can be a good way to do additional damage to the enemy, and possibly cause them to be stunned.

Nevertheless, the unpredictability of the banner system can be quite a problem, especially if you are targeting a certain hero. As such, pulling banners in the game requires the in-game currency known as Polychromes. Having more Polychromes allows you to pull more characters from the banner, and thankfully, the game features several methods of farming Polychromes.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is full of details that players can appreciate. Everything from changing the name of one's Super Destroyer and seeing it to finding mission interactables that provide more information about Super Earth gives the game a charm that most others do not possess. However, if there's one aspect whose potential is severely underutilized, it would be the NPCs. Though somewhat interesting, they mostly become an afterthought, meaning they could do with some changes if they want to become one of the appealing parts of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The Super Destroyer is the spacecraft in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  which acts as the hub area where players can change loadouts, purchase upgrades, choose missions, etc. The ship itself has many interesting features, but the NPCs acting as the crew are not one of them. Although they do possess a few fascinating tidbits of information, they offer nothing more than a minor distraction that becomes completely forgettable after one or two interactions. Since players will always run into crew on the ship, the developers should consider improving them to ensure they become memorable presences.

 <p>
  If
  <em>

  </em>
  ever gets more new Super Destroyer upgrades or improvements, the developers should consider putting some of that effort into the NPCs within the ship. Here are a few ways that could potentially turn them from forgettable to captivating figures:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Allowing them to provide information that the player can choose to learn about, like the Ship Master offering more detailed information on enemies
  </li>
  <li>

 <p>
  The NPCs need something about them that makes players look forward to interacting with them, and these few changes may help in doing that. If they see any noticeable improvements, they can turn players' hub area into a place full of life and interesting things to discover.

 <h3 id="why-improving-the-npcs-can-benefit-helldivers-2">
  Why Improving the NPCs Can Benefit Helldivers 2
 </h3>
 <p>
  Other than giving the ship more life, improving the NPCs can give more emphasis to the plot of the game.
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  's approach to NPC storytelling is not as compelling as many would have hoped. While there is a semblance of a story whose events are determined via player progression, it's mainly told via text that players can easily skim over. If the ship's NPCs see some changes in the future, perhaps they could also become more pivotal in presenting the game's narrative. With the right voice lines and text dialogue, they can become an essential tool that makes players care more about Super Earth and the quest towards galactic freedom.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":906} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  If properly done, the possibility of a story mode in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  would be likely in the future. The game already has a lot of resources to tell an interesting story, and all it lacks is characters that can help convey it. In this case, not only would there be something new to experience, but there would also be well-developed personalities that players can connect with. Such an update could lead to people fully immersing themselves in the world they're playing in, allowing Arrowhead Game Studios' multiplayer shooter the opportunity to become something truly memorable and beloved.

 <p>
  While there's no telling what
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  's future will look like, it's headed in the right direction, and it could be one with a lot of promise with some key changes. Improving how the ship's NPCs operate is a step in that direction, as it is an asset that has a lot of potential for keeping and bringing in players.

   <em>
    The Last of Us
   </em>
  </strong>
  games brought a new and horrifying zombie-like creation into the spotlight with the Cordyceps infection. The infection rapidly takes over a person's mind, eventually turning them into fungal-ridden monsters. The Cordyceps virus in
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is one of the more horrifying interpretations of a rapidly spreading disease, and
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  is at a crossroads with where the series goes next with the infection.

 <p>
  Throughout the series,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  has showcased a variety of phases of the Cordyceps infection. From the early stages of an infected person becoming a Runner or Stalker to the more advanced stages, like the Shambler or the dreaded Rat King,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  has seemingly demonstrated every possible point of the infection — at least in humans. However, the series has yet to explore a heartbreaking route, as there isn't nearly as much known about how Cordyceps affects certain animals.

  The Cordyceps Infection Could Evolve in an Unexpected Way
 </h3>
 <p>
  Since the focus is on the infected humans,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  hasn't spent a lot of time explaining how animals react to the Cordyceps infection. It's clear that plenty of animals have survived throughout the pandemic. Dogs, deer, horses, and even giraffes and zebras have been featured throughout the series. For the most part, it seems like animals are immune. The only animals that have been revealed to be affected by the Cordyceps are primates, but that could eventually change.

 <p>
  Despite the current immunity of most animals, the Cordyceps virus could evolve to eventually affect animals in the same way that it does humans. This would be a bleak route for the franchise to take, but
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  excels at leaning into the hopelessness of an apocalypse. Currently,
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  needs a major difference from its predecessors in order to feel like a new story worth following. After the shocking reveal of the Rat King in
  <em>
   Part 2
  </em>
  , it's hard to imagine how the series could meet the same heights with infected humans.

 <p>
  Unless there's a shocking new revelation about the Cordyceps that has yet to be revealed,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  may have covered as much ground as it can with humans. In terms of upping the ante, a horrifying prospect would be for Ellie to be on a hunt or traveling through the woods only to encounter a Cordyceps-infected bear or elk. This would be a completely new route for developers to play with since it would be fascinating to see how the mind-bending fungus changed animal behavior.

 <p>
  There is no official announcement for
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  , but a third chapter seems highly likely. It will be exciting to see what direction Naughty Dog chooses to take the story, but there are also high expectations to meet.
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  may have been divisive at launch, but it's grown to be a solid continuation of Ellie's story. However, Ellie's next chapter might feel stuck if she's facing the same dangers as the last game.

 <p>
  In order to set itself apart from the other two games,
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  needs to raise the stakes. This could be done with a terrifying new human faction, a yet-to-be-seen Cordyceps evolution, having the virus infect animals, or even a combination. There are many routes the franchise could go, but that is a tough choice to make, and it's a decision that could make or break the tension of survival in

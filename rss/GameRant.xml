      <title>Fortnite: All Chapter 6 Season 2 Accolades</title>

  Accolades have been in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  for a few years now, but a few seasons ago, Epic Games decided that it wanted fans to take them more seriously than ever. Before, gamers would be rewarded XP for completing certain Accolades, but unless they memorized them after getting them for the first time, there was no way of knowing what they had to do to unlock them.

 <p>
  This is why an Accolades collection was added to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , allowing players to check them at any time they'd like. This feature incentivizes fans to try to complete all Accolades available and acquire them as many times as possible so they can compare their stats with their friends near the end of the season.

  <em>
   As is standard whenever a Fortnite season launches, Epic Games reset and changed many of the Accolades available in Chapter 6 Season 2. This season, many Accolades changed categories and 71 were removed or entirely. While before gamers were rewarded for various tiers of similar Accolades, many of them were vaulted and replaced by a medium-difficulty version, rather than allowing fans to finish the easiest and hardest tiers.

 <p>
  There are
  <strong>
   100 Accolades to unlock in
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
   Chapter 6 Season 2
  </strong>
  , 71 less than last season. Accolades work like in-game achievements, and players will naturally unlock most of them simply by playing
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Battle Royale. However, some of them require gamers to do specific tasks in-game, and they won't be able to get them unless they check out the Accolades list in the Collection tab.
  <strong>
   The Collection tab can be found in the Quests menu, which can be accessed while in the lobby
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Players should make a note of the Accolades they'd like to unlock and then play a match following its exact requirements
  </strong>
  . For example, the "Knife to a Gun Fight" Accolade can only be obtained if the player wins a match only dealing damage with melee weapons - doing this by chance is nearly impossible.

  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is home to tons of different monsters that players will need to defeat. Whether it be for quests, for slay missions, or even for their satisfaction, doing so allows players to get some better equipment and armor for their character. The point is, being a Monster Hunter, players will find themselves fighting back monsters a lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will become familiar with pulling out their map every time they want to travel fast or just take note of where different monsters are within the world. The map will showcase many different icons and symbols that will indicate where certain monsters are and, sometimes, even what their health is. This is where the skull icon comes in.

  The skull icon is an important one that can help players get that last bit of material they need from monsters quickly.
  <strong>
   The icon tells players that this monster is incredibly low on health and is trying to run back to its nest to recover
  </strong>
  . While the icon isn't always promised to show up when a monster is weak, it is still great for the player when it does. It highlights an ideal time for players to go after said monster and slay it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Paying attention to this icon can help players get more monster kills, and slaying them will be pretty easy given that they are already weak. Those who have already attacked a monster will know that it is almost time for the battle to be over, and victory against such foes will come more quickly than battles against newly encountered enemies.

 <p>
  An industry leaker suggests that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Gears of War: E-Day
   </strong>
  </em>
  will be released in 2026, and a
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  collection will drop later in 2025 to take its place.
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  was first revealed as part of Xbox's impressive game showcase last June with a nostalgic and sentimental cinematic trailer. A prequel to the original trilogy,
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  will focus on franchise icon Marcus Fenix and his friendship with fan-favorite COG Dom Santiago on Emergence Day. While the trailer wasn't followed by a release window, rumors suggested it was aiming for a late 2025 release.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  was revealed in 2024, a
  <em>
   Halo: The Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  -style remastered anthology had been part of the Xbox rumor mill for quite some time. Over the past year, there has been a string of rumors and small pieces of evidence that suggest a
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  collection is in the works. In June,
  <em>
   Gears of War 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  musical composer Steve Jablonsky updated the thumbnails of both games' soundtracks on YouTube with The Coalition's studio logo, with both games originally developed by Epic Games. This led to more speculation about a
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  collection, as did Phil Spencer's recent revisiting of the earlier
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  games on Xbox this past January.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, even more leaked info has come out about both
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  and the potential
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  collection. Spanish leaker eXtas1s posted a new video to YouTube in which he mentioned that
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  is looking to release in 2026, not 2025 as prior rumors suggested. In its place, he says the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  collection will be revealed at the upcoming June Xbox showcase and released at some point later in 2025 for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 as well, corroborating others' rumors about Xbox's new multiplatform strategy touching the brand's most sacred first-party franchises. eXtas1s was recently correct in his
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 5
  </em>
  to PS5 rumors, so his new
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  claims do hold some weight.

  It would make sense for the

  collection to be released on PS5, as it'll allow gamers on that platform the opportunity to grow familiar with the characters before jumping back in time with
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  , which may also wind up on PS5 at some point down the road. While unknown, the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  collection could consist of the 2015
  <em>
   Gears of War: Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  remaster alongside new remastered versions of
  <em>
   Gears of War 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  . Whether the 2013 spinoff
  <em>
   Gears of War: Judgment
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  or either of the more recent Kait Diaz-led sequels make it into the collection is also still a mystery.
 </p>
 <p>
  As eXtas1s said, the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  collection could finally receive its proper reveal at Xbox's Summer Game Fest showcase in June, a date for which should be confirmed in the coming weeks or months. It wouldn't be a surprise to see the reveal be paired with a new
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  trailer, this time providing a look at gameplay and a release window.

  <em>

  has taken the same approach to promotion by including its own high-profile names in its marketing.

 <p>
  WWE Hall of Famer and manager Paul Heyman is a massive figure in wrestling. As the manager and mentor of superstar Roman Reigns, Heyman continues to have a strong presence in the sport. At the most recent Sony State of Play, Paul Heyman announced
  <em>
   WWE 2K25
  </em>
  's The Island, an online hub that features extra content like quests, shops, and live events. Using a major WWE legend like Paul Heyman is a great way to help generate more hype for the game, as he's been with the company for over 11 years total now. Following this trend,
  <em>
   NASCAR 2025
  </em>
  is also taking advantage of its most prominent figures.

  Sports games aren't new to the gaming industry, but over the years, gaming has become far more prevalent in mainstream pop culture. Gaming was once seen in a different light compared to other forms of entertainment, but it's now just as popular; even more in some cases. Now, the presence of major sports legends like Paul Heyman and Dale Earnhardt Jr. in their respective games' marketing is an exciting example of just how normalized gaming has become in other industries. The features of
  <em>
   WWE 2K25
  </em>
  and
  <em>

  </em>
  could have been exciting enough if announced by a developer, but having actual high-profile names from each sport push the projects helps solidify these games as not just fun pastimes, but as memorabilia.

      <title>Assassin's Creed Shadows' Thrown to the Dogs Pre-Order Bonus Explained</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  It's not uncommon for any game, especially an
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game, to include an extra quest as a pre-order bonus. In the case of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  , "Thrown to the Dogs" is available to those who pre-order the game, and it seems like it may be worth it in the end.

 <p>
  Game Rant recently spoke with
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' creative director Jonathan Dumont about the game's "Thrown to the Dogs" pre-order bonus quest. While Dumont didn't disclose too many explicit details about the quest—apart from what has already been revealed about it—he did leave us with an intriguing cliffhanger regarding its story.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <h2 id="assassin-39-s-creed-shadows-39-39-thrown-to-the-dogs-39-pre-order-bonus-quest">
  Assassin's Creed Shadows' 'Thrown to the Dogs' Pre-Order Bonus Quest
 </h2>
 <p>
  The thought of getting an extra quest as a pre-order bonus may not appeal to everyone, but
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' "Thrown to the Dogs" quest may be more than enough reason to do so. Based on what has been revealed about it so far, the quest's story sounds like it could not only be one of the game's more relatable quests but also one of its most emotional. When asked for more details about "Thrown to the Dogs," creative director Jonathan Dumont was tight-lipped about its specific contents, but he did divulge enough to pique one's curiosity:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Thrown to the Dogs is a simple yet heartfelt side quest. Since it's a standalone story, we can say that it's reminiscent of Odyssey's side content. In this quest, the protagonists stumble upon a beaten-up, stray dog that is waiting at a grave. The dog attracts your attention to follow him to the former house of the deceased. There our protagonists undercover some family secrets.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  For Dumont to say that "Thrown to the Dogs" is reminiscent of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  's side content may seem like a simple comparison, but it says a lot about the quest's design and the impact that it might have on
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' story and its players. A hallmark of some of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  's stronger side quests was their ability to be simple in nature and yet evoke an emotional depth that many side quests aren't known to achieve.
 </p>

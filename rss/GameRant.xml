  <strong>
   <em>
    Slitterhead
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s recent gameplay reveal got a lot of people talking. The game’s unique combination of visceral high-octane ultraviolence, OVA-inspired bio-horror, and pulpy manga character design helped set it apart from other horror announcements at this year’s Summer Game Fest, and the game’s setting—the fictional city of Kowlong, inspired by Kowloon Walled City in late 20th century Hong Kong—promises a locale unlike anything else in horror. Despite all this, it was the reveal of
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  ’s
  <em>
   Siren
  </em>
  -inspired possession mechanic that really stood out.

  Playing the role of Hyoki, a disembodied supernatural parasite who can enter and control living creatures, players are tasked with using the bodies of Kowlong’s civilians to hunt down and destroy the parasitic Yegouzi hiding within the city. With little regard for the safety of the city's civilians—the player is expected to possess a civilian, use it to fight monsters, then discard it for a new host when the current one is too damaged to continue—the ruthless nature of
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  ’s possession mechanic really helps sell the idea of playing as a non-human entity with little regard for the lives of the surrounding humans.

 <p>
  While alienating the player from the citizens of Kowlong works thematically, the lack of moral consideration for the game’s NPCs runs the risk of letting the player see behind the curtain. While the idea of Kowlong’s civilians merely being a resource definitely emphasizes Hyoki’s distance from humanity, Bokeh Game Studio needs to be careful that this doesn’t also distance the player from the game’s world. NPCs might be a resource, but they still need to feel alive in order for using them as a resource to remain dark and disturbing.

  Thankfully, a number of games have already found solutions to controllable NPCs feeling like lifeless and generic computer code. Most recently,
  <em>
   Watch Dogs: Legion
  </em>
  ’s 'recruit any NPC' approach used a set of random variables to generate an almost endless series of NPCs for the player to recruit—from human-statues prone to heart attacks, to suburban moms with a secret penchant for hacking and infiltration. A little backstory goes a long way.

  Slitterhead’s NPCs Are Designed to Feel Unique
 </h3>
 <p>
  Taking things one step further than many other games, the citizens of Kowlong have all been hand-crafted, with each of the city's controllable inhabitants being given unique backstories and character traits by the
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  dev team. The game's director, Keiichiro Toyama, has discussed how each NPC in the game will feel unique, moving and attacking differently based on their backstory. In a recent interview with IGN, Toyama discussed how, at one point in the game, players will be able to possess and control a homeless man who used to be a professional boxer, and the character’s movement and fighting ability will reflect that backstory.

 <p>
  <em>
   Slitterhead
  </em>
  is not an open-world game; instead it is split up into a number of ‘stages’, each approximately 30 minutes in length. With the game being split up into various stages, Bokeh Game Studio has been able to curate a finite number of unique NPCs within any given environment—rather than having to create systems to generate an endless number of characters within an expansive open world environment. This should hopefully allow each controllable NPC to still feel meaningfully alive, despite being used primarily as a resource for combat.

  There’s still a lot that gamers have yet to find out about Bokeh Game Studio’s upcoming action-horror adventure, but players won't have to wait too long to dive into Kowlong and discover its secrets for themselves.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has recreated an internet horror icon by making their Guardian look like the creepypasta character Slenderman using items from the game's
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  crossover armor set. The character still has its usual
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  design schemes, of course, with its sci-fi armor details, but it does manage to include the character's trademark black tendrils coming out from his back.

 <p>
  Slenderman is a household name when it comes to internet culture, having first appeared in a creepypasta story over a decade and a half ago and becoming immensely popular thanks to a series of indie horror video games. Thanks to the new
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  crossover that added a bunch of themed armor pieces and cosmetics to
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , the character's legacy has expanded once again to a game some fans may never have expected.

  Reddit user Feckel shared their creation to the r/DestinyFashion subreddit, which is a dedicated community for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players to show off their Guardians' attire, with a screenshot of their character donning the spooky outfit. Even though Slenderman is normally seen wearing a suit and tie, items which
  <em>

  does not currently feature, the costume serves as an adaptation of the character that fits within the game's aesthetic.

  Users in the comments quickly praised the outfit, with some even saying they would be scared to encounter the player in PvP since he is too intimidating to fight, and others simply want to make the outfit themselves. Luckily for them, the user's screenshot included the names of every item used to create the set, many of which come from the game's recent

  In
  <em>
   <strong>
    Hades 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , Melinoe's weapons offer a wide variety of play styles between them. But what adds additional complexity to them are the three different aspects players can choose from. Each aspect fundamentally changes how the weapon functions and, in turn, what players should build during a run. Out of all of these aspects, the Sister Blade's Aspect of Artemis can be a tricky weapon to build.

 <p>
  The Sister Blades' Aspect of Artemis needs plenty of damage buffs to scale well with your run and a healthy amount of Magick regeneration to remain relevant through your journey into the Underworld or on the Surface. Knowing what to look for and what gods are perfect for these weapons will be the key to your success. So if you've been looking for the best way to turn this Aspect into a titan-slaying machine, here are the boons and upgrades you should keep an eye out for.

 <p>
  The Aspect of Artemis gives a shield to Melinoe while she's charging her Omega Attack. If she's struck while the shield is up, Melinoe will parry that damage and gain the Riposte buff. This buff makes her impervious for 1 second and adds 50% critical chance to her next 9 strikes. Melinoe can parry every 15 seconds, and this aspect also increases her Omega Attack's charge rate by 60% at Rank 5.

 <h3 id="overall-strategy">

 <p>
  In effect, this allows Melinoe to play a more aggressive, close-range game than the other aspects of the Sister Blades. Parries encourage her to stay close to bosses and enemies alike so she can get the Riposte buff and increase her damage. The best part about Riposte is that it works for both her Attacks and her Special, which gives you some flexibility to how you build this weapon during your run.

 <p>
  For the build itself,
  <strong>
   you'll want to focus on anything that increases Melinoe's Omega attack damage, refreshes her Magick as fast as possible, and rewards her for using Magick.
  </strong>
  If you're going through the Underworld, you'll want to setup a good Attack boon and Magick regeneration boon before you reach Hecate. If you don't have a good Magic regeneration boon, you can still defeat Hecate as long as you know how the fight works, then focus on finding a good Magick regeneration boon in Oceanus.
 </p>

 <p>
  In comparison, if you're fighting through the Surface,
  <strong>
   you'll want to start with a boon that refreshes your Magick first
  </strong>
  so you can keep using your Omega Attack. Then, when you reach Ephyra, look for a good Attack boon. Unfortunately, if you don't find the boons you need after defeating Polyphemus, it may not be worth it to dedicate a Keepsake to find an Attack boon.

 <h3 id="attack-pattern">
  Attack Pattern
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ideally, you'll want to charge an Omega Attack, parry an attack, then release the Attack. Once it lands, you'll want to dash-strike through the enemy, and charge your Omega Attack again.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":579} -->
 <p>
  Performing a dash-strike is important here for two reasons: it gives you an opportunity to regenerate Magick before your next Omega Attack (you can't regenerate Magick while charging your Omega Attack), and it allows you to reposition yourself so your Omega Attack can get any backstab bonuses.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":879} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":true,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":879,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":true,"countRemainingForInjection":21,"nextBlockCount":435,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":true,"nextCount":1314} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":true,"actualCount":900} -->

 <p>
  This attack pattern will only change if you get Hera's Born Gain. Since it's the only Magick regeneration boon that refills your Magick while charging your Omega Attack, you can parry an attack and then continually unload Omega Attacks. If you need to get the backstab bonus, you'll have to take a few steps away from your target while charging and then release the Omega Attack to consistently teleport to the same spot.

  Out of all the Arcana cards, besides the usual suspects of damage Arcana cards (Huntress, Origination, Furies), the next most important cards to bring with you are the cards that allow you to alter boons and location rewards. These options will help you consistently find the boons you need and ultimately lead to more damage than Death and the Unseen. While Death and the Unseen aren't bad options, getting your build together consistently will usually be better in the long run.

 <p>
  Skulking Slice (+200% damage when attacking enemies from behind) early on is ideal since it's a good damage boost without increasing the amount of Magick you consume. However,
  <strong>
   finding Explosive Ambush will help in the long run
  </strong>
  since that's going to be a massive spike in your damage and allow you to clear rooms more efficiently at the cost of consuming more Magick.

 <p>
  To a lesser degree, Escalating Ambush is an acceptable option to take if you can't find Skulking Slice, but be aware that this option will not help very much against bosses. Along those lines, Flick Knives and Fan Knives can be useful if all of these other hammers aren't offered.

  The best gods you can get for the Aspect of Artemis are
  <strong>
   Aphrodite, Apollo, Hera, and Demeter

  Getting your build together is simple - focus on increasing Omega attack damage and get Origination working as soon as possible. While having these four specific gods is ideal,
  <strong>
   the only one that's truly core to the build is Aphrodite.
  </strong>
  She has the best attack stat and a majority of her best boons are relevant to this weapon. After that, focus on finding a good Magick regeneration and the rest of the build can be very open-ended.

  <strong>
   Aphrodite's Flutter Strike is easily the best boon here to use.
  </strong>
  It scales well later in the run, and it comes with plenty of support boons to make it better. If you're in need of a different attack boon, Apollo's Nova Strike and Demeter's Ice Strike can also work, but be aware that you'll have to lean more heavily on other support boons to increase your Omega Attack's damage later in the run.

 <p>
  Easily the best Hera boon in the game,
  <strong>
   Born Again is by far the best Magick regeneration boon you can find for this weapon.
  </strong>
  It's one of the only two boons in the game that will recharge your Magick while you're charging your Omega Attack (the other is Poseidon's Fluid Gain), and it's practically infinite Magick when you need it for a ridiculously small price. .

 <p>
  <strong>
   An acceptable alternative is Apollo's Lucid Gain
  </strong>
  , which will refill your Magick extremely quickly while you're standing in your cast. You'll have to use dash-strikes at times to get your Magick back before returning to Omega Attacks, but its rapid Magick gain makes it the next best thing.

 <p>
  Finding boons for these two slots follows the same logic:
  <strong>
   find anything that applies curses so you can get Origination working as soon as possible.
  </strong>
  For your cast, Hera and Demeter are the two best candidates. Two of Demeter's best boons, Arctic Ring and Gale Force, are incredibly powerful together because they will activate Origination with a single Cast. Comparatively, Hera's Hitch can do a surprising amount of damage and her cast can clear rooms fairly quickly.

 <p>
  Your special can either be used to apply curses, or if the game keeps throwing Special-oriented hammers at you, you can use it for damage by getting a Riposte stack, then unloading Omega Specials into an enemy's back. The same gods that would buff your attack (Aphrodite, Apollo, Demeter, Hera) also offer powerful Special boons, but if you just need a curse applied, Hestia and Zeus can also work in this slot.

  Almost every dash boon can work here, but
  <strong>
   if you're hoping to squeeze out every last drop of DPS from your build, Passion Dash is ideal.
  </strong>
  Not only does it introduce Sweet Surrender into your Aphrodite boons pool, it also works well with the Sister Blade's Omega Attack, and helps with Origination.

 <p>
  <strong>
   The next best option is Apollo's Nova Sprint
  </strong>
  which loses the damage of Passion Dash in exchange for the potential to get Backburner later in the run. Hestia's Soot Sprint is a good alternative if you're battling through the Surface because of how much it can help against Eris in her boss fight.

  <strong>
   Heart Breaker, Back Burner, Gale Force, and Weed Killer are all amazing.
  </strong>
  Not only do these keep you coming back to Aphrodite, Apollo, and Demeter and Hera, they all create powerful spikes in your damage output without any large changes to your game plan. Heart Breaker becomes even better if you can get Sunny Disposition, Apollo and Aphrodite's duo boon, which will make short work of every boss in the game. Just make sure you have all the necessary requirements to get this powerful duo boon if you plan on investing rerolls for it.

 <p>
  On the note of requirements,
  <strong>
   Exceptional Talent (Apollo's Legendary boon) is a powerful tool to add since it'll use your Omega Attack twice per cast.
  </strong>
  The problem is you have to build toward it by taking specific Apollo boons. If
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  continues to throw Apollo boons at you during your run at the cost of everything else, you may want to consider pivoting toward an Exceptional Talent build.

 <p>
  As far as other support boons go,
  <strong>
   Keen Intuition and Uncommon Grace
  </strong>
  are useful ways to get more damage out of your build, and they both come from Hera. If everything is going wrong, and you're worried that you won't be able to beat Chronos,
  <strong>
   you can never go wrong with Demeter's Coarse Grit
  </strong>
  since it will make the Chronos fight much more forgiving.

  <strong>
   Blumhouse Productions
  </strong>
  , the company behind popular films like
  <em>
   Get Out
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Black Phone
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Purge
  </em>
  , made an unexpected appearance at this year's Summer Games Fest, pulling back the curtain on its new gaming division. Blumhouse Games unleashed a barrage of game teasers during the show, and this preliminary salvo of game releases, coupled with Blumhouse's production strategy, could lead to great results.

 <p>
  Blumhouse is known for funding smaller projects that don't demand gargantuan production costs, and this financially conservative strategy has helped the company produce some of the most iconic horror movies of the past two decades. It's also a very creator-friendly approach, as the relatively lower budgets make for less risk-averse practices; Blumhouse has a higher risk tolerance than other production companies because its projects have a lower performance bar to clear to be considered profitable.

  The Indie Horror Space Is a Hotbed of Creativity
 </h3>
 <p>
  As excited as horror fans are about the next
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  , or other blockbuster production, it's undeniable that the indie scene has been churning out high-quality horror games for years.
  <em>
   Signalis
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Crow Country
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Darkwood
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   SOMA
  </em>
  are among the best horror experiences on the market right now, and they all come from independent studios working with far smaller budgets than a Goliath like Capcom or EA. Indie horror games, many of which make expert and efficient use of their small scope and often retro art styles, are proof positive that powerful, terrifying games can be produced on a budget.
 </p>

 <p>
  Blumhouse seems to be tapping into this market, which could turn out to be a brilliant move. Flagship Blumhouse Games projects like
  <em>
   Grave Seasons
  </em>
  are leveraging old-school graphics and gameplay formulas like the ever-present farming simulation to stand out amidst the crush of
  <em>
   RE4
  </em>
  -style survival horror titles from the AAA space, demanding a far less strenuous budget in the process. With mainstream game development becoming seemingly more safe, consolidated, and designed-by-committee, a company that supports subversive and risky titles has the power to produce some of the most affecting and creative titles in the genre.

  Blumhouse's Dollar May Stetch Farther With Games Than Movies
 </h3>
 <p>
  "Low-budget" is a relative term when discussing film production—even the most fiscally restrained films can cost millions of dollars to make. Games require a lot of funding too, but the medium has the privilege of a few budgetary workarounds that don't apply to films. One of the biggest ways that games, specifically indies, save money during development is labor: hit games like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  were made by solo developers,
  <em>
   Signalis
  </em>
  was produced by just two full-time developers, and countless other indies have come from studios with just a handful of employees.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":328} -->
 <p>
  Films also have various real-world obstacles to contend with. For instance, live-action films need to consider the cost of each actor, meaning that stories with a lot of different characters will naturally cost more in most cases. Then there's makeup, wardrobe, and costs associated with filming in certain locations, which can further inflate production costs. That's not to say that indies with a retro aesthetic always come cheap, but the fact that games can get away with the absence or limitation of voice acting, reusing assets, and the like, means that they can often cost less than their independent film counterparts.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":964} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Thus, Blumhouse could enjoy a bit more upside when funding low-budget games than movies. Assuming the production house chooses its projects wisely, its low-risk, high-reward strategy could pay dividends, benefiting both Blumhouse itself and the gaming community as a whole.

The three silhouetted Fall Guys appear to be wearing costumes of Captain America, Thor, and Hulk. No official price has been given for the skins yet, but based on the price of other collaboration skins, they will likely cost 800 show-bucks. In addition to the Marvel skins, the new Fame Pass will also go live June 18.

  The Crossover Kings Collaborate
 </h2>
 <p>
  While this Marvel collaboration will undoubtedly have fans excited, there is even more for
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  fans to look forward to. There has been an ongoing rumor about
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  crossing over with
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , a crossover that would include
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  versions of popular
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins being added to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , as well as a new
  <em>
   Fall Guys-
  </em>
  inspired mini-game mode.
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is another battle royale game known for its constant stream of collaborations, so a
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  crossover would make sense. Additionally, Epic Games' ownership of Mediatonic makes such a team-up easier than others. This crossover is rumored to happen on June 17, just one day before
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  ' crossover with Marvel, so
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  fans may be getting even more content than expected next week.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Sims Legacy Collection
   </strong>
  </em>
  is still suffering from crashing problems and technical issues after EA released the game's latest update on February 20. Although some major problems have been fixed,
  <em>
   The Sims Legacy Collection
  </em>
  appears to be far from the ideal
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  game that some fans hoped for.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  fans were very excited when EA announced that
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Sims 2
  </em>
  would be released again as
  <em>
   The Sims Legacy Collection
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Sims 2 Legacy Collection
  </em>
  , which include the base games and their respective DLC content. The community's response after the
  <em>
   Sims Legacy Collection
  </em>
  games were released was not as enthusiastic, however. Many players were reporting issues on Steam, including game crashes, corrupted saves, visual glitches, and progression bugs to name a few. Multiple updates were released after the game's launch on January 31, but there still seem to be plenty of issues that have gone unaddressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the release of the game's fourth update, fans went to the Steam forum post containing the patch notes and voiced their frustrations about
  <em>
   The Sims Legacy Collection's
  </em>
  persistent issues. Some players are still unable to load DLC, and the 16:9 aspect ratio doesn't appear to work in certain instances. In addition, some players are reporting UI scaling issues in 1080p, which greatly affects legibility for in-game text. Although fans are happy that some crashing issues were fixed, others are experiencing strange issues after loading into the game, including whole neighborhoods being empty without houses.

  Overall, reception surrounding
  <em>

  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  continues to be mixed after the game's latest update, with many fans making their opinions known about what has or has not been fixed on the Steam forum. According to the patch notes, EA is aware that there are issues that are currently being investigated, so it's likely that more updates and bug fixes will arrive in the near future. There's no guarantee that every issue will be fixed immediately, and EA encourages players to continue leaving feedback in the Steam forum and official
  <em>

  forum.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Sims Legacy Collection
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Sims 2 Legacy Collection

  are available on Steam for $19.99 and $29.99 respectively. Although ports and remasters have been released around these price points, the bugs and issues involving both
  <em>
   Sims Legacy Collection
  </em>
  titles have encouraged heavy scrutiny of the price. Some fans in the forums would like EA to put more effort into ensuring future
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  releases, such as a potential
  <em>
   The Sims 3 Legacy Collection
  </em>
  , are up to par with what fans expect from remasters.

 </ul>
 <p>
  As a Duelist, Human Torch excels at dishing out damage from a distance. He is a Flyer hero, similar to Iron Man and Storm. However, since he lacks any real escape abilities, you'll need to be extremely careful how you position during fights. It's easy for the enemy team to focus you down if you stay in the open for too long.

  Despite his three-star difficulty rating, learning Human Torch isn't too difficult. His abilities are pretty straightforward. While his Primary Attack has a big spread from a distance, if you get close to an enemy it almost all of them hit consistently. On top of that, his attacks can also crit, allowing you to deal massive damage if you get a headshot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember to use the combo of Blazing Blast and Pyro-Prison to control objectives or chokepoints. It's almost always better to use three Blazing Blasts to create a triangle. Then you can hit Pyro-Prison and enemies that get inside the triangle will take constant damage over time.

  While Flaming Meteor is a high-damage nuke, you should hold off on using it any time it's off cooldown. Human Torch is a pretty slow hero despite being a Flyer. Since Flaming Meteor gets you in range of even a melee hero, you become an easy target for a few seconds after using it. It's best used to catch a fleeing hero on low hp or as a killing blow on multiple targets.

     Human Torch's Omega Fire Team-Up Ability with Storm is one of the strongest in the game at the moment. Request a team-up during hero selection to see if an ally wants to pick up Storm to activate the combo.

  To unlock Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways, players must reach at least Union Level 30. Additionally, they must complete the prologue of Chapter II in the main story quest,
  <strong>
   Through the Sea Thou Break
  </strong>
  , which takes them to Ragunna City in Rinascita for the first time. Once these conditions are met, a side quest titled Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways will appear in the quest log.
 </p>
 <p>
  This side quest directs players to meet with Encore's Cosmos near Ragunna City's Resonance Nexus. After speaking with Cosmos, players will be sent to Thessaleo Fells, where the game mode is located near the area's Resonance Nexus.

  Similar to other game modes, players must select a team of three Resonators to take on Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways. Each week features a new rotation of Dreamscape Aid Resonators, and including at least one of them in the team grants a 150% bonus to Illusive Points, which are crucial for earning weekly rewards. Additionally, Dreamscape Aid Effects provide strong buffs, some of which are specifically tailored for that week's Dreamscape Aid Resonators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of the rotation, the primary effect of this aid is Lucid Dream, which automatically activates when players fill the Dreamscape Energy gauge—represented by a key symbol in the top-left corner. Dreamscape Energy is generated through Basic Attacks and other weekly conditions. When Lucid Dream is triggered, players receive powerful buffs such as increased Crit Rate, Energy Regen, and reduced cooldowns for a few seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  To complete a run of Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways, players must progress through 13 Memory Zones, or rooms. Similar to Depths of Illusive Realm, each Memory Zone grants Metaphors to enhance Resonators and Dream Fragments as currency. Memory Zones 6 and 12 serve as Memory of Rest rooms, where players can exchange Dream Fragments for additional Metaphors. Memory Zones 7 and 13 are boss rooms, which, after completion, offer players the chance to spend Waveplates for additional rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Metaphors in Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways are generally more straightforward than those in Depths of Illusive Realm, with most providing simple buffs to ATK, Crit, DMG, Basic Attacks, Heavy Attacks, Resonance Skills, and Resonance Liberation. Some Metaphors labeled 'Dreamscape Power' specifically modify and enhance the Lucid Dream effect.

  The weekly rewards for Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways are based on earning Illusive Points, as mentioned earlier. Players earn Illusive Points each time they participate in this game mode, with the amount varying based on the number of Memory Zones cleared per run. To receive all the rewards, players must accumulate 6,000 Illusive Points each week. This game mode grants up to 160 Astrite per week, equivalent to one Convene pull.

   RPG

  s are known for being extremely versatile and offering players tons of options regarding how they want to play the game, how they want their characters to look, and what they want them to wear, as well as the weapons they’ll wield. Many tactical RPGs have non-linear storypaths, allowing players to choose what they want to do, whereas others stick to a more traditional approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some isometric RPGs are tactical, but not all tactical RPGs are isometric, which is where a lot of people get confused about the grid-based system. Here are some of the

    Hard West

  is set in a fictionalized version of the American Old West, showing many standard elements of the Western genre while adding some supernatural aspects that make the gameplay experience very interesting. Players can expect to see some coming Wild West topics, such as bank robberies and the famed gold rush that took place in the 19th century, with a few variations that will keep them guessing.

 <p>
  This title offers tons of options for players to plan out their strategies, which is why it’s safe to say that it can be considered one of the best grid-based strategy games out there.

  is not strictly an RPG, but rather a JRPG. And while many argue that there isn't a great difference between one and the other, they do have certain elements that can clearly differentiate them.
 </p>
 <p>
  This particular title came out in 2008 and is set in Europa, a fictional region that is loosely based on real-life Europe during the events of World War 2. Throughout the game, players will have to plan out their military strategies carefully to ensure their victory on the battlefield and crown themselves as the superior force of the region. The game mechanics present in

   Tactics Ogre

  franchise has been around for almost three decades at the time of writing this article, and, along with the older
  <em>
   Ogre Battle
  </em>
  , it all began with this title—
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together

  </strong>
  . This title will have players take on the role of Denim Powell, who’s caught in the middle of a war in the once-peaceful nation of Valeria.
 </p>
 <p>
  The combat mechanics present in
  <em>
   Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together

  are excellent, and, along with the different classes available in the game, the experience players can have with this title is outstanding.

   <em>
    Crypt of the NecroDancer
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of those games that, while it didn't innovate in its concept, manages to deliver a very niche experience that some players love and others not so much. Throughout the game, players will have to move their characters and attack based on the rhythm of the song that’s playing in the background.
 </p>
 <p>
  The better players stick to the rhythm, the more efficient their attacks will be and the easier defeating enemies will feel. This title is one of the most reliant on a grid-based system, as it’s essential for the rhythm mechanics present in the game.

 <p>
  Not only does this game allow players to change their characters’ classes and outfits, but it also features a very intricate and complete grid-based combat system that is always entertaining.

   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers players a wide range of outfits to buy, find, craft, and wear. From jumpsuits to work gear, there's a lot to choose from. However, not all apparel in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  holds the same value. There are a handful of very rare and highly sought-after apparel items that players can obtain.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the rare apparel items share one thing in common: they are not easy to find. Some of the rarest items have drop rates of just 0.01%. This guide aims to help players learn all there is to know about the rarest apparel items that can be found throughout post-war Appalachia.

   Since this article was last updated, Bethesda has released a few new Fasnacht masks. These new unique glowing masks are now among the most valuable items in the game. Because of this, it only seems right to update this article to showcase the new Fasnacht masks. Also, some of the existing entries need to be updated so they match what is going on in the game today. Rare apparel has gone through a lot over the past few months. Bethesda has greatly reduced the value of many items in the game. However, there are still plenty of top-tier items to keep an eye out for.

   How To Get: Sometimes Sold By The Traveling Vendor Bot Responder
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Despite being fairly tricky to get, the Grey Fisherman's Overalls doesn't carry much value. That said, it is still pretty rare. To get this outfit, the player will need to find
  <strong>
   the Traveling Vendor Bot Responder.
  </strong>
  This vendor is a random encounter that has a small chance of being triggered when players walk through certain areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, should the player find the Traveling Vendor Bot Responder, there's no guarantee that the robot will have the outfit in its inventory. Despite its rarity, the outfit doesn't usually sell for more than a couple of thousand Caps. This is a rare outfit that many players may already have hidden away in their stash box and not know it.

 <p>
  Similar to the Grey Fisherman's Overalls, the Longshoreman Outfit isn't worth too much, but nonetheless, it's still a rare outfit. Players can get this outfit from
  <strong>
   the Traveling Vendor Bot Responder
  </strong>
  mentioned in the previous entry.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the chances of getting this outfit are the same as getting the Grey Fisherman's Outfit, this one tends to go for a little more. While it's still not much, players can get a few thousand Caps for this piece. It's not uncommon to find players selling the Longshoreman Outfit in their CAMP Vendors for around 5K Caps.

 <ul>
  <li>
   How To Get: A Possible Reward For Completing The Event; Riding Shotgun
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  There's an event that a lot of newer players don't know about.
  <strong>
   Riding Shotgun is a special event that can be triggered by talking to Vinny Costa
  </strong>
  over at Big Bend Tunnel East. Completing Riding Shotgun gives the players a small chance of receiving either the Blue Ridge Caravan Outfit or the Blue Ridge Caravan Mask.
 </p>
 <p>
  The event itself is fairly straightforward: guard a caravan as it makes its way through Big Bend Tunnel East and collect a few lost caches along the way. If the player finds all 4 lost caches, then they will have a 5% chance of getting one of the events' rare rewards. The Blue Ridge Outfit and Mask are among those rewards.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outfit and mask are worth a bit more than the previous two entries, but they won't bring in mega bucks. Players can possibly get around 8K Caps if they find the right buyer.

   How To Get: A Rare Daily Ops Reward

 <p>
  The Skull Lod Blood Eagles Suit And Helmet are two separate
  <strong>
   rewards that players can get for completing Daily Ops
  </strong>
  . These are considered rare rewards, meaning that players only have a small chance each day to get a piece of this set.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it doesn't sell for much, players who are lucky enough to get a piece of this set can expect to net at least a couple of thousand caps should they decide to sell it. The blood-oozing skulls that cover this outfit make this set stand out. Just like the other outfits on this list, it doesn't really have a function, other than looking cool. But players who don't yet have this outfit are often more than happy to pay out in order to get this set.

  These masks can be added to certain armor sets to complete them. The USA mask matches Urban Scout Armor, and the FSA mask matches Forest Scout Armor. While the armor sets themselves can be obtained through legendary drops or purchased from the MODUS terminal in the Whitespring Bunker, the masks can only be obtained by completing certain Daily Quests and events.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players have a small chance at receiving one of these masks by
  <strong>
   completing events and Daily Quests in the Savage Divide.
  </strong>
  Events such as Uranium Fever and One Violent Night are among the best events to complete in the Savage Divide, as they also award players with Treasury Notes. Like with the rarest apparel in
  <em>
   Fallout 76,
  </em>
  these masks have a less than 1% drop rate.

 <p>
  Fasnacht has been a part of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  for several years. This seasonal event is loosely based on the real-world Fasnacht event that occurs once a year in Helvetia. It works quite differently in
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  when compared to its real-world counterpart. There are robots, plenty of enemies, and rare masks to earn.
  <strong>
   For a long time, the Loon mask was the most valuable mask in the game.
  </strong>
  However, in recent years, Bethesda has released new sets of masks that have changed the values of the original ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  That said, the original set of rare masks still fetches a pretty penny. Even the lowest-value rare masks are worth between 35k and 40k caps. The other, rarer masks are trade-only items. The non-glowing rare masks can be seen below. They are placed in a rough order of lowest to highest value:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Winter Man, Crazy Guy, Raven Masks
  </li>
  <li>
   Deathclaw Mask
  </li>
  <li>
   Brahmin Mask
  </li>
  <li>
   Buffoon Mask
  </li>
  <li>
   Demon Mask
  </li>
  <li>
   Hag Mask
  </li>
  <li>
   Fiend Mask
  </li>
  <li>
   Loon Mask
  </li>
 </ul>

  The first set of glowing masks is worth considerably more than most of the masks in the previous entry combined.
  <strong>
   This set consists of four masks:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Glowing Honey Bee
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Blue Devil
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Scorchbeast
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Scorchbeast Queen
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  It's worth noting that there are non-glowing variants of these masks. However, they are pretty much worthless. Players are usually willing to part ways with some of the best items in the game in order to get a glowing mask or two. Out of the four masks listed above, the Glowing Scorchbeast Queen is seen as the most valuable one.

  In 2024, a new set of glowing masks was brought to the game. These quickly became some of the most sought-after items in the whole game. While the first set only contained four glowing masks,
  <strong>
   this set has a total of six masks for players to collect:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Glowing Turkey
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Pig
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Minotaur
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Robot
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Alien
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Unicorn
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  For the most part, the Glowing Unicorn and the Glowing Alien are seen as the most valuable masks from this set. However, just like all items in
  <em>
   Fallout 76,
  </em>
  things tend to fluctuate.

 <p>
  For 2025's Fasnacht festivities, Bethesda released four new masks for players to grind for. With each addition to the mask pool, the odds of getting a specific mask decrease slightly. This means that the newest set will be the rarest mask set in the game. The four masks can be seen below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Glowing Abe
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Bigfoot
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Jackalope
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Veggie Man
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While it's difficult to tell which of the masks listed above will be the most valuable,
  <strong>
   there are quite a few players with their eye on the Glowing Abe Mask
  </strong>
  . As time goes on, it will become easier to tell which of the masks is the most valuable. That said, all of them are still going to be very, very valuable. Players seem all too willing to trade huge bundles of in-game items for just one of the new rare masks.

 <p>
  The White Powder Jumpsuit is a dark blue jumpsuit with a light blue collar and pockets. Players have roughly a 0.15% chance of receiving this jumpsuit when completing certain events and quests. Similar to the FSA and USA Masks, the White Powder Jumpsuit can be awarded to players for completing events and Daily Quests in the Savage Divide. Alongside the BOS Jumpsuit, the White Powder Jumpsuit is the lowest-value ultra-rare jumpsuit. That said, it is worth way more than the maximum Cap limit of 40K.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is possible for a player to receive what is known as the '
  <strong>
   Wasteland Lottery.
  </strong>
  ' The Wasteland Lottery is an ultra-rare reward that players can receive for completing events in the Savage Divide. It consists of a couple of common outfits and 4 rare ones. The rare items are the BOS Jumpsuit, White Powder Jumpsuit, FSA Mask, and USA Mask.

  The BOS Jumpsuit, or the Brotherhood of Steel Jumpsuit, is a dark blue jumpsuit with the Brotherhood Of Steel emblem on the right pocket and on the back. This jumpsuit can be obtained in the same way as the White Powder Jumpsuit by completing events and Daily Quests in the Savage Divide.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The BOS Jumpsuit has a 0.15% chance of being awarded to a player
  </strong>
  for completing any of the Savage Divide events or Daily Quests. While it has the same drop rate as the White Powder Jumpsuit, it is a more popular jumpsuit and, therefore, is slightly more valuable than the White Powder Jumpsuit.

  The Forest Camo Jumpsuit is a very popular jumpsuit due to its camo-style pattern. It helps players to blend into the background of the Forest Region, allowing for a more immersive solo gameplay experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obtaining the Forest Camo Jumpsuit isn't easy. The jumpsuit is an ultra-rare reward that players can receive upon completing events in the Forest Region. Events like Fertile Soil and Leader of The Pack are among the most popular events in the Forest Region. This is because of how quickly they can be completed. The jumpsuit has a
  <strong>
   drop rate of just 0.03% and is more valuable than the White Powder Jumpsuit and the BOS Jumpsuit combined.

  The Traveling Leather Coat is a long green and brown coat with pants and boots.
  <strong>
   Players have roughly a 0.06% chance of receiving this outfit
  </strong>
  as a reward for completing events and Daily Quests in the Mire Region.
 </p>
 <p>
  Quests such as Heart of The Swamp, Irrational Fear, and It's a Trap all have the possibility of dropping this outfit as a reward. As for Daily Quests, Idle Explosives, Playtime, Queen of The Hunt, and Waste Not, give players the chance to get this outfit. However, the Daily Quests, as the name suggests, can only be completed once per day. The Traveling Leather Coat It goes without saying, but this outfit is very hard to come by. There are players who have been trying for years to obtain it.

  The Leather Coat is an ultra-rare reward that players have the chance to receive for completing events and Daily Quests in the Mire Region. Much like the Traveling Leather Coat, it has roughly a 0.06% chance of dropping upon completing one of the events of quests in the Mire Region. It is a popular outfit among hardcore
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Leather Coat looks very similar to the Traveling Leather Coat. The only real noticeable difference is that the Leather Coat doesn't have a backpack on the back, but the Traveling Leather Coat does. Despite having the same drop chance as the Traveling Leather Coat, the Leather Coat is worth considerably more as players seem to prefer it to the Traveling Leather Coat.

 </p>
 <p>
  There are two possible ways to acquire parts of the Responders Set. Players have an estimated

  The Red Asylum Uniform is one of the rarest outfits in the game. There are multiple variants of the Asylum Worker Uniforms, but the red one is by far the most valuable. The Red Asylum Uniform can spawn in three places. All of which are located on the third floor inside of Fort Defiance.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are two spawn locations at the end of the hall through a door on the right-hand side. The third possible spawn is in the room on the left. There is a
  <strong>
   0.01% chance of the Red Asylum Uniform spawning at
  </strong>
  one of these locations, making it one of the most difficult outfits to come by in the game. It is the second most valuable piece of apparel in
  <em>
   Fallout 76.

 <p>
  The Tattered Field Jacket is the most valuable apparel item in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  . The name of the outfit fits the description of what it looks like. It is a well-worn outfit with tears and holes all over it. Its tattered appearance is deceiving, as it is the most highly sought-after outfit in the whole game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Players have roughly a 0.06% chance of being awarded this outfit
  </strong>
  for completing events and Daily Challenges in the Mire Region. There is also a tiny possibility of receiving it for completing the quest One of Us, although it is extremely unlikely. As for its value, the sky is the limit for this outfit. Many players are willing to part with some of the best weapons in the game for the Tattered Field Jacket.

  There are various puzzles players might stumble upon while exploring the regions in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Some puzzles are complicated, like the Warden Vault one, while others are extremely easy and unlock a small room full of loot.

  Turn around, climb the stairs, then run left towards the fallen tree log. Approach the short gate, and open it to see a blue barrier across. Take the Power Crystal to remove the barrier and place it on the Energy Node next to the beam generator. Finally, aim it at a faraway Node.

  While other genres in gaming offer players amazing experiences, few can match the vastness and versatility of
  <strong>
   RPG
  </strong>
  s. In most cases, this genre not only presents players with the opportunity to create and customize their own character, but also recruit party members, upgrade their stats to their liking and explore worlds full of life and side quests.

 <p>
  Combat, narrative, the variety of weapons and companions available, as well as the quality of the missions are very important in a game. But what really makes an RPG stand out is how intimidating or interesting enemy chatter is, whether it comes from a regular enemy or a powerful boss. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best RPGs with great enemy chatter.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Cyberpunk 2077

  </em>

  As players progress through the story, they will encounter certain areas that they'll have to clear out either to progress through a specific mission or to help the NCPD in exchange for a few rewards. In any case, they'll be faced with constant enemy chatter that will only cease when every hostile has been flatlined.

  and other FromSoftware games are known for their considerable difficulty level, the bleak world they're set in, and the large variety of nightmarish enemies and bosses that players can encounter along the way. However, one aspect of these titles that few players talk about, but almost everyone loves, is the boss chatter.

 <p>
  Although most area enemies are silent and restrict themselves only to grunting or maniacal laughters, bosses typically have an opening cutscene, where they take advantage of their time in the spotlight to drop some of the coldest lines in their universe. Additionally, some bosses also keep talking as players fight them, making the experience even more epic.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of those games that players know will be a timeless classic in a decade or so, as it's already beloved by millions and the franchise has inspired TV shows, collectibles, and tons of fan tributes. Even though the game was released almost 10 years ago at the time of writing this article, its RPG game mechanics still feel fresh, allowing it to compete and even overshadow many modern titles in the genre.

 <p>
  Fighting enemies like guards is fun and makes for a few great lines during combat. However, where this game's enemy chatter truly shines is around entities like Gaunter O'Dimm, the main antagonist of the
  <em>
   Hearts of Stone
  </em>
  DLC. Not only is this character the closest thing to the devil in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  universe, but he also has very interesting dialogue that players can interact with. The game also has optional quests with a few enemies with outstanding dialogue, so there's no shortage of options when it comes to conversation.

  Similar to the

  franchise,
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

  restricts its area enemies to grunts and repetitive death sounds during combat. However, characters like Darth Malak and Admiral Saul Karath have very interesting things to say throughout the game, greatly elevating the narrative.

  puts players to the test constantly—especially when facing bosses.

  franchise, area enemies are rather quiet, so it's up to bosses to make up for all that silence, and for the most part, they absolutely deliver. While some bosses are also silent, those who speak before a fight, during combat, when they reach their second phase, or even after being defeated or killing the Tarnished, drop some of the best lines in gaming history.

  After progressing through the main quests in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , you will eventually unlock Davrin as a companion. Complete Davrin’s first companion quest, How to Train a Griffon, and then head back to Arlathan Forest to find the Plight of the Veil Jumpers quest available. Speak with Elio, who tells you some Veil Jumpers went too long and haven’t returned.

  Head to the marked location located northeast of the Veil Jumpers’ camp. Proceed deeper inside the forest to find a couple of portals and no sign of any Veil Jumpers. One will call you, but the path is blocked. To reach them, Rook must disable the relic causing the disruption.

 <p>
  Sprite Bulbs are a collectible item that usually appears on an island on your first visit, with more appearing on a revisit to further incentivize players to fast travel between islands, even after finishing the story there in
  <strong>

  While the use of Sprite Bulbs isn't immediately known, it's best to start collecting them early on. Rumbla Island is the first one in the game, and after revisiting it for the first time, you'll be able to track down all the Sprite Bulbs on the island; here's where to find them.

  The seventh Sprite Bulb is found far to the right side of the island from the previous few. While the location of the Bulb is further north, head towards the flower along the bottom right side of the map and use it to jump on onto the hill. Heading north, you'll find
  <strong>
   panels that each brother will need to jump on in order based on the color and letter
  </strong>
  of the panel. On the far side will be another hill with a rock that can be smashed to reveal the Sprite Bulb.

  After progressing a bit further into the game, you'll unlock Battle Plugs, which are
  <strong>
   crafted using Sprite Bulbs
  </strong>
  . Battle Plugs range greatly from passive boosts, like accessories, to active abilities to use in battle. Battle Plugs offer some of the best boosts or abilities, with later, stronger ones requiring players to craft weaker ones first. To use some of the best Battle Plugs in the game, you'll need to craft a lot meaning you'll need a lot of Sprite Bulbs, so it's best to start collecting early.

  Crafting is back in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Ops 6 Zombies
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and so is Salvage. Players are going to need a ton of the latter if they want to improve their odds of survival, but getting tons of Salvage is much easier said than done, especially since the game doesn't tell players how to get it.

 <p>
  Farming large quantities of Salvage may seem like a pain, but there are a number of ways to reduce the overall grind. Even the best weapons for
  <em>
   BO6 Zombies
  </em>
  need to get upgraded, and to do that, you'll need to get a lot Salvage before the undead horde becomes too much to handle. Here's how you can do so.

 <p>
  The simplest way to boost your Salvage gains per run is to aim for the head.
  <strong>
   Critical Kills on zombies have a higher chance of dropping Salvage for players
  </strong>
  , and since headshots deal more damage than bodyshots, there's no reason not to aim for the noggin when you have a train of undead going.

  To boost your Salvage drops even more,
  <strong>
   equip a suppressor
  </strong>
  on your starting weapon. You can setup your Zombies builds in
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  prior to starting a match, and if you aren't planning on doing a purist pistol start run, slap a silencer onto your gun (assuming you have the attachment unlocked). The drop rate boost for Salvage is noticeable, and with suppressed headshot kills, players should be able to upgrade their weapon to purple rarity on or before Wave 15.

  There are plenty of secrets littered in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies maps, and some of them may give players some Salvage and other rewards for finding them. For example, the blood pool in the Liberty Falls map will give you a bunch of Salvage
  <strong>
   if you throw three Semtex grenades into it
  </strong>
  . You can also
  <strong>
   smack the snacks vending machine near the blood pool
  </strong>
  for some free Salvage too.

 <p>
  If you don't want to deal with the slow early game in every Zombies match, you can interact with Rampage Inducers to ramp up the difficulty. This won't necessarily increase Salvage drops, but it will increase enemy spawn rates (on top of making them move faster). Having a Rampage Inducer toggled on means you'll be able to fight more things earlier on into a match, giving you more opportunities to earn Salvage.

 <p>
  Rampage Inducers can be deactivated, so if you feel like things are getting too hot, you can always go back to it and turn it off.

  Developers at Capcom working on the upcoming action title
  <strong>
   <em>
    Onimusha: Way of the Sword
   </em>
  </strong>
  have clarified their intentions with regard to the game's difficulty. Currently in development,
  <em>
   Onimusha: Way of the Sword
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  will land on the PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2026.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capcom's venerable
  <em>
   Onimusha
  </em>
  series is seeing a resurgence in activity after years spent largely dormant. The original
  <em>
   Onimusha: Warlords
  </em>
  was an early PlayStation 2 hit patterned off the gameplay style and presentation of the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  series. Outside of Japan-exclusive browser and mobile spin-offs and the 2018 remaster of
  <em>
   Warlords
  </em>
  , the series never left the PlayStation 2 and Xbox generation. Many fans assumed it had become a forgotten Capcom franchise, a relic of a previous generation. Capcom put that sentiment to rest with its showcase broadcast on February 4, where it unveiled
  <em>
   Onimusha: Way of the Sword
  </em>
  , an entirely new game in the franchise set for modern platforms.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the showcase,
  <em>
   Onimusha: Way of the Sword
  </em>
  Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Director Satoru Nihei outlined their goals for the game, including three core aspects of
  <em>
   Onimusha: Way of the Sword
  </em>
  gameplay. Nihei also clarified the team's attitude towards difficulty, saying that it's not trying to make "an impossibly difficult" game. Instead, Capcom hopes to make a game where players experience "thrilling sword fights" and take satisfaction from slaying their enemies.

 <p>
  From his mention of not intending for
  <em>
   Onimusha: Way of the Sword
  </em>
  to be "impossibly difficult," it seems that Director Nihei is setting expectations regarding what players should expect from
  <em>
   Onimusha: Way of the Sword
  </em>
  , as well as distancing
  <em>
   Way of the Sword
  </em>
  from "Souls-like" action games, which are famous for being challenging to the point of frustration for many players.

 <p>
  Given how long it's been since
  <em>
   Onimusha
  </em>
  was last in the headlines, clarifying those kinds of expectations is a reasonable move for Capcom. At first glance, a player with no knowledge of the series might look at
  <em>
   Onimusha: Way of the Sword
  </em>
  's dark fantasy style and violent combat and assume that it takes after the likes of FromSoftware's
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  or Koei Tecmo's
  <em>
   Nioh
  </em>
  , and have a similar focus on challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between
  <em>
   Onimusha: Way of the Sword
  </em>
  and the also-announced remaster of
  <em>
   Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny
  </em>
  , Capcom is on the way towards setting off a full
  <em>
   Onimusha
  </em>
  franchise revival. With time and success on
  <em>
   Way of the Sword
  </em>
  's part, that could mean a new pillar of modern action games could soon be raised.

  Set to launch next week on Xbox Series X|S and PC, Avowed has console players eagerly awaiting confirmation of a 60 FPS mode. Meanwhile, PC players can rest easy knowing they can push for much higher frame rates—provided their hardware is up to the task. Check out the system requirements below to see if your PC can handle it.

  The system requirements for
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  are fairly standard for a modern AAA game. As expected, it will only support Windows 10 or 11, and while it's mentioned, it's obvious that only the 64-bit versions will be compatible.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The minimum requirements list either an Intel i5-8400 or an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 as the CPU, paired with a GTX 1070, AMD RX 5700, or, for Intel GPU users, an Arc A580 at minimum.
  </li>
  <li>
   The recommended specs increase the CPU requirement to an Intel i7-10700K or an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X. For GPUs, players will need either an RTX 3080 or an AMD RX 6800 XT.

 <p>
  Both configurations require 16 GB of RAM, so at least memory won't be a concern. The system requirements also don't mention whether an HDD will be supported for storage. However, given that Avowed is a 2025 AAA title, it's highly recommended to use an SSD. Running the game on an HDD could lead to significant performance issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obsidian has not specified the target framerate or resolution for these requirements. Additionally, it's unclear whether upscaling technologies like DLSS or FSR have been factored into the performance expectations.

      <title>PSN is Currently Down</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/psn-down-ps5-ps4-february-2025/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Since around 6 PM EST,
  <strong>
   PSN
  </strong>
  has been reported to be down for PlayStation users. Unfortunately, there are no details on when PSN services could be restored.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  PlayStation Network offers online services for PlayStation gamers to make use of. In addition to allowing players to play games online with friends, PSN lets gamers use the PlayStation digital store, create profiles, share content, and more. While many PlayStation players enjoy using some or all of these features on a daily basis, many are currently unable to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  The PSN Service Status page has provided a run-down of the services impacted. Currently, account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and PlayStation Direct are all experiencing issues. The service outage also appears to be affecting all platforms, including PS4 and PS5 users. While the PSN Service page said the outage began at 7 PM EST, it is worth noting that Downdector started getting reports of issues around 6PM EST. With that in mind, users have been dealing with problems for quite a while already.

      <title>One Controversial Animal Crossing Spin-Off May Be an Experiment Worth Repeating</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/animal-crossing-new-amiibo-festival-spin-off-switch-2/</link>

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Animal Crossing
   </em>
  </strong>
  games are known for their cozy and relaxed gameplay that involves making friends with anthropomorphic animal villagers and living a peaceful life in whatever setting players are plopped into. One cannot talk about Nintendo's most successful franchises without mentioning
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  , but that doesn't mean it has never missed the mark. Great as the series may be, there is one
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  title that was critically panned for being repetitive and lacking in important areas. Despite not being well-received, its concept was at least interesting, and maybe Nintendo should consider reusing it in a future project.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  has had a few spin-offs that deviated from the series' usual gameplay formula, and some found success. However, the one that barely found any was
  <em>
   Amiibo Festival
  </em>
  , a game that required players to have figurines and cards to use its core gameplay features. While it's generally considered one of the franchise's rare misses, the title's concept of a party game based around
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  is something that some fans still appreciate Nintendo trying out. Given that it has been over nine years since its release, it may be time for a new game that takes the ideas of
  <em>
   Amiibo Festival
  </em>
  and refines them.

  While
  <em>
   Amiibo Festival
  </em>
  was a bold spin-off for the
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  franchise that failed, there were things it could have done that might have allowed it to rival other party games, like those in the
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  series. Should Nintendo decide to create another similar title, then it needs to consider things like:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Putting in more mini-games based around events that many fans of the franchise are familiar with, such as the Bug-Off, Fishing Tourney, and Bunny Day.
  </li>
  <li>
   Including better opportunities for customizations that allow players to change the number of turns, alter the amount of points needed to win, set the seasons that a board will be themed around, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
   Removing the need to use cards or Amiibos tied to
   <em>
    Animal Crossing
   </em>
   to play so that it's accessible to everyone right from the start
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If these ideas were implemented in a future spin-off
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  party game, it could become the hit Nintendo was expecting
  <em>
   Amiibo Festival
  </em>
  to be. Given that the company loves innovation, and has a reputation for creating quality titles, it may just happen in the future.

  How a Future Animal Crossing Party Game Spin-off Coulld Still Use Amiibos

 <p>
  If the Switch 2 has an
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  game with a concept similar to
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  , it could still implement
  <em>
   Amiibo Festival
  </em>
  's core feature of using Amiibos and cards, just to a lesser degree. Instead of making them a requirement to play the game, Amiibos and cards could be relegated to providing purely cosmetic bonus content. That way, people can choose to get them if they want, not because they have to in order to gain access to things that could drastically change gameplay like additional mini-games or modes. Also, Nintendo stands to benefit, as it could revive fans' passion for collecting Amiibos and cards, which could prompt more being developed for
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  and other franchises.

  failed to accomplish, it should have a much easier time doing so now, considering what can be learned from the original title's reception. All Nintendo has to do is refine what worked in the nine-year-old game, remove the parts that didn't, and add a few new mechanics and features so that the possible title can succeed where its predecessor didn't.

  The initial reception to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Civilization 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been pretty mixed. While some outlets (Game Rant included) gave
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  the high scores of 9 and above that the series is used to, praising the game's innovative new features and refined systems, other outlets were less impressed, criticizing the game's overly streamlined UI among other issues.

  Regardless of the critical response, fans who have purchased the more expensive editions of
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  are now getting their hands on the game, and it's clear that there are some key features from earlier entries that are sorely missing here at launch. But before some fans have even had the chance to play the game, developer Firaxis has already issued a statement addressing some common complaints, and it's a promising piece of transparency right out of the gate.

  Firaxis Is Prioritizing Civilization 7's UI Issues
 </h3>
 <p>
  After thanking fans for their feedback, Firaxis' early access launch statement is quick to address one of fans and critics' biggest complaints:
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's UI. Firaxis states that improving
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  's UI is its "top priority," and though it's going to take some time to "digest all of [the] feedback," it has plans to make UI interactions more intuitive, to improve
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  's map readability, and improve the general formatting of the game's interface, just to start with.
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's UI has been a common complaint across the board for both fans and reviewers alike, so it's great to see Firaxis prioritize fixing this key issue.

 <h3 id="firaxis-is-already-working-to-add-fan-requested-features">
  Firaxis Is Already Working to Add Fan-Requested Features
 </h3>
 <p>
  But fixing
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's UI is just one part of Firaxis' launch day statement. Firaxis also confirmed that a handful of key features that fans have been requesting will be added to the game as free updates. These features include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Hotseat multiplayer mode
  </li>
  <li>
   A wider variety of map types
  </li>
  <li>
   The ability to customize city and religion names
  </li>
  <li>
   The ability to choose starting and ending Ages (allowing for shorter games)
  </li>
  <li>
   Adding teams to multiplayer
  </li>
  <li>
   Refinements to the Distant Lands system that will allow full player counts in multiplayer throughout all three Ages
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Most of these features have been staples of the
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  franchise for decades, so it's great to see Firaxis promise to bring them back in future updates, and for no additional cost. Though Firaxis hasn't confirmed when fans can expect to see these features come to
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  , it has stated that the above features are all being prioritized behind the scenes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  's launch probably hasn't gone quite as well as Firaxis would have hoped, but it's impressive to see the developer stand tall and get in front of some of the game's biggest critiques. This one brief statement has proven that Firaxis is listening to fans, that it's trying its hardest to make the best
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  game possible, and that it's willing to support this next entry "for years to come," which should go a long way in convincing long-time fans to stick with the game.

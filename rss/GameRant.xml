  <strong>
   <em>
    Battlefield

  series is known for its intense multiplayer battles, large-scale maps, and destructible environments. The series always had a strong emphasis on gameplay.

  From the gritty realism of
  <em>

  <em>
   Bad Company

  subseries, the
  <em>
   Battlefield

  games tell a wide range of stories that still keep players invested in the game's worlds. While the series has had its ups and downs in terms of critical reception and commercial success, one thing that has remained consistent is the quality of its storytelling.

   </strong>
   Over the years, the Battlefield franchise has been under the observation of many critics and players. Often compared to other similar games like Call of Duty, Battlefield knows how to set itself apart by straying from the classic commercial FPS formula and striving for a much higher degree of realism. With titles like Battlefield 1, which very accurately represents the horror of World War 1 and the stressful situation that soldiers lived in the trenches, the Battlefield franchise shows players the raw side of war.

 <p>
  While some of the franchise's titles have experienced a few negative reviews in a fair share of multiplayer instances, the story mode in almost every game is always rich and full of drama and action.

  As the game's name suggests,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Battlefield 2142
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set in the 22nd century, right in the middle of an ice age. Players can choose to play as either one of the factions; the Pan-Asian Coalition (PAC), or the European Union (EU). As both superpowers fight over control of the last few remaining resources on a dying version of Earth, players will have to hone their survival skills and perfect their aim to win.

  Taking place during World War II,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Battlefield 5
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a first-person shooter. Several individuals representing different countries and perspectives on the war are featured in the single-player campaign. The campaign's chapters, which cover various aspects of the battle, give players a wide range of perspectives and opportunities to feel real emotion. In this role-playing game, players take on the personas of several characters fighting for recognition and equality during World War II, such as Norwegian resistance fighter Solveig, British criminal Billy Bridger, German tank commander Peter Müller, and Deme Cisse and his fellow troops.

  Playing with friends or even strangers should be a fun thing to do. What's the point of video games if players don't have fun? For some, the adrenaline rush of a challenging game is the best part of any video game despite the many offers to buy upgrades, level boosts, or loot boxes to make things easier.

  Whether it is for its fast-paced environments like
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone,
  </em>
  horrendous scripting issues like
  <em>
   Madden
  </em>
  Ultimate Team mode, or perplexing tactics like those used in
  <em>
   Dota 2
  </em>
  , mastering these games can be frustrating. These are some of the hardest multiplayer games when it's time to break some controllers.

   First-person shooters, adventure games, and RPGs are just some examples of the many forms that multiplayer games can take. Sharing a virtual space even when it comes to old-school online or local multiplayer activities opens up some interesting possibilities for video games, especially with recent trends in virtual reality and greater availability of satellite internet.

  The difficulty level of a game is always a matter of opinion, with the controversy raging about "story mode" and other opportunities to turn down the difficulty level of certain games, but these are some of the hardest multiplayer games
  <strong>
  </strong>
  to learn and master.

  It might sound laughable to include Disney's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Club Penguin
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but it was a hard massive-multiplayer game to master for a beginner. Although it's designed for children,
  <em>
   Club Penguin
  </em>
  required a certain amount of dedication to purchase more giant igloos, which served as players' penguin bases.

  Unfortunately, as of this writing,
  <em>
   Club Penguin
  </em>
  was already shut down in 2017. Many fans duplicate the game onto another website, but most of them have been taken down by the DMCA. However, there's an updated version called
  <em>
   New Club Penguin
  </em>
  , a fan-made game that still appears to be standing.

  The original
  <em>
   Overcooked

  had both single-player and multiplayer modes, and its popularity inspired a sequel that takes the teamwork factor and design to the next level. The second game also added some impressive new settings and clever transitions between levels but still tends to overwhelm inexperienced players.

  Any FPS game is going to require some teamwork and planning, which add a layer of difficulty to a game that's also multiplayer, online, and role-playing. When the game was first released, it focused on groups of three players, but since then single and two-player modes have also been added.

  The main draw is the battle-royale environment and the inclusion of elements from fantasy, science fiction, and a variety of other genres. That's part of the appeal of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Apex Legends
   </strong>
  </em>
  for groups that want to game, interact, and create unique characters. Other advantages include free-to-play status, although there are a variety of microtransactions from which to choose, and cross-platform play capabilities.

  It looks like
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  and was inspired by the game, but
  <em>
   <strong>
    TemTem
   </strong>
  </em>
  was designed and developed by a Spanish company named Crema for the PlayStation 5. What sets
  <em>
   Temtem
  </em>
  apart is the higher learning curve, making this game more for adults and those with some previous experience with the fighting pet genre.

  The game is classified as an MMORPG, with players exploring an area, raising and training magical animals, and using them to battle against both NPS and their fellow players. Like any proper MMO, the setting is creative and complex, made up of a series of diverse islands known as the Airborne Archipelago.

  Like many of the games in this franchise,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Madden NFL 23
   </em>
  </strong>
  has both a single and multiplayer mode, but this installment is noted for several basic quality-of-life improvements, like better trading and free-agency abilities. There were other cosmetic changes related to details in stadiums and better animation for action scenes on the field.

 <p>
  All of this made the game easier to play but more difficult to master. The new Field Pass system was implemented with this installment that included a Competitive version for those more dedicated gamers who want to spend extra time in multiplayer mode.

  Especially at the later stage of a difficult multiplayer game, playing

   <em>

  can be a burden for beginners. This complex game has already seen its fifth season and continues to impress players with its sophisticated controls and customization options.

  Many top players have spent a considerable amount of real-life money to polish their in-game characters, so new characters have a hard time competing. On top of that, aiming and shooting using a DualShock 4 controller is harder than aiming with a gaming mouse. The only alternative to it is to connect a mouse to the console.

  <strong>
   <em>
    League of Legends
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a multiplayer online game, but not an MMO in the sense that the focus is on the gameplay as opposed to an explorable open world. This game can be difficult or easy depending on the player's experience with real-time strategy games or an isometric layout.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The game will look familiar to those who played
  <em>
   Warcraft 3
  </em>
  back in the day, and that's not a coincidence. The layout was inspired by a custom map from the classic game,
  <em>
   Defense of the Ancients,
  </em>
  and players choose and build hero characters that are based on famous characters from
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  lore.

  An online game based on the vast
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  universe,
  <em>
   <strong>
    ESO
   </strong>
  </em>
  uses an RPG and leveling system based on TTGs like
  <em>
   Harnmaster
  </em>
  as opposed to
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
  </em>
  That means that anyone can use magic, use any weapon, or wear any armor. It doesn't have to be a complicated multiplayer game but it has that potential, and that's why most players are here.

  The variety of builds available can accommodate any group, no matter how diverse when it comes to experience level or personal preference. Create characters and even a guild, form a party, and start a life of adventure in Tamriel.

   <em>
    Slither.io
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a browser and smartphone-based game. It's pretty simple to play because it's highly similar to the classic 'Snake' arcade games, but don't underestimate how much Slither fans take this game seriously. It takes a severe amount of time to eat all the pellets and get the best score possible if players are lucky enough not to encounter any snake twice their size.

 <p>
  Upon its release,
  <em>
   Slither.io
  </em>
  has seen a massive amount of popularity, mostly coming from let's-play YouTubers like PewDiePie. It's easy to learn, difficult to master, and very habit-forming.

  Playing the game formerly known as
  <strong>
   <em>
    PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds
   </em>
  </strong>
  (PUBG) is fun on mobile, but its PlayStation 4 version is something else. PUBG is a nightmare for a newbie jumping off a plane with a bunch of strangers. Chance is that players either land in a well-known territory and meet twice or three times more skilled players or get overrun by the decreasing safe zone.

  On top of that, microtransactions have somewhat ruined the game among the fans. In the case of
  <em>

  and

  </em>
  Ultimate Team mode, it's almost impossible to get jobs done on the game without either dedicating a big amount of time or spending a big bank of money.

 <p>
  This MMO throws players in at the deep end with little in the way of introductions or tutorials, and that's a deliberate part of
  <em>
   <strong>
    New World
   </strong>
  </em>
  's design. The survivalist nature of the game is part of the high learning curve in which players have to learn how to fight and survive or die in the wilderness. There are no classes in the game either, and it can be complicated building one from scratch, especially for those new to the genre.

    What Are Your Thoughts On New World: Aeternum's Open Beta?
   </h5>
   <p class="display-card-excerpt">
    I didn't get to experience much of New World's attempt at rebuilding its world, but what I saw was honestly quite impressive. The opening sequence feels like AGS finally figured out what to doo with New World's story, and they've revamped the intro to be more immersive and interesting. It's definitely revived my interest in the game, but I'm not sure if other veteran players share the same sentiment.

  For those that want a change from tactical shooters, medieval fantasy, or sports games, there's the high seas adventure game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sea of Thieves
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Not a lot of games feature ship combat and the ones that do lack the same details and features. This one, though, delivers on that front. There's also the option of sharing with one other player or joining up with a whole group of salty sailors.

 <p>
  The game is similar to other MMOs with a reputation for a steep learning curve, such as
  <em>
   EVE Online.
  </em>
  There's still a lot for players to do if they would prefer to emphasize ship and character customization as opposed to combat. However, most of the updates and improvements focus on the combat part of the game, which has been altered to be an on-demand feature.

  was the type of game that was always designed with adults in mind, and the FPS version of the game reflects the same level of difficulty. It's a fast, complex game that includes a large number of playable characters and optional abilities for several different build possibilities, which might be overwhelming for new or inexperienced players.

  Writing this list would never be complete without mentioning the legendary FPS game of them all, the original title in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Counter-Strike
   </em>
  </strong>
  series. Several players even put more than hundreds of hours into mastering its maps and the wide variety of weapons before jumping into the real challenge against others.

 <p>
  Later titles are even more difficult because most
  <em>
   CS: GO
  </em>
  players are veterans of the game, making it harder for newbies to catch up. That makes the learning curve even steeper in what's already a difficult multiplayer game.

  Sometimes players and their friends aren't into the FPS or RPG scene and want to indulge in puzzles or trivia instead.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes
   </strong>
  </em>
  is similar to a virtual escape room, but in this case, the puzzle is a bomb. Players have to work together to defuse this complex explosive device, but only one of them can see it.

 <p>
  The other players have to put on their thinking and listening caps and follow directions. That makes teamwork, communication, and observation skills crucial to succeed. An advantage of this game is that it works on several different platforms, including Andriod, and players don't exactly need advanced software to play it.

   <em>
    Escape From Tarkov

  is built like a classic, no-nonsense, gritty first-person shooter. It has rules that gamers from the old MMORPG world would understand, such as losing all loot and money when a character is killed.

  The setting is the city of Tarkov, in a fictional region called Norvinsk that's currently hosting a war between two private armies, and the goal is to escape from the city with the most loot, weapons, or other valuables. It's already received a lot of positive attention even though a finalized version has yet to be released.
  <em>
   Escape from Tarkov
  </em>
  is still in development but a closed Beta has been open since 2017.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Dota 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is not exactly as hard as
  <em>
   EVE Online
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   StarCraft 2
  </em>
  , but putting this on the list has something to do with how long it takes for one to at least become an average player. It's a strategy-based game with over 100 characters with different weaknesses, combos, play styles, and specialties, making it difficult to understand.

 <p>
  In addition to that, as mentioned above,
  <em>

  is a teamwork game, so players need good chemistry within their group to dominate their opponents. Players can not single-handedly win the game for anyone.

  <strong>
   <em>
    StarCraft 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the kind of game in which players need excellent attention to fundamental details and high micromanagement skills. Its fast-paced nature requires the players to stay on top of their game, multitask swiftly from one objective to another, and gain the map's control.

 <p>
  A quick summary is that
  <em>
   StarCraft 2
  </em>
  is only for real gamers who have a competitive nature. Though it's one of the hardest multiplayer games and difficult to master, the outcome of trying this difficult multiplayer game will be highly rewarding.

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has suggested improvements to the Weekly Breakthrough Research rewards by including legendary monsters. When it was released in 2016,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  became one of the most popular mobile titles, with players still enjoying catching Pokemon while exploring the real world.

 <p>
  Regular players who manage to complete field research tasks for 7 consecutive days are rewarded with a Pokemon with ties to the current season. For the ongoing Max Out season in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , players can encounter Furfrou, Galarian Weezing, Galarian Mr. Mime, Excadrill, Jangmo-o, or Scraggy, but one player has an idea to change the Pokemon on offer to improve the overall game experience.

 <p>
  A Redditor going by the username Entire_Pineapple4732 suggests that Niantic should change the Weekly Breakthrough Research rewards to include legendary monsters. In a post to the r/Pokemon GO subreddit, the fan argues that having a set of legendaries, such as Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, as a weekly reward would not only motivate trainers to maintain research tasks but improve the 5-star raid rotations in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  as they would free up room on Gyms for other legendaries.

 <p>
  Replies to the post have certainly agreed with Entire_Pineapple4732’s suggestion, noting that the pool of monsters in the Weekly Breakthrough Rewards can typically be found throughout the season, pointing to the upcoming Legendary Heroes event in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  as an example of this. The event starts September 26 and runs until October 1 and sees Galarian Weezing, Galarian Mr. Mime, Excadrill, Jangmo-o, and Scraggy appear more frequently in the wild and raids. However, Furfrou is the exception. The Poodle Pokemon has been a mainstay of the weekly reward pool since December 2022.

  The rewards from the Weekly Breakthrough Research aren’t the only area of the game where Niantic has come under fire. Dynamax battles are the latest addition to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , but players have been facing issues when trying to battle the gigantic Pokemon Beldum. Gamers report various glitches that crash the game, costing them a chance at catching the Psychic Steel-type, along with precious MP.

  While fans will have to wait to see if Niantic will change up the Pokemon in the Weekly Breakthrough Rewards, there is still a lot to look forward to in the coming days. With October on the horizon, players have the Galarian Expedition event to look forward to. This event runs from October 4-11 and will see the shiny forms of the Galarian bird trio debut in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  for the first time.

 <p>
  Shigeru Miyamoto of
  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  fame has spoken out about AI during a recent interview. With so many game developers embracing the new technology, Miyamoto has given an idea of how Nintendo feels about it and whether it will be using it going forward in projects.

  Generative AI has already had an impact on numerous fields, and gaming is no different. Some developers have already announced plans to utilize AI in development, which understandably has workers in the industry anxious about their future. With so many layoffs in gaming and overall restructuring already becoming commonplace, some have worried that AI will take over some human developers' work.

  As Shigeru Miyamoto himself puts it, though, Nintendo often goes in the opposite direction of its biggest competitors, and the same can be said for its position on AI. In a new interview with The New York Times (via Dexerto), Miyamoto talked a bit about AI and its place in game development with Nintendo. Miyamoto noted that Nintendo isn't planning on using AI, pointing to the company's history of standing out from the crowd. This is in keeping with what the current Nintendo president previously said about AI, noting that it wanted to "deliver value" that "cannot be created with technology alone."

  It does seem accurate to say that Nintendo is a bit of an outlier in this regard. While not every studio is using AI or even plans to, numerous developers and publishers have acknowledged that AI will or is playing a role in their upcoming titles. A Unity report alleges that 62% of game studios are already using AI, while titles like
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  have been criticized for their use of generative AI. EA recently showcased an AI concept that would allow users to create basic game assets within minutes while using voice commands, showing AI's potential in game development.

  Generative AI is arguably just getting started, which has many gamers and developers a bit anxious about the future. For the time being, at least, it seems as though Nintendo isn't going to be one of the reasons to worry. The company has a history of its games not technically measuring up to competitors' releases purely in terms of things like polygon count and ray-tracing, yet Nintendo still delivers beautiful, captivating, and extremely fun experiences to play. While the company's stance could change someday depending on what AI is able to do as it continues to evolve, for now, Nintendo games will continue to be developed by people and not generative AI.

	 <strong>
		Fallout 76
	 </strong>
	</em>
	is Bethesda's take on an online
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	game, and it is a pretty amazing game. While it may have had a rocky start, players have been flocking back to the game ever since the release of the
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	TV show.

	Super Mutants are people who have been infected with the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus). While they may seem like a side effect of the nuclear fallout that has destroyed America since the Great War, they are actually creatures that were created
	<em>
	 before
	</em>
	the war. Unfortunately, they are the product of the corrupt science experiments that many companies were running around the country. The Super Mutants in Appalachia came to be after a local facility contaminated water that ran through the bulk of the region, causing anyone who was unlucky enough to come into contact with the water to develop the FEV.

	While Super Mutants can be found in various places at times (like Harpers Ferry or Summersville), there are also places where they can always be found. There are actually quite a few places that will always have these enemies, as they will always travel around in packs. One important thing to note is that while Super Mutants are tough enemies on their own, they also have Super Mutant Hounds that can cause damage to the player. Here are all the locations where Super Mutants are always going to spawn.

			<title>Dead Island 2: How To Beat Becki The Bride (Boss Fight)</title>

	<strong>
	 Becki the Bride
	</strong>
	is the first boss players encounter in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Dead Island 2
	 </em>
	</strong>
	, introducing players to some of the game's toughest enemies in the Zompedia.
	<em>
	 Dead Island 2
	</em>
	's Becki the Bride is a hilarious twist on the Bridezilla mentality as players get to 'dance with the bride' on a wedding party dance floor and defeat the intimidating, gruesome boss.

 <p>
	Becki the Bride is also the first time players begin defeating
	<em>
	 Dead Island 2
	</em>
	's crushers, a tank zombie with powerful attacks that can catch some players off-guard. Becki appears toward the end of the '
	<strong>
	 Room Service for Major Booker
	</strong>
	' story mission in the Halperin Hotel. Fortunately, with a few handy boss fight tips, defeating Becki is a breeze.

	 <strong>
		Updated June 1st, 2024, by Michael Llewellyn:
	 </strong>
	 Becki the Bride is a powerful boss character who is challenging to damage, and it seems like the character doesn't ever flinch. Worse still, other zombies join in the attack, making life more difficult for the player. Thankfully, defeating her is a matter of timing and staying on the move. This guide has been updated with more tips to fight Becki's zombie attackers, and another method to stagger and damage the Bride's stability bar.

	</strong>
	well-timed block is essential to win the fight. If players time their block just as Becki hits, they can temporarily stun her. This technique gives players a small window of opportunity to hit Becki with a powerful melee weapon and unleash critical damage.
	<strong>
	 Becki will stagger backward after landing a successful parry
	</strong>
	,
	<strong>
	 so attack her head for critical damage.
	</strong>

	 Repeating this strategy also causes Becki to drop to her knees, damaging her stability and enabling players to get up close and cause more damage when she's vulnerable
	</strong>
	, as the UI states. This technique also comes in handy for defeating other crushers that appear as the game progresses.

	After depleting Becki's stability bar she will drop to her knees, triggering a wave of regular zombies to start attacking the protagonist. Avoid getting surrounded by running to the opposite side of the dancefloor. Use the running dropkick to knock them down and cut them down with a weapon to finish them off.
	<strong>
	 Some zombies can randomly drop medkits
	</strong>
	, but keep an eye on Becki.
	<strong>
	 Use Chem Bombs

	for an area-of-attack effect on Becki and the smaller zombies to slow them down. Becki's team of zombies will often get caught in her shockwave attack so players should use that to their advantage, as a downed zombie can be vulnerable to a finishing stomp attack for more EXP.

	As well as kicking or swiping, Becki attacks by jumping in the air and pounding the ground in a stomp that unleashes a shockwave attack which can knock the player down if they're standing inside the AoE. Jumping to avoid the shockwave is the best method of preventing damage, because they can

	Players who want to liven up the party even more can try causing electricity damage with the overhanging electricity cable by luring Becki, or using the nearby jerry cans, to form an electric puddle trap, or the fuel cans to make a similar fiery death trap.

	On defeating Becki, players
	<strong>
	 unlock the
	</strong>
	<strong>
	 War Cry
	</strong>
	skill card. The War Cry skill is a special attack triggered with the LB + RB on Xbox or L1 + R2 on PlayStation. It allows the player to use a yell that
	<strong>
	 boosts their toughness
	</strong>
	and nearby squadmates, and weakens zombies. It's an excellent skill to fight the Crusher enemies, who are similar in size to Becki, as it creates a window of attack and slows down the regular enemies the player will bump into on their way back to Bel Air.

	A
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Call of Duty Zombies
	 </em>
	</strong>
	fan online has shared footage of an awesome remake of
	<em>
	 Counter-Strike
	</em>
	's iconic map, Mirage, in the
	<em>
	 Black Ops 3
	</em>
	version of the mode.
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	has had plenty of new maps over the years, but this fan-made map blurs the line between two great FPS franchises.

 <p>
	The mod in question is built on the
	<em>
	 Black Ops 3
	</em>
	version of
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	. Thanks to great modding tools on the PC edition,
	<em>
	 Call of Duty: Black Ops 3
	</em>
	features plenty of amazing mods, both in
	<em>
	 Zombies
	</em>
	and in the other game modes. Some
	<em>
	 Call of Duty
	</em>
	fans were even remastering
	<em>
	 Modern Warfare 2
	</em>
	's multiplayer in
	<em>
	 Black Ops 3
	</em>
	, although this project was a little while ago now. It has been interesting to see over the years how players have used these mod tools to bring their ideas to life, and this latest
	<em>
	 Counter-Strike
	</em>
	creation is among the coolest yet.

	The remake of
	<em>
	 Counter-Strike
	</em>
	's Mirage is available on
	<em>
	 Call of Duty: Black Ops 3
	</em>
	's Steam Workshop, although footage of it in action was posted to Twitter by user Faders_. The map is structured exactly as it is in
	<em>
	 Counter-Strike
	</em>
	, but features plenty of added details to make it feel just like an authentic
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	map. Weapon purchase spots have been placed around Mirage, and
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	Perk-a-Cola machines can be found in various spots. Mirage may not have initially been designed as a
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	map, but it certainly works well as one.

	Although it's great to see players continuing to enjoy old versions of
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	, it will be interesting to see what Treyarch cooks up for the
	<em>
	 Black Ops 6
	</em>
	iteration of the mode. Some feel that the trailer for the game has set up the possibility of a Five-style
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	map in
	<em>
	 Black Ops 6
	</em>
	, but the developer is yet to officially reveal what's coming next for the mode. As the first mainline Treyarch
	<em>
	 Call of Duty
	</em>
	title since 2020, the expectations are sure to be high.

	A fan has highlighted a plothole from an early episode of the
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Pokemon
	 </em>
	</strong>
	anime that has yet to be addressed. Despite being one of the most successful entertainment franchises in the world, the
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	<em>
	</em>
	games had humble beginnings, with the first game being set on an alternative version of Earth.

 <p>
	The lore throughout the
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	franchise can be disjointed, with each new generation raising questions about both the games and anime. An example of this can be seen with the planet itself, as players still don’t know what the world of
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	looks like, or where each region is located compared to the others. One fan has recently discovered an unanswered question dating back to the early days of the
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	anime.

	A Reddit user named Rychu_SR has posted a screenshot from the early days of the Pokemon anime highlighting an aquarium showcasing real-world fish instead of Pokemon. At the time of writing, the post has garnered 3.4k upvotes and has sparked a debate among the Pokemon community. The comments in the thread acknowledge that Game Freak only had a pool of 151 monsters to draw from, so it wouldn’t make sense to populate the aquarium with the limited numbers of Water-type Pokemon such as Magikarp and Goldeen, unless they were to be incorporated into future games.

	This line of debate may be the most logical approach, with some fans referencing entries in the Kanto Pokedex to further substantiate the theory. One fan notes that the

	</em>
	entry for Raichu tells players that the Pokemon has enough energy to make an Indian Elephant faint. This description is later changed in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Legends: Arcues

	to reference Copperajah, a Steel-type elephant introduced in Generation 8.

 <p>
	It could be argued that Game Freak didn’t expect the
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	franchise to take off in the way it did and didn’t fully commit to its unique lore. As time has progressed and more Pokemon have been added to the world, the lore of Pokemon has become more fleshed out and now includes references to Pokemon being responsible for all aspects of daily life, including the creation of a multiverse.

 <p>
	As the
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	franchise continues to evolve, this does mean that older games and anime episodes like the one Rychu_SR pointed out become odd relics. It remains to be seen if future games like
	<em>
	 Pokemon Legends Z-A

	will fit in with the established story or attempt to retcon any outdated information.

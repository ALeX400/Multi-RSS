      Some strains like Tokyo Shart with Gasoline are disappointing and not profitable, so players should be cautious with experimental mixes.

      Players should be strategic in mixing ingredients to produce profitable strains, like avoiding mixing Gasoline with expensive strains.

  <span class="display-card-hyperlink display-card-hyperlink-no-vignette" data-id="3449097" style="; ;">
   Schedule I

  is discovering new strains by mixing already prepared drugs with other products. These include items bought from various locations, and the resulting combinations can be valuable, highly addictive, and great for growing the business.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, there are some mixes that consume valuable resources that could be used better in other ways. Not every mixing experiment is going to yield productive results, so players should know which mixes are a worthwhile investment and

  The "Smegma" line is, for the most part, easy to make and a winner with clients, and is often the product of mixing a strain with Flu Medicine. The
  <strong>
   Aspen Smegma
  </strong>
  version, however, would be the weak link in this chain. It's not a bad mix, just painfully normal, and isn't worth the trouble or cost to make.
 </p>
 <p>
  Green Crack is already a valuable strain with a lot going for it, and it mixes better with cheaper and more readily available mixing ingredients, like Donuts and Mouth Wash. For those who are just having fun with the mixer, it's one that players should make just to have in their Product Manager, but it's not a worthwhile strain.

 <p>
  It's unusual for Mouth Wash to fail, but maybe it's because it feels redundant next to the already invigorating Sour Diesel. Both the strain and ingredients here are mid-range, and unless the Sour Diesel is of exceptional quality, the result,
  <strong>
   Extreme Punch,
  </strong>
  is equally mediocre.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mouth Wash is one of the more useful and valuable ingredients, which is one of the reasons why using it to make a paltry $50 strain feels like a waste of time, money, and product. Sour Diesel is a popular strain and Mouth Wash is a great mixing agent, but together they're disappointing.

  Sour Diesel has a downing effect already, which might be why mixing it with an ingredient with a similar property, Flu Medicine, doesn't work very well.
  <strong>
   California Cookies
  </strong>
  sure does sound good, but it's a very normal strain that's not priced very high.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flu Medication does much better with more expensive strains like Grandaddy Purple, or adds a more valuable property to OG Kush, a beginner strain. Flu Medicine isn't exactly expensive, but it's pricey compared to other ingredients available at this level and not worth the time or cash.

  The unappetizing name is totally appropriate here, because what can a person expect by mixing gasoline with anything other than cocaine? This isn't to say that Gasoline is useless as a mixing ingredient, but with cannabis, it usually doesn't combine into more profitable strains. Some experiments might yield worthwhile results, but it's an investment the player should be prepared to lose.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's logical to think that mixing a buzzy strain like Green Crack with an advanced ingredient like Gasoline would result in an expensive strain with an effect that would rip a client's head off. However, in the case of
  <strong>
   Tokyo Shart,
  </strong>
  the exact opposite is true, and players are better off selling the Green Crack and saving the Gasoline for something more profitable.

  It's worth making this strain just to have its hilarious name in the phone's Product Manager list, and to have a few fun free samples to give prospective clients, but other than that this it's not a thrilling mix. There are many other worthy uses for the Mega Bean, and Grandaddy Purple is already a fan favorite. Mixing them into
  <strong>
   Pink Balls
  </strong>
  seems to cancel all that out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The mysterious Mega Bean is an obscure ingredient that players can't access until Peddler 3, which is fairly late in the cannabis-growing portion of the game. It's much better when mixed with high-energy strains like Sour Diesel and Green Crack, and even OG Kush gets a nice boost from the Mega Bean compared to Grandaddy Purple.

  is another California strain that's decent but fails to impress. This is also an example of why players should save their Gasoline for the cocaine production process. The Toxic effect is popular with some clients, but it's a niche interest. Grandaddy Purple is already an expensive, high-quality strain, so it's up to the player if they want to mix it with a strong ingredient like Gasoline.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other drawback to this strain is that it's not very valuable, but the components to make it are expensive relative to the selling price, so it's not only a loss of product, but a loss of money. This makes it a losing investment in addition to being a mediocre cannabis strain.

  Paracetamol is available when the player is a mere Street Rat, and it's readily available at the Gas Mart along with bananas, Cuke, and donuts. Other than Viagra, this off-brand version of a painkiller also adds relaxing and calming properties to cannabis strains.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except in this case, that is. When combined with Sour Diesel, it adds a Sneaky effect to the
  <strong>
   Ultra Slime
  </strong>
  strain instead of something like pain relief. This could also be why it has a market value of only $44, making it one of the cheaper strains. The cannabis buds are worth almost as much by themselves, so it is better to save the pharmaceuticals for another strain.

      <title>Gears of War: E-Day Can Show an Interesting Side of the Story</title>

  The upcoming
  <em>
   <strong>
    Gears of War: E-Day
   </strong>
  </em>
  has understandably caught the attention of many fans of the longstanding franchise, with the game's return to the roots of the series already feeling like a real breath of fresh air. With a renewed focus on iconic franchise characters like Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in their younger years,
  <em>
   E-Day
  </em>
  seems to have a winning formula that could lead to plenty of memorable moments.

 <p>
  The narrative focus of
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  can still be fresh despite its nature as a prequel, because there are many aspects of the wider
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  lore that can be given a much-needed and long-awaited time in the franchise's spotlight. In particular, Marcus' father, Adam Fenix, is a massively important figure in the
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  story, and the upcoming
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  title would be remiss to not showcase Adam's fascinating links to the Locust and his role in how Emergence Day played out.

  franchise's main story has expanded significantly from its first entry back in 2006, with a wide range of game installments, books, comics, and more coming together to form deeply detailed overall lore that might not be immediately obvious to players who are looking to take their first steps with the IP. Most of the mainline story for
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  concerns Marcus Fenix, the protagonist of the franchise's first three mainline entries.

     <em>
      Gears of War: E-Day
     </em>
     is currently rumored for a 2026 release window, with it being confirmed that the project will feature a classic multiplayer mode alongside its campaign.

 <p>
  The upcoming
  <em>
   E-Day
  </em>
  will be set 14 years before the first
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  during the immediate events of Emergence Day, the day that the Locust horde first surfaced and plunged the world of Sera into deadly chaos. Many long-term fans are looking forward to seeing a more raw and inexperienced version of the likes of Marcus and Dom, but this does not mean that
  <em>
   E-Day
  </em>
  has to rely entirely on these characters for its narrative.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Adam Fenix is also a pre-established character, a lot of his earlier story is not as fleshed out in the games themselves. The events of
  <em>
   E-Day
  </em>
  are deeply tied to Marcus' father; Adam was one of the few humans who was aware of the Locust presence prior to Emergence Day, with Marcus' mother, Elain, losing her life after making contact with the species. Upon making contact with the Locust years before E-Day, Adam was taken to the Locust Queen Myrrah, who revealed that the Locust were actually humans who had been genetically modified in twisted experimentation.

  Adam Fenix Has a Close Relationship with Emergence Day and the Locust Horde
 </h3>
 <p>
  Despite Adam's best efforts to aid the Locust fight against the Lambent, his failure to resolve this conflict led to Myrrah commanding the Locust to emerge and wage war on the humans of Sera. This massively important part of the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  story has not been given the time of day it deserves within the games themselves. The plot of
  <em>
   E-Day
  </em>
  could be a fantastic way to flesh out these events to really elevate the narrative value of a true prequel to the original game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wider lore of the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  franchise is absolutely worth celebrating, and with the story of Marcus Fenix likely coming to an end soon, a deeper dive into his father's integral events surrounding Emergence Day seems like a no-brainer for
  <em>
   E-Day
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  should not waste any opportunity to fully deliver on a gaming experience that comprehensively tells the whole story of the momentous occasion, and segments dedicated to Adam Fenix's early contact with the Locust would be a fantastic way to do this.

  There are a ton of different Skills for players to choose from when crafting their perfect build in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  . These become available as players unlock more weapons to craft through their hunts, with this game's system differing from previous entries. Some Skills are no longer tied to armor, having been moved to weapons for players to experiment with. All of these skills can give specific advantages to players when used and completely change the way a character can dominate during a hunt.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, not every skill works best with every weapon. Players are going to want to know which ones work best with their weapon of choice to bring out the best of their build. That's why this topic is here to help anyone looking to head out with the Great Sword, one of the game's biggest and strongest weapons. Here are the best Skills that can be used with the Great Sword in

 <ul>
  <li>
   Buffs the charged attacks of the Great Sword
  </li>
  <li>
   Elevates what the weapon does best
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The core of using the Great Sword is using its charged attacks to deal insane damage with every swing. Charge Master helps with that by
  <strong>
   increasing the elemental damage and status effect build-up
  </strong>
  of the Great Sword's charge attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   It's a skill that elevates the best part of the weapon
  </strong>
  in a simple yet effective way. Using this skill will allow players to do what the Great Sword does best and make it a force to be reckoned with.

  <li>
   Increases Affinity when hitting weak points and destroying wounds

  <li>
   When used right, it can create constant critical hits
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Weakness Exploit skill is great for players who like to focus on landing hits on a monster's wounds and destroying them. This skill will
  <strong>
   buff a person's Affinity when they are landing these hits
  </strong>
  , increasing their odds of landing critical hits through their attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even better, if used with the Critical Eye skill, players can essentially
  <strong>
   turn every single attack of theirs into a critical hit
  </strong>
  . That creates an incredible display of damage output.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Boosts stamina regeneration to allow more attacks
  </li>
  <li>
   Basically eliminates the need to keep an eye on stamina
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The Great Sword, being the massive weapon that it is, needs quite a bit of stamina to be used correctly.
  <strong>
   This skill makes that easier
  </strong>
  by increasing stamina regeneration by up to 50%. This means that players will recharge their stamina at an incredible rate that more or less negates having to keep an eye on the bar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being able to unleash the Great Sword's best attacks without
  <strong>

   It increases the odds of landing critical hits more frequently
  </li>
  <li>
   Helps to tear through an enemy and keep them on their heels
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Being able to land critical hits can be a massive advantage for players with the Great Sword. If a person takes a weapon with a high affinity and then adds this skill to it,
  <strong>
   they can increase their Affinity odds up to 50%
  </strong>
  , which is an absurd chance of landing critical hits.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great Sword is all about dealing out the most damage at the cost of speed. So, being able to
  <strong>
   deal that critical damage
  </strong>
  more often is a huge part of maximizing the potential of the weapon.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Many Monsters specialize in specific elemental damage,
  <strong>
   which makes this skill very important
  </strong>
  . With Elemental Absorption, when a player takes a type of elemental damage, they will receive a better resistance to that element and also deal stronger elemental attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Having a skill that can boost defense and offense
  </strong>
  at the same time is an insane combination. It means players don't have to pick and choose which area they want to focus on.

 <ul>

  <li>
   This is the best element in the game and makes the damage even better
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Dragon is the best element in the game, and having a skill that will convert elemental damage into dealing Dragon attacks is a big deal.
  <strong>
   That's precisely what the Convert Element skill will do
  </strong>
  , which gives the Great Sword a bigger edge than it already has.
 </p>
 <p>
  While some monsters have resistance to Dragon, the element is, by far, the strongest and is still incredibly useful against these monsters. The
  <strong>
   benefits of this skill are just too great
  </strong>
  to be outweighed by the few resistant monsters.

 </ul>
 <p>
  When using the Great Sword, players are going to want to unleash its power as much as possible.
  <strong>
   The Focus skill is great for that
  </strong>
  , as it not only fills the charge gauge faster but also reduces its charge time. This means that players can prepare their attacks faster, but then they don't have to wait as long to charge it up.
 </p>
 <p>
  This means that people can hit as hard as possible more often, which can be the difference when facing some of the game's toughest hunts.
  <strong>
   Focus is a key skill
  </strong>
  to bring out the best of the Great Sword.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Creates more wounds while increasing non-elemental damage
  </li>
  <li>
   More wounds mean keeping monsters staggered and hurt more often
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Hitting the wounds of a monster is one of the best ways to quickly subdue them.
  <strong>
   The Flayer skill will make this even easier
  </strong>
  by making it simpler to create wounds and buff the non-elemental damage that a weapon can do. This helps create more weak points that players can use to their advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being able to attack more weak points means that
  <strong>
   damage numbers will skyrocket
  </strong>
  . In addition to this, destroying wounds is a great way to stagger and stun enemies, which helps keep them at bay at all times. The Great Sword is perfect for this skill with its high damage and powerful attacks.

  Shining Revelry introduced many new cards to
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  , including Gimmighoul and Gholdengo. Gholdengo, in particular, has emerged as a very strong ace due to the unique move
  <strong>
   Scintillating Surfing
  </strong>
  , which deals 50 damage for every successful coin flip per Metal Energy attached. Essentially, if you have enough Metal Energy equipped and get extremely lucky with your coin flips, you can knock out any ex card in play to claim an easy 2 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Dialga ex pairs perfectly with Gholdengo
  </strong>
  for this reason, as the Metallic Turbo attack also enables it to attach 2 Metal Energy to a benched Pokemon per turn. By leading with Dialga, you can stall until you're able to get Gholdengo set up and into play, and then hit hard with heavy damage for easy points to secure victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  To round out the deck, multiple Item/Supporter cards have been included to help
  <strong>
   disrupt your opponent's play
  </strong>
  and prolong Dialga's position in the Active Pokemon spot to assist in Gholdengo's setup. Adaman and Giant Cape help to feed extra damage and HP to your active Pokemon, which can work well for either Gholdengo or Dialga ex, Poke Ball and Professor's Research assist in getting Gimmighoul and Gholdengo into your hand, and Leaf makes switching from Dialga to Gholdengo as smooth as possible.

      The current Epic Games Store free mobile game is Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Epic Games Store
  </strong>
  users on mobile have two more freebies to claim, including a
  <em>
   Walking Dead
  </em>
  game. Every week, Epic Games Store users on mobile have new freebies to snag. This past week, Epic Games Store mobile users were treated to
  <em>
   Doodle Kingdom: Medieval
  </em>
  , which was free to claim until Thursday, April 10.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just like the Epic Games Store free PC games update every Thursday at 10am CT, so too do the free mobile game offerings. Epic Games has found a great deal of success with luring PC gamers to their storefront using free game giveaways, so it's really no surprise to see the company employ a similar strategy in the mobile space.
 </p>
 <p>
  Until April 17, Epic Games Store users on mobile can claim
  <em>
   Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead
  </em>
  and the Astarion's Champions of Renown Pack for
  <em>
   Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms
  </em>
  completely free of charge. For those who may be unfamiliar with the Epic Games Store mobile app, it's available worldwide on Android, but iOS users can only claim the free games in the European Union for now. Come April 17,
  <em>
   Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms
  </em>
  freebie will be cycled out and replaced by next week's free games.

 <p>
  <em>
   Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead
  </em>
  is a puzzle game where players have to build bridges all the while dealing with the threat of zombie hordes. The game features popular characters from
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  TV series and incorporates other elements of the franchise to make for a unique
  <em>
   Bridge Constructor
  </em>
  experience. It's an interesting twist on the typical
  <em>
   Walking Dead
  </em>
  video game, and so franchise fans should be sure to claim
  <em>
   Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead
  </em>
  for free through the Epic Games Store mobile app while they can.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the meantime, Epic Games Store users on mobile will also want to grab the Astarion's Champions of Renown Pack for
  <em>
   Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms
  </em>
  while it's still available. This pack for the free-to-play game comes with Seat 3, Seat 4, Seat 5, Seat 10, and Seat 11 unlocks for Artemis, Karlach, Kalix, Astarion, and The Dark Urge, respectively. It also includes the exclusive Tuxedo Kalix skin, Rumble the Angry Flumph familiar, 32 Platinum Artemis Chests, 32 Platinum Karlach Chests, 32 Platinum Kalix Chests, 32 Platinum Astarion Chests, and 32 Platinum Dark Urge Chests, plus 1 Potion of the Gem Hunter and 1 Potion of the Gold Hunter, which provide players with week-long buffs.

      Xbox Game Pass is losing five games on October 31, 2024.
     </li>
     <li>
      The next wave of XGP departures consists of Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery, Headbangers: Rhythm Royale, Inkulinati, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and Mineko's Night Market.
     </li>
     <li>
      Lonely Mountains: Downhill boasts one of the longest Xbox Game Pass stints out of all third-party titles on the service, as it has been part of its library for half a decade by now.

  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  is losing
  <em>
   Headbangers: Rhythm Royale
  </em>
  and four other titles on October 31. These upcoming removals will bring the total number of October 2024 Xbox Game Pass departures to 10.

 <p>
  The XGP library typically shrinks every two weeks, in the middle and at the end of every month. This most recently happened on October 15, when Xbox Game Pass lost a handful of titles, including
  <em>
   F1 Manager 2023
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Everspace 2
  </em>
  , and the Game Preview version of
  <em>
   Dyson Sphere Program
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Another five games will follow suit on October 31, when Microsoft's subscription catalog will lose
  <em>
   Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Headbangers: Rhythm Royale
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Inkulinati
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Lonely Mountains: Downhill
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Mineko's Night Market
  </em>
  . This is a fairly varied list of titles in terms of time spent on the service, with its two shortest stints belonging to
  <em>
   Headbangers: Rhythm Royale
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mineko’s Night Market
  </em>
  , both of which reached Xbox Game Pass in October 2023. Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Lonely Mountains: Downhill
  </em>
  has been part of Microsoft's subscription library since October 2019 and will hence celebrate its fifth anniversary on the service just ahead of its removal.

  Aside from having the longest Xbox Game Pass stint,
  <em>
   Lonely Mountains: Downhill
  </em>
  is also the most critically acclaimed title from this upcoming wave of departures. Specifically, the mountain biking game boasts a "Strong" rating on OpenCritic, derived from an aggregate score of 81 and a 92% reviewer recommendation rate. It also has "Very Positive" user reviews on Steam, based on over 2,200 player impressions. As such, it has been a big boon to the selection of high-quality indie titles on Xbox Game Pass ever since its day-one release on the service. Its sequel,
  <em>
   Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders
  </em>
  , is currently targeting a late 2024 launch, but it's currently unclear whether it's also planned to reach the XGP library.

  As per usual, this upcoming batch of departures was announced alongside the next wave of Xbox Game Pass releases, which includes eight titles in total. The first of those is
  <em>
   South Park: The Fractured but Whole

  , Ubisoft's critically acclaimed RPG that's set to reach the service later today, October 16.
  <em>
   MechWarrior 5: Clans
  </em>
  and

  </em>
  will then arrive a day later, whereas
  <em>

  will debut on October 25.

      <title>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero DLC Wish List</title>

 <p>
  After years of anticipation,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  is finally out, and fans are already enjoying it. The fourth main installment of the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series had impressive Steam player numbers before it even came out, and response to its recreation of all things
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  has been mostly positive so far. Online and offline, there are a lot of things to do in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  , and plenty of characters to try out in the process. It's a full package that authentically follows up the old fanservice-packed
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  games.

  Whether players dedicate their time to mastering combat or Custom Battle's intricacies,
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  should keep many
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  fans satisfied even after the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  anime comes to an end. The fun won't end there, either, as 20 or more characters are confirmed for
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  ’s first season pass as part of the
  <em>
   Super Hero
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Daima
  </em>
  1, and
  <em>
   Daima
  </em>
  2 packs. More DLC has been rumored beyond that, but there’s more that a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game this diverse could add post-launch than just an endless march of characters and forms.

  For as plentiful as
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  ’s content is, there's still room for more. For example, Episode Battle’s various character stories tell
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super
  </em>
  's stories well enough, but there could be character episodes specifically for minor characters like Krillin or Raditz that focus heavily on
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  's “what if” scenarios. Custom Battle could be updated with more options and more developer-made Bonus Battles. More customization items and an advanced tutorial section could be added. Even
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  ’s local versus mode could have more stages enabled for it over time.

 <h3 id="new-side-modes-in-sparking-zero-would-be-welcome">

 <p>
  However, a really impressive addition would be an entirely new mode added on to the existing set.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2
  </em>
  could be used for inspiration, as it added a Hero Colosseum that merged
  <em>
   Xenoverse 2
  </em>
  ’s roster and mechanics with an auto battler. If that's too involved,
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  has plenty of other options, like a menu-based roguelike dungeon crawl reminiscent of
  <em>
   Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy
  </em>
  ’s Labyrinth, or chess matches akin to an old
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat: Deception
  </em>
  mode using characters with altered stats. The sky's the limit for a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game made to please the fans.

  There's only so much a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game can realistically add without keeping up a flow of new characters, but there are some interesting directions
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  can go after bringing
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi 3
  </em>
  ’s lost fighters back alongside other obvious choices. While
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  ’s canon roster has developed over the years, non-canon spin-offs have introduced plenty of forms and faces that a
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  successor should have access to. Towa, Mira, Fu, Cumber, and all manner of other characters and forms, like Golden Cooler and SSJ4 Vegito, can be found in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Xenoverse
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Heroes
  </em>
  , and more, which
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  would get a huge pop from adapting.

 <p>
  One other common feature in those side games could migrate over to
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  , and that is a custom player avatar. First seen in
  <em>
   Ultimate Tenkaichi
  </em>
  , created characters may seem unnecessary for
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  at first glance, but
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  ’s template approach to character design actually lends itself well to the idea. This would work best as an addition late in
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  's life, pushing fans to return to the game and enjoy its other additions. What, besides the new characters, will be worth checking out by that point is hard to say, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  shouldn't feel the need to hold back with its DLC.

  One of the greatest things about open-world Switch games is that, due to being available on the handheld console, they can also be enjoyed in the open world of real life. This means that players can take these expansive worlds filled with all sorts of thrills while they go on long trips on public transport, or when they simply wish to take their gaming outside on a nice warm day. Even though some of these Nintendo Switch open-world games are incredibly detailed, the battery life of both the regular Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch Lite allow for hours of playtime. With battery in mind, these open-world games are some of the best for purchasing on the Nintendo Switch.

  Open-world Switch games come in an assortment of styles, and a variety of Lego games have also been released onto the Nintendo Switch. One of the most promising games that many players on the Switch have praised is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lego City Undercover.
   </em>
  </strong>
  This open-world Lego game sees the player take on the role of a police officer inside Lego City as he hunts down an escaped crime boss.

 <p>
  Players are free to explore the entire city as Chase McCain, making the most of all sorts of fashionable Lego vehicles to chase after the various criminals of Lego City. As the game was originally exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, exploring this open world will reveal all sorts of Nintendo Easter eggs for the player to uncover too.

   <em>
    Don't Starve
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an open-world survival game where the main goal of the game is to not starve to death. Besides starving, players will have plenty of other goals, such as preparing for the winter months, fighting off wolves, and remaining sane while the darkness creeps closer.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Players may set up their base in one place, but to find all the resources they need, they will have to adventure across the randomly generated world to find what they are truly after. This combined with the interesting Gothic art style of Don't Starve makes the survival title the perfect sort of game to enjoy while playing the Nintendo Switch handheld.

   <em>
    Subnautica

  One of the greatest open worlds that players can explore is Ubisoft's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag.
   </strong>
  </em>
  It not only offers exploration on land, but also allows players to go out on incredible pirate adventures across the sea. This open world is only made more enticing due to all the activities a player can take part in, from deep sea diving to hunting for sharks, which are likely to distract any player from the main story.

  <em>
   A Short Hike

   <strong>
    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

  This game not only has an expansive open world that is so large it needs to be split into separate sections, but also a variety of monsters for the player to defeat to make them feel like the incredible monster hunter that Geralt is. With a horse available to explore the world, players are encouraged to explore, even on the Nintendo Switch.

  By far, the greatest open-world game that can be played on the Nintendo Switch has to be the exclusive
  <strong>
   <em>
    Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
   </em>
   .
  </strong>
  Before this was
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  which amazed players allowing them to explore the entirety of Hyrule and complete various quests for the people around it.

 <p>
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  are this and so much more, as players are now free to explore deep below the surface and high above the clouds. Still free to do whatever they wish with even more powers for them to play around with, makes the
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  a must for any with a Nintendo Switch.

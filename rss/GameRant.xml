  Although some games already provide abundant base content for players to enjoy, some developers go a step further to provide various DLCs for the games they create. This downloadable content usually requires the player to purchase it so that they have extra things to do.

 <p>
  However, some developers create free DLC for their games that are either automatically added to the title as if it were an update or can be downloaded from the store for no extra cost. Therefore, these are not only some of the greatest games but also have some of the best free DLC.

  One of the most loved free DLC to be released for
  <em>
   Overcooked 2
  </em>
  was
  <em>
   Suns Out, Buns Out
  </em>
  . In this DLC, players were given a variety of summer recipes to put together, as well as an assortment of new kitchen levels that use dispensers that have only been seen in previous DLCs.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Titanfall 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an FPS title by Respawn Entertainment that not only had an impressive campaign but also great multiplayer. While various updates that included free DLC didn't particularly add anything to the single-player part of the game, the multiplayer saw plenty of interesting DLCs, with the sixth free DLC,
  <em>
   The War Games
  </em>
  , being one of the best.

 <p>
  Besides the return of the classic map from the original
  <em>
   Titanfall
  </em>
  known as War Games, this free DLC also included a new permanent playlist and a game mode that allowed players to take part in a free-for-all in their Titans. Both of these continue to be features players enjoy while hoping for a new
  <em>
   Titanfall
  </em>
  in the future.

  Although referred to as updates,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Spiritfarer
   </em>
  </strong>
  tended to gift its players free DLC by creating additional passengers and therefore storylines for other lost souls that need help passing over. Being just as emotional as the other passengers players have met, these DLC residents also came with their own islands, giving players even more places to explore.

  With the final two passengers, Jackie and Daria, being added in 2021, the game was released once more as
  <em>
   Spiritfarer: Farewell Edition
  </em>
  , which included previous free DLCs that showed the entire story of the game at its conclusion as well as symbolizing Thunder Lotus stepping away from it.

  Similar to
  <em>
   Spiritfarer
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cult of the Lamb
   </em>
  </strong>
  has added countless new content through updates that do much more than simply fix bugs. There have been several free DLCs by Massive Monster, with one of the most recent adding a local co-op option to
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  , allowing a friend to help in the roguelike by becoming a goat.

  However, one of the most loved updates that added a variety of DLC content was the

   <em>

  had quite a rocky release with the action-adventure title not meeting players' expectations. However, Hello Games didn't give up as it continued to work on
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  giving players all sorts of free DLCs through updates to create a survival experience in space that many players are now obsessed with.

 <p>
  The story has not only expanded, but the experiences players can have within
  <em>

  have also become greater. Some players even feel that Hello Games doesn't need to give players any more free DLCs, though the company continues to add all sorts of content to this space adventure.

  Confirming previous leaks,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Unite
   </em>
  </strong>
  has revealed that Armarouge, Darkrai, and Psyduck will be the next Pokemon to join the game.
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  is a MOBA with a 5v5 experience, similar to other famous titles such as
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mobile Legends: Bang Bang
  </em>
  , in which the aim is to score as many points as possible within the time limit.

 <p>
  To do this,
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  players have a roster of 65 Pokemon to choose from. The game features several fan-favorite Pokemon such as Garchomp, Mimikyu, and Greninja, with Ho-Oh being
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  's latest addition. Now, with the end of the Pokemon World Championships 2024,
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  has confirmed that three more monsters are on their way to Aeos Island.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  has announced that Armarouge, Darkrai, and Psyduck will be joining the game's roster. The new trailer confirms that Armarouge, one of Charcadet's evolutions, will be available for
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  players on September 12. Armarouge will be an Attacker, one of the roles in
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  that is characterized by having low durability but being able to deal high damage to opponents from a distance. Although the trailer doesn't give many details about Armarouge's move set, it does indicate that its Unite Move will be Armor Cannon, one of the skills Armarouge learns in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  when it hits level 62.

  The second addition to
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  will be Darkrai, the Mythical Pokemon from Gen 4, which will arrive in October at a date yet to be revealed. Darkrai will be a Speedster, meaning its main lane will be the jungle. The trailer doesn't detail the Pokemon's abilities, but a leak previously shared revealed Darkrai's move set, including its Unite Move, which will be called Worst Nightmare and will send an opponent into a nightmare. Psyduck rounds off the list and will be added in November with no set date, increasing the list of Supports available in
  <em>

  .

  <em>
   Pokemon Unite

  celebrated its third anniversary this year with rewards for players such as a free Charizard license. But in addition to the arrivals of Armarouge, Darkrai, and Psyduck, there's more in store for players. Until August 26,
  <em>
   Pokemon Unite
  </em>
  is holding a special sale on Holowear and licenses for Pokemon that appeared in the World Championship. In the future,

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise is no stranger to expanding its weapon arsenal on a regular basis. In the case of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Modern Warfare 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warzone
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the Torque 35 is one of the more unique pieces of weaponry on offer in multiplayer and the battle royale. Instead of Sledgehammer Games opting to release another gun for players to master, the Season 5 Reloaded update, the developer has added a compound bow.

  Although not a lot is known about the Torque 35 and whether it can compete against the best weapons, the Call of Duty blog has shed light on its in-game characteristics and how players can customize it to suit their style of play.

  Sledgehammer Games says the bow features "an array of ammunition" including arrows equipped with toxic gas and explosives. The ability to fire explosive arrows could prove useful for those who want to deal plenty of damage to multiple opponents or for those wanting to disable any incoming vehicles as fast as possible.

 <p>
  The developer also reveals the Torque 35 features an integrated red dot sight and the ability to pull it back to increase its distance when fired. The bow also possesses "excellent" mobility, giving players to take advantage of fast follow-up shots if the first arrow misses the intended target. Players have the ability to retrieve the arrows that are fired, too. This is great for players who often find themselves running out of ammunition in the crucial moments of a match.

 <p>
  The Torque 35 is expected to be a popular weapon in both
  <strong>
   <em>
    Modern Warfare 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warzone
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Packed with plenty of versatility and ammunition to inflict more damage, there's a chance the bow will skyrocket in popularity when it arrives in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty
   </em>
  </strong>
  universe.

  The first M-Rated Jackbox game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Jackbox Naughty Pack
   </strong>
  </em>
  , is set to release on September 12. The
  <em>
   Jackbox Party Pack
  </em>
  game will introduce players to three minigames that are intended for mature audiences.

 <p>
  A Mature-rated version of a
  <em>
   Jackbox Party
  </em>
  game makes plenty of sense, considering many players' answers can potentially be inappropriate for general audiences. The entry will be a particularly refreshing experience for the video game industry, which typically sees party games follow a family-friendly theme.

 <p>
  Jackbox previously revealed its upcoming M-Rated
  <em>
   Jackbox
  </em>
  game back in April, and fans will be excited to know that they no longer have long to wait for it. The title will launch on September 12 for $21.69 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, PC, and both Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV. The title will feature the games Fakin’ It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, and Let Me Finish. Fans who already own Jackbox Games titles on PC will be pleased to know that the new entry will be compatible with the Jackbox Megapicker.

 <p>
  Of the three titles in this particular
  <em>
   Jackbox

  game, two are extensions of existing games that series fans will recognize, while the third is a completely new release. All three games can be played by 3-8 players.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Fakin' It All Night Long
   </strong>
   is a social deduction game that selects one secret "faker" per round who must lie in response to the questions asked, while those kept in the dark have to try and guess who the faker is. Fakin' It All Night Long will also include remote play mode for the first time, so players can join in from other locations.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Dirty Drawful
   </strong>
   is a drawing and guessing game that sends a prompt to each player and tasks them with drawing a picture based off of it. The other Drawful players must then guess what the prompt was that the player's drawing is trying to depict.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Let Me Finish
   </strong>
   is a brand-new debate game. The premise is that the title will offer a question like “Where is the mailbox’s butt?” or “How does this avocado get aroused?” and it's up to players to decide what the answer is to them and then argue their position with the other players.

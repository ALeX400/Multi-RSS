   Marais Executioner's Sword
  </span>
  was already a demi-god shredding chainsaw in the base game of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Using its Ash of War felt like you were tearing through bosses with a massive drill rather than a Greatsword. With the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, this weapon has gotten a few new toys to play with that make it an even better deity-destroying armament than it previously was.

 <p>
  Marais Executioner's Sword is a legendary greatsword with a decent moveset behind it, but its real draw is its Ash of War --

   Eochaid's Dancing Blade Skill
  </span>
  . If you tap the Ash of War button, it'll quickly send the sword out directly in front of you and spin like a drill. Your Tarnished will then take the weapon back into their hands and swipe at the enemy once. This attack can be charged by holding down the Ash of War button to deal more hits. Since this attack is chargeable, hits in rapid succession, counts as a dance, and deals a significant chunk of magic damage,
  <strong>
   Eochaid's Dancing Blade has several different routes to buff
  </strong>
  <strong>
   its already high damage
  </strong>
  to reach its infamously boss-shredding potential.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1011} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  However, despite its mind-blowing damage, there are still a few weaknesses to take into account when you're building this weapon. The Ash of War must be fully charged to deal the damage you're building for. This means
  <strong>
   your Tarnished will be stuck in the same spot during the charge animation and stuck in the same spot while the animation plays out.
  </strong>
  Against enemy Tarnished, Eochaid's Dancing Blade will leave you painfully vulnerable if they dodge the drill or interrupt you while you're charging. You could use the fast version of this Ash of War, but it's still easy for most opponents to dodge since it only attacks the area directly in front of you. In PvE, standing still for its attack can be problematic since you still have to find the right time and place to charge up the attack without your targets interrupting you.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":true,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":850,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":true,"countRemainingForInjection":50,"nextBlockCount":489,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":true,"nextCount":1339} -->

 <p>
  Despite those downsides, Marais Executioner's Sword is still a good weapon. If you're helping a friend fight off an invader, the Executioner's Sword can still catch an invader off-guard if they get sloppy. High poise, careful timing, and good spacing can also help make up for the long charge time leading into the attack. But
  <strong>
   this weapon truly shines in PvE where big-bodied, slow enemies will give you plenty of opportunities to let a fully charged drill rip through them.
  </strong>

  There are a few different options to use in your off-hand. If you prefer to stay behind a shield, a Great Shield without an Ash of War is a great option since it gives you the opportunity to block attacks until you see a good opening to use Eochaid's Dancing Blade.

  A second greatsword to powerstance this weapon can also help your damage output if you're up against a faster enemy, or if that's your preferred style into PvP. A Bleed Iron Greatsword in particular strikes a good balance of damage and inflicting bleed damage, which you can use for bleed-based buffs like

  The Madding Hand is here just for its ability to buff your damage. Even if you don't have the stats for it, equip the Madding Hand to your off-hand and use a seal in your main hand. Use Shabriri's Howl until you're inflicted with Madness, then swap your main hand back to Marais Executioner's Greatsword. If you plan on two-handing this Greatsword and investing into a madness build, this is the perfect off-hand weapon to get even more damage out of your build.

   80 Strength

  shine in almost any build that wants to attack quickly and often, it has a particular home with the Marais Executioner's Sword. Since Eochaid's Dancing Blade deals so many hits so quickly, it's fairly easy to activate both of these talismans in a single activation of your Ash of War.

 <p>
  Godfrey's Icon increases the damage of all charged attacks by 15%. Tor all intents and purposes, this talisman is practically a second copy of Shard of Alexander for Marais Executioner's Sword. If you're playing PvP however, this talisman's slot can be a flex spot since you won't be landing too many full-charged Ash of War attacks against player-controlled Tarnished.

      Strategy games encompass various sub-genres, often featuring recruitable units like dragons for added excitement.

      Games like Kingdoms And Castles and Divinity creatively include dragons, either as enemies or as controllable units.
     </li>

      Titles like Total War: Warhammer 2 and Age Of Wonders 4 offer players the chance to recruit and command dragon units.

  Strategy games cover a broad and varied number of sub-genres, but many of them feature recruitable units or some form of unit management. Many strategy games take on a fantasy theme, but, unfortunately, not all of them feature dragons.

 <p>
  This is a shame, as dragons are an iconic part of fantasy. However, although some games choose to omit dragons, others embrace them. From defending against ferocious dragon enemies in
  <em>
   Kingdoms And Castles
  </em>
  to recruiting the dragons themselves, strategy games have been creatively including dragons for years.

  <em>
   Divinity: Dragon Commander
  </em>
  is a creative combination of third-person action, RPG systems, and real-time strategy. The game focuses on building and managing armies, conquering territory via a world map not dissimilar to
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  . Most notably, however, players are able to take control of a dragon during each battle, allowing
  <em>
   Divinity: Dragon Commander
  </em>
  to offer unique gameplay.

 <p>
  Outside of its dragon combat, however,
  <em>
   Divinity: Dragon Commander
  </em>
  is a relatively straightforward real-time strategy game. For hardcore fans of the genre, it may lack challenge, but for players that enjoy more lightweight experiences,
  <em>
   Divinity: Dragon Commander

  is consistently engaging.

  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  games are known for their blend of turn-based, over-world campaigns and large-scale real-time strategy battles. Many of these games take on a historical theme, but the
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer
  </em>
  franchise takes the fantastical world of
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  and combines it with
  <em>
   Total War's
  </em>
  iconic gameplay. There are currently three
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer
  </em>
  games available, but the second game in the trilogy is arguably the best.

  Resource management, elements of grand strategy, and tactics all play important roles in

  Although
  <em>
   Heroes Of Might And Magic 3

  may appear inaccessible on the surface with its old-school visuals and busy user interface, it's a frequently engaging and consistently charming experience. As its title suggests,
  <em>

  is a fantasy-themed strategy game, and it features a large variety of high-fantasy units. Among its many units are a variety of recruitable dragons.

  Though not quite as massive as RTS franchises such as
  <em>
   StarCraft
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Command &amp; Conquer
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Stronghold
  </em>
  is a cornerstone of the real-time strategy genre and, more notably, a pioneer of base defense games. Although the original
  <em>
   Stronghold
  </em>
  took place in medieval England, FireFly Studios got creative with one of its later sequels,
  <em>
   Stronghold Legends
  </em>
  , which added fantasy elements inspired by myths and legends.

  These fantasy elements include everything from frost giants and werewolves, all the way to wizards and, of course, dragons. For fans of both fantasy and the classic castle-sim gameplay of
  <em>

  ,
  <em>
   Stronghold Legends

 <p>
  Many open-world games focus on gameplay mechanics such as survival, exploration, resource gathering, and crafting. In these games, first-person combat takes something of a back seat, being just a way to defeat enemies to continue with other activities. But some games shift this focus, or ensure that the shooter gameplay is fully fleshed out.

 <p>
  What makes good FPS shooter gameplay though? Is it the weapons available? Skills that can improve combat capabilities? Or is it something as fundamental as gunplay feeling natural, well-coordinated, and rewarding? Possibly it is a combination of all these things and more. However, there are definitely some open-world games that got combat right.

  <em>
   The Front
  </em>
  is a competitive PvP survival shooter, that follows in the footsteps of games like Rust. Players compete for control of a fairly large open-world map. The gameplay follows a logical progression, with players constructing a basic base, and then working toward unlocking further technologies to upgrade the base.

 <p>
  The gunplay in
  <em>
   The Front

  is excellent, as one would expect from a competitive PvP game. Furthermore, combat can take place in vehicles such as tanks and helicopters, with multiple players crewing them. Overall, for small teams,

  is a fun game.

  As zombie survival games go, few offer such a complete and polished experience as
  <em>
   7 Days To Die
  </em>
  . However, considering the game spent 11 years in early access, this is not really surprising. This game has it all. Challenging zombie encounters, missions, crafting, base building, and the fun Blood Moon tower defense gameplay.

  Combat in
  <em>
   7 Days To Die
  </em>
  is rewarding. This is not a game that forgives mistakes, and it is very easy to end up dead as a new player. It takes time to learn how the zombie AI reacts, and the common locations where zombies are hidden inside POIs. Luckily, the gunplay is great, and really rewards players that are willing to learn how to play well.

  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  isn’t for everyone. This is a game that can be downright disturbing at times. Add to this the fact that simply staying alive in this game is a challenge, and you have a game that isn’t really suited to casual play. Put simply, people either love or hate
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  . Those that love it, generally end up investing hundreds of hours into the game.

 <p>
  The FPS combat in
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  is tough. Primarily due to the fact that, in the early stages of the game, a player only has access to simple weapons such as a bow. Advanced weapons need to be retrieved from dangerous, hidden locations, which can be tough to get to. The trick with combat in
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  is knowing when to run and not fight in many scenarios.

  Out of the box,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  places the player in third-person mode. However, for people who prefer first-person combat, there is a hotkey for switching the view. However, most players use a combination of both views, sticking to the third-person view when exploring the open-world map, and using the first-person view for combat.

 <p>
  Gunplay in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  is more tactical than brutal. Players need to utilize cover to avoid being hit, only popping out of cover to return fire. AI enemies will try to flank, meaning the player needs to stay aware of what is going on around them in combat.

  Of all periods of history, the Wild West is the most synonymous with gunplay. There are few Western movies that don’t have at least a few gunfights.

 <p>
  The gunplay in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is fantastic. This is another game that drops the player into third-person view by default, but has a key bind to switch to first-person. Quickdrawing an army Colt revolver, or pumping a fresh round into the chamber of a Winchester rifle is a truly iconic experience. Whether fighting AI enemies, hunting animals, or battling other players online, it takes skill to wield weapons well in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2

  <em>
   Fallout 4

  is seen by many people as the pinnacle of Bethesda's world-building prowess. With its great open-world, post-apocalyptic map, it sets the scene for some fun and frantic FPS combat. This is a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously, and this is apparent in the often humorously named weapon selection.

  First-person combat gameplay in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  seems quite simple at first. It isn’t until a player progresses far enough to begin entering the dangerous POIs such as underground bunkers that the complexity comes into play. Put simply, players can’t just stand and shoot in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , they need to think about cover, and the impact of stealth as well.

  Among the many unique melee weapons in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the Frozen Northern Pike stands out as the most ridiculous of the bunch. However, despite its nature, it's actually very effective at beating down anything that comes a little too close for comfort.

 <p>
  Getting the Frozen Northern Pike isn't quite as simple as the other melee weapons in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . It's well worth the effort, though, especially if you're using an Elemental build that focuses on the Frost Vortex effect.

 <p>
  Unlike many other melee weapon in the game, you can't get the Frozen Northern Pike blueprint just by opening mystic crates in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . Instead, you have to buy it from Margerie, the NPC in charge of selling fishing-related items. She appears on many different piers all over the map, but if you want the Frozen Northern Pike blueprint, you need to visit her at the makeshift pier at the beach in the Red Sands region, the one on the eastern edge of the map. It's right next to the Blackheart region border.

 <p>
  To get the blueprint, you'll need to trade 10 Northern Pikes to Margerie, something that's likely going to take a while. For the sake of actually crafting the frozen pike, make sure to get one extra fish.

  One good spot for fishing Northern Pikes is the very same beach where you find Margerie in Red Sands. Walk some ways down south, and find a rock to stand on. Fishing in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  can be a little tedious, but the mechanics are simple enough to keep things from getting too frustrating. We strongly recommend using Dough bait here.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Move your camera in small increments when trying to reel fish in.
  </li>
  <li>
   Don't forget to move your camera up and down if the fish is moving laterally.
  </li>
  <li>
   You can see what fish takes your bait. If it's not a Northern Pike, press ESC and try again to save time.
  </li>
  <li>
   Even if both the line and fish status bars get depleted, don't let go of your mouse button. There's a chance that the fish will still get reeled in.

  You can make this frozen fish weapon the same way you make guns in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  — just go to any Gear Workbench, and check the melee weapons tab. However, you can only craft the high-tier versions of it in an Advanced Gear Workbench. To make the Tier V version of the Frozen Northern Pike, all you need are 12 Ice Cubes and 1 Northern Pike. To make Ice Cubes, you'll need to put some Purified Water inside a Fridge. Put some Dirty Water in a Water Purifier, and wait for a few minutes.

  The Frozen Northern Pike is more than just a joke weapon. Heavy attacks with this frozen fish will simultaneously freeze your main target and spawn a Frost Vortex by their feet, dealing major Frost DMG over a short duration to anything inside the vortex.

  For hardcore survival game fans,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Green Hell
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most challenging options available on the market. In this game, characters are stranded in the Amazon rainforest and must use all their skills to survive the challenges that affect both body and mind.

  <em>

  also features a consistent nutrition mechanic where players need to obtain foods that maintain attributes like Carbohydrates, Fats, Proteins, and Hydration to keep the player character alive. However, for better results, it is crucial that players understand what the

  Since they are not usually found in the game's starting area and require some exploration of the map to locate, Red Footed Tortoises are somewhat rare, but their cooked meat provides a good amount of protein and energy. For characters needing substantial boosts in these values, this is one of the
  <strong>
   best food options in

  </strong>
  .

  These tortoises can be found near riverbeds at the edge of the forest, and their colorful appearance makes them easy to spot in this environment. Additionally, they are slow-moving, making them easy targets for players who can take them down with a single hit.

 <p>
  Like other foods in
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  , iguana meat can be prepared in various ways, but for players seeking a higher protein gain, cooking is the best preparation method. Despite its short shelf life of only two days before spoiling, it provides 28 protein.

 <p>
  Iguanas can be found throughout the forested areas in
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  , but players need to be cautious, as they tend to flee when sensing danger, and their green bodies blend into the surroundings. It is recommended to use ranged weapons or set traps in strategic spots to capture them.

  For players looking for a versatile alternative in
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  , the Heart of Palm stands out as a nutritious and easy-to-obtain option. Harvesting this part of the Young Palm Tree provides 45 Carbohydrates and 20 Hydration, along with 2 Protein. These attributes make the Heart of Palm an excellent choice for maintaining the character's energy while exploring the dense Amazon rainforest.

 <p>
  In addition to being consumed raw, the Heart of Palm can be used to prepare a brew that, while sacrificing protein and hydration, offers 10 Energy. Players can obtain this item by cutting down a Young Palm Tree, usually found in various areas of the forest, making it one of the best foods in
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  to ensure survival.

  The Malanga Bulb is one of the
  <strong>
   best foods in
   <em>
    Green Hell

  </strong>
  for players who need a quick and efficient source of carbohydrates. Harvested from the Malanga Plant and consumed raw, it offers 50 Carbohydrates but also causes food poisoning, making it risky for direct consumption.

 <p>
  Cooking the Malanga Bulb is the safest and most advantageous option, as it retains the 50 Carbohydrates and adds 5 Energy without posing health risks to the character. Its easy availability and the benefits it provides make it an essential food for those aiming to survive in the Amazonian jungle of this survival game.

  Bananas are among the
  <strong>
   best foods in
   <em>
    Green Hell
   </em>
  </strong>
  due to their abundance and easy accessibility. While they provide 25 Carbohydrates (a relatively low amount compared to other foods), their constant presence on the map ensures that players always have a reliable energy source at their disposal.

 <p>
  Their ease of access, combined with a short spoilage time of just two days, makes bananas a strategic choice for maintaining carbohydrate levels during exploration of the Amazon rainforest. Additionally, bananas can be used as seeds for cultivation or as fertilizer, offering continuous benefits throughout the game.

  The Unknown Nut is one of the best fat sources in
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  , offering 15 Fats per unit. This food, which can be found occasionally falling from Raffia Palms, requires no cooking, making it a practical option for players wanting to maintain their character's health with minimal effort. Furthermore, its small size allows players to store a significant amount without compromising inventory space.

 <p>
  Another benefit of the Unknown Nut is its long shelf life, boasting a spoilage time of 3 days. This makes it ideal for extended journeys through the Amazon rainforest. It can also be planted in a Large Planting Box, providing a constant fat source. For those seeking an easy-to-handle and highly efficient item, the Unknown Nut is an indispensable choice in

  The Brazil Nut is one of the best fat sources in
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  , providing 35 Fats per unit, along with small amounts of Carbohydrates and Proteins. It can be found at the base of the Brazil Nut Tree, usually in groups of three to four nuts, making it a reliable choice for players who need fat to stay alive.

 <p>
  In addition to being an excellent fat source, the Brazil Nut also offers a small sanity boost, making it essential for characters in critical situations. With a spoilage time of two days, it can be used effectively on long journeys, ensuring that players always have a nutritious and lasting food source available.

  Peccary Meat is one of the best options for those seeking high protein and fat values in
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  . Found in densely vegetated areas, Peccaries are passive creatures that can be hunted using spears or traps. While the raw meat is already nutritious, drying it enhances its protein and fat content, making it an excellent energy source.

Cooking it provides a significant boost in energy and sanity, while smoking or drying it extends its shelf life, allowing players to store it for extended periods during their journeys. This makes it a robust choice for sustaining life in the Amazon rainforest.

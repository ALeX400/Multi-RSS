  Survival is everything in
  <strong>
   <em>
    No More Room In Hell 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as losing your life on the game's enormous map means starting your next run with a brand-new character. As such, it's important to consider all options when choosing your next character class, even if your options are limited, and find your fellow Responders as soon as possible.

  With each new run, players will be given a selection of characters to choose from, each in a different class. The limitation to this is that you won't know the character's starting skill until you pick them, so this article will shed some light on
  <strong>
   all character classes in
   <em>
    No More Room In Hell 2
   </em>
   and their starting skills
  </strong>
  , so you can pick the best option to suit your playstyle.

  At the time of writing this, there are a total of 26 different character classes in
  <em>
   No More Room In Hell 2
  </em>
  , each with their own starting abilities. While you'll only have the choice between three when you start a new run, little information is given about how these classes differ, particularly when it comes to their skillset. The table below will shed some light on what each class has to offer and give you a better chance of securing those valuable extractions:

 <p>
  Your options are limited when starting a new run in
  <em>
   No More Room In Hell 2
  </em>
  , as you're only given three choices that are randomly picked from the pool. Recommendations could be made on which ones would be the strongest for starting from scratch, but statistically, it is unlikely that you'll have them as one of your options. In saying that, you can certainly build a character that suits your playstyle, whether you prefer stealth, firepower, strength, survivability, or resourcefulness, or you can play with friends that have different skills and feed off each other's strengths.

 <p>
  While these skills are linked to each of their respective character classes, that doesn't mean they'll be unavailable for the rest of the characters in the game. As you earn XP and level up your character, you'll be given another three options to choose from the pool of skills. The key to creating a character that fits your playstyle is to gather those resources and successfully be extracted from the map, so you can continue to strengthen your loadout with each run.

  Unfortunately,
  <strong>
   it is not possible for players to change their character in the traditional sense
  </strong>
  in a run of
  <em>
   No More Room In Hell 2
  </em>
  . However, that's not to say that it isn't possible, but it will require sacrificing any progress you have made with your current character and intentionally dying. So, if you're looking to make a change, then it would be best to do so when you're in the early stages of your run.

  <em>
   No More Room In Hell 2
  </em>
  has a permadeath feature which, as the name may suggest, means that when your character dies, that is the end of your run. While you can be healed or revived by a teammate during a match, there's no option to respawn, so once you're gone, that's it. This also applies to exiting a game early - if you exit to the main menu or desktop before a mission is complete, your character is considered dead and you'll need to start again.

   <em>
    Persona
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most popular JRPG franchises of all time. The games served as spinoffs of the mainline
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  series before the third entry integrated some revolutionary changes that helped
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  stand out as a brilliant combination of traditional JRPG and life sim elements.

 <p>
  These games take place in the modern world and are either set in Japan's cities or take place in fictional locations inspired by the many iconic areas in Japan. This allows players to explore urban landscapes rife with Japanese culture, to the point where they can double as a virtual tour of sorts.

  Out of the many locations players explore in

  , but players will appreciate this limited urban exploration after roaming around the boonies for the vast majority of their adventure. It's a glimpse into the urban chaos present in most
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games before players eventually come back to the intimate town of Inaba.

  One of the more notable areas in
  <em>
   Persona 5 Strikers
  </em>
  that players will love to explore, Sendai is full of charming locales and iconic sights that are faithful to the real city. It's surprisingly big despite being a stopover, and players will love exploring the markets and seeing what's on offer here.

  One of the most iconic locations in Japan that is bound to be a blast to explore in any video game, the glimpse fans get of Osaka in
  <em>
   Persona 5 Strikers
  </em>
  is a joy to behold. It would be impossible to incorporate the entire city into the game, but the sections that fans can explore communicate the beauty of this city's urban chaos.

  The authenticity of this location is immense, to the point that anyone familiar with Osaka's landmarks will find them to be accurately depicted in the game. It houses an iconic jail and serves as the hub for a tech company that brought Emma into existence.

  One of the most well-known cities in Japan, it's easy to see why Kyoto has made multiple appearances throughout the games. It serves as a road trip destination for the Phantom Thieves in
  <em>
   Persona 5 Strikers
  </em>
  and a vacation destination in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Persona 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  that is filled to the brim with highlights.

 <p>
  Despite players spending the majority of their time exploring the hotel in Kyoto, it still serves as a great look at this legendary city and its inherent beauty. It helps that this vacation feels more memorable courtesy of the many hilarious moments and poignant moments with Ryoji that players experience here.

  Fans who may find it daunting to get into
  <em>
   Persona 2

  because of a lack of life sim elements should bite the bullet and give this amazing duology a shot. The quality of these games is through the roof, to the point where long-time fans swear by the fact that

  boasts the greatest story seen in the series.

  For a game that is as dark and oppressive as it comes, Tatsumi Port Island should be lauded for featuring a ton of charm without taking away from what makes the game so great in the first place. Players will become intimately familiar with this location in no time, especially if they check out its visual overhaul in

 <p>
  From the memorable dorm to the Iwatodai Station Mall and everything in between, it's easy to see why

  Tatsumi Port Island is one of the best cities in the series. There are many reasons why fans will shed a tear at the end of

  After being forced to leave his hometown following a legal case, Joker is sent to stay with Sojiro Sakura in Cafe Leblanc. This serves as a soft introduction to the urban sprawl of Tokyo that's a joy to explore and never gets old throughout an adventure that can span a hundred hours if not more.

  <em>

  <em>
   Pokemon GO

  has a history of introducing new versions of the series' many Poke Balls to the game during events. Beast Balls were introduced to the franchise in Gen 7 and were later added to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  during Pokemon GO Fest 2022 as special Poke Balls designed specifically for catching UItra Beasts, making them ideal for catching these rare creatures but less useful for most others. While the Safari Balls are not as limited in their catching capabilities as Beast Balls, the two balls share another similar downside in

  Pokemon GO's Version of the Safari Ball Follows its Main Series Counterpart's Lead
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the mainline Pokemon series, Safari Balls have been around since the Gen 1 days when they were given to players to use exclusively in the Safari Zone. Players can only use Safari Balls in the Safari Zone and they are, in turn, the only balls that can be used in the location. Although the Safari Zone and related areas have been phased out in recent generations, the Safari Ball remains a rare Poke Ball for players to show off and use as a cosmetic option when catching wild mons.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  takes these Poke Balls back to their roots and makes them a limited-time offering for
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players participating in the Wild Area 2024 event. Safari Balls can only be obtained through special Timed Research given to Wild Area ticket holders, and have a rare chance to drop from PokeStops during the event for these same players. Additionally, these balls can only be used during the event and any left unused by players will disappear from their item bags after the event ends.

  Why the Safari Ball is a Double-Edged Sword for Pokemon GO Players
 </h3>
 <p>
  The major draw of using Safari Balls during
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's Wild Area event is their increased catch rate. Similar to the mainline Safari Balls prior to Gen 8,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's version will give players a much better chance of catching the player's desired critter, making them perfect for capturing some of the rare mons that will be spawning during the event. However, the limited nature and expiration date of the Safari Balls means they will only be useful for the few short days the Wild Area event runs.

  Like Beast Balls, Safari Balls are teed up to be a great new recurring event-only Poke Ball type that offers players participating an increased chance to catch rare mons. However, their event exclusivity holds them back from being a truly great addition to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . With this in mind, players participating in the Wild Area 2024 event should take full advantage of the Safari Balls they're given within the short timeframe of the event to maximize their great catching utility.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Magic: the Gathering
   </em>
  </strong>
  has revealed one of the TCG's newest "Secret Lair" sets coming next year, bringing SpongeBob SquarePants and his aquatic friends to the game. The beloved trading card game from Wizards of the Coast has featured a wide variety of different ways of introducing cards to the game throughout its long history. From "Universes Beyond" crossovers bringing other franchises to the card game to special promotional sets, fans have no shortage of highly-sought after
  <em>
   Magic
  </em>
  cards to add to their collection. Now, a certain yellow sponge is making his way to a popular product line.

 <p>
  Since the product line was first introduced in late 2019,
  <em>
   Magic: the Gathering
  </em>
  's "Secret Lair" cards have become some of the game's most elusive and rare cards. Secret Lairs are typically only available for a limited period of time, offering players the chance to pick up exclusive alternate arts and special cards for their collections. Secret Lairs have often introduced new crossovers into the game as well, debuting special cards based on franchises like
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Hatsune Miku
  </em>
  . Now,
  <em>
   Magic
  </em>
  's next Secret Lair comes with one of the most iconic cartoon characters ever created.

  Wizards of the Coast officially revealed its newest Secret Lair set on Friday, confirming that
  <em>
   Magic: the Gathering
  </em>
  is crossing over with SpongeBob SquarePants. The newest collaboration will feature several cards based on the beloved Nickelodeon franchise, expected to include alternate art versions of pre-existing
  <em>

  cards. The reveal did not give any details about the featured cards, though fans have speculated that other characters from Bikini Bottom like Squidward and Sandy may appear. The

  While Wizards of the Coast did not reveal any official cards coming with the Secret Lair,
  <em>
   Magic: the Gathering
  </em>
  's past cards have led to plenty of speculation. Wizards of the Coast has already debuted several creature types that may correspond to some of
  <em>
   SpongeBob
  </em>
  's characters, including Sponge, Squid, and Squirrel among others. Potential Artifact and Equipment cards have been the subject of discussion as well, with fans hoping for references to SpongeBob's spatula and other recurring
  <em>
   SpongeBob
  </em>
  gags like the "Magic Conch."

  A gamer online has noticed what appears to be an oversight in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Free for All game mode, after winning a match in a unique way.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  has only just been released, but this gamer has already found an issue with one of the game's most popular modes.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Free for All has been a staple of the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  series for many years now. With no teams and often small maps, it can prove to be one of the most hectic
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game modes, where individual skill matters above all else. There are no teammates to carry the worst player here - the cream of the crop will rise to the top. While
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  was missing some fan-favorite modes from launch, Free for All was never going to be one of them. It's simply far too popular among the franchise's community to go anywhere.

 <p>
  Despite how long Free for All has been a series staple, the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  iteration of the mode has one big oversight, as pointed out by Redditor AidenT06 after one of their games: the match rankings are score-based, not kill-based. This means that getting the most kills in a Free for All lobby doesn't necessarily guarantee the win. Assists still gather points in Free for All, as does flashbanging an enemy. One player pointed out in the thread that this could be done to offset the impact of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  killstreaks, which usually give fewer points per kill.

 <p>
  Overall, the sentiment in this particular discussion was pretty negative about the change to the popular
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  game mode. One user put it simply, saying, "Free for all should be pure kills, don’t "fix" what ain’t broken." A glance at
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's pre-release material about Free for All confirms the choice as intentional, with Treyarch referring to the mode as the "first player to reach a specific number of points" wins the match. It'll be interesting to see if the studio responds to any of the discourse about Free for All, although it's very possible it just remains as it currently is.

  's multiplayer offering is just getting started. There's no doubt that there will be plenty of new content and changes to existing modes that cause tons of debate in the community. Season 1 of the game doesn't currently have a release date, so gamers will have to wait and see when Treyarch reveals this. For now, gamers have
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's version of Nuketown to look forward to on November 1, which will be a remaster of the original iteration of the map.

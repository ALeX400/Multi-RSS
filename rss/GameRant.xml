      <title>6 Video Game Franchises Where Every Mainline Game Is A 10/10</title>

 <p>
  There is nothing better than discovering a
  <strong>
   video game franchise
  </strong>
  and then playing through all its main games in quick succession, a journey that constantly reinforces your love as you realize this series can do no wrong. During these moments, even weaker entries become more enjoyable, which is probably the primary reason I have fond memories of
  <em>
   Devil May Cry 2
  </em>
  . However, once in a while, the unthinkable happens, and you play through a series that legitimately can claim to consist of nothing but
  <strong>
   10/10 masterpieces
  </strong>
  , at least in relation to the core games.

  Game development is, obviously, extremely challenging, and plenty of things can go wrong over the many years required to create magic. Consequently,
  <strong>
   perfect video game series
  </strong>
  are almost unheard of, and the precious few that exist should be celebrated. If nothing else, they should be played if you are interested in their genres.

     A few notes and criteria:
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <ul>
     <li>
      We are only counting mainline games and not spin-offs, as that would eliminate pretty much every franchise. That said, we will mention a few great spin-offs.
     </li>
     <li>
      To qualify, a franchise has to have three main games.
     </li>
     <li>
      Ultimately, not everyone will agree on whether a game is a 10/10, and there is no purely objective answer. We are going to focus on series with games that are exclusively highly regarded, rather than subjective picks. For example, I think the
      <em>
       One Piece Pirate Warriors
      </em>
      games are all awesome, but I wouldn't expect anybody else to agree.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto
   </em>
   : Most of the main entries are 10/10, but Rockstar has re-released a few versions that are far from perfect.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Max Payne:
   </em>
   All three games are brilliant, but Rockstar's entry is slightly polarizing.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid:
   </em>
   I almost included
   <em>
    MGS
   </em>
   , but
   <em>
    Guns of the Patriots
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    The Phantom Pain
   </em>
   are not universally adored.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Red Dead:
   </em>
   The
   <em>
    Redemption
   </em>
   games are arguably 10/10, but
   <em>
    Red Dead Revolver
   </em>
   is just decent.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    God of War:
   </em>
   <em>
    Ascension
   </em>
   qualifies as a main entry, and it is not great. The first
   <em>
    God of War
   </em>
   is also nowhere near as incredible as its sequels.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Infamous:
   </em>
   I love all the
   <em>
    Infamous
   </em>
   games, but none of them are unquestionably 10/10. Well, maybe
   <em>
    Infamous 2
   </em>
   , although the story isn't great. Still, does that really matter?
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda:
   </em>
   <em>
    Zelda II
   </em>
   is certainly not 10/10. Don't get me wrong, it is still pretty great.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Uncharted:
   </em>
   The first game was great for its time, but it has not aged extremely well.
   <em>
    Uncharted 3
   </em>
   is also very polarizing.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    The Witcher:
   </em>
   <em>
    The Witcher 2
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    3
   </em>
   are nearly perfect, but the first game could use a remake.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Xenoblade Chronicles:
   </em>
   <em>
    Xenoblade Chronicles 2
   </em>
   seems to divide people.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Dark Souls:
   </em>
   If the picks were solely based on my opinion, FromSoftware's Soulsborne would be first on the list. However, I know people tend to love or hate
   <em>
    Dark Souls 2
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Street Fighter:
   </em>
   The numbered entries are mostly brilliant, but the first game is rough, and the fifth entry took a long time to become great.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Hitman:
   </em>
   Honestly, I'd argue the World of Assassination Trilogy is perfect. The earlier games are mostly excellent, too, but a few entries are just good.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest:
   </em>
   Probably the most consistent JRPG franchise of all time, and I could totally see the argument that all the main games are 10/10.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Batman Arkham
   </em>
   :
   <em>
    Arkham Knight
   </em>
   is somewhat let down due to the Batmobile sections, and
   <em>
    Arkham Origins
   </em>
   is underappreciated but not perfect. Technically,
   <em>
    Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
   </em>
   is also part of the series, so...yeah.

   <em>
    Deathmatch

   , and
   <em>
    Lost Coast
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Out of all franchises ever,
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  is arguably the only one that genuinely has nothing but
  <strong>
   10/10 games
  </strong>
  , including expansions and multiplayer spin-offs. If we are talking solely about the mainline entries, then Valve's series is a no-brainer, as
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  are two of the most influential first-person games of all time. The latter is more highly regarded than its predecessor, but make no mistake, the original
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  was groundbreaking and still holds up as one of the grandest projects of the '90s.
  <em>
   Half-Life Alyx
  </em>
  is arguably the best VR game of all time, and it is worth investing in the technology just to play it. While not fully fleshed out experiences that rival their predecessors, the episodes are nevertheless incredible additions to
  <em>
   Half-Life 2
  </em>
  that should not be skipped or ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most impressive thing about this series is just how well all of these games have aged. The first two titles are more than two decades old, and yet they are an absolute blast to play through today. You don't need nostalgia to appreciate their quality, and their brilliance still shines as brightly as it did all those years ago.

 </ul>
 <p>
  After
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon
  </em>
  is the franchise with the most obvious perfect track record, although its niche genre means it might not be the first series that comes to mind. Compared to its sim sibling,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon
  </em>
  is all about over-the-top arcade racing and gorgeous sandboxes, with every entry being set in impressively realistic regions from around the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although each sequel introduces new elements, your favorite might just come down to whether you prefer Australia, Colorado, or Mexico, as the games are so fundamentally amazing that they are guaranteed to offer a good time. Personally,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 4
  </em>
  is my top pick, just because I used to live in Edinburgh and enjoy revisiting the city through Playground's open-world. Otherwise, every entry is equally brilliant, addictive, and simple to pick up and play.

   <strong>
    Other 3D Super Mario Games That Are Close To 10/10:

   <em>
    Super Mario 64 DS
   </em>
   (Still great, but the controls are nowhere near as good as the original version) and
   <em>
    Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker
   </em>
   (Great puzzle spin-off game, but not quite on the same level as the main entries)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Another easy inclusion, Nintendo always seems to hit the mark when it comes to 3D
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  might be the most important and plain-old fun game of the 1990s, and age has done absolutely nothing to dull its appeal.
  <em>
   Super Mario Galaxy
  </em>
  and its sequel are the best games on the Nintendo Wii, and they are prime contenders for the greatest 3D platformers of all time.
  <em>
   Super Mario Odyssey
  </em>
  is like an evolved form of
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  , and it gets pretty much everything right.
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D Land
  </em>
  does an amazing job of showing off the 3DS's hardware and capabilities, all the while delivering an adventure that could rival home console releases in most areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only somewhat questionable entries are
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World
  </em>
  , although the only argument is whether they are 9/10 or 10/10. The latter is probably the safest and least experimental 3D
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  , and it does not stick in the mind quite as long as nearly every other mainline game in the franchise. That said, it is still fantastic and among the very best games on the Wii U. On the other hand,
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  is arguably the most experimental entry, and the F.L.U.D.D. movement system is not for everyone; however, if it clicks with you, you will not find anything else quite like
  <em>
   Sunshine
  </em>
  .

     could also qualify, but I went with 3D
     <em>
      Super Mario

     as there is more of a reason to replay all the entries nowadays.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Ah,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  , an RPG series that, technically, has been producing gold for four decades. Larian's
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  was such a massive success story that it largely overshadows everything that came before it, and it plays differently enough from BioWare's original entries to stand on its own two feet.
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  serves as a prime example that a release does not have to be flawless to be a 10/10. Especially at launch, the game had its share of bugs, along with difficulty spikes that can make for a frustrating experience at times. However,
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  's writing, scope, dialogue, character, player choices, and narrative are so good that nothing else really matters. As long as you enjoy turn-based RPGs, you will almost certainly adore Larian's masterpiece.
 </p>
 <p>
  BioWare's
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  games show their age nowadays, but they are arguably still the developer's best pure RPGs, a statement that is not made lightly. The games greatly influenced future epics like
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  , and their gameplay was genre-pushing for their era. The first game can be slightly hard to fully love nowadays, as it has enough rough edges and jank to make for an uneven experience. Still, it was a 10/10 when it was originally released.
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 2
  </em>
  is comfortably one of the greatest RPGs of all time, and it is the main reason so many long-time fans wanted the series to return.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  is oddly amazing. Have you ever tried to describe these games to somebody? It is near impossible to do so in a way that makes sense or paints the series in a positive light. Yet, the second someone boots one of the main
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  titles, they will quickly find themselves immersed in its tiny world and unexpectedly intuitive controls. Everything just comes together to create a franchise that is largely one of a kind, even if a similar project pops up from time to time. Something like
  <em>
   Tinykin
  </em>
  is great in its own right, but it is not a replacement for
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  , as nothing seems to be able to scratch the same itch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering Nintendo built the series around such novel gameplay, the fact that the first game hit things immediately out of the park was truly incredible, and an argument could be made that the original
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  is still the best. However, all three main sequels fine-tune and expand on their predecessors' ideas, all the while maintaining the same core gameplay loop and sheer joy.

 </ul>
 <p>
  OK, this one is a bit of a strange case, as
  <em>
   Persona 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  tend to be forgotten and ignored. They are completely overshadowed by their successors, and their gameplay and storytelling are pretty different from everything that came after. Still, they are stellar monster-collecting JRPGs and PS1 classics in their own right. If you have never played them, give them a try as they might surprise you.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the third entry,
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  has been on an unprecedented run of success, especially for a JRPG series that has produced a LOT of spin-offs. Nearly all games that carry the
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  name are quality, but the numbered entries are exclusively all-time greats.
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  set the benchmark and wrote the guidelines for the franchise's future, and it tells arguably the best story in the series.
  <em>
   Persona 4
  </em>
  had nearly all of its predecessor's strengths, along with improved visuals. If someone were to say that
  <em>
   P4G
  </em>
  is the greatest JRPG of all time, they would not need to justify it. Finally,
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  helped extend the series' widespread appeal by delivering top-notch visuals, music storytelling, and characters. Then, somehow,
  <em>
   P5R
  </em>
  took the 10/10 base game and made it better.

      <title>Fallout 4 Just Hit Its Lowest Rating and It's Really No Surprise</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  's recent Steam reviews have fallen below the "Mostly Negative" threshold, with nine out of ten being unfavorable. The unenviable milestone is a result of the heaviest review bombing campaign that
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  has suffered since its 2015 release.

  November 10 marked the 10th anniversary of the latest mainline entry in the post-apocalyptic RPG series. Bethesda commemorated the occasion with
  <em>
   Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  , a re-release akin to
  <em>
   Skyrim Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  , which bundles the base game with all its DLC and more than 150 Creation Club add-ons. However, the updated version of the RPG introduced a range of issues that sparked fan backlash, leading to a surge of negative reviews across multiple storefronts, with Steam being the most affected.

  Nearly two weeks later, the
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  Steam review bombing campaign is still ongoing, having evolved into the most significant instance of fan pushback against the game to date, percentage-wise. According to SteamDB data sourced from Valve’s API,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  received over 7,500 negative reviews in the 12 days leading up to November 22, with nearly 91% of its user reviews during that period being negative.

 <p>
  Excluding its launch month, the post-apocalyptic RPG has been subject to two prior review bombing campaigns on Steam. The first occurred over a two-month period beginning in August 2017, triggered by the launch of the Creation Club feature, which introduced paid mods and forced users to download sizable CC data even if they had no intention of using the platform. That campaign resulted in over 18,000 negative reviews but was less severe proportionally, with 88.64% of reviews during the period being negative—compared to 90.93% now. The second, significantly smaller campaign took place in April 2024, following the
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  next-gen update that broke a wide range of mods, some of which remain incompatible with the current version of the game 19 months later.

  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  The ongoing barrage of negative reviews stems from complaints that
  <em>
   Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  broke the Creations Menu, introduced issues with DLC ownership verification, and resulted in a range of other technical hiccups, including new crash scenarios. It also broke numerous mods, which is a common side effect of Bethesda updates that require runtime changes, namely a new executable file. A vocal segment of the fanbase is describing the current situation as entirely predictable, if not avoidable. "Breaking the game on its anniversary is peak Bethesda," one player wrote on Reddit, in a thread filled with calls for Bethesda to do better.

  Fallout 4 Is Getting Another Bug-Fixing Update Soon, and More Fallout Games May Be in the Works
 </h2>
 <p>
  Bethesda already released one
  <em>
   Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition
  </em>
  hotfix on November 17 and confirmed that another bug-fixing update will arrive before the end of the month. Looking ahead,
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  fans may have several game-related projects to look forward to. According to previous leaks and insider reports, both
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  have remasters in development. Their release timelines remain unclear, though the modernized version of
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  may launch first, as it has been rumored for much longer—dating back to its mention in ZeniMax documents inadvertently leaked by the FTC in September 2023 during its legal battle with Microsoft over the Activision Blizzard acquisition. As for
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  , Bethesda Executive Producer Todd Howard repeatedly said work on the next mainline game will start once
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  is out, which isn't expected to happen before 2027 at the very earliest.

  <em>
   99 Nights in the Forest
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game where you explore a foggy forest in search of lost children. It's a great experience if you like games with lots of crafting, but also want an interesting storyline. As the name suggests, you have to survive 99 nights, which is quite a challenge even for experienced gamers, especially considering the terrifying monsters lurking in the forest. However, such a serious challenge only fuels curiosity, so it's no surprise that hundreds of thousands of players have already tried the game.

  The mystery of the forest is not easily solved, so it would be nice to get some additional rewards, especially for beginners. That's why we've created a guide where you'll find all the information about redeeming
  <em>
   99 Nights in the Forest
  </em>
  codes.

  <em>
   Right now, you have a single reward available that gives you a small batch of gems. It’s a simple bonus, but still useful if you want a little extra help as you progress. Since this is the only option at the moment, it makes sense to grab it while it’s active. You can always return to this guide later to see if more rewards are added in future updates.

  <em>
   Blue Lock Rivals
  </em>
  is a soccer game on
  <strong>

 <p>
  One of the game's great features is the ability to add custom sounds for goals and other actions. If you want to diversify the gameplay, you should use the
  <em>
   Blue Lock Rivals
  </em>
  sound ID codes from our guide.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Updated November 22, 2025, by Artur Novichenko: Blue Lock Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   has several new sound IDs you can use, with a mix of fresh options and returning choices. The newest additions give you quick ways to customize your in-game audio. You’ll find everything from simple effects to more dramatic sounds that change how the game feels. Be sure to check back soon, as more sound IDs are likely to be added later.

  Sound IDs in
  <em>
   Blue Lock Rivals
  </em>
  are straightforward to use, but there is one inconvenient detail that may be concerning for many players. To apply custom sounds, you must purchase a game pass for 109 Robux. However, this is a small price to pay, so it's worth buying if you're a fan of this
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  game. To help you, we've created a step-by-step guide explaining how to redeem codes in
  <em>
   Blue Lock Rivals
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
   and open
   <em>
    Blue Lock Rivals
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Look at the bottom of the screen with a bunch of buttons. You need to click on the rightmost button, Settings.
  </li>
  <li>
   Next, you will see three text fields. Enter the code in one of them, depending on your preference. Then click Set.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you don't have a game pass yet, buy it. After that, you will be able to use different sound IDs during the game.
  </li>

  Sound ID codes can be found all over the internet, for example, on TikTok or in guides like this one. We cannot recommend a specific source for the sounds as there are so many of them, so we recommend bookmarking this page in your browser, as we will be updating it with new cool sounds from time to time.

  <em>
   Untitled Boxing Game
  </em>
  codes,
  <em>
   Roblox

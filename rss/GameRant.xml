  Drawing on the success of cleaning games like
  <em>
   Powerwash Simulator

  and
  <em>
   Viscera Cleanup Detail,
  </em>
  the newly released
  <em>
   <strong>

  </em>
  has taken audiences by complete surprise, bringing something new to the genre. The game is packed with multiple cleaning tools for an intensive process, a detailed storyline that adds depth to the characters, and plenty of hidden secrets. It delivers much more than basic clean-up duty.

  Like every great cleaning simulator,
  <em>
   Crime Scene Cleaner
  </em>
  offers players an assortment of different cleaning tools to get the job done, each serving an individual purpose in tackling different kinds of blood stains. It also features higher and lower areas that have their own specific challenges. The first of these integral cleaning supplies is the
  <strong>
   sponge.
  </strong>
  The primary use of this small but precise handheld scrubber is for areas that need a more careful scrub down.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Ideal for cleaning out those niggling hard to get spots, particularly on walls, the sponge is great for going over already-cleaned areas and touching up the few final bits that won't come out or somehow get missed. The sponge also works well for deeply stained rugs that need a more aggressive scrub than other areas might.

 <p>
  With a great reach and a wide surface range, the mop is a cleaning essential that players will find themselves defaulting to for most situations. From cleaning up those pesky footprints, blood puddles and wall splashes, the mop can do it all. Its wide range is also great for quickly cleaning up large areas of dirt and blood.

 <p>
  After a while of use, the mop is prone to becoming soaked with blood, smearing stains across the floor if players aren't careful to monitor it as they're cleaning. But the good news is, the white reticle slowly turns dark red, indicating how much time is left before the player needs to dunk it into the bucket's fresh water. Be sure to clean up those patches of smeared blood on the occasions that the mop becomes drenched, as players should leave each area completely clean to finish.

 <p>
  As an integral cleaning tool for players to use any of the differing cleaning devices, the bucket is where the player can dunk and wash out any of the cleaning items after they become too blood-soaked. This applies to both the sponge and the mop. The tools will turn the water more blood-red with each dip into the water, and the player will eventually need to refill the bucket at certain tap stations to keep the water clear and fresh for use. The powerwasher should be refilled at the bucket stations itself, so keep that in mind.

 <p>
  Adding
  <strong>
   detergents
  </strong>
  to the water allows cleaning tools to cut through deeper stains with more ease. Lathered them up with a dip into the bucket, then tackle those difficult spots with new soapy goodness.

  Those familiar with
  <em>
   Powerwash Simulator
  </em>
  and its epic extensions and upgrades will be all over this tool in
  <em>
   Crime Scene Simulator
  </em>
  , delivering that familiar experience among their other different cleaning tools to keep it fresh. This tool offers the player range, precision and a sheer amount of force. The powerwasher is a great choice for higher and harder to reach areas and walls with little to no error, cleaning up almost every speck of blood in its path.

 <p>
  Like the bucket, players can fill up the powerwasher at water sources around the levels and re-fill it when needed, keeping the water inside it fresh to use. Upgrades can allow it to apply a lot more pressure, cutting through bloody grime in each scene and getting players out of there as soon as possible.

  An integral part of the job in
  <em>
   Crime Scene Cleaner
  </em>
  is leaving no trace, whether that be the broken furniture, items scattered around the place, or incriminating evidence. With that in mind, it's the player's job to pick up items like bottles or shattered furniture in a trash bag as they walk around, making sure the scene is spotless. Once filled up, these bags can be tossed into the truck or onto the blue tarp. Bodies also must be chucked away in these locations, so don't forget about getting rid of them while working.

 <p>
  Players must also collect evidence around each area, from cameras and polaroid images of the murder to lists and phones with texts. Players shouldn't leave a single item that points the finger towards their client. Instead, these should be taken away, dutifully fulfilling the role as crime scene cleaner for this criminal organization.

Thus, it's the player's job to make sure that not only are the incriminating blood stains, evidence, and more taken care of, but also that the locations don't look suspicious to anyone passing by. Furniture can be scanned to find exact previous positions, allowing players to reposition chairs, paintings, and other objects so that it is all as it once was.

  As these things can be easily missed, make sure to keep checking the toggle-on scanner to find where items need to go, ensuring everything finds its rightful place and no one can point out a single detail that's in disarray. Once it's in position, the outline will glow green and lock into place.

  Back at home between missions, players can interact with a bunch of information, building up the real-life of the protagonist they play as. Players learn more about their daughter's medical issues through letters, as well as family photos, their daughter's bedroom, and more. The reality and emotion of the situation sinks in profoundly.

  But as much as it's easy to dwell on these details, the real use of coming home is to check out the basement, using the player's PC to scout new jobs and unlock skills on the expansive skill tree. With varying upgrades to tools like the mop and sponge, or for things like water, players can make the game easier for them in the long run by specializing in whatever seems to be their biggest issue.

  With so much lore to be found, one of the coolest and most unexpected details of
  <em>
   Crime Scene Cleaner
  </em>
  is how many secrets its areas offer. With blocked off secret paths and rooms, players can break down barriers and find hidden collectable tapes, which they can use as background music while they play.

  Items found throughout jobs can also be stolen, adding thousands of dollars to the player's bank. They can even collect drugs to later sell down the line. Other things like lucky keys will open certain things on each level, incentivizing players to look deeper into their surroundings even when they think they're done. Keycodes are also possible to hack, offering good items to steal or story progression inside their rooms. All these additions encourage players to go out of their way to uncover all the little details each area has to offer them.

  Combos Can Change the Tide of Battle in Black Myth: Wukong
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is a very difficult game, enough to frustrate even the most seasoned Soulslike fans with its countless swift and tireless bosses. As such, it's important for anyone diving into
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  for the first time to know the ins and outs of its combat. Otherwise, they'll take the fast track to repeated deaths and therefore inhibit their progress. One of the most valuable features players will need to take advantage of in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's challenging combat is combos, as they can often turn the tide of battle.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Firstly, a full execution of the Destined One's Light Attack combo can deal considerable damage to enemies in and of itself. However,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's Varied Combos are even more useful. Performing a Varied Combo in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  requires nothing more than one Focus Point and the execution of a Heavy Attack in the middle of a Light Attack combo. This is an efficient method for getting the raw damage of a Heavy Attack without its slow animation, which can be extremely helpful when fighting one of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's fleet-footed bosses.

  Respecification Is Necessary to Overcome Some of Black Myth: Wukong's Toughest Foes
 </h3>
 <p>
  Skill point respecification in a role-playing game is typically an expensive endeavor, as it generally requires the player to shell out currency in exchange for the ability to rebuild their character. In
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , however, players can respec their skills points, or "Sparks," an unlimited number of times for free at any of the Keeper's Shrines found throughout the game's sizable world. The fact that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  allows players to perform such an advantageous move for free says something about how often it is necessary, which is something players should thoroughly consider as they progress through the game.

  respecification feature is free for a reason — it's often a player's only option for finally defeating an otherwise insurmountable boss. In light of that, players shouldn't shy away from respecifying their skill points, or, as the game calls it, "Reignite the Sparks." This can be done at any Keeper's Shrine via the "Self-Advance" tab, either Spark-by-Spark or a complete reset of all skill points.

  Spirits Are Useful in a Variety of Ways, But One Spirit Rules Them All

 <p>
  One of the most useful features in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is Spirits, which can be obtained shortly into the game's first chapter. Spirits can be acquired by defeating mini-bosses or more hearty versions of Lesser Yaoguais and can then be equipped and used in combat. Each Spirit has a passive Equipped Effect that can provide some much-needed buffs, but Spirits can also be used to deal direct damage to enemies or stagger them. There are dozens of Spirits to find in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , but one Spirit arguably bests the rest in terms of its damage and Equipped Effect.

  The Wandering Wight is by far the best Spirit in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , as it significantly increases Defense when it is equipped, takes a significant chunk out of an enemy's health on contact, and even briefly staggers them. What's even more beneficial about the Wandering Wight is that it can be obtained fairly early on in the game, so long as players are brave enough to face the Wandering Wight in the Forest of Wolves area in Black Wind Mountain.

  Transformations Have Separate Health Bars
 </h3>
 <p>
  Players will only learn a handful of legitimate transformations in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , but they can be life-savers and tremendous damage-dealers. While transformations can be used to dish out a considerable amount of damage, they are even more useful for protecting the Destined One's health bar, as each transformation has a separate health bar. As such, should players find the Destined One to be in critical health, it might be time to transform, if not just to provide the protagonist with a temporary meat shield that can deal some damage in the process.

  Exploration in Black Myth: Wukong Is Almost Always Worth It
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  isn't an open-world game, but there is plenty of ground to cover and it is almost always worth exploring. When venturing off the beaten path in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , players can find a variety of different resources and treasures, but the biggest potential discovery of all is the game's secret areas. Each major region in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  has a secret area with a secret boss, and should players find every secret area and boss, they will unlock a different ending for the game. There are also plenty of other bosses in the game that can only be found by exploring every nook and cranny, but players need to be thorough.

  <em>
   Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand,

  an action RPG developed by Deck13, is the latest game to be added to
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  for subscribers to enjoy. A little over a year after its original launch, the game's open-world experience may attract a new swathe of players, thanks to its introduction to the Xbox Game Pass catalog.

  Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service that gives players access to a constantly shifting library of games. Each of the four tiers — Core, Standard (still in alpha), PC, and Ultimate — offers a little something different. Core is the least expensive tier, at $9.99 per month, and provides a selection of over 25 games to enjoy on console. Ultimate, at the other end of the spectrum, is $19.99 a month and offers hundreds of titles, many of which are available on day one.

  Joining the Xbox Game Pass lineup on August 22 is

  , the updated version of the open-world RPG that was originally released in August 2023.
  <em>
   Reign of Sand
  </em>
  was a major update that added new enemies, challenges, and environments to the game, as well as more difficulty modes including New Game+ and revamped quests, progression, and voice acting.

  The update resulted in a minor surge of reviews on Steam, bringing the game’s overall rating to “Mostly Positive.” Players expressed appreciation for the changes introduced with
  <em>
   Reign of Sand,
  </em>
  particularly the addition of Ben Starr of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  fame to voice Nyaal. They also praised the noticeably improved combat, wider range of enemy types and loadout options, as well as the polishing done to the early game experience.

  Players can enjoy the third-person game’s immense open world in single-player or two-person co-op mode, and it only takes 15 to 20 hours to complete the story of

  Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service can be particularly useful for indie developers and players alike, introducing gamers to titles that might have fallen under their radar. For a game like
  <em>
   Atlas Fallen
  </em>
  , which came out over a year ago and has a finite story, its addition to Game Pass can replenish its player base. And the recent launch of the
  <em>
   Reign of Sand
  </em>
  update will perhaps give those who already finished the story a reason to pick up their controllers and check out what’s new.

  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  has a total of 41 feats brought over from
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons'
  </em>
  fifth edition, and picking which one to provide the maximum benefits is a daunting choice. Each feat will grant powerful abilities and boons, but the wrong feat can be a serious hindrance. Feats are extremely significant in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  compared to
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  , with some players opting to forego feats entirely, but that is not a mistake players should make in

 <p>
  Across the course of the game, there will be opportunities to gain a new feat at levels four, eight, and twelve, and picking the right feat is no easy task. With such a large collection of feats to pick from, it's easy to become paralyzed by indecision. Playing as a Sorcerer, there are some fantastic feats available that will turn players into a powerhouse. Here are some of the best feats in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  for Sorcerers.

   <em>
    Updated August 22, 2024, by Hamza Haq
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   : One of Baldur's Gate 3's biggest achievements is balancing a D&amp;D adventure in such a way that almost every choice a player can make seems viable. Everything from classes, subclasses, stat spread, equipment, to which feat to choose for each class provide multiple possible options, allowing for limitless build variety and replay variance. Sorcerers only get the opportunity to select a feat three during their level up journey and each one needs to be carefully thought through. The list has been updated with additional information to give players more context about these choices.

  One of the worst feelings in
  <em>

  is when the whole party simultaneously fails a perception check while exploring a new area, prompting a good many players to reload from an earlier save just to see what it was that they missed. Dungeon Delver solves that problem by doubling the chance that a character with this feat will succeed in their Perception checks.

 <p>
  Dungeon Delver achieves this by giving characters Advantage on all Perception checks to detect hidden objects - even the ones outside of a Dungeon - allowing them to roll two dice and take the higher roll any time they come across something hidden in a dungeon. Not only that but Dungeon Delver also heavily counters traps by offering an advantage on saving throws when a trap gets triggered and reducing the damage taken through resistance if even that saving throw fails.

 <p>
  Of course, since Sorcerers only get three chances to choose a feat for their class, picking Dungeon Delver should only be considered an option if the rest of the party is severely lacking in this area. It is a very situational feat that might be worth picking up for a limited time in secret heavy areas with lots of hidden objects before respeccing back.

 <p>
  Managing spell slots as a caster in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  can be a difficult task, so players often find themselves relying on Cantrips in lower-stake fights. The Spell Sniper feat allows players to learn 1 additional Cantrip, and reduces the 20 that is usually needed to roll to get a critical hit by one.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":974} -->

 <p>
  Whilst this may seem small at first, it effectively doubles the chances of landing a critical hit on foes. When firing off Cantrips, particularly as a twinned spell using a Sorcerer's metamagic, this boon comes in useful pretty frequently. This also stacks with any other effects that lower the critical hit threshold, making this an excellent feat to learn to hit harder.

 <p>
  Cantrips remain relevant well into the late game as spell slots are an incredibly scarce resource at all stages of the game. For Sorcerers, this means that they want to rely on casting Cantrips as much as possible in a long, drawn-out fight.

  One of the biggest drawbacks of a Sorcerer is the limited number of spells known. Across the course of the game, a Sorcerer can learn up to 13 spells, not including the 5 Cantrips characters will eventually learn by level 12.

 <p>
  The Ritual Caster feat allows players to learn two ritual spells from a list that includes Disguise Self, Enhance Leap, Find Familiar, Longstrider, Speak with Animals, and Speak with Dead. What's more, if the spells learned from this feat are cast outside of combat, they won't use up a precious spell slot, making this a great feat to expand an already limited resource pool.

  Ritual Spells, especially Speak with Animals and Dead, are some of the most useful utility spells in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3

  . They allow players to find alternate solutions to problems by unlocking the ability to talk with creatures they wouldn't be able to otherwise.

 <p>
  Tough is a feat often found on martial characters, but it is not to be underestimated when it comes to Sorcerers. Unfortunately, Sorcerers are some of the squishiest characters in the game, and they can't suit up in armor to soften the blow.

 <p>
  Whilst it may seem an unorthodox feat, Tough will increase a Sorcerer's maximum hit points by 2 for every level gained, adding another 24 hit points by level 12. This can represent a significant increase to a Sorcerer's hit points and will help keep them fighting in even the most brutal of battles. Though, at earlier levels, it might feel a little underwhelming, Tough is a great feat to take in the later stages of gameplay.

  Taking Tough as the third feat at level 12 means that the Sorcerer will increase his HP pool by 24 points in one fell swoop. Tough gives this class the tools to survive in a difficult fight, even when under focus fire.

  Every time players enter a combat scenario in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , a background roll is triggered by the game using the formula ‘1d4 + DEX Modifier’ for every combatant that’s part of the combat. So if a character has a perfect roll on the four-sided die and has a DEX of 20, their final score for initiative will be 9, making it extremely likely to go first.

  Characters with the Alert feat will get a +5 bonus on top of the roll, giving them a gigantic boost to initiative. With this much of a leg up, it makes it extremely likely that a character with Alert will go before anyone else.

 <p>
  For Sorcerers, this is an incredible advantage because of the way Metamagic works. Unlike Wizards, Sorcerers can frontload a lot of their damage in a single turn, allowing them to cast two Fireballs (three, if they’re Hasted) in a single turn. And if the Sorcerer gets to go before the enemies, they can fully take advantage of their ability to destroy clumped-up enemies using AoE damage.

  Magic Initiate is another feat that will add to a Sorcerer's limited spell pool. It grants two additional Cantrips and a 1st level spell. Players can choose which class spell list they wish to learn from.

 <p>
  The spells will, however, have to use the spellcasting ability for whichever class is selected, meaning Magic Initiate: Sorcerer, Warlock, and Bard are the best bets as a Sorcerer. This is a great feat to take early on, as it can provide a much-needed expansion of spells known, and even allow players to branch into areas that might not typically be available as a Sorcerer.

 <p>
  The Cleric Spell list has useful spells like Guiding Bolt and Cure Wounds at level 3, Bards have Tasha's Hideous Laughter and Dissonant Whispers, while Wizards have the same spell list as Sorcerers. Taking this feat at later levels will not provide better spells.

 <p>
  It can be extremely frustrating to build a character with a specific element in mind, only to face off against an enemy resistant to that damage type. Elemental Adept allows a Sorcerer's spells to ignore enemy resistance to a damage type of their choice.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":11,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":11,"nbrPlacementsScanned":11,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":580} -->
 <p>
  It can overcome resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage, making spells hit harder against stronger enemies. Moreover, when casting a spell of the damage type chosen, it is impossible to roll a critical miss, meaning that not only will a Sorcerer's spells hit harder, but they'll also hit more frequently.
 </p>

 <p>
  This feat is especially useful for Storm Sorcerers, who lean heavily on Lightning and Thunder damage to augment the effects of their spells. Increasing the likelihood of this elemental damage getting past resistances can easily turn the tide of a hard fight.

 <p>
  Sorcerers are known for their charisma, which just so happens to be their spellcasting ability. With a high charisma comes an easier time persuading, deceiving, intimidating, and even performing, so it's not uncommon for players to try to persuade or con themselves in or out of a situation.

 <p>
  The Actor feat grants a small bonus to the Charisma skill, increasing the ability score by one, and granting proficiency in both Deception and Performance checks. If this wasn't enough, the proficiency bonus is doubled for Deception and Performance checks, turning a Sorcerer into one crafty actor who can talk themselves out of a pinch.

  Unlike the Ability Improvement feat, Actor can push Charisma past 20, meaning this feat should be saved until the Sorcerer's natural Charisma has reached 20 to get the most value out of it.

 <p>
  This is perhaps the most basic, and even underrated feat, but it can provide some of the biggest improvements for a Sorcerer. As a Sorcerer, perhaps the most important ability will be Charisma, which will be used for spell attack rolls and spell save difficulty, and Constitution, which is important for maintaining concentration in the midst of battle.
 </p>

 <p>
  Ability score improvements can be used to increase two skills by one point, or one skill by two points, to a maximum of 20. This is a great feat to take early on, particularly to get a Sorcerer's Charisma to 20. Whilst it doesn't provide benefits as flashy as other feats, this is one of the best ways to increase a Sorcerer's power very quickly.

 <p>
  The Ability Improvement feat can be taken multiple times, meaning players add a theoretical 6 points of stats to their character if they take the same feat at all three points. Unfortunately, the hard limit of 20 means that this is not as broken as it seems at first glance.

 <p>
  War Caster is arguably one of the most powerful feats that a spellcaster can learn. It grants advantage on concentration saving throws, meaning any enemy trying to break a Banishment, Polymorph or Telekinesis is going to have a much harder time. It also grants spellcasters a neat twist on opportunity attacks, allowing them to cast Shocking Grasp as a reaction whenever a target moves out of melee range.

 <p>
  Typically, opportunity attacks aren't particularly useful for spellcasters, who will usually not be carrying a fearsome weapon, but War Caster allows players to potentially nullify an enemy's reactions, making them a much easier target for the rest of the party.

  For Sorcerers, the most useful Concentration spell they can use is Haste, which allows them to double their Action points even without the Quickened Spell Metamagic.

  Whilst Lucky is a feat that any class would benefit greatly from, Sorcerers will find immense value in taking this feat, particularly Wild Magic Sorcerers. This feat grants the player 3 luck points, which can be spent to gain advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws. It can even force an enemy to re-roll their attack.

 <p>
  This is an extremely powerful feat, as whilst it functions like a reaction, it doesn't use the reaction resource, which means this can work in conjunction with the Wild Magic Sorcerer's 'Bend Luck' ability. The Lucky feat can turn a devastating blow into an embarrassing miss, or allow the party to drive the final nail in the coffin for any tedious foes.

      <title>Roblox: Rob the Place Codes (August 2024)</title>

 <p>
  <em>
   Rob the Place
  </em>
  is one of the representatives of the robbery simulators on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Therefore, here, players have to stealthily rob a store, avoiding the guard. However, at first, it is quite difficult, since without upgrades, your character is very weak. Fortunately, this can be quickly fixed with the help of
  <em>
   Rob the Place
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":331} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: featured video below first paragraph! -->
 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: mid intro! -->
 <p>
  Using codes, players can get extra money in this
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  experience. This will significantly speed up your progress. However, over time, codes expire, so you should hurry to use them while they are still active.

 <p>
  At first glance, it may seem that
  <em>
   Rob the Place
  </em>
  gameplay is quite simple. But even though there is only one guard, stealing without catching his eye is a real challenge. This is especially true at the very beginning, when your character can only wear one item and does everything slowly. To fix this, you need to steal one item at a time and sell them. Alternatively, you can use
  <em>
   Rob the Place
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1016} -->

 <p>
  As we said, these codes are a great source of free currency. Some of them can reward you with up to 400 Cash. This is enough to buy good accessories, as well as unlock several rat pets. However, after a certain time, the codes expire and the rewards become no longer available. So, you should use them as quickly as possible.

      <title>Wuthering Waves: Youhu Team Composition Guide</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/wuthering-waves-wuwa-youhu-team-comp-composition/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Youhu is a versatile 4-star character in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  , capable of fulfilling both the healer and sub-DPS roles, making her a flexible choice for a variety of team compositions. Her playstyle revolves around gathering Antiques via RNG mechanics and strategically locking them in place to maximize benefits, all while dealing consistent Glacio DMG. With the ability to heal the entire team and boost her own damage, she fits seamlessly into teams that need sustain or a hybrid DPS option. Her Resonance Forte allows players to unlock multiple buffs by matching Antiques, which adds depth to her gameplay, rewarding thoughtful decision-making and well-timed basic attacks.

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: below first paragraph! -->
 <p>
  Any team in need of a healer or sub-DPS in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  can essentially benefit from Youhu, especially if the team includes characters that rely on coordinated ATK buffs, such as Mortefi, Yuanwu, Zhezhi, or Yinlin. Youhu’s Outro Skill complements these characters perfectly by boosting the coordinated attack DMG by 100% for an extended duration. As such, as long as players know how to play Youhu, she can be a formidable sustain or sub-DPS for many teams, with the below teams being additionally synergetic with her.

 <p>
  Undoubtedly, Zhezhi is one of the most synergistic units for Youhu, as she is one of the few characters who can fully capitalize on Youhu’s Outro Skill coordinated attack buff. On the flip side, Zhezhi is an excellent teammate for Jinhsi, thanks to her coordinated attacks, which help build up Jinhsi's Incandescence stacks more quickly. This trio forms a team with strong synergy and high damage potential. It's important to note that since Youhu herself doesn’t have coordinated attacks, having two Glacio element units on the team doesn't pose a problem for stack accumulation, making this combination both viable and efficient.

 <p>
  For players who prefer to have Youhu on the field more often, Yuanwu can be a more F2P-friendly alternative to Zhezhi. Yuanwu still ensures that Jinhsi’s stacks accumulate quickly while allowing Youhu to boost Yuanwu’s damage. This setup is easier to maintain and provides solid synergy, particularly for those focusing on maximizing Youhu's on-field presence while maintaining strong support for the team's overall damage output.

 <p>
  Another excellent ally who can make full use of coordinated attack damage is Yinlin. For players seeking highly synergistic team members, Xiangli Yao is one of the best contenders, as both are Electro characters. Additionally, Yinlin's Outro Skill further buffs Xiangli Yao’s Electro DMG and Resonance Liberation DMG, making this duo a key part of one of the most ideal and synergistic trios available. This setup doesn’t require heavy investment either, especially considering Xiangli Yao has been obtainable as a strong 5-star character for free.

 <p>
  Players fortunate enough to have already obtained Yinlin should definitely try out this team composition, especially for challenging content like the Tower of Adversity, where eliminating enemies quickly is crucial, and maximizing DPS in a short period is highly valued. This trio, with its balance of burst damage, coordinated attacks, and a healer that can also deal significant DMG, can excel in situations that demand fast and efficient damage output against challenging enemies.

 <p>
  Jiyan and Mortefi were two of the most sought-after units at the launch of
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , with Jiyan debuting as the first limited main DPS unit. Although his popularity may have waned over time due to the growing roster, Jiyan remains a formidable DPS unit, especially when paired with Mortefi, who continues to be his best sub-DPS ally. Mortefi excels not only in providing coordinated attacks—ideal for fast attackers like Jiyan—but also in boosting overall damage output even when he's not the active character on the field. Moreover, Mortefi’s Outro Skill enhances heavy attacks, which aligns perfectly with Jiyan’s Teal Dragon state during Resonance Liberation, where all his attacks become heavy attacks. When built correctly, Mortefi significantly boosts Jiyan’s overall damage, making him an indispensable ally.

 <p>
  With Youhu’s addition to the roster, this synergy is further amplified. She can buff Mortefi, increasing his damage output while also providing much-needed sustain to the team. This results in a well-balanced composition where switching to the right character at the right time becomes crucial for maximizing damage and survivability. The dynamic between Jiyan as the main DPS, Mortefi as the sub-DPS and buffer, and Youhu as the healer, sub-DPS, and buffer, offers players a highly rewarding playstyle, especially for those who enjoy strategic team rotations with a focus on outro skills.

 <p>
  The launch of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  is now just around the corner, with Treyarch having already given fans a solid impression of what to expect from the title. With the game reportedly being in development for four years, huge amounts of expectations are being placed on the campaign, core multiplayer, and Zombies modes for the project. Treyarch has also been vocal about the supposed return to classic gameplay that this new iteration of Zombies is attempting to capture, putting even more pressure on the survival mode.

 <p>
  The currently confirmed maps for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies have already been met with mixed reactions by the game's community, with the title seemingly still having reservations about what kind of experience
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  Zombies should provide at its core. While the post-launch maps of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies will be extremely important for the mode's success, the seasonal content aimed at Zombies will likely be its lifeblood.

 <p>
  One of the main appeals of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies is its return to the classic round-based formula that made the mode so iconic, moving further away from the controversial open-world Outbreak formula of more recent
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  titles. This has been complimented by the return of a core cast of playable Zombies characters, with many fans praising the respect that Treyarch is paying towards some fan-favorite past Zombies iterations.

 <p>
  This perspective was somewhat hindered by the reveal of Liberty Falls, one of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's two launch Zombies maps, with this particular experience seeming much more in line with the divisive elements of Outbreak Zombies. Of course, more maps will be added to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies throughout the game's post-launch life, but more will need to be done to supplement the mode in between these massive additions.

 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  has firmly entrenched itself in the live-service seasonal content approach of many modern games, with new content being periodically added to its core multiplayer and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  modes every couple of months or so. While it is fairly common for these multiplayer seasons to introduce new 6v6 maps for
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  's core multiplayer, the more intricate and larger maps associated with Zombies cannot be released with this kind of rapid turnaround.

  Limited-time Modes Could Be the Key To Keeping Black Ops 6's Zombies Fresh

 <p>
  This puts Zombies in the unique live-service position of having to rely on other content to keep fans engaged between the massively anticipated release of new maps, and this content will be extremely important in shaping the overall legacy of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies. To boost the content in between map releases,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Zombies should lean more heavily into limited-time modes for Zombies, with a focus on bringing back some fan-favorite past experiences.

 <p>
  The Grief game mode from
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  's Zombies is one example of a mode that could periodically return for
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , which saw teams of players hinder and outlast their opponents in a range of Zombies locations. Grief was originally intended to return in
  <em>
   Black Ops 4
  </em>
  before being scrapped, and the special place it holds in the history of
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  Zombies makes it the perfect match for Treyarch's approach to more classic gameplay. More limited-time modes can recontextualize pre-existing maps and make them feel fresh in the downtime between new maps, and Treyarch should pay real attention to this for the seasonal Zombies content of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  .

  Zacian (Hero of Many Battles) is a 5-Star Raid Boss, and winning the Raid can reward a Shiny Zacian (Hero of Many Battles). It is a Legendary Pokemon with amazing stats, solidifying its spot among the game’s powerhouses. Such ultimate battle prowess make it hard to defeat without proper Raid counters.

 <p>
  There are two different variants of Zacian: Hero of Many Battles (HMB) and Crowned Sword. Both of these variants are Shiny compatible but are among some of the rarest encounters in the game. Since the Shiny Zacian (HMB) is coming as a Raid clearance reward, you must first strategize powerful counters to ensure victory. That said, this guide explores the best way to get Shiny Zacian in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO

  Zacian is a Legendary monster, and it is a challenging task to encounter a Legendary Shiny. You must win several Zacian (HMB) Raids and encounter numerous Zacian (HMB) to match the monster’s Shiny odds.
  <strong>
   Zacian’s (HMB) maximum CP of 4329
  </strong>
  gets a significant boost as a Legendary Raid Boss, making it a dangerous existence.
  <strong>
   Avoid attempting the Zacian Raids solo
  </strong>
  and team up with other players to ensure victory.

  Zacian (HMB) exhibits notable power as a Legendary Raid Boss, and defeating it requires proper meta-knowledge. After studying the monster's meta, you must prepare a relevant counter roster to win against Zacian (HMB) in Raids. Make sure that the Zacian Raid Counters have the Same Type of Attack Bonus (STAB) potential attacks aligned with Zacian's type-weaknesses,

  The version 2.5 update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  is packed with fresh content, including the strongest Hunt character to date, and the thrilling climax to the latest Trailblaze Continuance story. It also dropped some new Planar Ornaments: Lushaka, the Sunken Seas, and The Wondrous BananAmusement Park. While they did release with Feixiao, these sets aren’t for her. Instead, they’ll buff some existing team comps. It looks like they’re a sign of what’s to come for the game’s meta, too.

  Some relics and planar ornaments in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  hint at future character and team archetypes. For example, Feixiao’s best-in-slot Relic and Planar Sets: The Wind-Soaring Valorous and Duran, Dynasty of Running Wolves. These items offer optimal boosts to her CRIT DMG, CRIT Rate, and Ultimate DMG as a complete set. They were introduced to the game two major patches before Feixiao’s release. Harmony Trailblazer’s break effect-focused Watchmaker, Master of Dream Machinations set also dropped two updates before they were introduced to the game. As such, it’s interesting to see what
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  2.5’s new Planars could inform about upcoming character or team archetypes.

  The Wondrous BananAmusement Park is the more intriguing set of the
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  2.5 Planar releases because it offers 16% CRIT DMG off the bat and an additional 32% when the wearer’s summon is on the field. Two existing units can utilize this effect well:

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Topaz and Numby:
   </strong>
   The Wondrous BananAmusement Park set is excellent for this duo because Numby benefits from every offensive stat boost that Topaz gets. With this set’s massive Crit DMG boost and a further increase using Topaz’s ult, the Trotter will hit harder than before.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Jing Yuan:
   </strong>
   Lightning Lord also scales from whatever stat buff that Jing Yuan gets. The Dozing General has fallen off the meta as of late, but this new set’s massive CRIT DMG boosts could give him the extra push to be more relevant again, especially in AOE-focused game modes like

  How a New Summon Character Can Make the Most of The Wondrous BananAmusement Park
 </h3>
 <p>
  While Topaz will enjoy some good stat boosts from this new set, she’s better played as a support unit rather than a main DPS. Jing Yuan and Topaz also have their damage backloaded because they often have to wait for their summons to make their move. Players will often have to plan and time their buffs and debuffs to get the most out of Numby and Lightning Lord’s turns.

 <p>
  Topaz can advance Numby through her skill and Talent, albeit with special conditions. Perhaps the future Wondrous BananAmusement Park user could have a simpler way to frontload their summon’s action like through an ultimate or skill. This way, they can dish out big damage using the set’s CRIT DMG boost with more control and consistency.

  How Lushaka, the Sunken Seas Benefits Existing and Future Supports
 </h3>
 <p>
  Lushaka, the Sunken Seas doesn’t seem to point to features of any new units, as it offers universally useful buffs. It could be a great asset for Support and Sustain units that rely on activating their impactful ults as often as possible. This set offers an unconditional 5% energy regeneration rate increase, which is helpful for ultimate rotation. It also provides a 12% ATK boost for an ally character who is the first unit in the lineup. These effects make the set an excellent choice for
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail'
  </em>
  s hypercarry teams with supports like Ruan Mei, Robin, or Sparkle paired with solo damage units like Acheron or Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae.

 <p>

  2.5’s new Planars could be the best-in-slot sets for a future summon DPS and a new support that enables them. Judging by the timelines from previous patches, such units could come as early as patch 2.7. If this isn’t the case, then these items are a welcome option for players who want more build choices for their Topaz, Jing Yuan, Ruan Mei, Sparkle, or Silver Wolf.

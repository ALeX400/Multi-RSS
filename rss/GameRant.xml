  A talented
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan online has created an awesome oil painting of the Red Rocket gas station, depicting it as it appears at the beginning of Bethesda's RPG. Most players will encounter the Red Rocket early in their
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  adventure, making it one of the most recognizable areas from the game.

  Despite being released almost a decade ago,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  retains an extremely dedicated fanbase online. The game's community continues to play Bethesda's 2015 title, with many using mods to bring it back up to modern standards in its visuals and gameplay. The fact that players still continue to play is impressive, highlighting their love for the game. This dedication often translates to fan tributes online, which arrive in various ways. For example, one creative
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  fan made their own LEGO power armor set, finding a unique way to bring the series into their real life.

  Redditor artace shared their awesome
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  artwork with the game's community online, depicting the Red Rocket gas station as it appears in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . The details here are incredible, showcasing the first meeting between the Sole Survivor and Dogmeat. Even the colors used perfectly match the color grading seen in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  - it's subtle but it makes all the difference. According to the user, this is an oil painting on canvas, which really adds to the texture of the piece.

 <p>
  For most
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  players, the Red Rocket gas station is a location they'll stumble across very early in the game. Bethesda designed the game world in a way that tends to lead players in that direction after leaving Sanctuary, meaning it's very difficult to miss. Crucially, it's also where players encounter Dogmeat for the first time, giving players the chance to bring the canine companion along on the adventure. Because of this, it's a popular location for fans of the game, who have paid tribute to it over the years in tons of interesting ways. There was even one
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  player who created a LEGO version of the Red Rocket gas station.

 <p>
  While gamers are continuing to enjoy
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , it's a shame that it seems the wait for a sequel will rage on for a while yet. It's known that Bethesda wants to release games at a quicker rate, although it seems at the moment, there is no plan to diverge from its current plan of actively developing one game at a time. Right now, that game is
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  , meaning
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  is likely on the backburner for now. Some fans would like to see Bethesda take a
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  approach, allowing another studio to take a stab at the IP until it's ready to develop the next mainline entry. However, this seems unlikely at this point.

  Remix is a nostalgic trip to the past, bringing players back to the Chapter 2 island for a limited time, but with a twist. As players drop from the battle bus in the ultimate Battle Royale of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , they can actually find a few familiar faces that can be challenged and bested to claim powerful and exclusive loot, as well as a new ally.

  The Doggpound is the POI found at the center of the Chapter 2 island, and while it replaces The Agency, it still has all the charm of the original, with the added cool factor of Snoop Dogg. The Doggpound houses none other than D-O-Double-G, but don't be fooled by his great music, since this hostile boss will attack on sight.

 <p>
  Snoop Dogg utilizes Stink Bombs and Snoop Dogg's Drum Gun to fight players, but those daring enough to battle him will be rewarded with Dogg's company, joining the player as an unwavering and loyal ally. The Doggpound is a hot spot for action considering its central location on the map, so try to be careful when dropping here.

  The Yacht is found at the top right corner of the Remix map, and inside players can find Meowdas himself, who will purr and hiss his way to victory. That is unless players have weaponry that can rival Meowdas' Peow Peow Rifle. Meowdas also throws some Chug Splashes to help himself and his allies, and players can be that ally if they manage to take Meowdas down.

 <p>
  Meowdas usually roams the bottom deck of the Yacht, so try to be careful when patrolling this area and bring some useful weaponry, since Meowdas isn't going to go down without a fight, and his army of goons will take as many bullets as it takes for their golden kitty boss.

  The very bottom left of the Remix map houses the Rig, a giant oil rig where Dynamo TNTina has made her home. It's a large open space surrounded by a body of water, so players are going to want to drop here from the battle bus and prepare for war against other players brave enough to drop in this desolate location.

  Dynamo TNTina has a few agents by her side, and she uses a Ka-Boom bow as well as some Grenades to make for an explosive arsenal. Keep to cover and watch out for rogue players who want to claim her company and her loot.

  The
  <em>
   Life and Death
  </em>
  expansion pack for
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings players a unique look at a soul’s journey, from living a fulfilling life to embarking on the final stages of death, introducing funeral events, enhanced ghost mastery abilities, and even options for rebirth. Central to these themes are the two new career paths: Reaper and Undertaker. The Undertaker is a traditional career that progresses through standard work hours, while the Reaper career is an active one, similar to the Scientist or Doctor careers. With the Reaper career, players accompany their Sims to work, guiding them through tasks that contribute to their performance rating, ultimately affecting promotion opportunities.

  Unlike many other careers, the
  <em>
   Reaper
  </em>
  role does not branch into separate paths; instead, it intensifies in complexity as Sims progresses, presenting new and intriguing daily tasks. Skills such as
  <em>
   Thanatology
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fitness
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Charisma
  </em>
  play an essential role in advancing through the ranks. Notably, Reapers must also help souls transition to the netherworld to earn promotions, and they face a unique weekly quota of 25 souls. Meeting this quota grants access to
  <em>
   Grim’s Box
  </em>
  , an exclusive reward. Here's an overview of each career level, skill requirements, tasks, and all the essentials players need to master the Reaper career.

  Starting the Reaper career in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  is as straightforward as any other job—players can initiate it by selecting Find a Job to access the career selection menu. Occasionally, however, the Grim Reaper himself may also call Sims to join the ranks of the Reapers. While there are no prerequisites to get started, the career’s darker nature makes it an ideal choice for Sims with the
  <strong>
   Macabre
  </strong>
  trait, as these Sims are naturally more inclined to work with the afterlife and will have less debuffs from being near death.
  <strong>
   Focused
  </strong>
  moodlet is also ideal when performing tasks.

  Upon beginning their journey as a “Grimtern,” Sims will need to attend two days of active duty, during which they’ll get a hands-on tutorial that covers the essentials of reaper tasks, preparing them for a successful career. The first day will take players through the usual reaping tasks, including some pre-travel and post-return tasks to be able to complete the reaping procedures.

  Sims may need to complete a certain number of tasks before they can actually travel and reap souls. They are relatively straightforward, but should be done as soon as possible so that players have enough time to deal with the tasks as they travel or come back from the reaping. They include:

  As Sims progress through the
  <em>
   Reaper
  </em>
  career, their cases increase in complexity, requiring a variety of tasks before they can successfully collect souls and complete the on-site portion of their workday. At lower career levels, Sims might be assigned to collect just 1-2 souls per day, but as they advance, the number can rise to 4-5 souls (especially with certain emergencies which also allow Sims to skip the pre-travel tasks all together, such as the Cowplant Emergency, or Laughter Disaster), which is helpful for meeting Grim's weekly soul quota. For each case, Sims will first need to identify the cause of death before they can officially reap the soul.

     Players are able to choose between a few options when collecting a soul. The differences are for the most part for some animation variety, however they have different success rates. For example, reaping carefully will take a little longer but will always succeded, but other options have a chance of failing, which might actually cause Sims to take longer time.

In these cases, the active Sim can either choose to accept the Plea (which will then require the reaper Sim to revive the deceased Sim by clicking on them, or otherwise they can reject the plea and reap the soul. While players can essentially choose either of the option, Reviving the Sim will mean they will not be able to collect a soul for the quota, which can make it more difficult to achieve. After choosing either of the options, Sims will be able to return to the office as usual.

  There is still more stuff to do after returning from a successful reaping session. They are also quite straightforward, and players should aim to do as many of them as possible until they can get a Gold medal for the day. Other than that, the Sim can simply do any activities that may help them build skills, fill their needs, or release souls to the netherworld, or check the weekly quota for their progress.

  In the
  <em>
   Reaper
  </em>
  career, Sims are tasked with collecting a weekly soul quota of 25 souls. This is a combined goal with fellow Reaper colleagues. Meeting this quota is essential not only for maintaining good performance but also for unlocking rewards from Grim's special chest, located upstairs at the HQ. Players can track their Sim's progress toward the quota at any time by using a computer while at HQ, allowing them to plan their tasks accordingly.

      <title>How Project Orion Can Improve Cyberpunk 2077's Romance Options</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/cyberpunk-2077-project-orion-improve-more-romance-options/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Recovering from its difficult launch,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  has grown into a worthy game filled with fascinating characters and lore. Between last year's game-changing 2.0 update and the
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  DLC,
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  has proven itself as a sci-fi epic. Now that a sequel is officially underway, codenamed Project Orion, many questions surrounding the follow-up have revolved around how it will improve upon its predecessor.

  Despite its impressive upgrades,
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  still has room to grow, which is what makes a sequel such an exciting prospect. There are a variety of ways that immersion can be brought to greater heights in Project Orion, and one of the most effective improvements that should be at the forefront is found in the game's romance options.
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  offers several romantic relationships to be formed with specific NPCs, but when it comes to the RPG genre, the options are lacking.

  More NPC Romance Options Are a Must

  Although there are a variety of brief romantic encounters V can have with characters and Joytoys, there are only four NPCs to choose from when it comes to forming an actual relationship.
  <em>

  's romance options being kept to just four characters arguably helps keep the game's story more concise, but it can also be a point of frustration.

  When comparing
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  to the likes of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , it's clear that the former needs to improve on its romance options. The four characters offered as relationship possibilities are all compelling in their own right, but at least doubling the number of NPCs in Project Orion would make this aspect of role-playing far stronger.

  Making Romanceable NPCs Less Restrictive
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another downside of
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's romance options is that they are incredibly restrictive. Depending on whether players choose a feminine or masculine version of V, one's choices are restricted even further. For example, Judy Alvarez will only romance a version of V with a feminine body and voice. On the one hand, this can help establish the personality and story of NPCs in an effective way, but it can also take away from one's desire to live whatever life they wish in Night City.
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  balances its relationship restrictions quite well. Players can romance characters regardless of orientation and gender, but some characters are open to polyamorous relationships, while others are monogamous.

  Building a Life in Night City
 </h3>
 <p>
  Building relationships in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  can have its challenges, but getting more freedom in Project Orion would only make the world of Night City feel that much more realistic in the long run. Since the game is still in its very early stages of development, it will likely be a long time before more news about the sequel comes to light. However, when that day finally comes, it will be fascinating to finally get a glimpse at how CD Projekt Red goes about making a follow-up stand out while still retaining the first game's energy.

  After a long and rocky road,
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  has finally become a beloved RPG. This may mean that expectations are high for Project Orion, but CD Projekt Red at least had an opportunity to hopefully learn from initial mistakes. Bouncing back from a controversial launch the way
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  did is not an easy task, and now that developers have extra knowledge under their belts, Project Orion has the chance to go even bigger with many of its concepts. In that regard, romance options are a great starting point.

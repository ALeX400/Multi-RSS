  <strong>
   <em>
    Quidditch Champions
   </em>
  </strong>
  lets players choose from the four different positions in
  <em>
   Quidditch
  </em>
  matches and experience how each one impacts the game. One of these positions is the Keeper, who, much like soccer or hockey goalkeepers, is the last line of defense for the team and needs to protect the rings from the opposing team’s attacks. Although defending three rings from the other team's Chasers can be challenging, with some tips and practice, players can become incredible Keepers in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Keepers in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  have a unique mechanic that provides significant advantages to Chasers during attacks. Known as Playcaller, this ability creates rings that increase the speed of teammates, making it essential for optimizing plays. Proper use of this ability maximizes team efficiency, boosting the chances of scoring points.

 <p>
  The goal is to position these rings to offer the best possible route for the allied Chaser, making it crucial for Keepers to make smooth route adjustments, avoiding abrupt direction changes. This prevents the Chaser from having to correct their trajectory mid-air, which could lead to a loss of speed due to a poorly placed ring.

 <p>
  If, after several matches, players feel their Keeper skills still aren’t sharp enough, a good idea is to return to training mode and practice the game’s fundamentals. While simple, the Practice Mode in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is highly customizable, allowing players to explore various mechanics of the characters.

 <p>
  For example, if a player wants to perfect Playcaller routes, they can do so in training without the pressure of knowing a mistake could harm the team. Additionally, it's possible to increase the difficulty of the opposing team, making the Chasers’ Quaffle shots more precise, which is ideal for training reaction time.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , players cannot maintain a fixed position, requiring them to alternate between roles with teammates for the best results. After defending the rings against the opposing attack, Keepers can quickly switch positions with Chasers.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1011} -->

 <p>
  This switch provides the team with more offensive options, as otherwise, the Chasers would be controlled by bots, which generally don't make the best decisions in terms of movement and passing. Having an extra player in the Chaser role is highly beneficial for creating better plays, but Keepers must be mindful of the perfect moment to make the switch, as the team can lose the Quaffle quickly and end up unprotected.

  Whether on keyboard or controller,
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  features various commands, each with its specific function for the characters. Thus, whether as a Keeper or in another role, it’s important to be comfortable with the controls before entering a match, especially in PvP modes.

 <p>
  Given the high level of competitiveness in these modes, players might accidentally press the wrong button when defending a particular ring, heading in the wrong direction and allowing the opposing Chaser to score points. Therefore, familiarizing oneself with the controls before playing against other players is essential for a more satisfying experience.

 <p>
  Whether in real sports or
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , one of the key fundamentals that Keepers must master is positioning to reduce the space for opposing Chasers and their chances of scoring with the Quaffle. While this skill comes with experience over time, some practices can be implemented from the start.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":901} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Staying positioned between the Quaffle and the central ring is an essential strategy for any Keeper looking to increase their chances of making a save. Aligning this way limits the opposing Chaser’s vision and options, forcing them to make risky passes or take long-distance shots, even allowing the Keeper to make a quick interception and initiate a counter-attack.

 <p>
  Brooms are not just cosmetic, and one of the best tips in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is to examine the attributes each one offers and equip them based on the needs of the role. For example, Keepers can benefit from brooms that provide bonuses in durability and agility.

 <p>
  The Comet is a good choice for Keepers, as its agility allows them to move between rings faster, reducing the time it takes to cover the distance, which can make all the difference in a successful defense. Durability is also crucial since the opposing team’s Beater can take advantage of any weaknesses to knock the Keeper off their broom.

 <p>
  A good Keeper in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  doesn’t just wait for opposing Chasers to attack. In some situations, leaving the defensive position to intercept the Quaffle from an attacking Chaser can be an effective strategy for winning. When noticing a Chaser getting too close, try flying towards them and causing a quick interception.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":902} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  However, this tactic can be risky. Keepers need to pay close attention to the opposing Chaser’s movements, as leaving the defensive position can leave the rings unprotected. Interceptions should only be attempted when there is confidence in success to avoid giving the opponent an easy shot.

 <p>
  One of the keys to becoming a good Keeper in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is avoiding predictability. Experienced Chasers often trick Keepers by pretending to shoot toward one ring and then quickly changing direction. Maintaining varied movement and not focusing on just one or two rings reduces the chances of being outplayed by these strategies.

 <p>
  Additionally, observing the Chaser's behavior and identifying attack patterns can be a significant advantage. Noticing repetitive plays from opponents allows the Keeper to anticipate moves and even move forward to stop the play before the Quaffle is thrown toward the rings.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  has a skill system, it isn’t overly complex, making it easier for players unfamiliar with the genre to feel comfortable making choices. Regardless of which of the three skill trees Keepers choose, all offer interesting bonuses that can prove useful.

 <p>
  However, Teamwork is one of the skills to watch out for early in the game, as its main function is to improve Playcallers, the Keeper’s unique ability, by reducing its cooldown. Additionally, skills in this tree can even buff the allied Chasers’ speed when the Quaffle is shot to them rather than passed.

  <em>
   Gym League
  </em>
  is an exciting Clicker Simulator on the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  platform with a gym theme. In this game, you must choose different strength training equipment for each muscle group and click a lot to get the best result and the most beautiful and athletic body. You can even take boosters that will accelerate the growth of your muscles and statistics, but you need in-game currency to purchase them.
 </p>

  Of course, you can participate in competitions to earn money, but you can also use

  </em>
  codes to get some cash for free. You can get in-game currency or a ton of free boosters using free codes. But the codes have a limited expiration date, so hurry up and get all the rewards as quickly as possible.

  Even though you can achieve great results by systematically visiting gyms for different muscle groups, the fact that players love freebies remains the same. Free boosters will not give you a cheating advantage but will only allow you to get some in-game currency to buy boosters or immediately reward you with a couple of chocolate bars or other energy products. To stir up players' interest, the developers will give players pleasant rewards, but remember that the
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  codes have a limited expiration date, so use them as fast as possible to get all the freebies.

  There are 75 stages in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Astro Bot
   </em>
  </strong>
  , ten of which can only be accessed by finding secret exits in some of the game's regular areas. Each of the five main star systems that players visit as part of the main story has two warps, which, when triggered, will take Astro to an area called the Lost Galaxy.

  Players will be able to tell which stages have secret exits thanks to the warp icon on the stage select screen. They're usually pretty difficult to find due to their obscure locations, so those having trouble tracking them all down may want to consider using this guide to every Lost Galaxy warp in
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  .

  Not long after acquiring the boxing gloves power-up, players will find themselves in a room with a Russian doll enemy. After taking it out, they should destroy the four torches on the nearby wall, using the ladybug enemy as a springboard to reach the ones at the top. Once the torches are all gone, the wall will open up, granting access to the Az-Tech Trail warp planet.

  A few minutes into the stage, players will come to a pink pig enemy that they need to throw into a nearby wall of ice to proceed. However, if they turn around and throw the pig at the glass seal sculpture in the previous area, a blue X will appear on the ground where the seal once stood. Using Astro's spinning punch while standing on this spot will take players to a new area, which is where they'll find the Creamy Canyon warp planet.

  After players beat Captain Pincher at the end of the stage, his claw will fly off and stick into the ground near a nearby tree stump, which will cause a blue X to appear on the ground. If players use Astro's spinning punch here, they'll be able to burrow down into a secret area containing the Go-Go Archipelago! warp planet.

  The Downsize Surprise stage has a bubble-blowing frog that players can activate by blowing into the microphone on their DualSense controller. After doing so, they should activate the mouse power-up to shrink down and then hop onto one of the bubbles. If they keep going past the cage with the trapped Bot inside, they'll be able to get onto the tree branch above and use it to reach the Downsize Surprise warp planet. There's no cable to pull this time though, so they'll need to push the red button to activate it instead.

  Around halfway through the stage, players will find themselves in a garden area where they need to use the sponge power-up to soak a pile of sponges in a Mount Fuji mural. Rather than heading straight here, they should instead take a left through the red tori gate and onto the cherry blossom tree. From here, they can use the sponge power-up again to extinguish the flames coming out of the chimney and then hop inside. After using Astro's spinning punch to take out the screw enemy, they'll be free to interact with the Bathhouse Battle warp planet.

  Immediately after entering the stage, players should take a right and head out into the water towards the large stone structure. They'll need to trick the electric enemy here into shocking the two electricity pads, which they can do by standing on them and then moving out of the way after the enemy begins charging its attack. Once both pads have been zapped, the nearby rockface will open up and players will find the Free Big Brother! warp planet.

  After sliding down the slope at the end of the stage and arriving in the room with the regular exit, players should jump on the bounce pad on the right side of the room and then push out the block in the center of the golden wall. This will trigger a section where they need to clear two more golden walls to avoid being crushed, after which, they'll find themselves at the Heiroglitch Pyramid warp planet.

  Immediately after getting the pufferfish power-up from the giant, players should turn around and then use the ladybug enemy to launch Astro toward the platform off in the distance. Just as his booster is about to run out, they should activate the pufferfish power-up and then land on the aforementioned platform. Spinning the blue flower here will cause a new platform to appear, on which, players will find a cutting device. After using this to cut down the bamboo, they'll need to use Astro's booster to go around the edge of the newly revealed circular device, which will make the Balloon Breeze warp planet appear.

  After defeating the Djinny, players will find themselves in an area with the stage's regular exit. Rather than using it, though, they should look for a ledge on the wall to their right and use it to get as much height as possible. From there, they can activate the dog charge power-up to reach the top of the ledge at the back of the area. Here, they'll just need to punch the magic carpet to get it to unroll and then ride it up to the Djinny of the Lamp warp planet.

  Near the very end of the stage, players will come to a snowy area with a ramp and four electric enemies. After defeating the latter with Astro's jets, they should turn their attention to the snowball that the two penguins are playing around with. If they roll this around enough, it will grow big enough for them to use as a platform to reach a ledge over to the left of the area. Here, they'll find a snow-blowing device that they can use to clear away the nearby snow wall to gain access to the Frozen Meal warp planet.

  There are eleven Puzzle Pieces for players to track down in the Crash Site area of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Astro Bot
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Quite a few of them are out in the open and so are quite easy to find, but others will only show up if players interact with the environment around them in some way, shape, or form.

  Finding every Crash Site Puzzle Piece will be important for those hoping to fully complete
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , as they'll need all 120 pieces to finish the Golden Statue puzzle. Thankfully, the following guide has instructions on how and when players can find each piece.

  After recovering the Mothership's GPU, players will gain access to a new area of the Crash Site that requires 90 Bots to enter. There, they should use 80 bots to flip the large block of ice and then jump on the blue bounce pad to reach the ledge above them, which is where they'll find the tenth Crash Site Puzzle Piece.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Deadlock
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the newest title from Valve Software, combining elements of both third-person shooters and MOBAs to deliver a fast-paced yet strategical competitive experience. Taking obvious inspiration from their past titles, such as DotA 2 and Team Fortress 2,
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  has lots to offer players, whether they're a fan of the numerous games it draws inspiration from, or new to the MOBA genre looking for a title to jump into.

 <p>
  When starting a game of
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  , the game's matchmaking system takes a variety of information into consideration, including the players' preferred characters, skill level, and automatically detected region. While these settings are meant to deliver the best possible experience to players, in the current Early Development build, a player's region also determines at what hours the time-limited matchmaking service is available to create player-vesus-player matches. These settings are largely out of the user's control, but players have found a way to change their matchmaking region to play against human opponents at any hour of the day.

  Changing matchmaking regions can be easily done through
  <strong>
   the developer console, accessed by pressing F7,
  </strong>
  and using the command
  <strong>
   citadel_region_override #
  </strong>
  . By replacing the pound symbol with different numbers, players can change which matchmaking region the game uses when creating a new game. At the time of writing, the available regions are:

  The automatically detected region Deadlock decides for players is used to ensure matches created are played on the closest servers available, reducing ping and improving the game's responsiveness. However, at the time of writing, the current build of
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  is an early alpha, featuring regional curfews restricting the matchmaking server to certain hours of the day depending on the user's region. While switching matchmaking regions can result in a worse connection to the game's servers, it also allows players to bypass the curfew present in their native region.

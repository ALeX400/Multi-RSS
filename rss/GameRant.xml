	Collecting Echo of different rarities is required if players wish to level up their Data Bank in
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	. Rovers get Data Bank EXP each time they unlock a new Echo of a new rarity, so to level up the Data Bank, players must complete their Pokedex and ensure they catch the top rarity of every Echo.

	Many people may find themselves missing an Echo marked as
	<strong>
	 H81
	</strong>
	in their Data Bank. Fortunately, H81 Echo is actually easy to find, as long as players have already completed Chapter 1: Act VI of the main questline, and unlocked the
	<strong>
	 Dreamless boss in
	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </em>
	</strong>
	.

	Dreamless boss in
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	is unlocked after players complete
	<strong>
	 Chapter 1: Act VI
	</strong>
	of the main story. Afterward, Rovers can head to Norfall Barrens (northeast side of Jinzhou) and find the H81
	<em>
	 WuWa
	</em>
	boss northeast of the Suspended Ruins.

 <p>
	According to players' discovery, bosses like H81 have a pity system where players are guaranteed to get an Echo drop in at least 1 out of 2 fights. This means if Rovers didn't get an Echo drop in the current fight, they can simply re-enter, and they're guaranteed to get the H81 Echo after the next battle ends.

 <p>
	Although Dreamless Echo has a special effect that's related to Havoc Rover in
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	, there's not much strategy needed when fighting her. Players must simply dodge her attacks, prepare for counterattack when the golden ring appears, and attack the boss whenever the chance arrives.

	<strong>
	 Dreamless Feather
	</strong>
	, also known as
	<strong>
	 Unwarranted Feather
	</strong>
	in
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves,
	</em>
	is obtainable as a drop from the Dreamless boss. Players can collect the loot by spending 60 Waveplate, up to three times per week. Once you use the three-times quota, you'll have to wait until next week to obtain more Dreamless Feather/Unwarranted Feather. Typically, weekly stuff refreshes every Monday, 4 am server time.

 <p>
	Unwarranted Feather is a skill level-up material in
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	for characters like Yinlin. Each of her abilities needs 4 Dreamless Feathers, meaning you'll need 20 Unwarranted Feathers to maximize all her abilities. Additionally, for her Stat Bonus and Inherent Skill, Yinlin needs 6 extra, for a total of 26 Dreamless Feathers to maximize one character's entire Forte.

 <p>
	Other than for Unwarranted Feather, the Dreamless H81 boss in
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	also awards 450 Union EXP, Intimacy, Shell Credit, Advanced Energy Core, and Advanced Sealed Tube. Lucky Rovers may also get the Standard Weapon Mold, a rare drop that can be used to craft a 4-star weapon at the crafting table. This item is equivalent to weapon prototypes in
	<em>
	 Genshin Impact
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	While
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Skyrim
	 </strong>
	</em>
	can be a high octane game, full of combat and peril, it also offers the optional simple pleasures of role-playing; coming home after a long day battling Daedric princes to a crackling fire and the smell of a hearty meal is an image that many players find comfort in. While much of
	<em>
	 Skyrim
	</em>
	's landscape is abundant with livestock and wild meats, for vegetarian players who want to experience the joys of cooking minus the animals, there are still plenty of options.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
	Although the total value of the ingredients are often more than the dishes themselves, the final cooked products offer vastly better Health, Stamina, and Magicka perks. So, whether a warm soup to enjoy on a wintry evening or 20 stews to down mid-battle, the following cooked foods are vegetarian dishes that can be made in-game with easily sourced ingredients.

	If players own a house, they can find garlic hanging near their cooking pots, but it can also be easily sourced from Inns or by raiding NPCs' homes. Similarly, salt piles are sold by food and alchemy merchants or stored in fish barrels near water-dominant locations such as Riften.

	If players are looking to make something with a bit more substance, the Cabbage Potato Soup might be the answer. Seasoned with salt but without the pungent flavors of garlic, this dish provides immediate health and stamina gains, making it a deliciously helpful meal to keep in players' inventories.

 <p>
	Cabbage soup is the easiest recipe to make in
	<em>
	 Skyrim,
	</em>
	requiring only two ingredients. Cabbages can be sourced from most merchants, market stalls, lying around kitchens, or directly from farms (if players don't mind harvesting them).

 <p>
	While perhaps not the most hearty-sounding dish with the lowest stamina perk, it gives the player instant health and stamina gains, making it a useful and cost-effective cooked alternative to health potions.

 <p>
	For players who want the same benefits of the more complex dishes without having to source a lot of ingredients, Potato Soup is the perfect solution. Needing only two ingredients, this is an efficient recipe if players are looking for a quick, cheap health or stamina boost.

 <p>
	Like cabbages, potatoes can be easily found in markets, shops, kitchens, and sacks at a majority of locations, meaning Potato Soup is perfect to make in bulk for emergency mid-battle munchies.

 <p>
	An arguably rogue combination, this flavorless sounding recipe is surprisingly beneficial. With only one extra ingredient than Cabbage Soup but giving the player an extra five point health bonus, this simple dish is worth cooking.

 <p>
	Although slightly less common than vegetables, red apples can still often be found in barrels and be purchased (or pick-pocketed) from merchants. If players are looking to sell food, Apple Cabbage Stew also goes for a little extra gold compared to other vegetarian dishes, giving players the largest profit if ingredients are sourced without purchasing.

 <p>
	Elsweyr Fondue is a little bit different from other vegetarian dishes in
	<em>
	 Skyrim,
	</em>
	but although the ingredients are slightly more elusive, its effects can prove useful for players going for a mage build and needing a quick Magicka boost.

 <p>
	The Eidar Cheese Wheel is slightly less common than its sliced form or Goats Cheese Wheels but can be found in Jarls' kitchens
	<strong>
	 .
	</strong>
	Ale, unsurprisingly, can be found in most Inns and Taverns, "The Bannered Mare" in Whiterun being a good starting point, while Moon Sugar can be easily sourced from Khajit Caravans outside the cities or in apothecary satchels in alchemy shops.

 <p>
	On top of trying to survive in
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Dead Island 2
	 </strong>
	</em>
	, you will also be completing many missions. During these missions and while you're exploring, you'll have the opportunity to find hidden items throughout each area of the game. These items can include weapons, Easter Eggs, and keys.

 <p>
	One key in particular may have you puzzled in the Haus DLC. When it comes to the Forget Me Not key, it can be pretty difficult to find. This is especially true since you'll be fighting your way through zombies to reach each house while you search.

 <p>
	As with other keys in the game, such as the mall cop's luggage key in
	<em>
	 Dead Island 2
	</em>
	, this key is easier to find than you might think. Looking at the map, you will be going to the first house on your left that says "Keep Off The Grass". Head up the stairs and turn to your left. You'll see an open door at the end of the hallway; turn right and go up the next set of stairs.

 <p>
	Once at the top, you'll find the Secret Admirer standing in the middle of the room, surrounded by TVs. Luckily, she'll be unaware of your presence at first, so you should be able to get a couple of good headshots in. When you defeat her, she will drop the Forget Me Not key. You'll most likely have to fight your way out of the house.

	At the end of the walkway to the house that had the key, veer to your left and head to the house straight down the sidewalk.

	There’s something therapeutic about Farming simulators. These games can transport gamers from their busy life to a serene, isolated valley at the press of a button. Additionally, most Farming sims aren’t just limited to tending the crops; some offer superb multiplayer experiences, too, while others combine other gameplay elements like hack-and-slash combat or managing a restaurant.

 <p>
	Farming sims also make a terrific addition to your Steam Deck's library. Unlike games that require a mouse and a keyboard, farming sims can be enjoyed from the comfort of your couch or a car's backseat when traveling. Here are some of the best farming games that can be enjoyed on the handheld.

	Most farming sims progress slowly. However, that’s not the case with
	<em>
	 Harvestella
	</em>
	, which puts players right in the middle of an unnerving plot at the start. The game, which is equal parts a farming simulator and an action RPG, lets players choose from a handful of jobs or classes, including Mages who use magic to overwhelm enemies or Shadow Walkers, who can dual-wield blades.

 <p>
	As farmers, players must use varied farming techniques and account for the game’s different seasons to grow a wide range of crops. Speaking of which, the world of Harvestella is governed by four super-sized crystals, which control the game’s seasons. However, a fifth season, namely Quietus, occurs between the four main seasons and causes the crops to wither. The season is also fatal to humans. With the player’s arrival, the super-sized crystals start behaving erratically. Players must wither the seasons and fend off monsters to unravel the island’s mystery.

	Farming simulators can be somewhat punishing, especially ones that require players to account for the crops rotting and other variables.
	<em>
	 Farm Together
	</em>
	lies on the opposite end of the spectrum. Not only that, but the game also advances time when players are away. This is a stark difference from other farming simulators and ensures players don’t have to wait for their crops to grow or other tasks to complete when they hop back into the game.

	The game lets players choose from a couple of different plots to start their farming journey. Players can customize their characters and even get a fluffy companion like a dog or a cat. Notably, the game doesn’t have a story, per se. Instead,
	<em>
	 Farm Together
	</em>
	lets players focus on growing their farms, acquiring newer buildings, and working on varied projects. It also has a multiplayer element to it, and up to four players can work on the same farm together.

	Players looking for a farming game with robust RPG elements will find a lot to like about
	<em>
	 FaeFarm
	</em>
	. The game kicks off with players creating a detailed yet charming avatar using numerous filters like Hair, Voice, and more. The story takes place in Azoria, a faraway island that is home to a budding community of farmers and - wait for it - magical creatures. These creatures threaten the peace and quiet of the community, so players must take on quests and deliver specific items to befriend these spirits.

 <p>
	The game also lets players fish, mine, and even raise different animals for produce. It offers charming graphics and intuitive controls, including auto-equipping the right tool to mine rock or water your plants. Unsurprisingly,
	<em>
	 FaeFarm
	</em>
	has amassed many positive reviews on Steam, and it works perfectly on the Steam Deck, too.

	is perhaps the most realistic farming game on this list. The game features hundreds of real agricultural tools from brands like Case IH and CLAAS. Additionally, the game doesn’t just propel players to make their own farm but a full-blown agricultural empire with production lines and more.

 <p>
	The game divvies up a player’s day between various farming chores, like taking the weeds out, tilling the soil, or planting seeds with a seeder. Additionally, the player’s home base changes with the seasons. This also affects the farm’s economy, as certain items can only be procured under the right conditions. Suffice it to say, players with a knack for detail and farming will find a lot to like here.

	Although farming simulators have a charming appeal, players can lose interest owing to their monotonous nature. That’s where
	<em>
	 Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin
	</em>
	comes into the picture. The game is a cross between a hack-and-slash platformer and a farming simulator. The game’s story revolves around Sakuna, a harvest goddess who is exiled to a demonic island with some humans.

 <p>
	Sakuna must fight monsters and harvest different types of Rice, which, coincidentally, is also the source of her powers. Players must also pay heed to different farming elements, such as using different types of fertilizers or softening the soil. These factors determine the type of harvest, giving Sakuna different boosts during battle.

	<em>
	 Story of the Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town
	</em>
	is a popular remake of the original that was launched for the GameBoy. Much like
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	, players must take on the task of revamping their grandfather’s plot in
	<em>
	 SoTS
	</em>
	. The game offers cutesy graphics and runs quite well on the Steam Deck.

 <p>
	The game also has some dating sim elements, and players can romanticize eligible bachelors and bachelorettes and eventually put down roots with them. There is plenty of gathering to do, too, and players can go fish, harvest crops, and tend to animals to sell produce, too. All said and done, the game offers plenty to budding e-Farmers and is a good option for new and returning games of the franchise.

	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	is unlike most games on this list. While it has a major focus on farming, the game also implores players to invest their time in building relationships with townsfolk. The game also includes a romantic aspect and allows players to find a spouse. In addition to bringing the family farm to its former glory, players must also help scale up operations in the nearby town.

	<em>
	 Stardew Valley’s
	</em>
	overarching plot can strike a chord with gamers, too. After spending most of their years inside an office cubicle, the protagonist takes a plunge and relocates to Pelican Town. Upon receiving a note from the grandfather, players move to his desolate farm to try and make it profitable once again. The game lets players explore dungeons and mine for minerals, help townsfolk with chores, and even fight monsters.

	The crux of
	<em>
	 Dave the Diver
	</em>
	revolves around exploring the vast depths of the ever-changing Blue Hole biome and procuring fish for Bancho’s restaurant. However, the game has some farming elements to it, as well, which are introduced as players progress through the story. One such mission, dubbed the Noisy Customer, will introduce players to Otto. Upon completing the quest, Otto will then set up places for players to farm fish and other ingredients.

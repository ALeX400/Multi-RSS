      <title>Best Female Ninjas in Games, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-female-ninjas-video-games-ranked/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Female characters in video games have faced several struggles in their quest to enjoy fair representation, instead of being turned into objects for the male gaze and nothing else. This is why it's refreshing to see strong women make an impact in the games they're featured in. Often, being a ninja is a shortcut to achieving that goal.

  Players will love the idea of interacting with or controlling these ninjas, who use their swift movements and powerful skills to slice up their enemies in no time. Watching these kunoichi complete sensitive missions or give people a beatdown never ceases to be satisfying.

  <em>

 <p>
  Being a ninja isn't easy, and even the ones gifted to take on this role would prefer to do something else instead that doesn't endanger their life. This is the case with Ibuki, a character who must follow the path of the ninja to honor her family, even if all she wants to do is live the life of a regular teenage girl.

 <p>
  All she'd love to do is eat sweet potatoes and gush over boys her age, but the expectations on her shoulders prevent her from unfurling her wings. This inner conflict may seem simple, but goes a long way in making Ibuki one of the more memorable characters in
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  .

  A shrine maiden who boasts impressive skills as a ninja, Momiji is a kindhearted woman who looks out for the well-being of others, even if it comes at a personal cost. However, anyone who underestimates this kunoichi and fails to take her seriously in battle will be breathing their last in no time.

 <p>
  Momiji is playable in
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2
  </em>
  , letting gamers control one of the best characters in the series —and one who was trained by the protagonist himself. This makes her a fearsome warrior, given that she learned from the very best.

 <p>
  Kunimitsu isn't a name per se, and is instead a title reserved for two rogue kunoichi. In the
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  series, she's usually depicted as a master thief who used to be a member of the Manji Clan before defecting.

 <p>
  As one would expect, this character is swift and a lot of fun to control as players master her moveset and unleash a torrent of pain on their enemies. The fact that she was stealing from right under Yoshimitsu's nose takes some guts, and makes it clear why fans love this character so much.

  The
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  series has attained a less-than-stellar reputation for many reasons, but most people will agree that the core fighting games are a joy to play every time. The simple arcade fun and a wealth of memorable characters ensure that players can come back to this series and fall back into a familiar gameplay loop in no time.

  One of the most popular characters in
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  is Ayane, who has a complicated relationship with the main character, Kasumi. This kunoichi is a joy to control in battle, and players can easily beat down their enemies as long as they know the best moves to use with this character.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7

  Yuffie can be a nightmare to recruit for players who are unaware of her wily ways. Players must make the correct dialogue choices and not open the menu or use the Save Point in this field to recruit this character successfully. But once they do, it's worth it. Yuffie plays a central role in a quest line where she steals the party's materia when they land in Wutai, allowing her character to grow as a result of this side adventure's conclusion.

  Kitana is one of the most iconic video game characters of all time. This character is portrayed as Shao Kahn's adoptive daughter who uses her skills as a kunoichi to great effect. However, unlike most of this tyrant's minions, Kitana has a crisis of faith and can't bear to work for the side of evil.

 <p>
  This leads to her switching sides and becoming a friend and lover to Liu Kang, helping Earth combat the Netherworld in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  time and time again. She's a great character who has made many noteworthy appearances throughout the series. Her simple yet engaging moveset allows players to catch enemies in a combo that will deplete their health bar in a flash.

  Players who want to solely focus on the stealth in these games should always control Ayame whenever they get to choose their playable character in the series.

  SP is used to cast magic spells from your Persona in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Persona 5 Royal
   </strong>
  </em>
  . SP management is crucial when exploring a palace, as many enemies will require you to use SP and hit weaknesses to help bridge the gap in level or stats.

 <p>
  The first few palaces in the game are some of the hardest, simply because your SP pool on each character is very low, making it difficult to fight at your fullest while also trying to clear a palace in a single day to make the most out of your free time. Here are some SP restoration items you can easily get throughout the game to make management much easier.

  For the most part, the only SP restoration items you can reliably buy are Arginade and Water of Rebirth, which are both purchased from Vending Machines. Both of these cost 300 Yen a piece and only two of each can be purchased at a time.
  <strong>
   Vending Machines restock every Monday

  The other and much better method for getting SP Restoration items is by ranking up Sojiro's Confidant. As you rank up, he'll let you
  <strong>
   brew coffee any night and cook curry
  </strong>
  any night there are leftovers in the fridge. Doing either will give you SP restoration items for free. If you also rank up the Temperance Confidant, you can have Kawakami brew coffee for you any night for 5,000 Yen without using your own time to do so.

 <p>
  With these ranks, Kawakami will make two Master Coffees a night, which restores 100 SP for one ally. No matter what you plan on doing any night,
  <strong>
   call Kawakami to make coffee
  </strong>
  as it will not only cost you a lot of Yen but give you a very large supply of some of the best SP restoration items.

  While you can choose any name you want, there is a canon name for Joker that Atlus uses in other media. For those looking to use the canon name in

  Through spin-off games, an anime adaptation, and a manga adaptation, the protagonist has been given the names Ren Amamiya and Akira Kurusu. This has led to a bit of a divide in the fan base as to which one is canon. The
  <strong>
   true answer is Ren Amamiya
  </strong>
  , as that comes from
  <em>
   Atlus
  </em>
  themselves and is even programmed into Persona 5 Royal. Akira Kurusu only appears in the Manga adaptation and is still seen as a reasonable answer to the question.

   Ren Amamiya is also the name used for the Protagonist in
   <em>
    Persona 5: Dancing In Starlight

  </strong>
  , which is a spin-off but still an official Atlus game. While the Persona 5 Manga does follow the major story of the game, it does have a few alterations from the game that further its place as supplemental material than the canon events of the story; lessening the legitimacy of Akira Kurusu.

  With the release of

  <strong>
   <em>
    Towers of Aghasba
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a survival building game that mixes in some homestead management and high fantasy. It also has quite a particular system that allows players to interact with the world in several ways to get the resources they need. This, of course, includes getting Fur from animals, which is needed for many crafting recipes.

 <p>
  Players can use Amity to keep a healthy relationship with the Ecosystem of their new home, and prevent the Shimu tribe from starving. Fur farming can factor into this. Fortunately, there are many different ways to obtain this valuable resource, including those that are more "environmentally friendly."

  Players will notice that every action has a reaction. Getting Fur from animals will mean a loss or gain of Amity, depending on what method players use. Losing Amity can become a problem in later stages of the game, so having it maxed out is the best way to prevent players from failing the bigger challenges that await ahead.

 <p>
  There are three methods to get Fur in the game. The first one involves healing hurt animals under the King Trees, which will require specific resources. The second is to Feed certain creatures food. The last, and least recommended, is by Hunting wild animals.

Once healed, the creature will become active in the environment again, and players will receive certain items. This method gives players the highest chance of receiving Fur. Harelopes are the best creatures to look for, as they are more likely to drop this resource. Here are the steps for this method:

 <ol>
  <li>
   Approach the hurt animal and check its health status.
  </li>
  <li>
   Gather the required items and return with them.
  </li>
  <li>
   Interact again and select "Turn items" to nurse the creature back to health.
  </li>
  <li>
   Don't forget to pick up the Fur and other items dropped as rewards.

  Once again, Harelopes are the best animals for this method. Look for the ones that are under the King Tree, which are most likely attracted once you Upgrade it to Ranks 2 and 3. Harelopes prefer three types of food: Berries, Roots, and Lettuce. Lettuce is their favorite, and it makes them drop more Uncommon and Rare Items, such as Fur and Hooves. Here's how to use this method:

 <ol>
  <li>
   Approach the area where animals are grassing, use the Shimuscope to analyze their food preferences.
  </li>
  <li>
   Open the inventory and select the food that was marked with a "!" Icon to get better resuts.
  </li>
  <li>
   Equip the food and throw it near the animals.
  </li>
  <li>
   Wait for them to eat, and pick up the items they drop.

  This method will also reward players with Amity, which is quite useful to develop the village and upgrade the King Tree.

  If players want to get more Fur and Faster, and are willing to lose Amity and risking the environment collapsing, then the other method is to hunt animals. Using bow and arrow, or a spear, players might be able to get Fur faster. However, each time they kill an animal, they will lose Amity fast. Just remember to plant lots of seeds, heal animals, and feed them often to recover Amity.

  There are numerous
  <strong>
   Nihon Falcom
  </strong>
  games from the 2000s and 2010s that are finally seeing releases on modern consoles and becoming accessible to a western audience for the first time. This gives many gamers plenty to explore and discover.

 <p>
  The two biggest juggernauts in Nihon Falcom’s arsenal are easily the
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  franchises, but these are not the only games worth playing, with many throwback titles still holding up to this day and being well worth checking out.

 <p>
  Nihon Falcom has done a lot of action RPG games, and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Brandish: The Dark Revenant
   </strong>
  </em>
  applies this talent to the dungeon crawling subgenre of gaming. Gamers may think that the game looks a little slow-paced, but lingering in one spot can result in one becoming surrounded, so players will need to keep pressing on.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1104} -->

 <p>
  However, this is not a difficulty that will continue to hinder players. Instead, once they adapt to it and get familiar with how to dispatch all threats in a single room, the game has a very enjoyable rhythm. There are plenty of areas to explore, enemies to fight, and items to loot, making it a great experience for beginners.

   <strong>

  is a very straightforward action adventure game with a lot to offer. The game has very pleasant visuals that make use of bright colors and hyper-stylized polygon graphics. This means that anyone who buys it today will have a game that visually holds up.

 <p>
  The game was originally released in Japan for PC but would be ported to the PSP, where it would later release in Western territories. It would later come to the Western PC market and finally the 3DS market. This makes it a very accessible title for gamers to get a hold of, and one that is still well worth playing today.

  may not be as popular as the

  or

   Ys

  games, both being other properties of
  <em>
   Nihon Falcom

   Brandish

  , offering plenty of the likable dungeon crawler elements but with much better controls.

  This can make it much easier for modern gamers to enjoy. Swapping between characters allows gamers to change how they play, and this can be a great way to keep things feeling fresh throughout the game’s many dungeons.

  There are a lot of long-running JRPG franchises out there, and many gamers love getting into franchises like these because of just how much there is. However, franchises like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  tend to make each main entry its own standalone story. Each
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  title, however, follows the events of the past games, which means that gamers will be in for an incredibly long undertaking if they decide to dive in.

 <p>
  One place to start is with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Trails From Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which acts as a prequel to the series. This game was developed much further down the line and has numerous quality of life features, such as a streamlined combat system, an enhanced user interface, and it can be more emotionally investing for players, too.

  While some gamers might find
  <em>

  </em>
  a lot easier when trying to get into the

  games, another great starting point would be the actual first game in the hit franchise. This lets players play the games in the intended order that they were released and get the most out of each entry.

 <p>
  This can be a harder pill to swallow with how dated the game is in comparison to
  <em>
   Trails From Zero
  </em>
  . However, this game has a remake in the works under the title
  <em>
   Trails in the Sky the 1st,
  </em>
  which is set to release in 2025. This could be the ideal game for new players to get into this beloved franchise.

  Players can progress through the main story without much grinding, and there are plenty of side quests for those who wish to extend their time with the game, too. A lot of these side quests actually seem right at home being sprinkled among the main quests, making them feel more meaningful.

  This is one for
  <em>
   Persona

  fans, as the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tokyo Xanadu eX+
   </strong>
  </em>
  features a modern-era Japan with otherworldly properties. The city is plagued by rifts filled with monstrous entities, but there is a special team tasked with sealing them. The player character, Kou, joins up with this team once he realizes he shares similar powers to them.

 <p>
  Players can roam around this game’s version of Tokyo, interacting with many charming NPCs along the way. While the game might give off a lot of
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  vibes in terms of story and world-building, its combat completely differs, functioning an action-based system, which is likely to appeal to newcomers looking to dive in.

  Just like with the
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  titles, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ys
   </em>
  </strong>
  features a very lengthy line of games that follow a continuous story, but some gamers might be wondering where to start. The
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  games are more episodic and can technically be played without needing to play any of the previous games. However, those starting from the very beginning might not really be able to get into the game because of how dated the original games are.

 <p>
  The perfect starting point for beginners is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ys 10
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This game has great visuals, fun and fluid combat, gives players plenty of lore to explore, and is a great JRPG experience in general.
  <em>
   Ys 10
  </em>
  chronologically takes place after the first 2
  <em>
   Ys
  </em>
  games, so if players enjoy it and want to play out their whole franchise, they will be closer to the start of the continuity. Those who don’t take to earlier games can skip them, as future titles do a great job of filling in any story gaps.

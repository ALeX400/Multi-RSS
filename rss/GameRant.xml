   </strong>
   Put simply, if you want to make progress in Dice Dreams, you need a lot of dice. With each roll, you can either build up your kingdom with the coins you collect or raid other players' boards for treasure. Running out of dice in Dice Dreams means you can't take any actions on the board. Thankfully, Dice Dreams frequently releases free dice links. You can use these links to top up your dice pool and keep the fun going. This guide is updated regularly with new Dice Dreams links to help you keep your dice rolling. Remember, these links are only active for a short time, so check back often to claim your rewards before they expire.

  Like most board games, the developers of
  <em>
   Dice Dreams
  </em>
  regularly introduce dice links for players running low on dice. These links can be helpful in continuing your progress and can be used to redeem various rewards, including rolls and Building Blitz, which can consequently help you build your kingdom. Moreover, these links occasionally reward millions of coins, but most of the time, you'll receive rolls. Below is a list of active links that
  <em>
   Dice Dreams
  </em>
  players can use to earn some free goodies.

  links expire quickly, usually within a day or so. Recently, there’s been a noticeable shift in the frequency of these link releases, and developers have reduced their quantity. As such, it’s uncertain how long the links will remain active moving forward. For your convenience, here are some expired Dice Dreams links:

      <title>Why PS5 Players Should Keep an Open Mind About Fairgames</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/fairgames-ps5-good-why-sony-live-service-focus-changes/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  In July 2022,
  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  acquired Haven Studios, a Canadian game developer situated in Montreal, Quebec. Haven Studios' name likely didn't ring any bells for most gamers, but that's because it had never released a game at the time. In fact, the studio was established in March 2021, only a year before it was bought by PlayStation owner Sony. Even though Haven Studios was brand-new, it had a lot of talented developers at the helm; the company was founded by
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Watch Dogs
  </em>
  co-creator Jade Raymond, who was previously employed at Ubisoft, EA, and Stadia. Additionally, more than a hundred employees were working at Haven Studios as of 2022, many of whom were experienced creators behind hit titles like
  <em>
   Rainbow Six: Siege
  </em>
  .

  Sony confirmed that Haven Studios was working on a new live service game shortly after it purchased the firm, but it didn't reveal what that game was until 2023. During the PlayStation Showcase that year, the two companies announced
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  , a co-op heist shooter developed exclusively for PS5 and PC.
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  was met with largely lukewarm reception among PlayStation fans upon its announcement. Many were critical of the lack of gameplay in its vague, CGI-focused reveal trailer, and others were quick to label the game as a derivative
  <em>
   Payday
  </em>
  clone, despite not seeing much of it. Haven Studio's debut project admittedly didn't make a great first impression, but there's still a chance that the game may end up being a hit, especially after some recent developments at Sony.

  Fairgames is One of Several Live Service Games in Development at Sony
 </h3>
 <p>
  Sony is typically known for its blockbuster singleplayer games, but the company has been trying to break into the fruitful live service market over the last few years.
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  was just one of several titles that the PlayStation owner invested in as part of this initiative, alongside other games like Bungie's
  <em>
   Marathon
  </em>
  and Naughty Dog's now-canceled
  <em>
   The Last of Us: Online
  </em>
  . After the failure of the PlayStation first-party hero shooter
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  , though, some pundits believed that Sony would pivot away from its live service push entirely.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  However, according to Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki, this won't be the case.

 <h3 id="sony-is-learning-a-lot-from-its-recent-live-service-releases">
  Sony is Learning a Lot from Its Recent LIve Service Releases

 <p>
  During a recent meeting with shareholders, Totoki revealed that PlayStation would continue making live service games alongside traditional singleplayer titles. He then added that PlayStation would hold more internal tests going forward in order to prevent a disaster like
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  from happening again. Totoki also stated that Sony learned a lot from the GAAS games it released this year. According to him, the company "intends to share the lessons learned from its successes and failures" across the many studios it owns "so as to strengthen its development management system."

  Sony's Plans to Improve Its Future Live Service Titles Will Likely Benefit Fairgames
 </h3>
 <p>
  The fact that Sony is determined to make its future live service games successful may bode well for
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  If PlayStation does indeed learn from its mistakes, as Totoki says, then it's unlikely that the company will release Haven Studio's upcoming co-op shooter without it reaching a certain quality bar. The QA tests Sony plans to put in place for its future GAAS games may benefit
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  a lot. Not only will they potentially improve the quality of the game as a whole, but they may also allow it to be as rich in content as possible upon its launch.

 <p>
  It's unclear exactly how
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  will play or when it will even release, but a recent rumor alleged that Sony was very positive about
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  internally. Hopefully, this report is true, because if
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  is high-quality and able to distinguish itself from its competitors in meaningful ways, then it may attract a large audience on
  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  consoles and PC.

      <title>Future DC Games May Be Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/dc-future-games-batman-focus-burnout/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  After recent releases have failed to impress audiences, Warner Bros. has revealed that it is going to be shifting focus a bit. Instead of developing titles in all of its vast IP, the studio has plans to put more of an emphasis on four franchises:
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat,
  </em>
  DC Comics,
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  . With DC Comics, the studio wants to specifically focus on
  <strong>
   Batman
  </strong>
  and his exciting roster of supporting characters. Although that could lead to something special, it may not be the best route forward.

 <p>
  Just like with Marvel, DC has made a name for itself with its massive cast of characters. Players have fallen in love with Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, and all the rest of DC's leading figures. However, the immense success of Batman has eclipsed them all, so naturally, the studio wants to focus on his story more than all the others. And while that has led to some fantastic titles over the years, putting too much of a focus on him may put DC's future in a tough spot.

 <h3 id="the-arkham-series-is-currently-in-a-rough-spot">
  The Arkham Series is Currently in a Rough Spot
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the main reasons that focusing on Batman may not be the best idea is that his video game life seems to be in a rough state right now. While the
  <em>
   LEGO Batman
  </em>
  franchise has gone from hit to hit, the
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  series has not had as much luck recently. The original
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  trilogy helped define what a great superhero video game should be, but since
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  , the series has struggled to make the same impact.

 <p>
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  was supposed to be the next massive Rocksteady-led adventure in this series, yet it failed to deliver. The focus on live-service proved extremely controversial, the story felt lackluster for many, and the entire experience paled in comparison to what came before. Additionally, the story's use of the Caped Crusader left a sour taste in the mouths of many.

 <p>
  Outside of
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  , the other
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games after the main trilogy have also struggled to impress audiences. 2013's
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham VR
  </em>
  were met with mixed reception, and
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  has seemingly come and gone despite good reviews. While another mainline
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  game could be worth a try, if it continues the franchise's recent trend, it could also further dampen it for many.

  Too Many Batman Experiences May Burn Players Out
 </h3>
 <p>
  Of course, Warner Bros. does not just have to stick with the
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  series, as superheroes are rebooted all the time. There are still plenty of stories waiting to be told and gameplay styles waiting to be tapped, so the potential for a Batman-led adventure in another style is seemingly limitless. However, the moment might be right to move away from Batman altogether, despite Warner Bros.' plans.

 <p>
  Batman has been the face of the DC brand for years, as he is its most profitable hero. He has seen countless movies and appeared in many video games these last couple of years. As of now, there are even two live-action series with The Dark Knight being built, and his most famous villain has just got a brand-new standalone film in the form of
  <em>
   Joker: Folie a Deux
  </em>
  . Fans do not have to look far for any sort of Batman content, which is great, but if video games also continue to focus on him, then those same fans may quickly get burnt out.

 <p>
  Warner Bros. is at risk of having too much of a good thing on its hands by focusing on Batman. DC is filled to the brim with characters that could shine in their own video games. If Batman is the only thing fans are getting, then those experiences will not feel as special anymore. Yet, if there are other heroes' stories between whatever Bruce Wayne does next, then that could be the perfect way to build anticipation. Hopefully that's exactly what will happen, but based on what Warner Bros. has said, it may be a long time before players get anything besides Batman.

  is all about disarming a bomb, but with a fun twist. Only one player has access to the bomb and can actually see it, and they are the only player with no knowledge about how to disarm it.

 <p>
  On the other hand, a set of other players do have an instruction in hand for disarming the bomb, but since they can't see the bomb, they need to communicate with the player in charge of disarming to finally survive the threat before the timer hits zero.

  <em>
   Human Fall Flat
  </em>
  is a physics-based game with a variety of scenarios that will make players laugh more than they could actually complete the objectives. During each scenario, players will have to cooperate with each other to get past a difficult platforming puzzle or place certain things at designated spots.

  Of course, it's easier said than done. It will take a bit until players get the hang of controls for the character, but even after that, the goofy movement mechanics of
  <em>
   Human Fall Flat

  will deeply challenge players with tackling the objectives, creating a lot of funny moments in between.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Overcooked
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the first game that comes to mind when players talk about party games that are a lot of fun to play through. It doesn't take a genius to understand
  <em>
   Overcooked
  </em>
  's mechanics, making it the perfect pick-up-and-play title that players will love as they try to make dishes and satisfy as many customers as possible.

  What makes this simple gameplay loop so satisfying is the incredible presentation of each stage, with a wealth of hazards and unique dish combinations meaning that players have to constantly be on their toes in every level.
  <em>
   Overcooked

  can either be the life of the party or cause serious arguments to break out — there's no in-between, and this is precisely why so many people hail this title as one of the best modern party games ever made.

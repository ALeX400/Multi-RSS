      <title>Why You Should Nuzlocke Pokemon Gen 1 in 2025</title>

  A major part of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  community that has ballooned in popularity over the years is the existence of challenge runs, with the Nuzlocke being the most common.
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  Nuzlockes are a type of hardcore playthrough where players impose a set of restrictions on themselves to make the game more difficult, including limiting themselves to only capturing one critter per route and releasing any Pokemon that faints. While this ruleset can be used in nearly any mainline
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game, there is a strong argument for undertaking a Gen 1 Nuzlocke in 2025.

  Despite how nostalgic it is for many
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans, Gen 1 remains one of the series' roughest to replay given that it was Game Freak's first outing with this formula, and would be refined as the generations went on. As such, a Nuzlocke of Gen 1 in 2025 comes with a unique set of challenges that other generations don't have, offering a potentially even more challenging experience for players looking to test their mettle. The bare-bones features of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  Gen 1 leave these games as standout options for Nuzlocke runs in 2025.

  Which Gen 1 Game Should You Nuzlocke?
 </h3>
 <p>
  While it may seem like
  <em>
   Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow
  </em>
  all offer similar Gen 1 experiences, there are some key differences that could affect which game players decide to Nuzlocke.
  <em>
   Pokemon Blue Version
  </em>
  has a total of 45 different encounter locations with 93 potential mons to collect, while
  <em>
   Pokemon Red
  </em>
  has the same number of encounter locations and only 92 potential mons to catch.
  <em>
   Pokemon Yellow
  </em>
  , on the other hand, has 94 potential mons to catch, giving it the most options for players to consider.
 </p>
 <p>
  However,
  <em>
   Pokemon Yellow
  </em>
  has other limitations to consider, such as players being required to obtain Pikachu as their starter. Additionally,
  <em>
   Yellow
  </em>
  has more major boss battles to consider, with multiple battles against Jessie and James that don't exist in
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  . While some players may want this additional challenge in their Nuzlockes, others may want to avoid it and stick to
  <em>
   Red
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Blue
  </em>
  .

  Gen 1's Battle Mechanics Make Nuzlockes a Completely Different Experience
 </h3>
 <p>
  With the Gen 1
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, battles can play out very differently compared to the rest of the franchise due to the way some mechanics are designed. For example, critical hits function very differently in this first generation and can be both a run-killer or a run-saver depending on the situation. Gen 1 crit damage follows a multiplier based on the attacker's level, meaning higher-leveled mons deal more damage, and the crit chance is based on the attacking Pokemon's speed stat, with faster mons having a greater chance of landing a crit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Status moves function somewhat differently from the rest of the series as well, which can also be a blessing or a curse depending on how the player takes advantage of them. Sleep is a very useful status condition in Gen 1 since it can potentially last between 1 and 7 turns, with affected mons only having a 1/8 chance of waking up after the first turn—a much harsher status compared to Gen 2 onward that reduced the max number of turns a mon can stay asleep. Leech Seed and Toxic can also be a devastating combo since Leech Seed's damage can be compounded by Toxic's counter, meaning it will do increasing amounts of damage each turn like Toxic.

    <p>
     Butterfree is a surprisingly strong Pokemon to use in Gen 1 Nuzlockes since it can be obtained early and has access to both Sleep Powder and Psychic.

 <h3 id="psychic-types-in-gen-1-are-the-biggest-roadblocks-to-a-nuzlocke">
  Psychic Types in Gen 1 Are the Biggest Roadblocks to a Nuzlocke
 </h3>
 <p>
  The elephant in the room anytime one is replaying a Gen 1 game is the sheer dominance Psychic types have. Due to a glitch in the games, Psychic types aren't weak to Ghost like they are supposed to be, and Ghost-type moves instead have no effect on Psychic types, while the only damaging Bug-type moves to deal super-effective damage to Psychic types in Gen 1—Pin Missile and Twineedle—have incredibly low base power. This makes going up against Sabrina's powerful team of Psychic types incredibly difficult, and a potential run-ender, but could be the type of challenge some Nuzlocke runners are looking for.

      <title>Baldur's Gate 3: All Waypoints</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  A Fast Travel system is a common feature in many different video games, playing the crucial role of enabling players to quickly navigate from one area to another.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is no different from this, offering a Fast Travel system across the world of Faerun in the form of Waypoints. From working your way through quest lines to doubling back to grab a hidden item, Waypoints play a very important part in each
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  playthrough.
 </p>

 <p>
  For this reason, ensuring you unlock every Waypoint as you explore the world of Faerun, as well as knowing where to find each one can certainly come in handy. This way, players will usually be just one step away from being able to travel wherever they need to go. However, in the case that you have not yet unlocked certain Waypoints, this can also become a hindrance when you want to quickly reach a targeted location. Knowing where to activate and find all Waypoints is crucial, so a complete list of every Waypoint and approximate map coordinates in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  has been outlined in the guide below.

      <title>Minecraft's Desert Biome Updates Should Be Complemented With a New Weather Type</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  In light of Mojang's most recent content drops diversifying
  <em>
   <strong>
    Minecraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Overworld through new mobs, plants, and ambient effects, it could be the ideal time to explore new weather types for biomes like the desert and badlands. With Mojang forging ahead with its new update approach to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  through smaller content drops that enhance its existing gameplay, some of the game's recent changes have focused on expanding the variety across the Overworld's biomes. However, certain biomes like the desert could hold even more potential, especially when its newly added ambient sounds could help inspire future content drops.

 <p>
  One
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  feature that is overdue an update is its weather system, given that it has always played a key role in the game's atmosphere and mechanics. While the various effects
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's weather has had over the years have gradually evolved, such as lightning transforming mobs or cauldrons filling with powder snow, Mojang hasn't introduced a new weather type beyond the likes of rain, snow, and thunderstorms. But with its latest content drop strategy, Mojang has the perfect opportunity to address this, starting with biomes like
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's Desert.

 <p>
  Among
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's recent content drops are several new features that have helped enhance its Overworld in small but specific ways, such as introducing new pig and cow variants or new bush and leaf litter plant types. Unlike past updates that have significantly changed key areas of the game's Overworld, like 1.19's The Wild or 1.21's Tricky Trials, Mojang has demonstrated a stronger focus on evolving
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's environment and atmosphere. If this continues to be the case, then Mojang should consider revisiting its weather system as part of its ongoing strategy to enhance
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's Overworld.

  Mojang Should Capitalize on Minecraft's Desert Biome Changes
 </h3>
 <p>
  By extension of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's evolving Overworld, certain biomes have arguably benefited the most from Mojang's recent content drops, as these new mobs, plants, and more have helped the likes of the desert and badlands biomes to feel more distinctive. Alongside the introduction of new dry glass blocks and cactus flowers, Mojang has added new ambient noises to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's sandier biomes to emulate the sound of wind within the Overworld. However, with the positive reception these changes have received from
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  players due to the depth they add to these naturally sparse biomes, Mojang would be wise to capitalize on this newfound momentum.

  Despite being one of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's earliest mechanics, its weather system hasn't changed much beyond small, tangential additions like powder snow in the Caves &amp; Cliffs updates. As a result, Mojang could kill two birds with one stone by taking its ambient desert and badlands sounds one step further as inspiration for an all-new weather type. More specifically, Mojang could introduce sandstorms as part of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's weather system, something that could be exclusive to sandier biomes like deserts, badlands, and possibly even savannas similar to the temperature-specific mob and block variants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the improvements sandstorms could have for the atmosphere and gameplay of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's sandier biomes, Mojang would have the opportunity to experiment with potential mechanics that the new weather type could bring. Possible features for sandstorms in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Players slowly taking damage over time when buffeted by sand.
  </li>
  <li>
   Visibility and light are reduced, potentially causing Husks to spawn.
  </li>
  <li>
   Generating sand blocks as a natural source of sand.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While there could be some opposition to overhauling a key feature like weather, the debut of sandstorms as part of Mojang's content drops for its desert and badland biomes could help ease players into other overdue weather updates in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's future.

      <title>Genshin Impact Reportedly Had a Large Revenue Drop in February 2025</title>

      Genshin Impact's February revenue dropped 74% compared to January, mainly due to its banner schedule.

      Mizuki, the latest new character, was not as popular.

  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  revenue report has revealed that the game's overall sales for February have dropped significantly.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  follows a gacha model, meaning that the primary source of revenue for this free-to-play game comes from its various banners.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's most popular banner is the Limited Character Banner, which typically features new playable units. Since the introduction of the Natlan region, HoYoverse has introduced at least one new character per update, with Mizuki being the most recent addition. Updates are usually divided into two banner cycles, each containing two limited five-star characters and a lineup of three four-star playable units.
 </p>
 <p>
  An interesting chart shared on the main
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  subreddit shows the overall mobile game rankings based on February revenue. The data in the chart is sourced from Sensor Tower, revealing that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's February revenue was approximately $26 million, a 74% drop compared to January’s $99 million. The primary reason for this decline is likely HoYoverse's banner schedule, as January 2025 featured two highly popular
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  characters, Mavuika and Citlali. Since then, the game's content has slowed down as it temporarily shifted away from the Natlan storyline.

  The second half of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.3 took players back to Liyue for the Lantern Rite Festival, an annual event celebrating the new year. The ongoing Version 5.4 update features the fan-favorite Inazuma region and HoYoverse also introduced a new five-star character from
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's Electro nation. Although Mizuki has proven to be a powerful character, particularly as a support unit, a significant portion of the player base appears to have skipped her banner.

 <p>
  In comparison, HoYoverse's second most popular title,
  <em>
   Honkai Star Rail
  </em>
  , also reported a revenue decline, though it was less severe, with earnings dropping from $51 million in January to $47 million in February. There is a possibility that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's sales will rebound this month, as the second phase of the ongoing update will introduce the fan-favorite Lady Furina. She will be joined by another
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Fontaine character, the long-awaited Wriothesley, who will finally receive his first rerun banner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.5, which is expected to launch at the end of March, has the potential to significantly boost sales. HoYoverse has already confirmed the arrival of two new playable units, Varesa and Iansan. Iansan will reportedly be a four-star unit, while Varesa is expected to be a five-star character, making her a likely candidate for the first banner of Version 5.5, based on HoYoverse’s usual update schedule.

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds: How to Target and Lock On to Monsters</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lock-on-target-mh/</link>

 <p>
  For newcomers to the series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  might seem clunky at first. There's no obvious way to lock on to the Large Monsters, which can cause you to miss a lot of your attacks. But before you kick the bucket in frustration and call it quits, there's a way to activate a more classic lock-on targeting system in the game.

 <p>
  While it may not be perfect, the lock-on system in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , once activated, can help make the early hours much easier. Unfortunately, the way to activate it isn't explained well, and many players might have trouble figuring out how to enable it.

  The default lock-on system in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  doesn't work the same way as other traditional action RPGs. Instead of fixing your camera on the Monster, the game simply faces the camera towards the target without locking it. This gives you more freedom to reposition yourself in combat rather than being locked into one view. To switch to a traditional lock-on system, you'll have to
  <strong>
   change the Target Camera Control Type to Type 3.
  </strong>
  This option is hidden on the third page of the Camera Settings, accessed by from the main menu.

     Use the directional buttons on your controller or A/D buttons on your keyboard to switch pages in the Camera Options.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  There are five different Target Camera Control types that you can choose from:
 </p>
 <div class="table-container">
  <table align="" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="" summary="">
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <th scope="row">
      <p>
       Type 1
      </p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pressing LB, L1, or CTRL once faces the camera towards the Monster
       </strong>
       . Pressing the button twice turns the camera towards the direction the Hunter is facing. This is activated by default.
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th scope="row">
      <p>
       Type 2
      </p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pressing LB, L1, or CTRL once faces the camera towards the direction the Hunter is facing
       </strong>
       . Pressing the same button twice turns the camera towards the Monster.
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th scope="row">
      <p>
       Type 3
      </p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pressing LB, L1, or CTRL locks the camera towards the Monster
       </strong>
       . This is the closest you can get to an actual "Lock On" in the game.
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th scope="row">
      <p>
       Type 4
      </p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pressing LB, L1, or CTRL locks the camera in the direction the Hunter is facing.
       </strong>
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th scope="row">
      <p>
       Type 5
      </p>
     </th>
     <td>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pressing LB, L1, or CTRL doesn't aim the camera in the direction the Hunter is facing or the monster.
       </strong>
      </p>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>
 </div>
 <p>
  If you want to play with a classic lock-on system, we recommend switching the Target Camera Control to Type 3. Although it takes away a bit of the freedom from camera movements, it'll make it easier for beginners to adjust to the combat mechanics of the game. After changing it to Type 3, press RS, R3, or RMB to switch to the target monster. After that, you can press the LB, L1, or CTRL to activate the camera lock.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_10">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     It's also worth noting that activating the Focus Mode disables the Lock on. Since you'll be using the Focus Mode to deal critical blows to a Monster's wounded parts, you'll have to press the lock-on button again afterward.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Whether you use the Lock-On system in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  is entirely up to you. It all boils down to personal preference. Since you can access a Training Area pretty early on, we recommend trying out all Targeting Camera Control Types in the game to see what feels best.

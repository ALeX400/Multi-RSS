  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14's Endwalker
   </em>
  </strong>
  expansion got a lot of attention on its release due to its story serving as the conclusion to the long-standing Hydaelyn and Zodiark saga, spanning multiple expansions. During the storyline, many secrets were revealed, and some important questions that lingered from past expansions, especially
  <em>
   Shadowbringers
  </em>
  , were answered, specifically about the origins of the cataclysm known as the final days. As expected, the expansion took its players to six new zones that saw its storyline play out.

 <p>
  Unlike previous expansions, which had their zones tied closely together across one interconnected map (or two, in the case of
  <em>
   Stormblood
  </em>
  ),
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  had its zones spread out. Some were located on the previously uncharted continent of Ilsabard, others floating adrift in the sea of stars, and some in places few could hope to ever visit.

 <p>
  Many people agree that Labyrinthos is the weakest part of
  <em>
   Endwalker,
  </em>
  narrative-wise, as it artificially extends the story while sending the protagonist on menial tasks. The zone itself has some uniqueness due to its structure and location: a large underground place built beneath Sharlayan. It is the storage of an immense amount of knowledge and lore accumulated over many years, and so this is where the Forum’s secrets are located.

 <p>
  The zone is artificially made yet was meticulously designed to reflect the life forms of the Northern Empty. That’s why it has lakes, grass, and natural-looking caves that spread around the few Sharlayan outposts located at the critical places of Labyrinthos. The center of the zone houses a large dome hiding Ragnarok, a ship regarded as the last hope for the people of Etheirys.

 <p>
  One of the biggest promises of the expansion since its announcement was the opportunity to go to the moon, and
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  delivered on this front. The expansion presents an entire zone that is out of the bounds of the known world and encompasses the ‘crater of martyrs,’ the resting place of the dark primal Zodiark, a major figure throughout the story. This is where the players are finally able to face him, though not under the expected circumstances.

 <p>
  Besides that, the zone makes an incredible first impression with its unique sights and depressing atmosphere. The player interacts with the wandering souls of the ancients, who reach out to the primal before them and walk the underground tunnels, following a mysterious familiar by the name of Argos. The zone looks barren after the novelty wears off compared to many others, but it doesn’t undo the lasting first impression.

  One of the first zones the players visit in
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  is Thavnair, an island nation known for keeping neutrality and maintaining positive relationships with neighboring areas. Thavnairian alchemy plays an important part in creating a method of breaking through the aura of the newly emerging towers, and the elusive Satrap of the nation becomes a prominent character in the expansion. The zone also serves as a staging ground for Final Days, where players can witness the destruction first-hand.

 <p>
  The zone itself portrays a lush landscape mixing jungle and desert. The architecture is inspired by India, as is the culture seen within the zone. The lush plains of the zone make for an atmosphere of a tropical island that is certain to impress any first visitor. The Tower of Zot that looms in the distance adds an ominous, dark feeling to the zone, which only increases during the final days. It is alho the homeland for the beast tribe of Matanga.

  Ultima Thule is the final zone that players will visit in
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  , and in a way, it is the final zone of a series of multiple expansions, which sees the battle between hope and despair happen on its grounds. Ultima Thule is unlike any other zone, as the energy of Dynamis reigns supreme over Aether, creating rules that are entirely different from what both players and characters are used to, as its layout can change through Dynamis.

 <p>
  This zone is the epitome of despair, as it presents many cosmic civilizations that met their unfortunate demise, and their echoes now wander in this cosmic void. Some of them are familiar to the player, like Dragons or Omicron, while those like Ea are new additions to the setting. The player will interact with all of them while witnessing remnants of their civilizations with the huge violet vortex swirling beneath.

  One of the most breathtaking places in
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  is, without a doubt, Elpis. The exact location of this place was kept a secret throughout the marketing campaign, leaving players to theorize on the subject of a mysterious floating island portrayed in the concept art. After the expansion finally released, Elpis was revealed to be a location from the past, a facility governed by the ancients and where the Final Days truly began.

 <p>
  The place contrasts strongly with the ravaged Thavnair, offering a glimpse into the ancients' peaceful and prosperous world. The facility is full of grass and greenery with different creatures wandering around. As it is supposed to be a testing ground for the creations of the ancients, there is a lot of variety when it comes to wildlife. The peaceful music and shining blue sky also help create an atmosphere of peace and fulfillment that the zone radiates, making the change in tone after Meteion receives her report all the more drastic.

  Garlemald is a zone many players wanted to visit ever since A Realm Reborn. A homeland for the antagonist faction of the Garlean Empire, the capital was only ever shown in short cutscenes and glimpses, with the most exposure being in
  <em>
   Shadowbringers
  </em>
  when Gaius and Estinien infiltrated the black rose facility. For this reason, venturing to Garlemald was one of Endwalker’s most anticipated elements.

 <p>
  By the time the players arrive in Garlemald, it is completely destroyed, and the atmosphere is a far cry from the militaristic, technologically advanced city and culture that many expected. Most of Garlemald has become a wasteland, with tempered roaming around the place, slaughtering innocents. The depressing and dark atmosphere that reigns supreme across the country of Garlemald creates a uniquely atmospheric and downright depressing place.

  Certain games redefine their respective genres: for third-person action games, it was
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  that was revolutionary, for first-person shooters, it was
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  . When it comes to indie metroidvanias,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  was the title that set the modern gold standard, as evidenced by the sheer number of upcoming indie games like
  <em>
   Constance
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  that take more than a few cues from Team Cherry's 2017 hit. One look at
  <em>
   <strong>
    Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus
   </strong>
  </em>
  may prompt onlookers to paint it as something of a
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  clone, but that would be a grave injustice to
  <em>
   Bo
  </em>
  , which is a marvelous game.

  <em>
   Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus
  </em>
  is the first full release from Squid Shock Studios, an indie outfit based in Thailand. Squid Shock's collective artistic talent and vision are on full display from the onset, as its striking art style is a mesmerizing blend of traditional, hand-drawn animation, quasi-anime character designs, and traditional Japanese papercraft. All of these distinct artistic elements, aided by some spectacular lighting and other visual effects, combine to create one of the most appealing and unique art styles of any recent game. But make no mistake,
  <em>
   Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus
  </em>
  is more than just a pretty face.

  <em>
   Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus
  </em>
  has all the hallmarks of the Metroidvania genre: its progression is gated by specific abilities, there's minimal hand-holding, and its map is interconnected and laden with secrets. At the same time, 2D platforming conventions are inextricably woven into the game's DNA, to a far greater degree than its genre contemporaries. Understanding this blend of genres is key to appreciating
  <em>
   Bo
  </em>
  's gameplay.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  comparison is apt, at least for
  <em>
   Bo
  </em>
  's first hour or so. Players control a small, deceptively cute, cloaked figure wielding a basic, sword-like weapon. Hitting enemies with this weapon will result in a recoil effect that, when attacking from above, can be used to prolong airtime, which helps with traversal and repositioning.
  <em>
   Bo
  </em>
  's stroke of genius comes in the form of what Squid Shock calls its "move-and-reset system." In essence, this mechanic allows players to gain a midair jump upon hitting an enemy or other object. This will also reset Bo's dash ability. The mechanic is surprisingly forgiving, as the jump and dash reset will kick in whether the player hits the relevant object from above, below, or the side.

 <p>
  The impact that this has on
  <em>
   Bo
  </em>
  's moment-to-moment gameplay cannot be overstated. The system is immediately rewarding and easy to grasp, but is eventually further expanded with new tools, like a quick-firing grappling hook and a speedy wall climb. The result of all these synergistic mechanics is a traversal sandbox that is pliable, supple, and consistently satisfying until the end credits. Not since
  <em>
   Metroid Dread
  </em>
  has a Metroidvania felt this good to control.

 <p>
  This satisfying movement translates seamlessly to combat as well, which is often at its best during intense, complex boss battles that allow for numerous opportunities to exercise Bo's abilities. Players can fly around boss arenas with grace, using the boss itself as a tool to stay afloat and avoid projectile attacks. In
  <em>
   Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus
  </em>
  , combat is traversal, and traversal is combat—the line between the two is blurred, making it remarkably easy to slip into a trance-like flow state, whether you're taking on a platforming challenge or a tough boss battle.

  The mystical world of
  <em>
   Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus
  </em>
  is formed around the spine of Japanese folklore. Bo himself is a tentaihana, a flower-animal hybrid yokai invented for the purposes of the game, and most of the enemies and NPCs players will encounter are yokai as well. These NPCs include a fourth-wall-breaking two-headed bird inspired by the Yogen no Tori, or "prophetic bird" of Japanese myth, and the Vermillion Stranger, a bizarrely beautiful woman drawn from a 19th century Japanese legend. Indeed,
  <em>
   Bo
  </em>
  's Japanese inspirations run deep, and the game is rich with subtle references waiting to be recognized.

  But while other games centered on mythology tend toward the grandiose and dramatic,
  <em>
   Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus
  </em>
  is bravely quaint, calm, and wholesome. Yes, it contains a multitude of brutal challenges and no shortage of combat, but there's very little malice or evil in its world. Evil is presented as a dangerous, cosmic force rather than something inherent in intelligent beings, and by the end of the game, it's hard to fault the antagonists for the decisions they made, even if they did result in a good deal of destruction and suffering. In other words, the game will leave you with the feeling that, despite all the strife, everything will be okay. One of its greatest accomplishments is how it remains engaging in the face of this more subdued narrative tone.

  is broken up into four main regions, one of which is Sakura City, a beautiful hub world blessed with eternal sunshine. Sakura City is linked to southern, eastern, and western regions, which are each stunningly realized and visually distinct. They are also notably digestible, with recognizable environmental patterns that make it easy to find your way around. It also helps that they are rather trim, which contributes to

  <em>

  ' main campaign can be cleared in around ten hours. Completing all side content and nabbing all collectibles can net you a few more hours, but not many. In a way, this helps the game, allowing it to move along at a steady cadence, regularly offering new mechanics, environments, and characters to interact with; it has nothing that could be called 'filler.' At the same time, those looking for more bang for their buck might be understandably disappointed by the lack of content on offer.
  <em>
   Bo
  </em>
  also has a dearth of replay value, as there are no higher difficulties to select or challenges that could significantly distinguish a second playthrough from an initial one.

  But for those exhausted by drawn-out AAA experiences,
  <em>
   Bo
  </em>
  's lean nature might just be a breath of fresh air. Ultimately, when the most significant criticism someone can make about a game is that there isn't enough of it, that ought to be taken as a fairly good sign. If you have even a passing interest in the metroidvania or platforming genres,
  <em>
   Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus

  is not a game you can afford to miss.

  For the first few hours of gameplay,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Once Human
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a survival MMO with players expanding their territory to house things built from the various Memetic trees. There is also a main story that helps players progress through the world and activate the various Rift Anchors to open the pathway to bosses.

  As players get further into the game and want to join up with allies and partake in PVP, they can join a Warband. Warbands are like clans in Once Human and also offer players unique things to do as various Warbands fight for resources.

  Players can create a Warband by going to the

  Warbands are the

As Warbands get stronger, they are able to take and hold territory to gather resources for all players in the Warband, while also declaring war with other Warbands to take territory.

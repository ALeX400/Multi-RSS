	Slurp Cacti are noted by their cactus structure, with a healthy green plant adorned with spikes and blue bulbs. Upon running into one, players do not have to fear the spikes, as this is purely a cosmetic texture. To release the contents of the Slurp Cactus, simply
	<strong>
	 hit it with a pickaxe, shoot it, or run into it with a vehicle
	</strong>
	to watch it burst like a Chug Splash and
	<strong>
	 heal players for 30 points
	</strong>
	, or 30 shields depending on what's full, but HP will always restore first.

			<title>Star Wars Outlaws Still Has an Ace Up Its Sleeve It Hasn't Played Yet</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	Based on what has been revealed so far, there is plenty to be excited about with Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment's upcoming open-world
	<em>
	 Star Wars
	</em>
	adventure
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Star Wars Outlaws
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. Despite facing some skepticism here and there,
	<em>
	 Star Wars Outlaws
	</em>
	continues to stand out as a unique
	<em>
	 Star Wars
	</em>
	game, primarily because of its open-world model, non-Jedi protagonist, and non-traditional setting. As the outlaw scoundrel Kay Vess, players will explore the Outer Rim in an attempt to pull off a major heist, all while likely participating in a variety of optional activities along the way. One of those optional activities has already been confirmed, and it's likely to appeal to modern gamers, in light of recent trends.

 <p>
	According to
	<em>
	 Star Wars Outlaws
	</em>
	' ESRB rating summary, "During the course of the game, players can wager in-game currency on Sabacc, a blackjack-like card game with detailed rules." While Ubisoft and Massive have not openly revealed the inclusion of Sabacc in the game, the ESRB summary alone confirms it. Sabacc is an iconic card game in the
	<em>
	 Star Wars
	</em>
	universe, and
	<em>
	 Star Wars Outlaws
	</em>
	will be the first game to ever feature it as a playable mini-game. As mini-games continue to increase in popularity, especially after
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
	</em>
	's Queen's Blood took the stage,
	<em>
	 Star Wars Outlaws
	</em>
	might want to reveal more about its version of Sabaac ahead of launch to build hype for the game.

 <p>
	Mini-games have been around for a long time in gaming, but they have only very recently seen a surge in popularity. This is primarily due to the successful implementation of what is universally accepted as
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
	</em>
	's best mini-game, Queen's Blood, although it could certainly be argued that
	<em>
	 The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
	</em>
	's Gwent paved the way for mini-games like Queen's Blood.

 <p>
	Canonically, Sabacc has only been played on one of
	<em>
	 Star Wars Outlaws
	</em>
	' confirmed planets, Tatooine, which means players will most likely be traveling there to enjoy the mini-game. That being said,
	<em>
	 Star Wars Outlaws
	</em>
	could feature more planets than it has revealed so far, thereby potentially broadening Sabacc's territory in the process. Nevertheless, if
	<em>
	 Outlaws
	</em>
	' version of Sabaac ends up being just as good as, if not better than,
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
	</em>
	's Queen's Blood, it's likely to make waves just as its spiritual predecessor did.

	It's currently impossible to know what

	Revealing more about
	<em>
	 Star Wars Outlaws
	</em>
	' version of Sabacc ahead of the game's release would kill two birds with one stone. Firstly, it would confirm the variation(s) of Sabacc
	<em>
	 Outlaws
	</em>
	is choosing to feature, which some hardcore
	<em>
	 Star Wars
	</em>
	fans may wish to know. Secondly, it would show off the mini-game and most likely build hype for
	<em>
	 Outlaws
	</em>
	' optional activities, especially for those who grew fond of Queen's Blood in
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
	</em>
	. At the very least, there is little reason why Ubisoft and Massive wouldn't go ahead and formally announce it in some way, especially given the popularity of mini-games as of late.

	According to a newly published patent,
	<strong>
	 Sony
	</strong>
	is actively working on virtual reality foot sensors that would allow players to move in VR games using their feet. Sony's virtual reality patents have caught the eye of audiences, with many curious as to which, if any, of the company's latest research and development projects will ever be made available to the public.

 <p>
	A powerhouse in the technology and entertainment industries, Sony has firmly established itself as a front-runner in virtual reality gaming. With the PSVR and PSVR2 systems available for pairing with the PlayStation family of consoles, Sony has opened up efforts to bring higher levels of immersion into the realm of video games. In order to make this aspect of gaming more accessible and comfortable for some users, Sony is currently developing an interesting new way to play VR games.

 <p>
	Published on May 23, the Sony VR foot sensor patent details a unique accessory device that would allow users to move an in-game character using their feet while keeping their torso stable. The patent suggests that players who may experience motion sickness due to their in-game character moving while their actual body remains stationary could benefit from being able to move their feet to perform in-game actions. Rather than simply using hand controllers to move a character, players could attach foot sensors and use swinging, tilting, and twisting motions with their feet to experience the game and avoid motion sickness. This effort by Sony to improve accessibility in gaming reflects a similar pattern in other recent patents, suggesting that the technology giant may hope to reach even more audiences across its consumer bases.

 <p>
	Figures 5-10 of the Sony VR foot sensor patent show how the sensors are attached to either side of each foot and how different movements, such as sliding or rotating, can be translated into in-game movements. An example from the patent is in-game jumping, which could be triggered by moving both feet above a certain threshold. The sensors would calculate the displacement of the feet from their baseline location and determine that a jumping movement has been made, resulting in the VR character performing a jump. This would allow players to keep their torso still and play mostly with their feet, opening up a number of accessibility options. However, it is key to note that companies like Sony frequently file new video game technology patents, and without official announcements, there is no guarantee that this VR foot sensor will ever be produced and sold.

	Virtual reality remains a polarizing tool in the technology, entertainment, and video game industries. While certain virtual and augmented reality devices have proven popular, many remain unable to use these tools due to issues like motion sickness, limited mobility, and other health concerns. By offering accessible options for gaming, Sony could expand playing opportunities to more audiences, though it remains unknown if the VR foot sensor or any other newly patented

	technologies will ever be available to consumers.

 <p>
	Just like the first game,
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2
	 </strong>
	</em>
	puts a strong focus on narrative, but that doesn't mean that all of the story is told to the player directly. In the first
	<em>
	 Hellblade
	</em>
	, it was heavily implied that much of the game's events took place in Senua's mind, but developer Ninja Theory has never confirmed exactly what was real and what was a symptom of Senua's psychosis. Much of the story of
	<em>
	 Hellblade
	</em>
	is up to interpretation, and that's the case again with the recently released sequel.

 <p>
	At a fairly reductive level,
	<em>
	 Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2
	</em>
	is a story of vengeance that eventually gives way to a story of hope. Senua begins her second journey already on the hunt for the men who killed her husband and ransacked her home village. But after learning that Giants are terrorizing this new land, Senua sets off on a journey to stop them. The first Giant Senua meets in
	<em>
	 Hellblade 2
	</em>
	is Illtauga, an angry being capable of burning entire settlements to the ground. But there's more to Illtauga's story than meets the eye, and it's a story that echoes a lot of Senua's own past.

 <h3 id="illtauga-and-senua-share-a-similar-origin">
	Illtauga and Senua Share a Similar Origin
 </h3>
 <p>
	After coming face to face with the Giant Illtauga for the first time, Senua vows to do everything she can to get rid of the murderous monster. Her journey takes her to the cave of the Hiddenfolk, a mysterious unseen people who decide to help Senua reclaim the land. In an effort to do that, the Hiddenfolk reveal Illtauga's origin. Once a young human woman named Ingunn, Illtauga's story begins when a volcano erupts and brings destruction and famine across the land. In an attempt to evoke the aid of the Norse gods, Ingunn takes her newborn baby to the mouth of the Hiddenfolk's cave, and offers it as a sacrifice.

 <p>
	This sacrifice seemingly fails to appease the gods, and the famine continues to rage on across the land, turning people into the crazed cannibalistic Draugr that now threaten Senua and her newfound group. As time goes on, Ingunn's self-hatred only grows deeper, and eventually, she allows her grief and guilt to consume her, turning her into the Giant Illtauga, a being still fueled by that same rage.

 <p>
	Though it isn't immediately obvious, Senua's own origin actually mirrors Illtauga's quite a bit. Much like Illtauga/Ingunn, Senua fell into a deep depression when her husband died and blamed herself for his death, as she had banished herself from the village in an attempt to overcome her psychosis. But Senua and Illtauga's journeys diverge quite dramatically.

 </h3>
 <p>
	While Ingunn allowed herself to be swallowed up by her grief and guilt, Senua managed to reconcile with her own self-loathing. While
	<em>
	 Hellblade 2
	</em>
	makes it clear that Senua still harbors a lot of internal guilt over her husband's death and her inability to save him, her entire first journey revolved around her coming to terms with his death, and in the end, she was able to forgive herself slightly.

	One of the most important themes in
	<em>

	</em>
	<em>
	 -
	</em>
	and one that players are constantly reminded of via dialogue - is that everyone is capable of becoming a monster. Illtauga and the other Giants show this theme quite literally. But they also highlight the game's theme of hope, as Senua is able to overcome her own darkness to help lay the Giants to rest.

	CD Projekt Red has confirmed that no one at the company is currently working on
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Cyberpunk 2077
	 </em>
	</strong>
	, marking the end of an era for the open world action-RPG. Development on
	<em>
	 Cyberpunk 2077
	</em>
	reportedly started shortly after the release of
	<em>
	 The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings
	</em>
	, meaning someone at CD Projekt Red has been working on the game in some capacity since 2012. The wait for the game was an excruciating one for fans of CD Projekt Red's work, and when
	<em>
	 Cyberpunk 2077
	</em>
	was finally released to the masses, it unfortunately failed to live up to expectations.

 <p>
	While those with high-end PCs had a fine enough time with the game,
	<em>
	 Cyberpunk 2077
	</em>
	launched in a disastrous state on consoles.
	<em>
	 Cyberpunk 2077
	</em>
	's launch state was bad enough that PlayStation and Xbox started offering refunds for the game, with PlayStation going as far as to remove it from its digital storefront entirely. CD Projekt Red didn't give up on
	<em>
	 Cyberpunk 2077
	</em>
	, though, and instead committed itself to improving the game through sizable updates that addressed fan feedback and made important changes, vastly improving its reputation in the process.

	 Cyberpunk 2077

	originally launched in 2020, but the need to improve the game through updates and the work that was being done on the Phantom Liberty expansion meant that CD Projekt Red still had people working on it four years later. However, CD Projekt Red's latest financial report has confirmed that it no longer has anyone working on
	<em>
	</em>
	<em>

	 Witcher
	</em>
	game, except that it will be built using Unreal Engine 5 and is meant to be the start of a new trilogy. Fans can expect the new
	<em>
	 Witcher
	</em>
	game to be CD Projekt Red's next major release, followed by the
	<em>
	 Cyberpunk
	</em>
	sequel, though there are even more games associated with the company that are in the pipeline.

	CD Projekt Red is also working on Project Hadar, a completely original IP, as well as Project Sirius, a
	<em>
	 Witcher
	</em>
	multiplayer game, which is being made alongside The Molasses Flood. And finally, a
	<em>
	 Witcher 1
	</em>
	remake is in development at Fool's Theory, with it too using Unreal Engine 5.

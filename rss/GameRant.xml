      <title>With XDefiant's Days Numbered, One Ubisoft Franchise Should Fill the Void</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    XDefiant
   </em>
  </strong>
  is shutting down, continuing a tumultuous year for Ubisoft. The company has faced a string of rocky launches, leaving it with the tough decision to shut down
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  despite the game not even being a year old. Released back in May,
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  brought a free-to-play 6v6 shooter to gamers, but struggled to keep a solid player base. In a genre that is saturated with similar titles,
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  was unfortunately unable to stand out in the crowd.

 <p>
  However, despite Ubisoft's recent woes, the shutdown of
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  could still open the door for something more promising to be put in its place. A free-to-play 6v6 shooter isn't a bad idea, but the execution may have been off. Instead of a brand-new IP, Ubisoft may find stronger footing with a similar approach by putting such a game under the
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  name. A free-to-play
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  option would likely fare better in such a crowded space, but it could also be a powerful way to expand the franchise.

  Embracing Far Cry's Past Multiplayer Features
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  franchise is mostly seen as a single-player experience, but the multiplayer options in the series' entries have harbored passionate followings through the years. Not only that, but the map editors featured within various
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  games served as shining points in the tight-knit multiplayer community. A
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  game following in the footsteps of other free-to-play multiplayer titles, like
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  , could provide plenty of sources of inspiration.
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's Forge is a map creator that is loved by many, and with
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  's history of featuring its own fun-to-use map editors, a full-blown multiplayer project may be well worth Ubisoft's time.

  Going More In-Depth With Far Cry's Multiplayer Capabilities
 </h3>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  's multiplayer may have been more niche among its player base, a free-to-play game that embraces these past mechanics would not only satisfy fans of the multiplayer modes, but it could bring in a whole new fan base. There are many gamers out in the world who simply prefer a multiplayer experience. Even if some of them have been intrigued by the lore of
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  games, its single-player status can still deter them. However, if Ubisoft were to open the doors of the franchise to hardcore multiplayer fans, the company could possibly have a hit on its hands.

 <p>
  Ubisoft hopefully still has a chance to bounce back from these difficult years. In response to a Ubisoft employee survey, company CEO Yves Guillemot stated, "I want you to know that all my energy is focused on finding the means to guide Ubisoft through these turbulent times."

 <p>
  Leading a company as massive as Ubisoft can't be an easy task, but the past few years of financial failures need to push the company in a different direction.
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  not even making it past the one-year mark is a tough pill to swallow, but it's also a further indication of what many gamers may not be interested in.
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  lacked the personality that many other games in the genre excel at, and
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  already has the unique angle and legacy to make it a stronger name for Ubisoft to market. Speculation about
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's fate has been ongoing since the summer, proving that going back to the drawing board is necessary.

 <p>
  Despite the uncertainty of Ubisoft's future, there is still a chance for a comeback. The company is working on expanding its own IP, especially
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  may not boast the same success as its counterpart, but putting a similar amount of energy into
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  , especially with a multiplayer spin-off, may help Ubisoft thrive once again.

 <p>
  Spirit is a special resource located around the player's mana orb used to activate passive character effects like auras, self-reviving minions, meta gems, and more. Unlike mana, Spirit is not a resource that is spent and recovers over time. Instead,
  <strong>
   Spirit is reserved by skills that grant a persistent effect
  </strong>
  , preventing the reserved Spirit from being used by another skill until the effect is manually disabled by the player. A player's maximum Spirit effectively limits the number of passive effects that can be active at a single time. For example, if a player has 100 maximum Spirit and activates the Skeletal Warrior skill, 60 Spirit will be reserved to create a skeletal minion that revives on death, leaving 40 Spirit left for use on any other passive effects. The 60 Spirit reserved by the Skeletal Warrior will remain reserved until the player manually deactivates the minion, even if the minion dies in combat, as its self-reviving capability is considered part of the effect.

  While sources of Spirit are somewhat scarce, players can increase their maximum Spirit in three main ways. Killing specific bosses in the Acts will drop permanent Spirit upgrades, certain pieces of equipment can grant players additional spirit while equipped, and, in rare cases, a character's Ascendancy Class can even grant them additional spirit for a unique cost.

  Each Act in the campaign features a boss that rewards players with a gemmed skull, permanently increasing the player's maximum Spirit by 30. During early access, these rewards will be dropped even during the player's second time through the Acts on Cruel difficulty, giving players that find all of them 180 Spirit.

  Certain gear can increase the player's maximum spirit while equipped.
  <strong>
   All sceptres passively increase the player's maximum Spirit by 100 when equipped
  </strong>
  , making them powerful sources of the relatively scarce resource. Additionally, some sceptres grant players passive effects that do not reserve any Spirit, such as a free minion or aura effect. Similarly, Sun Amulets grant a small amount of spirit, though at a much smaller range of 10 to 15. Additionally,
  <strong>
   certain magic and rare items can randomly roll prefix modifiers to increase the Spirit granted from the item by a percentage
  </strong>
  . Players looking to maximize their Spirit will want to craft primarily on sceptres, before moving on to amulets if needing more.

  While rare, as of early access, there are two Ascendancy Classes featuring Spirit-increasing nodes: the witch's Infernalist and the monk's Invoker.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":387} -->
 <p>
  The Infernalist Ascendancy offers the Beidat's Will node, reserving 25% of the player's life, but granting players 1 maximum Spirit for every 25 maximum life they have. While the 25% life reservation can be a steep cost to pay, the prerequisite node, Altered Flesh, can help offset this induced fragility by converting a portion of cold, lightning, and physical damage received into fire and chaos damage. Additionally, Infernalists will likely want to invest into maximum life or life recovery regardless of the Beidat's Will node to offset the self-damage inflicted by their Demon Form or Infernal Flame mechanics.

 <p>
  The Invoker Ascendancy offers the Lead Me Through Grace... node, preventing players from gaining Spirit from requipment, but granting 1 Spirit for every 6 Evasion and 15 Energy Shield on their body armor. This can potentially be an exceptional source of Spirit for monks, particularly towards the end game where players will be able to craft incredibly powerful armor to fully maximize the Spirit granted from this node. In addition, Lead Me Through Grace... naturally synergizes with its next node, and Protect me from Harm, which reduces the player's evasion rating, but allows Evasion to provide Physical Damage Reduction, a very rare but equally useful defensive stat.

  One
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deep Rock Galactic
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has recently shared an incredible story about how the game has inspired him to pursue a mining career. Years later, the player is still looking fondly at this decision, crediting
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  for helping him completely transform his life.

  Developed by Denmark-based Ghost Ship Games,
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  is a co-op shooter for up to four players. Since its 2020 release, the game has achieved tremendous success, with PlayTracker and Gamalytic estimating that its lifetime sales on Steam alone are in the ballpark of seven million units as of late 2024.

 <p>
  Among the millions who bought
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  over the years is Reddit user Bulk-Detonator, also known as Mat. His experience with the game is as unusual as they come, not least because
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  inspired him to become an actual miner. This happened circa 2021, when Mat says he was at a low point in his life, stuck in a "dead-end job" and suffering from low self-esteem. That's when he discovered
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  , which served as an escape of sorts. Months later, he came across a job listing for rock drill training and explosive mining, which prompted him to ponder "wouldn't it be funny to do the video game thing IRL," as he recalled in a recent Reddit post. This turned out to be a life-changing decision, which helped him earn more, lose a lot of weight, and be happier overall.

  Speaking to GamesRadar+, Mat revealed that his crew's everyday responsibilities come down to drilling dozens or even hundreds of holes throughout quarries, pumping them full of semi-liquid explosives, capping them with stone, and blowing them up once everyone is at a safe distance. The goal is to make gravel by breaking down rock, thus providing materials used for asphalt, concrete, or drainage, among other applications. Mat is currently still a driller trainee, but hopes to be promoted to a full-fledged driller position in the near future. "I just came into this blind, and it ended up not only being a job that has been very good for me, but I'm incredibly passionate about it," he said.

  Real-Life Mining Inspired a Lot of Deep Rock Galactic
 </h2>
 <p>
  Mat's new career made him realize that the world of
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  borrows much more from real-life mining than he originally thought. E.g., the Glyphid Bulk Detonator monster was seemingly named after bulk explosives used in mining. Likewise, spiders predominantly attracted to stone do exist in real life, even though they're nowhere near as big as the monstrosities found throughout Ghost Ship's hit co-op game.

      <title>How Ghost of Yotei Can Solve One of Tsushima's Biggest Problems</title>

  Crafting the perfect sequel to a critically acclaimed title like
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  is easier said than done. The AAA title earned its flowers by thrusting players into a detailed depiction of feudal Japan and taking them on a journey filled with breathtaking visuals and enthralling deflective combat. However, even the most celebrated games are not without their shortcomings, and Sucker Punch Productions will be looking to improve upon a few areas in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Yotei
   </em>
  </strong>
  sequel. Although some might view it as a nitpick, one of the most significant criticisms aimed at
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  was the lack of variety in its architectural design.

  While the game’s buildings captured the aesthetic of 13th-century Japan, resplendent in its vegetative majesty and mountainous landscape, players often found themselves navigating structures that looked pretty much the same across the map. For a game with so much emphasis on environmental building, this oversight diminished the sense of immersion in an otherwise vibrant open world. With
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  set to release sometime in 2025, Sucker Punch has an opportunity to address this issue while maintaining the historical accuracy that fans of period-based games such as this cherish.

 <p>
  Despite being released over four years ago,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  still features some of the best visuals in an open-world game. However, after a few hours of riding through settlements, it became apparent that the buildings didn't receive the same careful attention to detail that other components did. Much of the architecture, from lowly farmsteads to castles, has the same aesthetic. Now, it can be argued that the landscape accurately depicts the style of feudal Japan. However, there needs to be some form of environmental diversity to capture attention. When every new town feels exactly like the last, it can undermine the sense of adventure that open-world games aim to deliver.

 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  is to take up the challenge left by its predecessor, then it must skillfully balance the need for accurate building representations with diverse designs. The architectural layout of 17th-century Japan is not too different from that of the 13th century, with most buildings constructed with wood, thatch, and stone.

 <p>
  Hokkaido Island,
  <em>

  <em>

  </em>
  risks feeling even more repetitive than its predecessor.

 <p>
  The game's setting in 1604 provides a golden opportunity to diversify its construction blueprint. The Portuguese first set foot in Japan in 1543, and their arrival could make for some exciting additions to
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  's portfolio. These Portuguese were Catholics who came to Japan to spread the gospel and trade, so it would not be out of place if players came across churches and priests during their gameplay. In the same vein, there should also be more features that represent the prevalent culture and religion during that period, like Buddhist temples and cathedrals dotting the landscape.

 <p>
  Like
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  ’s expansion, which brought Iki Island, Sucker Punch can also consider creating a DLC for its highly anticipated sequel that takes place in one of Japan’s major cities—preferably Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto), since it was the home of Japan’s ruler at the time. Exploring this would allow Sucker Punch to create more intricate societal layouts with architectural variety, like palaces, film houses, marketplaces, and all sorts. While
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  ’s rendition of towns and buildings is not game-breaking by any means, not improving on its offerings in
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  would feel like a waste.

  The Raccoon City Incident is the most infamous event in the history of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  . While the Spencer Mansion may have been the first zombie-infested area players explore in the series, the stakes were made much higher in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  when a virus infests an entire city, turning almost the entire local population into flesh-hungry zombies.

 <p>
  Considering that the police force was wiped out almost immediately after the outbreak began and that the government eventually bombed the entire city not long after, only a handful of people managed to escape with their lives intact. These individuals may be lucky to have gotten out of the nightmare safely, but the haunting memories of Raccoon will likely never leave their minds for as long as they live.

  Alyssa Ashcroft is a character from
  <em>
   Resident Evil Outbreak
  </em>
  whose main concern throughout the incident was to get to the bottom of who was behind it and expose them to the world. Her mission doesn't go as well as she would have hoped, though, once she realizes she's already been infected and is yet to become a full zombie.

 <p>
  As she makes her way through the city, narrowly dodging the swarms of zombies that lurk around every corner, she eventually reaches the hospital where Umbrella's involvement in the outbreak becomes clear as day. Just moments after the bombs land on Raccoon City, Alyssa manages to escape with the knowledge of Umbrella's wrongdoing. If players snoop around a little in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  , they can actually find a newspaper article written by Alyssa, which exposes Umbrella's antics, proving that she eventually succeeded in her mission.

  When Ada first shows up in Raccoon City, she pretends to be an FBI agent to earn the trust of Leon, whom she sticks close to for a fair share of the outbreak. Though Ada has a secret mission that she's trying to achieve, her and Leon are constantly thrown into dangerous scenarios, which Leon saves her from every time, even going as far as to take a bullet for her.

 <p>
  By the end, Ada falls down a chasm but miraculously survives to reappear in
  <em>

  . Raccoon City clearly changed Ada, primarily in showing her how she shouldn't always try to use those around her as tools for her own selfish gain. Leon went above and beyond to protect her and even saved her life. So, while Ada is still the mysterious rogue spy she's always been, the outbreak has clearly made her see people and their worth a lot differently.

  Trying to escape a city full of zombies is already hard enough, but when there's also an obsessive behemoth stalking the hopeful escapee the entire way, it makes things even more difficult. Though Jill is based in Raccoon City to try and find out more information about Umbrella, she's eventually hunted down by the Nemesis, a monster dedicated to wiping out every member of S.T.A.R.S. before they are able to leave and spread any information about what happened.

 <p>
  Unlike Claire and Leon, Jill actually has some prior experience with handling zombies, so it makes sense how she was able to take on so many of them. However, being able to avoid Nemesis was more luck than skill, since Jill comes very close to biting the bullet on more than a few occasions. Jill also owes a lot to Carlos, who was willing to venture through the city just to find a cure for her; otherwise, she never would have made it.

  HUNK earned the' Grim Reaper' codename because of his miraculous ability to embark on a suicide mission and, somehow, come out in one piece, with the Raccoon City incident being a prime example of this. HUNK's initial mission was to secure a sample of the G-Virus from William Birkin, only for things to go array once Birkin lashes out at HUNK and his team.

 <p>
  HUNK was the only one to survive Birkin's attacks, but rather than finding a way out of the city, he instead decided to stay put in order to find a sample for his superiors. Clearly, HUNK is a man who's dedicated to carrying out his mission, no matter how dire things get, and though many survivors look back on Raccoon City in horror, HUNK probably saw it as just another one of the many life-threatening missions he's embarked on throughout his career.

  The reason for Carlos being in Raccoon City during the outbreak was to serve his duty as a loyal member of the U.B.C.S., a group of mercenaries under the control of Umbrella. Since Carlos had no idea Umbrella was behind the whole fiasco, he was kept largely in the dark, but upon meeting Jill and helping her escape, things start to become a lot clearer.

 <p>
  After putting the pieces together and discovering Umbrella's role in creating the outbreak, Carlos dedicates himself to saving those who are still alive, including Jill. Carlos risks going through the Spencer Hospital just to find a cure for Jill after she becomes infected, making him a pretty heroic character who is credited for saving the life of a series fan-favorite. Carlos hasn't been seen since Raccoon City's destruction, but one thing is clear: He's definitely not going to be working with Umbrella again.

  Abandoned by her parents and forced to fend for herself, Sherry is initially hesitant to go along with Claire after the latter runs into her in the R.P.D. Eventually, though, Sherry realizes that there's not much she can do by herself, and she decides to tag along with Claire, relying on her for protection. Sherry still goes through quite an ordeal, though, being scolded by her own mother, seeing her father become a grotesque monster, and even becoming infected herself.

  At the very last moment, Claire was able to retrieve a cure to help Sherry, before then escaping from the city by train. In

She also comments that she can never forget that her father's obsession with his work led to his demise, which is something that drives her to stop the same kind of experimental horrors from breaking out elsewhere in the world.

  In the hopes of finding her brother, Chris, Claire makes what should have been a quick journey to Raccoon City to see what's going on. Little did she know that she would be plunging herself head-first into a living nightmare once she entered the city, being forced to take shelter in the R.P.D. to avoid the hordes of zombies who patrol the streets.

  Once Claire discovers Chris is actually on 'vacation,' she turns her attention to Sherry, becoming her guardian and vowing to keep her safe so that the two can make it out alive. Claire not only takes on Mr. X, but she also has more than a few run-ins with Chief Irons, who is constantly plotting to get her killed. The horrors of Raccoon City encouraged her to join TerraSave, an organization based around helping and supporting victims of bioterror incidents, just like herself.

  Leon probably had the worst first day on a job in human history. As the rookie cop arrives at his post, he begins to realize that something's gone very wrong with the city after seeing burning buildings and mountains of corpses scattered across the road. Things only get worse when he enters the R.P.D., only to find that virtually all of his future colleagues have been torn to shreds, forcing him to fend for himself.

  Leon manages to avoid certain death multiple times throughout his journey, including when he narrowly escapes a giant alligator in the sewers and escapes the behemoth known as Mr. X. However, Leon's inability to save others, especially Ada Wong, causes him to harbor deep regrets about the incident, resulting in him pushing himself twice as hard to save Ashley in

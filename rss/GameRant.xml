  combat is arguably one of the most immersive experiences any player will experience in a modern video game. The mechanics that must be learned to overcome enemies mesh together so well that it can turn any fight into an engaging and visually pleasing experience. Even if
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's combat is harder than some expect, mastering it provides a degree of satisfaction that most other games of the same genre fail to give. However, there is the slight issue of the parrying mechanic feeling somewhat off, leaving the sequel the opportunity to fix it.

  Since its release in July 2020,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  has received a lot of praise from players and critics. Besides its beautiful soundtrack and gripping story, one of the important factors that has drawn many towards playing the game is its immersive combat system. The different weapons, abilities, and stances one can use against the many enemy encounters can make every fight feel unique. However, timing parries against attacks from foes can feel somewhat perplexing. Though there is a clear indicator when one is supposed to do the mechanic, it feels more like a suggestion than something to do at that instant. The sequel may be able to change and possibly improve how parrying works, ensuring players feel that they're actually mastering the art of deflection.

  's skill-based approach to combat means that it's important that players can properly fend off attacks whenever possible. Even with a visual indicator that tells when an enemy will strike, there is still a small window from after the cue happens to when the parry has to be done. This can or has already led many to take hits they otherwise should have avoided, making it reasonable for some to want the mechanic to change. If Sucker Punch Productions decides to modify it in the sequel, then there are a few ways to go about it:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Have the indicator tell players when exactly to parry instead of when an enemy is about to attack
  </li>
  <li>
   Give the player a more generous window of opportunity to parry moves after the indicator disappears
  </li>
  <li>
   After a certain number of strikes against a blocking opponent, an indicator can appear to signal when an enemy is about to counterattack for a parry opportunity

  These changes can make it easier for players to learn how to parry attacks in

  's sequel. Although some may feel that such modifications can take away the game's challenge, it is still worth doing so that the mechanic functions in a way that makes combat feel more seamless and enjoyable in the next game.

  How Improving the Parry Mechanic Can Affect Other Aspects of Ghost of Tsushima’s Sequel
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the things the
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  sequel can implement to streamline parrying is to give players the ability to parry with other weapons. Whether it's Jin or someone else as the protagonist of the next game, that person will likely have multiple weapons to use. Making the parry mechanic more intuitive could allow the developers to implement it in equipment other than the sword. If it's feasible to implement, such a feature could provide more layers to the sequel's combat, making it even more engaging and intricate than its predecessor.

 <p>
  While there is possible evidence of a
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  sequel in development, there's still no confirmation of its existence or what it will take and modify from the previous title. Updating the parry mechanic could effectively improve the sequel's combat, but only if Sucker Punch Productions feels it needs the change. If it were to happen, players could have a much better and possibly easier experience in the next game, regardless of what challenges it poses.

  Gameloft releases new Star Path events every few months. At the moment, we have the Majesty and Magnolia Star Path as part of The Lucky Dragon update. In this Star Path event, Dreamers can do event-exclusive duties to earn Magnolia tokens. One task is to 'Harvest a Pungent Wild Crop From the Forest of Valor.' Wondering what crop this is and how to get it? This guide will help you find out.

  The

  that you have to harvest to complete this Star Path duty
  <strong>
   is Garlic
  </strong>
  . While Garlic can be found in different biomes, it’s important to get it from the Forest of Valor. Players can unlock this area with only 3,000 Dreamlight. If you don’t have enough, you can earn more by completing Dreamlight Duties.

  Once you unlock the area, go in and look for Garlic scapes on the ground. You can identify them by their big green leaves. After finding one, simply interact with it to harvest it. Each harvest will give you one piece of Garlic. Keep in mind that you have to harvest

  The Majesty and Magnolia event has many cooking-related Star Path duties where you have to prepare three-star, four-star, and five-star Appetizers, Entrees, and Desserts.

   The Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, is finally available for players to dive into its content. This expansion not only brings new maps and enemies but also adds significant depth to the lore of the universe created by FromSoftware with the help of George R. R. Martin. Among the highlights is Miquella, a mysterious character from the base game who now receives considerable attention from the developers. Besides the new areas to explore, players can expect a substantial expansion of the game's lore, further enriching the narrative experience of Elden Ring. Here's what the DLC has to reveal about this crucial character in the game's story.

 <p>
  Miquella's intention is to usher in a new era of everlasting peace through ascension to godhood, aiming to claim a consort in the process. His plan revolves around manipulating events to resurrect Radahn, using the body of Mohg within the Realm of Shadow. This scheme unfolds in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , where Mohg's disappearance and subsequent revelations hint at Miquella's plot to fulfill his divine ambitions.

 <p>
  Miquella made a pilgrimage to the Realm of Shadow, leaving everything behind on her journey to become a new god. With everyone under Miquella’s spell, peace would finally be achieved in

  Players who have battled their way through all the optional bosses in the base game might wince at the name Malenia, but they might not recall that her full title in one of the hardest boss fights in any FromSoftware game was 'Malenia, Blade of Miquella'.

 <p>
  The pair are twins; while Miquella tried to learn incantations and sorceries to expand his knowledge, Malenia acted as his defender and a powerful warrior. The pair are close, and the infamously difficult battle against Malenia happens in the place where she has been waiting for her brother to return to her.

  Miquella and Malenia were both born cursed. Miquella was cursed to never age, remaining a child forever and Malenia was cursed with the Scarlet Rot - a legendary illness that eats at the host's flesh and mind.

 <p>
  When the Golden Order, the devout followers of the Erdtree's order, couldn't reveal a cure to either of the siblings' afflictions, Miquella started to grow the Haligtree, using his own demi-god blood. He planned to encase himself in the safety of an alternative powerful tree, both to let himself grow to maturity and to allow himself the power to save his sister.

  During
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , Sir Ansbach reveals that Miquella possesses the ability to endear himself to others. This caused Mohg to become infatuated with him, leading to the kidnapping of Miquella. Consequently, Mohg now safeguards Miquella's body in Mohgwyn Palace, revering him in the hope that one day he will awaken, allowing Mohg to become his consort and establish a new dynasty.

  While Miquella was inside the Haligtree, he entered a kind of cocoon. It was within this casing that he wished to become more powerful and wise, to achieve his full potential and save his sister. However, at some point during the wars that raged through the Lands Between, Mohg - a half-brother of Miquella - tore him from the Haligtree in his cocoon and brought him to his undercity lair.

 <p>
  This is not common knowledge; Malenia believes her brother is in the tree and his followers only know that he has gone missing. Unbeknownst to them, Mohg stands beside Miquella's sleeping form in his lands and has his followers soak the dreaming demi-god in blood. Mohg's motives are clear - Miquella is an Empyrean and so has been chosen as a potential successor to host the Elden Beast. Mohg wishes to help Miquella ascend to godhood to attain power at his side as his consort. His gruesome methods reflect the Lord of Blood's evil intentions.

  While it can be assumed that he is as powerful as his divine family, his sister describes Miquella as "the most fearsome Empyrean". This puts him ahead of the hardest boss herself, as well as hinting at a more manipulative side to his power. The item description for the Bewitching Branch hints that Miquella could "compel" others to love him, and his close association with St Trina who could be his alter ego and controls dreams and sleep, seems to reveal that Miquella holds much more magical sway over his friends and foes than is clear at first.

 <p>
  Only an Empyrean can become the next vessel for the Elden Ring and the beast that it inhabits and Miquella holds much in common with his mother, the current host. He seems to have another form in St Trina, he pursues knowledge and values free will. Perhaps he is to be the next god of the Lands Between.

 <p>
  St. Trina, once revered as a deity of solace in the Lands Between, was revealed in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  not as a separate god, but as a distinct persona within Miquella. Unlike Miquella's ambitious nature, St. Trina offered restraint, balancing their shared existence.

 <p>
  However, Miquella eventually abandoned St. Trina at Stone Coffin Fissure, severing their connection and relinquishing the Great Rune because St. Trina didn't have any grand ambition or goal to become a god, so she would keep Miquella’s impulses in check.

  Messmer is Miquella's brother, much like Malenia. He, like his siblings, was born under a curse. The exact timing of his birth, whether before or after his siblings, remains uncertain, as their mother erased all mention of him when she abandoned him in the Land of Shadow.

  Despite this obscurity, Messmer played the role of an elder brother to Radahn, who is older than the twins, establishing Messmer as the senior sibling among them.

  Radahn, son of Radagon and Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, entered into a marriage of convenience to unite the Carian Royals with the forces of the Golden Order. Despite the strategic alliance, Rennala harbored a lasting affection for the red-haired warrior. Radahn rose as a champion within the Golden Order, revered akin to Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.

 <p>
  His charisma and popularity appealed greatly to Miquella, who envisioned a future as a god fostering an era of compassion, free from the Golden Order's influence. Miquella sought Radahn as his Lord Consort, forging a vow that ultimately led Radahn to accept the role.

  It remains unclear if Miquella perished by the end of
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , but upon entering the Realm of Shadow, a physical form was present, evidenced by remnants of their corporeal self along the path to the Divine Gateway.

  By defeating the king consort, players thwart Miquella's aspirations to rule the Lands Between, as a god requires a consort. Miquella's survival after the final battle is ambiguous; they may be left powerless in the Land of Shadow or have perished alongside the revived Radahn.

   <em>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley

  is a cozy life simulation game from Gameloft that can keep you hooked for hours. In this wholesome game, you can make friends with famous characters from the Disney universe and do different life sim activities together. Not only that, but the game also has some interesting riddles for you in the form of Star Path duties.

  While doing this duty, players might initially think of other beans in the game such as Beans, Cocoa Beans, and Baked Beans. But surprisingly, you don’t have to get any of them.

 <p>
  The energetic bean you need to harvest for this particular Star Path duty is actually
  <strong>
   Coffee Beans
  </strong>
  . This fruit ingredient can be found in the Glade of Trust, a forest-style biome that you can unlock with 5,000 Dreamlight. If you need more Dreamlight, you can either complete your Dreamlight Duties or craft it with Dream Shards.

 <p>
  But that’s not the only thing you need to do. To get your hands on Coffee Beans, you first need to complete Stitch’s level four friendship quest called Very Sleepy Stitch. In this quest, you find out that the little alien is feeling lazy because he hasn't been drinking coffee. To help him, you'll have to craft a Coffee Sapling and plant it inside the
  <strong>
   Glade of Trust.

  After finishing the quest, enter the biome and look for coffee bushes on the ground.
  <strong>
   Every harvest will give you three beans. It’s important to mention that there are only three coffee beans available at a time, so you will only get a total of nine beans in one trip.
  </strong>
  And to quickly mention, they take 40 minutes to respawn. You need to harvest
  <strong>
   25 of these energetic beans
  </strong>
  for this duty, so completing it will take a lot of legwork. Once players complete it, they will earn 10 Magnolia Tokens.

  A fan of Nintendo's classic
  <strong>

  Following its initial launch over two decades ago, the GameCube initially struggled to keep up with the sales numbers of its main competitor, the PlayStation 2, but still managed to find success due to its selection of classic games and dedicated fans. With titles like
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
  </em>
  gracing the platform, along with a variety of unique third-party games, the system is remembered by many as one of Nintendo's all-time best.

  Reddit user itangriesuptheblood was understandably excited to find a carrying case for the GameCube on Facebook Marketplace, which they promptly picked up and shared online. According to the photo the user shared on the official GameCube subreddit, the case is bright blue and has multiple compartments, seemingly meant to fit games and controllers alongside the console itself.

  Portability has been a major selling point for many of Nintendo's products, with the GameCube being an early example. The company not only sold carrying cases like the one posted - the console itself had a handle on the back for easy transport. Today, this consideration for playing on the go has culminated in the massive success of the Nintendo Switch, which is now the company's best-selling console thanks in large part to its use as both a home console and a handheld device.

  Despite the console's fan-favorite status, Nintendo has yet to rerelease many GameCube titles in an official capacity, even with the Nintendo Switch Online subscription offering multiple official emulators for consoles like the SNES and Nintendo 64.
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  saw a port a few years ago with
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D All-Stars,
  </em>
  but GameCube fans still largely rely on the original hardware or the Dolphin emulator to play their favorite games today.

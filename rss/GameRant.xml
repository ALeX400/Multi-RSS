   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is arguably one of the greatest open-world games to have ever been released on both the Nintendo Switch and any other platform. This title features amazing combat mechanics, lots of things to discover, and a broad range of NPCs and side quests that keep the experience interesting.
  </em>
  <em>
   Since Breath of the Wild was released, many games have tried to emulate it, and while some have failed, others have been very successful, offering players a chance to get a similar experience while focusing on other universes. This formula seems to work very well, and more often than not, makes for entertaining gameplay.

  <em>

  </em>
  is a charming throwback to the early days of 3D gaming, featuring a colorful but humble aesthetic. The vibe feels very "N64 Rareware" or "PlayStation 2 Naughty Dog" — but in a delightful way! The game brings a nostalgic and artistic charm, fleshed out by quasi-open-world exploration and sword-based combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  It resembles
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  in some aspects — especially the on-the-nose fantasy hero themes, as well as its arcade-style action and deep adventuring. Though Inverge Studios also rounds things out with some basic 3D platforming, keeping things upbeat and fun even when traversing the colorful worlds alone.

  <em>
   Moonlighter
  </em>
  can be described as an homage to the 2D dungeons traversed by Link, fused with a shop-keeping sim — and a touch of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . The experience shifts from ARPG-style action to shop and finance management. Players not only
  <strong>
   pawn
  </strong>
  the goodies they just gathered, but set prices and alter them according to popularity. It's a clever, rewarding experience that scarcely gets old.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just beyond town are a slew of randomized dungeons that bring tough roguelite gameplay, as players must delve into vast monster-laden depths to get items and resources for their shop — which expands as the shop-keeping monster slayer gains more wealth. The accessible, simple combat is balanced by a surprisingly deep in-game economy and ample layers of progression.

  In a departure from most games starring Nintendo's famous mustached mascot, the
  <em>
   Paper Mario
  </em>
  series has thrived on narrative-driven gameplay, deep progression, and a sense of humor.
  <em>
   Origami
  </em>
  <em>
   King
  </em>
  holds these traits in spades, with a surprisingly compelling (and slightly dark) tale featuring folded Origami foes. Shoving Bowser aside, the game features a new dynamic villain named King Olly, leader of the "Folded Soldiers".
 </p>
 <p>
  The combat is similarly deep and memorable, featuring a circular grid in which players must shift and rotate baddies scattered about to more effectively defeat them in fewer hits. While more whimsical than
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , this game is similarly dripping with imagination, colorful worlds, and rewarding gameplay.

  Studio Acid Nerve proves that fantasy concepts can still be applied without adhering to tired tropes. Case in point? The aptly-named
  <em>
   Death's Door
  </em>
  , which brings the amusing premise of a reaper crow gathering souls for the afterlife, embodied by the "Reaping Commission Headquarters". Absurd themes aside,
  <em>
   Death's Door
  </em>
  shines as an amusing, atmospheric dungeon explorer and puzzler at the end of the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The level design is akin to classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  dungeon crawlers, while the stylish, shadowy aesthetic reminds one of
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  ' darker bouts. Swappable weapons and tools, deep progression, and some fun abilities also make this indie a compelling choice for fans of Nintendo's fantasy series.

  Ancient mythological civilizations? Check. Highly stylized graphics and open-world locales? Yes indeed. A story-driven quest driven by NPC interactions? Check that too. Combat? Not so much... Indeed,
  <em>
   Sable
  </em>
  can be considered a reimagined version of 3D
  <em>
   Zelda —
  </em>
  assuming that alternate vision didn't include any form of fighting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather, Shedworks' adventure stresses discovery, world traversal, puzzles, and platforming — wrapped in a story-driven campaign. That's not to say there's a lack of action here, as the heroine Sable will spend plenty of time on her hoverbike zipping through the vast desert planet of Midden.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a good pick for fans seeking that same
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  vibe but with a lower-key, borderline relaxing, experience. At least players won't have to worry about those pesky Guardians here.

  Mario's debut in the RPG realm makes an emphatic return in this vibrant, delightful Switch remake. The same core gameplay and atmosphere of the original classic remain in all of their glory. Mario must again team up with Peach, Bowser, and Square Enix creations Geno and Mallow to rid the Mushroom Kingdom of Smithy and his gang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the visuals have been spruced up, and they complement the isometric perspective nicely. Various aspects have been refined and added, including a new chain combo system, AoE (area of effect) attacks, and a combined super move that can be used to wallop foes into oblivion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The time-based hits heavily featured in battle (which are now more clearly conveyed) add some pacing and excitement to the turn-based combat Like
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  , this
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  romp is a glorious symphony of Nintendo's charm and accessibility — coupled with rich, rewarding RPG and adventure gameplay.

  While garnering a mixed reception, it's hard to deny the unique appeal and amusing themes of this mammalian ARPG by Experiment 101. Players will venture through a vibrant post-apocalyptic world as they clash with hostile mutant animals. Fusing fantasy role-playing and sci-fi action,
  <em>
   Biomutant
  </em>
  offers plenty of zany fun as players explore and toy with various weapons and powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  comparison is more of a stretch here, the game holds some parallels to
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , including open-world journeying, fast-paced combat, and icy-cold biomes for good measure. There's even the familiar mechanic of lacing the animal hero with equipment to deal with different environments and dynamic weather. This wild quest utilizes various influences ranging from
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  to Kung Fu — yet the result is a truly unique experience.

  Switch gamers may be missing out on the darker, more expansive
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , but they
  <strong>
   can
  </strong>
  boast possessing perhaps the best way to experience its predecessor on console. Between the alluring dungeon crawling, simple-yet-deep progression, and seamless co-op (local and online), fans of Blizzard's groundbreaking RPG will have their hands full here. It also helps that this version has had years of fine-tuning under its belt, after a rather shaky initial release.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Eternal Collection
  </em>
  on Switch brings the Reaper of Souls add-on, the deadly Necromancer class, and a slew of rotating seasonal events to add even more replay value. As a neat bonus,
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans can enjoy a Ganondorf-themed cosmetic armor set, further adding to the game's sinister tinge.

  This Indian-made adventure entices players with a unique visual style modeled off Pahari paintings, and underpinnings of Hindu mythology. Players take the role of Raji, an isolated circus performer, who finds herself up against a slew of ominous demons and beasts to retrieve her captured brother Golu. What follows is a memorable, story-driven ride that yields more revelations as well as more powerful weapons and upgrades.
 </p>
 <p>
  With simpler, fast-paced combat,
  <em>
   Raji
  </em>
  can be more likened to
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors
  </em>
  — sprinkled with some clever puzzle gameplay and lovely atmospheric music. Either way, the game should intrigue many
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans with its familiar, yet distinct, design — especially with its lush environments and free-roaming exploration.

  Take an indie hack-and-slash frenzy, inject grueling roguelike elements, and dress it up with enchanting Greek mythology, and 2020's
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  is the result. It channels that retro
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  vibe with its barrage of tough baddies and dungeon-crawling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Supergiant Games entices players with a slew of hellish, randomly generated dungeons, loads of unique foes, and satisfying weapons. Like many roguelikes, the antihero Zagreus is all but set up to fail, as he must fight his way through the vast reaches of the underworld. But while death is a near-certainty, there's something about this addictive, white-knuckle gameplay that beckons players back for more punishment.

  With its superb blend of historical influence and high fantasy, CD Projekt Red's epic feels somewhat like a darker, Westernized
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  that never was. While
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  's visuals take a sleeker, more realistic approach, they prove equally enthralling as the more stylized charm of
  <em>
   BotW
  </em>
  . And of course, the gritty antihero Geralt is a far cry from the classic hero Link.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the gameplay front though, the lines blur quite a bit more, as both games have a healthy dose of action-based combat and exploration — as well as ample crafting and customization to adhere to one's playstyle.
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  enriches and immerses players into its lush locales and gripping story — strengthened by the Eastern European mythology and fantasy novels it draws from.

  Drawing from the strong lore and enjoyable gameplay of the hit Wii RPG, Monolith Soft triumphs again with this deep, majestic
  <em>
   Xenoblade
  </em>
  sequel on Switch. Like the first
  <em>
   Xenoblade
  </em>
  , this 2017 follow-up stresses a gripping story, likable characters, and lavish environments.
 </p>
 <p>
  It also sports loads of addictive combat that's equally interesting in its own way. Instead of revolving around the iconic Monado sword, the game excels in its unique system of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  -esque Blades, each of which brings a different dynamic and distinct powers. The
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  overlap is apparent in the vast, explorable landscapes and fantasy themes — but also in the endlessly fun battles, which blend arcade action with various skills and nuance.

  Including a
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  title may seem rather "on the nose", even one that's fairly distinct from its more dynamic
  <em>
   BotW
  </em>
  sibling on Switch
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  Still, given the superb blend of classic and modern
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  , this charming Game Boy remake just had to receive a nod. This is the third release of
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  , this time being a complete graphical overhaul.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  on the Switch is gorgeous and plays as smoothly as butter. Like
  <em>
   BotW
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  opens up much of the full overworld to explore pretty early on, giving that same, wonderful sense of exploration. And of course, there's still much journeying, combat, and puzzle-solving to be had. It's a fairly subdued, kid-friendly counterpart to the more bombastic
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , but it certainly has its place.

  One of Wii U's sleeper hits has made its way to the Switch, and in more appealing form than ever. While the themes, of course, contain similarities to the main series' fantastical Hyrule and its colorful monsters, the actual gameplay is more akin to
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  with its frantic action.
 </p>
 <p>
  This game is like
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  amped up to a fever pitch, taking the number of baddies on-screen to absurd and wild heights.
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors
  </em>
  is a satisfying hack 'n' slash that is quite suited for Switch's handheld pick-up-and-play sensibilities.

  It isn't often an indie game of this magnitude is released with so much critical acclaim, but
  <em>
   Hyper Light Drifter
  </em>
  lives up to its popularity. Created by a very small team of developers,
  <em>
   Hyper Light Drifter
  </em>
  takes classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  formulas and turns them into something uniquely beautiful.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fast-paced, challenging gameplay is complemented by a story that needs to be played to be understood, as everyone will interpret its cryptic cutscenes in different ways. Players will likely get lost quite a bit in this deceptively deep pixel-art game, but that makes it all the more enjoyable.

  Until Nintendo finally decides to port

  </em>
  to the Switch,
  <em>
   Oceanhorn
  </em>
  is here to scratch the itch of fans who fancy that seafaring twist on
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  . Originally released as a mobile title,
  <em>
   Oceanhorn
  </em>
  isn't afraid to pull quite a bit from multiple
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games, but it does so with its special charm.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will be sailing seas in search of treasure, exploring caves, and fighting monsters just like
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   Oceanhorn
  </em>
  is a more compact adventure fit for those looking for a quicker, more low-key journey.

  has its roots in classic 2D
  <em>

 </p>
 <p>
  Hitting the Switch nine years after its initial release,
  <em>

  </em>
  looks better than ever and serves as one of the best action RPGs on the platform at a great price, making it a great choice for any
  <em>

 <p>
  Dying in video games is often inconsequential or a minor inconvenience, with players merely respawning or restarting at the most recent checkpoint and carrying on as if nothing had happened. It can be annoying losing some progress or having to retry a difficult section, but it acts as a safety net and means that players can continue relatively unharmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some games have introduced permanent death or
  <strong>
   "permadeath" mechanics,
  </strong>
  meaning that a character or an entire playthrough is lost on death, which can be gut-wrenching. Hours, days, or weeks of work can be lost in an instant, but the entire roguelike genre is based around this concept and it has proven to be very popular.
  <strong>
   Other games make permadeath optional,
  </strong>
  with many players viewing all-or-nothing runs as the optimal way to play these games.

  Enabling 'Hardcore' mode on the character selection screen in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  already sets that playthrough apart from others, putting the chosen character's name in red and animating them in a more aggressive stance. Upon death, that character is permanently lost, remaining on the load screen as a hooded ghost and reminding players of their past failures.
 </p>
 <p>
  While developing
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  , many of Blizzard's team were very hesitant about adding a 'Hardcore' mode with permadeath, fearing fan backlash. However, it proved to be very popular and has remained a feature in later
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  games, with many players believing that it adds realism and gives a real sense of achievement if they beat the game with just one life.

  For many years, permadeath just had to be accepted by players of
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Long Dark
   </strong>
  </em>
  and its brutal Survival Mode. Many players were resistant to the idea of changing this since death is part of the game, but Hinterland Studio added the "Cheat Death" mechanic as an option in 2024, with a few caveats.
 </p>
 <p>
  When this option is turned on, players are given the choice to continue upon death up to three times, but the game becomes progressively harder each time. "Rebirth" incurs several penalties of varying severity, such as a weakened state and clothing being torn, as well as the loss of items. In many ways, it may just be better to accept one's fate and start a new save.

  Initially, Ubisoft planned to have permadeath as a default option in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Watch Dogs: Legion
   </strong>
  </em>
  , but chose to make it optional to appeal to both casual and hardcore players. When choosing the "Ironman" setting, players are unable to turn off permadeath, but Standard allows it to be turned off during a playthrough, although it can no longer be turned back on during that playthrough.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a normal game, operatives will be arrested or injured, but with only one life enabled, they are dead, meaning that the game will end if players run out of operatives. 'Resistance Mode' has Ironman permanently enabled, and even makes enemies stronger and the game world feel more oppressive, increasing the difficulty level across the board.

  Having permadeath in a Soulslike may seem unthinkable to many, but that's exactly what the developers of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Remnant: From the Ashes
   </strong>
  </em>
  decided to include in their Hardcore Mode. While many games unlock this option after completing the game at least once, this time it's available from the get-go, though it is recommended that only more experienced players try the mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are plenty of exclusive rewards on offer for those brave enough to try, and there are rare occasions when players can be revived in multiplayer, but none at all in single-player gameplay. It's certainly not a mode for beginners, requiring lots of prior knowledge about the game, its enemies, and its map layout.

  Permadeath has been a feature in every
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  game, but in recent entries, it only occurs while playing the game in 'Classic Mode.' While many attribute the first inclusion of 'Casual Mode' in the series to
  <em>
   Awakening
  </em>
  , it was actually
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem
   </strong>
  </em>
  that introduced it first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exclusively released for the DS in Japan, it is a remake of the third installment in the series. Adding the option to have fallen units return was meant to attract more prospective players who were put off by the permanent death mechanic, but it was a bone of contention for many developers working on the game. In this mode, fallen units merely retreat from battle and return to fight in the next mission.

  In previous
  <em>
   Wolfenstein
  </em>
  entries, the hardest difficulty level was already a tough challenge for many players, but MachineGames decided to add an almost impossible challenge in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus
   </strong>
  </em>
  . 'Mein Leben' is only for the most dedicated players, increasing the difficulty level and giving players only one life with which to complete the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that's not already too much of a challenge, this mode must also be completed in one sitting with no saves, and players must restart from the very beginning upon death. Considering that it takes roughly eleven hours to play through the game, any prospective combatant would have to possess a lot of patience and a clear schedule to roll credits on this difficulty.

  The Hardcore variant was already added to the open-world crafting game
  <em>
   <strong>
    Minecraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  way back in 2011. This new addition gave players only one life in Survival mode, with no option to respawn upon death, only a button to delete the world. The ability to spectate has since been added, and players must now manually delete the world themselves, but it is still impossible to respawn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hardcore is also set to Hard difficulty by default, so some players will struggle while trying to survive. It's also possible to play in Creative Mode, but players will still see the same death screen in the event of their untimely demise. Of course, some may have found sneaky ways to cheat death in Hardcore, but that kind of thing is not encouraged.

  The 2016 reboot of the first-person shooter
  <em>
   <strong>
    DOOM
   </strong>
  </em>
  saw the introduction of 'Ultra-Nightmare' difficulty, which features all the regular perks of 'Nightmare,' such as more aggressive and intelligent enemies, but also gives players only one life to work with. This feature also remains in the sequel,
  <em>
   DOOM Eternal
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  While it is slightly more forgiving than
  <em>
   W
  </em>
  <em>
   olfenstein
  </em>
  , allowing players to save at the end of levels rather than playing the entire game in one sitting, it still presents a tremendous challenge. Many players struggle to finish the first level, and the game even warns that it is punishing when selecting 'Ultra-Nightmare.'

   <strong>
    The Last Of Us Part 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  and retroactively added in the
  <em>
   Part 1 Remaster
  </em>
  , permadeath is one of the many difficulty modifiers for Custom difficulty. It can only be enabled when starting a new game, and players have three choices when selecting it as an option:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Per Chapter
   </strong>
   : Restart the chapter upon death.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Per Act
   </strong>
   : Restart the act upon death.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Whole Game
   </strong>
   : True permadeath, must restart the whole game from the very beginning.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In terms of difficulty, players can attempt a permadeath run on the easiest setting, Very Light, if they wish, all the way up to Grounded. There are also no manual saves, and if the player closes the game during a dangerous moment, it is treated as a death to prevent save scumming.

  Arguably the games most well-known for optional permadeath are the strategy games
  <em>
   XCOM: Enemy Unknown
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    XCOM 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  with their notorious Ironman Mode. Autosaving is disabled, with a single campaign save file existing in order to prevent players from simply reloading to an earlier point or restarting a mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players almost inevitably make mistakes in
  <em>
   XCOM
  </em>
  games, and Ironman forces them to deal with the consequences, even when a character dies from sheer bad luck. The fact that soldiers are fully customizable means that players often become attached to their operatives, making their loss in combat even more sorrowful.

  Tulletail is a very rare fish and crafting material in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It can only be found in the Stellar Fishing Ground, which is unlocked sometime after completing the main quests concerning the Abandoned District.

 <p>
  Stylists in need of this material in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  will struggle as they can only get one per day. After that, they must wait for 24 hours, which is when the game materials respawn. So, it is advised to try and catch it daily to use it in time of need.

  The Tulletail will test players' fishing skills as it is a purple rarity fish. Similar to any blue rarity fish, the purple ones are also quite tricky to catch but will require more reeling. Once the Tulletail is hooked to the bait, players must go against the fish’s swimming direction three times and reel it in three times as well. Be patient as it can sometimes weigh more than 10 Kg, so it requires a lot of work.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many ways to locate the Tulletail fish, like using the tracking system from the map if you have already caught a Tulletail before, or exploring the Abandoned District’s fishing spots until you catch one. If the sum of the Tulletails caught is 20 Kg or more, Stylists will unlock Precise Tracking.

  Many fabulous outfits require Tulletails and one of them is the Starlit Celebration, which you get for free at the beginning of the game. If players wish to re-craft the outfit to unlock its Evolution version, you will need a lot of materials in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  like 3 Kg of Tulletails.

  As it is a very rare fish, Tulletail is found in only one fishing spot in the Abandoned District, specifically on the Stellar Fishing Ground island. To reach it, you need to complete some chapters from the main quests until the Abandoned District is available. You will be close when players are tasked with creating the Floral Memory ability outfit in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  , which will help players cross great distances.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next, unlock the Handsome Lads Circus Warp Spire and then approach the Strawhat Sleepy Station and ask for help to reach the Stellar Fishing Ground island. Once the preparation is complete, use the Floral Memory outfit to glide toward the island.

      Japanese anime has a rich history post-war with iconic shows like

  Like the rest of the world, Japan was fascinated by animation in the early 20th century. They saw people like Winsor McCay and Walt Disney('s staff) bringing cartoon figures to life and thought they should give it a try too. There were a few early shorts that still survive today, like 1917's
  <em>
   The Dull Sword,
  </em>
  but to the rest of the world, Japanese animation came into its own during the post-war era when the likes of
  <em>
   Astro Boy
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Speed Racer
  </em>
  started catching on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since then, Japanese anime has become a fixture of TV schedules, cinema marquees, and a ton of video games. It seems like there's at least one game for every anime franchise ever made. Even then, it hasn't been enough to have just a set of
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  games, some
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  beat 'em ups, or a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  -based RPG here and there. Sometimes, they've managed some crossover encounters, where the biggest names in Japanese anime have either joined forces or fought against each other, with these being just some of
  <strong>
   the best anime crossover games around.
  </strong>

   This list originally looked at some truly awesome anime crossovers, but it needed a refresh. Some of its original entries were mobile games that have since been shut down, making them inaccessible without either emulation or hacking. As such, those entries have been replaced with some new, equally intriguing options, the old entries have been given more detailed blurbs to show what they're all about, and the list has been reordered to show, in descending order, which anime crossover games are truly the best.

  It feels like companies have only really tried to beat Nintendo at their own game of creating mascot fighters in the past decade or so, with the likes of
  <em>
   PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
  </em>
  coming, going, and coming back again. If people look further, they can find some truly odd games that tried to take on the
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  series, like when Hudson Soft got Bitstep to make a game where their characters battled it out with figures from Konami and the Takara toy company.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bomberman, and
  <em>

  's Yugo, could go toe to toe with

  's Simon Belmont and
  <em>
   Beyblade

  <em>

  as they are against Metal Gears.

  even comes with a story mode, where the characters are fighting to...increase ratings for the DreamMix TV channel. It's a surreal little game that's worth dabbling in, despite it being a Japan-only release.

  A lot of the most famous franchises in the anime medium made their debut in the pages of
  <em>
   Shōnen Jump
  </em>
  . Its publishers, Shueisha, haven't been shy about showing off its characters either.
  <em>
   Famicom Jump
  </em>
  on the NES brought together its biggest stars for its 20th anniversary in 1988, while its sequel,
  <em>
   Famicom Jump 2
  </em>
  , trimmed things down to letting players control seven of its key protagonists, like Goku from
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  <em>
   Z
  </em>
  , Jotaro Kujo from
  <em>
   Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
  </em>
  , and, um, Kankichi Ryotsu from
  <em>
   KochiKame
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Nowadays,
  <em>
   Shōnen Jump
  </em>
  is a more familiar name worldwide, so fans got to see what their brawl-for-all would be like in
  <strong>
   <em>
    J-Stars Victory Vs+
   </em>
  </strong>
  , an arena fighter made by the people behind the
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series. They can pit Gon Freecss from
  <em>
   Hunter X Hunter
  </em>
  up against Kenshiro from
  <em>
   Fist of the North Star
  </em>
  , with Vegeta from
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  as their partner, or the Sket-dan team
  <em>
  </em>
  from
  <em>
   Sket Dance
  </em>
  as their support. That's not to mention characters from
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bleach
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bobobo-bo-Bobobo,
  </em>
  and more waiting in its roster.

  's brawlers are all well and good, but what if fans aren't interested in the comic's more obscure characters? What if they'd prefer a game where it just focused on three of its biggest hitters and had their classic characters take each other on instead? With help from Q Entertainment, future

 <p>
  It's a 2.5D platform fighter akin to
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  , where players have to beat the orbs out of each other. The winner is either the first person to get all the orbs in a stage, beat all the orbs out of their opponents, or have the most orbs once the time limit runs out. Up to four players can get in on the action, using their special moves and transformations, alongside the occasional helpful item. Although anyone spoiled on their bigger games before and since might find its 20-character roster rather slim.

  To those not in the know,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel
   </em>
  </strong>
  sounds like an anime spin-off to some long-forgotten 90s toy line, but it's actually a fighting game made by the same team behind the cult moe fighting series
  <em>
   Arcana Heart
  </em>
  . Only this time, Heart Aino is joined by characters from the different visual novels published by Nitroplus. Ever wanted to see her beat up Saber from
  <em>
   Fate/Zero
  </em>
  ? Or watch Super Sonico take on Homura from
  <em>
   Senran Kagura
  </em>
  ? It's all possible with this game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, not all of its visual novel representatives had anime series of their own. Luckily, it features assist characters from a variety of different anime series, so Heart can be helped by Yuki Takeya, the girl gaslighted into thinking a zombie invasion is just another school day in
  <em>
   School-Live
  </em>
  , or by Amy, the chirpy guide from
  <em>
   Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet
  </em>
  . If that wasn't odd enough, its mix of heroines can be aided by characters from heavier sci-fi hits too, like Akane from
  <em>
   Psycho-Pass
  </em>
  and Angela from
  <em>
   Expelled From Paradise.

  To celebrate Dengeki Bunko's 20th anniversary, French Bread and Ecole Software (of
  <em>
   Melty Blood
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Under Night In-Birth
  </em>
  fame) put together
  <strong>
  </strong>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a 2D fighter featuring characters from some of their most famous light novels. It's a one-on-one fighter, but characters can call in assists
  <em>
   Rival Schools
  </em>
  -style to attack or provide a pick-me-up. So, Kirito and Leafa from
  <em>
   Sword Art Online
  </em>
  could join forces to take on
  <em>
   Toradora
  </em>
  's Taiga, who's being helped in battle by the infamous Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan herself.
 </p>
 <p>
  They're also joined by characters from
  <em>
   Oreimo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Boogiepop Phantom
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   A Certain Magical Index
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Kino's Journey
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Spice and Wolf
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Shakugan no Shana,
  </em>
  among others. Each have their own special abilities and surreal super moves, like
  <em>
   Oreimo
  </em>
  's Kirina using a UFO Catcher crane to grab her opponents. To top it off, it has Akira and Pai from
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  , perhaps the most sober, strait-laced fighting game around, turning up to demonstrate some normal kung-fu amid the fantasy chaos.

  <em>
   J-Stars Victory Vs+
  </em>
  was great for anime fans, as its bold, colorful presentation and different character interactions would have them finding Easter Eggs for days
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  However, it was also when the malaise over 3D anime arena fighters started to set in. Running all around an open space and blasting projectiles might resemble some shows better, yet it didn't help keep the gameplay fresh for long. It made some wonder if things were better back when
  <em>
   Jump
  </em>
  's brawlers were 2D, like in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Jump Ultimate Stars
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It was essentially a 2D
  <em>
   Smash Bros.
  </em>
  clone on the Nintendo DS, but with additional strategy via building card decks. If players can get the right deck together, they can overcome their opponents mentally as well as physically, gaining attack buffs along the way. Neither it nor its predecessor,
  <em>
   Jump Super Stars
  </em>
  , left Japan, but people who got it on import felt that it was one of the handheld's best hidden gems. It's certainly one of the more interesting ones, as people probably didn't expect there to be a game where
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  's Luffy could be backed up by the cast of
  <em>
   I"s
  </em>
  .

  Given most people's reaction to the game's release back in 2010 was "What's a Tatsunoko?", chances are that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tatsunoko Vs Capcom
   </em>
  </strong>
  wasn't originally meant to get a global release. The game came out in Japan two years before the West with an exclusive challenge mode and with endings animated by the famous anime studio itself. However, thanks to Nintendo, and perhaps to the success of
  <em>
   Street Fighter 4
  </em>
  on rival consoles at the time, Capcom was able to negotiate with the anime's different license holders abroad to co-operate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, all except one. Hakushon Daimaoh would remain a Japan-exclusive character and would be replaced with Tekkaman Blade (aka
  <em>
   Teknoman
  </em>
  ), Yatterman #2 from
  <em>
   Yatterman
  </em>
  , and Joe the Condor from
  <em>
   Gatchaman/Battle of the Planets/G-Force/Eagle Riders
  </em>
  in the West. Even if players were unfamiliar with them,
  <em>
   Hurricane Polymer
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Casshern,
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Karas
  </em>
  , they'd recognize its tag gameplay, as it was heavily inspired by the
  <em>
   Marvel
  </em>
  games. However, the game remains trapped on the Wii, and due to its tricky license deals, is perhaps unlikely to get a fresh release.

  When it comes to anime crossover games, it would feel amiss not to mention the
  <em>
   Super Robot Wars
  </em>
  series. It's been pitting mechs from
  <em>
   Mobile Suit Gundam
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Getter Robo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mazinger Z
  </em>
  , and more against each other since 1991. However, it can be hard to pick which entry in the series is the best, as it has its own range of spin-offs, reboots, and reworkings alongside its main series games. It's like looking for a piece of hay in a stack full of needles. So, this list will go for just one of its most popular entries in
  <strong>
   <em>
    The 3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha: To the End of the Galaxy
   </em>
  </strong>
  (
  <em>
   SRA3
  </em>
  for short).
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Super Robot Wars Alpha
  </em>
  series is particularly well regarded by fans of the series, with
  <em>
   SRA3
  </em>
  being considered one of the best. It's a tactical RPG where players must organize their units of famous mechs to take on the Ze Balamary Empire.
  <em>
   MSG
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Stardust Memory
  </em>
  to
  <em>

  </em>
  are represented, as are
  <em>
   Getter Robo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mazinger Z
  </em>

  <em>
   Neon Genesis Evangelion
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Space Runaway Ideon
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The King of Braves GaoGaiGar
  </em>
  , and more, alongside some original characters, producing one of the largest cast of mechs in the series.

  Crafting materials in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  come in many shapes and forms, like insects, Esselings/Bosses drops, plants, flowers, and many more. There are tons of fish swimming around in the waters of Miraland, so it might be hard to locate a specific kind. Although there is a tracking system in the game, it cannot be activated if Stylists haven’t discovered the material yet.

  The Ribbon Eel is a long blue fish with whimsical fins that make it appear like the fish is dancing in the water. You will require this fish to craft certain items like dresses, skirts, and so on. Finding it will be challenging, as if you require a certain amount, you have to repeat the fishing process daily since the fish is not abundant in Miraland.

  Ribbon Eels can be fished from big ponds or narrow rivers as long as they are within the Breezy Meadow. As the fish is a blue rarity in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  , players need to put in a bit of effort to catch it. Upon getting caught by the bait, the Ribbon Eel will change direction twice and Nikki will have to reel in the fishing rod twice to catch the fish.
 </p>
 <p>
  By catching 60 Kg of the Ribbon Eel, you will unlock Precise Tracking, which is pretty self-explanatory, and until then, Stylists need to visit the Ribbon Eel’s fishing spots by tracking them on the map.

  Although you can get Ribbon Eel from other fishing spots in the Breezy Meadow, they are quite rare and random to obtain. Luckily, there are currently two guaranteed Ribbon Eel locations in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  . When you reach a fishing spot and throw the fishing hook, keep in mind that each spot has three fish, and you can’t choose which one to catch first, as it is random.

  Reaching the second fishing location is time-consuming if you haven’t unlocked the Abandoned Fanatic Wisher Camp Warp Spire yet. If it’s available, teleport there and proceed to the northwestern fishing spot. There will be other fishing spots, so make sure not to confuse them with the one located northwest.

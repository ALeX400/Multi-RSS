  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Snap
   </strong>
  </em>
  has just announced the contents of its December 2024 patch. With the latest
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  season having started on December 3, several cards have been introduced into the game. As with every new release, developer Second Dinner tries to balance out the game as a whole to avoid instances wherein a certain kind of deck or card may be deemed overpowered or too weak, depending on the case.

 <p>
  One of November 2024's
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  updates saw cards such as Surtur, Agent Venom, Skaar, Silver Sable, and others receive adjustments. This was to ensure competitive play, especially since many fans found the Surtur card that was added that season to be too strong. As such, with the Marvel Rivals season commencing, it was the right time for the developers to try and scope out and tweak a few more cards that could help players out.

  <em>
   Marvel Snap'
  </em>
  s December 2024 update introduces several changes to many cards. One of the biggest adjustments during this patch is the one involving Arishem decks in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  . Many players enjoy using this archetype because of its unpredictability. This is why the new update sees the random cards reduced from 15 to 12, and the +1 Max Energy only being awarded on turn 3. This should help balance out gameplay with no user having a clear advantage until mid-point of the match.

 <p>
  Another big change involves
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  's Typhoid Mary usage. Typhoid Mary worked so well with Surtur that there was backlash about how powerful Mary had become. To address this, Mary's debuff now causes other cards in the location to have -2 power instead of the old -1. This should give players a risk and reward system wherein it could be great to power up Surtur, but at the risk of other cards. Granted, it could still become overpowered if partnered with an Ajax or Zero card.

  Other cards that received some updates were Alioth, Enchantress, Black Widow, Frigga, Shuri, Lockjaw, Stormbreaker, Cerebro, and Elsa Bloodstone. The comments section on
  <em>
   Marvel Snap'
  </em>
  s Twitter announcement showed different reactions to the new update. Many felt that Arishem's debuff killed the card's value. Others mentioned that Cerebro decks in
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  could move to the forefront because of the buff it received. Still, even if players found the update to be a mixed bag, it's still early in the season. It's quite possible that a mid-season balance patch will be coming later on to address even more effects that the new cards, and the changes from the patch have brought in.

  CDPR first confirmed that
  <em>

  </em>
  was in development in March 2022, although it didn't attach an official title to the game. Instead, it merely referenced it by its codename,
  <em>

  The company at last used the name "

With a runtime of over six minutes, the newly shared promo serves as a meticulous introduction to the upcoming RPG's setting. It also confirms its protagonist, Ciri, Geralt's adopted daughter who played a pivotal role in
  <em>

  Ciri Is a Full-Fledged Monster Hunter in The Witcher 4
 </h2>
 <p>
  The video shows an older, more experienced Ciri, who now seems to be a full-fledged monster hunter. As such, the trailer seemingly establishes one particular
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  ending as canon. Ciri is seen taking on a witcher contract in a rural village terrorized by a not-too-friendly monster hungry for ritual sacrifice, with her task ending about as well as one would expect from a new entry in CDPR's now-iconic franchise. Reflecting on the TGA 2024 trailer, game director Sebastian Kalemba confirmed that Ciri will be "the heart of the story" in the upcoming RPG.

  The Witcher 4 World Premiere Trailer Was Likely Pre-Rendered On Nvidia RTX 5090

 <p>
  In a press release accompanying the newly debuted trailer, CDPR confirmed the obvious: the TGA 2024 video was pre-rendered using a custom build of Unreal Engine 5, the company's engine of choice for the fourth
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  game. The developer also revealed that the rendering process utilized an unannounced Nvidia RTX GPU, likely the widely rumored RTX 5090, which is expected to be the crown jewel of the upcoming RTX 50 Series. Nvidia's upcoming lineup of graphics cards is likely to be officially announced at the next edition of CES, which kicks off on January 10, 2025. The announcement itself might happen a day before that, as CES exhibitors often outline their show lineups 24 hours before the event.

  <strong>
   Twitch
  </strong>
  has announced multiple upgrades to its Clips feature along with plans to reward viewers who create and share Clips. In recent months, Twitch has enhanced its Clips function to help creators reach larger audiences faster. Now, it seems the streaming platform is seeking a way of encouraging more viewers to make Clips as well.

 <p>
  Short-form vertical content has become increasingly popular in recent years. While TikTok remains the leading platform in this area, other sites like YouTube and Instagram have joined in on the trend of short videos. In 2016, Twitch introduced Clips, a feature that lets creators cut out memorable moments of a stream. Later, in 2023, the Amazon-owned platforms announced the possibility of creating vertical Clips. The feature proved to be very helpful for streamers to gain more traction on their channels. In September 2024, Twitch further improved vertical Clips for social media sharing so that streamers could easily post them as YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, or TikTok videos. Twitch isn't done promoting Clips though, as the streaming service has new updates in store for the feature.

 <p>
  On December 12, Twitch announced a series of upgrades coming to Clips and teased a rewards system for viewers who create these videos. Twitch revealed a new "Top Clips" panel on the Stream Summary section to help users find and share the most-viewed Clips from each stream. This would aid streamers to better select which Clips to share on their social media. Moreover, Twitch revealed that it's trying out a "Top Clips leaderboard" feature that recognizes which viewers have clipped the most-watched moments of a livestream. Twitch stated that it's already "working on more ways to reward viewers" who often create and share Clips in support of their favorite streamers. The platform did not detail whether these rewards would be monetary, but this could be an important incentive to attract more viewers. Earlier in October, there were rumors that Kick would start paying its viewers as well, so this wouldn't be the first teased monetization strategy on a streaming service.

 <p>
  To help viewers know when it's best to create a Clip, Twitch is experimenting with "Clip Nudges." The feature alerts when a stream's chat is most active and prompts viewers to clip this moment quickly. Additionally, Twitch revealed that its web version's Clips editing tool would be launching on mobile. The Clips Manager has been updated as well, letting users filter videos by date, category, channel, and more. Finally, Twitch said it's giving streamers "more control over which clips show up on discovery surfaces" by allowing them to limit their discoverable clips to Featured Clips only. Sometimes streamers aren't happy with Twitch's upgrades, but the platform often attempts to set things right by enhancing its creator tools, including Clips.

  Twitch's Clips is one of its most popular features. Thanks to the tool, streamers no longer needed external programs to create vertical videos highlighting their streams on their social media, like TikTok or Reels. On the other hand, TikTok might be banned in the US, which could cause a strain on many creators' audience reach.

 <p>
  Flex Gadgets are the first item that players will be introduced to when loading up a game of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic, and while they are not the most important aspect of a player's loadout, they can come in handy if players select the right one that suits their playstyle.
  <strong>
   Flex Gadgets can be chosen at the start of the game
  </strong>
  , with five options available. However, these
  <strong>
   Flex Gadgets cannot be shared with other players
  </strong>
  , meaning that once a player locks in their choice, that Flex Gadget will remain inaccessible to the rest of the team.

 <p>
  While players may initially aim to lock in their favorite Flex Gadget as soon as they get the chance, communication is key here. If playing in a team, be sure to plan accordingly, taking into consideration
  <strong>
   which Flex Gadgets are better suited for which members of the team.
  </strong>
  If a certain player is capable of using the Frag Grenade to a better degree than others, for example, ensure they have priority over that Flex Gadget.

 <p>
  Another key tip is to learn how each Flex Gadget works. For example, Proximity Mines shine at laying traps at the Plant Sites, while Frag Grenades function perfectly for bouncing around corners and into rooms to flush out enemies lurking inside.

  <strong>
   Good crosshair placement
  </strong>
  is a skill that will improve a player's game in any of
  <em>
   Fortnite's
  </em>
  modes, including Battle Royale, but is exceptionally important in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic. Given the game takes place from the first-person perspective, and virtually all weapons feature a sight that players can use for precision aiming, having good aim is going to be one of the main deciding factors for whether players come out on top in most of their gunfights.

 <p>
  With that being said, players should
  <strong>
   be mindful of where they place their crosshairs
  </strong>
  when moving through the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic map. Players can use common practices including
  <strong>
   pre-aiming around corners
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   centering the crosshair while moving
  </strong>
  through the environment, and
  <strong>
   holding their crosshairs at angles, long lines of sight, and key flank routes
  </strong>
  to minimize the need to adjust their aim should an enemy come into view.
 </p>

 <p>
  Players must also be mindful to
  <strong>
   keep their crosshairs high
  </strong>
  , particularly at an enemy's neck or head level, as they play. Doing so will make it much easier to land a headshot, which deals significant damage in
  <em>

  There are a variety of different weapons in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic, from the Nemesis AR to the Reaper Sniper Rifle. Each weapon has its own perks and drawbacks, leaving players to figure out which weapon is the right one for them.

 <p>
  Right now, one of
  <strong>
   the best weapons is undoubtedly the Striker AR
  </strong>
  , thanks to its pinpoint accuracy and solid fire rate for an excellent time-to-kill. That's not all, though, as other weapons can also be viable if they match a player's playstyle.

 <p>
  Looking to get close and personal and dish out great damage? Then
  <strong>
   the Hammer Pump Shotgun may be a good option.
  </strong>
  Players adept at taking opponents down with pinpoint accuracy may instead
  <strong>
   benefit from the Reaper Sniper Rifle or the Hand Cannon
  </strong>
  , especially if they can land consistent headshots. Players should be sure to experiment with each weapon, for they may be surprised at how solid each one is.

     Running low on Credits and need to purchase a weapon? Consider

 <p>
  Credits are an important currency in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic, as the amount of Credits players have in hand will determine how good their loadout will be for later rounds. At the start of each round, players will have the opportunity to purchase weapons, consumables, shields, and other items to add to their loadout, with
  <strong>
   Credits being earned through eliminations and victories.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  While players may be tempted to just spend their Credits on the first item they see, they should
  <strong>
   consider their purchases carefully
  </strong>
  , as doing so can set them up for success in later rounds. During the first round, players will start off with the same weapon and only a limited amount of Credits to purchase the most basic items. During this initial round, it’s best to prioritize getting the essentials, like
  <strong>
   shields to boost health.
  </strong>

 <p>
  Moving on to the next round and onwards, players should
  <strong>
   prioritize getting their weapon of preference
  </strong>
  and then
  <strong>
   upgrading their shields,
  </strong>
  before using any remaining Credits on Flex Gadgets and consumables. This is because, without a solid weapon, players may be at a disadvantage, as they will no longer be on a level playing field like they were during the first round. What players should avoid, however, is spending too much Credits, as they may need some saved up if they are eliminated.

  Though the map feature may initially fly over some players' heads, it can be an effective tool when paid attention to. The biggest benefit of the map is making callouts, as
  <strong>
   the names of each area of the map will be on display
  </strong>
  . The map can also be
  <strong>
   used to study each area
  </strong>
  , allowing players to make a plan for attack. For example, if players are looking to defend the A Site, they should note that there are two main points of entry from the enemy spawn, on either side, making covering both lanes vital for defending the area.
 </p>

 <p>
  Another important aspect is the minimap, which will remain on screen for players to use. The minimap showcases the player's location and provides the names of each point of interest for players to reference. While it doesn’t offer a full map overview, paying attention to the player's surroundings via the minimap can be useful.

 <p>
  For example, if players are progressing around a corner,
  <strong>
   the minimap can give them a better idea of the area
  </strong>
  they are heading into next before they peek, helping to identify potential vantage points enemies may be using.
  <strong>
   The minimap also stays visible when players are blinded by a Flashbang
  </strong>
  or obscured by smoke, allowing them to orient themselves behind cover even when their vision is impaired.

  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic is a round-based shooter at heart, playing similarly to the likes of
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  . While players transitioning from one game to the other may notice some similarities, the gameplay of both games is significantly different.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  , players find that hip-firing while standing still provides pinpoint accuracy, but accuracy generally degrades when moving, encouraging the use of a strategy called Counter Strafing to gain an advantage. While
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic is similar in that
  <strong>
   accuracy is reduced while moving
  </strong>
  , hip-firing in this mode is not particularly effective beyond close range. Instead, since each weapon features a built-in optic,
  <strong>
   aiming down sights is the preferred approach
  </strong>
  for most gunfights.

  For general practices, Assault Rifle and Submachine Gun players benefit greatly from pre-aiming around corners or crouching and aiming down sights when engaging an enemy to minimize their profile. While Shotguns are more forgiving due to their pellet spread, prioritizing aiming down sights with every other weapon will ensure maximum accuracy, especially for long-distance fights.

  Players diving into
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic will find themselves alternating between attacking and defending, with the attackers focusing on planting a Rift Point Device at one of two sites, while the defenders aim to stop them. These roles require players to strategize, and while strategies can be universal for both roles, there are a few key things to keep in mind. Firstly, when attacking,
  <strong>
   players should always ensure they have teammates with them.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":10,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":10,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1012} -->
 <!-- Zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":11,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":11,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  While fully stacking one site can sometimes pay off, it is risky, especially if a competent team is defending either site. Instead, players should split up, sending a team of two or three on the offensive in the area with the most action, while the Rift Point Device carrier is protected by another player to plant at the targeted site.
 </p>

 <p>
  Likewise,
  <strong>
   defenders must ensure they have players covering both sites
  </strong>
  at the start of the round. As the round progresses and the opposition is thinned out, or if their own team members are eliminated, defenders can then converge on a single site as needed.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic being a first-person shooter experience without the traditional building system,
  <strong>
   cover plays a vital role in shielding players
  </strong>
  from incoming damage. There is plenty of cover available throughout the map, such as boxes, walls, and other structures, all effective at providing protection. Players should make full use of cover during matches, as it is their primary form of defense.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Practices players should adopt include
  <strong>
   positioning themselves near cover before entering a gunfight
  </strong>
  , enabling them to duck behind it quickly if needed. Additionally, players should generally
  <strong>
   peek from the right side of an object
  </strong>
  , as this exposes their weapon first rather than their body, minimizing incoming damage while still allowing them to return fire.

  Bubble Grenades can also serve as an effective form of cover in open areas, providing protection when planting or defusing the Rift Point Device.

  When it comes to a player's loadout, consumables are generally put on the back burner if players need to prioritize acquiring a good weapon and some shield. However, if players have a few Credits to spare,
  <strong>
   getting hold of consumables can be a game-changer.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  There are currently only two consumables in the loot pool for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic, each with its own perks. The first consumable is the Flashbang, a go-to for many players for one key reason:
  <strong>
   Flashbangs have the advantage of blinding any player
  </strong>
  near them upon detonation, making them a great tool for breaching areas that enemy players are holding and generally making fights easier.

  <strong>

  JRPGs are commonly remembered for their epic narratives, memorable characters, and complex combat systems. However, not everything in a hero's life revolves around battles. In many games of the genre, players have the opportunity to engage in non-combat activities that provide moments of relaxation and decompression, serving as an alternative for those who want to enjoy the game without engaging with the main plot.

 <p>
  In some cases, players might attend classes and form new friendships, while in others, they could challenge the region's top anglers or take part in a thrilling kart race, showing that, with a bit of creativity, it's possible to add diverse content to each game. As a result, there are many
  <strong>
   non-combat activities in JRPGs
  </strong>
  for players to enjoy.

  The premise of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
   </em>
  </strong>
  is that players are given the opportunity to study at one of the best schools in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  world. To succeed, players must not only participate in Pokemon battles but also attend classes. These classes, divided into various subjects, challenge gamers to answer questions about Pokemon battles and the characteristics of different species.

  In
  <em>
   Trails to Azure

  , players can help save the Crossbell Fisherman's Guild by challenging the Elite Four - an obvious nod to
  <em>

  - composed of the region's top anglers. What begins as a simple task develops into a side quest with its own progression, adding incredible content for players who wish to take a break from the main objectives.

 <p>
  Players can explore Yokohama and engage in mini-games such as karaoke, darts, classic arcades, kart racing, and even business management, where the goal is to turn a failing company into a profitable empire. As a result, players may find themselves spending more time on side activities than on the clashes between Japanese mafia clans.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Fire Emblem: Three Houses
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a tactical JRPG set in the Garreg Mach Monastery, where three groups of students from different regions of the continent live and participate in school activities. In addition to its focus on combat and a twist-filled storyline, the game shines with its non-combat activities, such as group meals, fishing, event planning, and dating sim mechanics.

 <p>
  As the monastery's new professor, players must build bonds with their students, guiding them in both battle proficiency and personal growth. Additionally, the game incorporates some time-management mechanics, requiring players to carefully select the activities they will undertake each day, as time is somewhat limited.

  .
  <strong>
   <em>
    Persona 5 Royal
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers an extensive range of activities. The game’s premise involves the player being part of a group that fights societal evils while leading a normal high school life and engaging in typical teenage activities.

  Set over the course of a one-year calendar, the game provides various school and personal life activities, such as strengthening friendships, studying for exams, and much more. Many of these additional activities help the protagonist enhance their own Personas or those of their allies, granting more advantages during the dungeons in the main missions.

   <strong>
    Donkey Kong Bananza
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Freezer Layer introduces players to the Zebra Bananza, but only once you're able to navigate the first half of the stage and reach the Zebra Elder. Along the way you'll have to make use of Ice terrain and stalactites to cool lava and create paths across dangerous sections of the map.

  The Freezer layer is one of two locations players of
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Bananza
  </em>
  can choose to visit after reaching the Divide, with the other being the Forest Layer. Unlocking Zebra Bananza in the Freezer layer will provide DK with a substantial upgrade to his speed, allowing him to sprint across wide areas at tremendous speed, assuming his Bananza Energy is full.

  After landing in the Freezer Layer, your first order of business is grabbing that bunch of Banandium Gems that fell down ahead of you. With that handled, you can head down the path to find a snowboarding slope and a chunk of terrain just begging for you to turf surf it. Grab it and ride down the slope to meet a Zebra, who'll give you your first main objective for this Layer: Cross the Crumbly Bridge and see what's going on. Heading for the spot he marked, preferably by turf surfing, you'll find some more Zebra hanging around near the bridge. Speaking to one of them will have them explain that something's wrong with the cooling tower and they'd like you to investigate.

 <p>
  Complicating the matter of investigating the cooling tower, the crumbly bridge is made of a crumbly material that will drop out from under you, and DK isn't fast enough to cross it. Luckily, there's an alternative, but slower, route directly beneath the bridge, so drop down there and head into the caves. Inside these caves you'll encounter two major obstacles, lava terrain and rolling enemies. Luckily, we can use the latter to deal with the former. Just punch them once to shatter their shell, then hit them again to send them flying away from you. If you aim them at the lava terrain they'll clear it away as they fly, and if you need to clear any more you can hit it with ice or snow terrain to cool it, then break it with a punch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Use these techniques to navigate up through the caves until you arrive at the far side of the crumbly bridge, then continue onward to find a village and the path to the cooling tower. A Zebra near the bridge to the cooling tower will point out that you can't cross the bridge for the same reason that you couldn't cross crumbly bridge earlier, and suggest meeting with the Zebra Elder to learn a new Bananza that can help. This will mark a new destination for you.

  Your next destination is Coolstripe Cavern, but it's blocked by more of that purple material we keep seeing. You can find the machine producing it hidden inside a house nearby (see image 1 above) and once you've broken it you can use a machine near the cavern entrance to blow away the rocks and head inside.

  Snag a Banandium Gem on the way inside and skate across the ice, taking out the rolling enemies as you go. Following the cavern will lead you to a hall filled with falling stalactites. After passing them, you'll reach a gap with a stalactite hanging over it. Hitting the stalactite with a chunk of thrown terrain will cause it to fall, creating a path forward. Rinse and repeat this as you proceed through the caves to create a path for yourself. Take the opportunity to build a getaway and heal up if needed once you reach the area shown in image 2.

  Continue traversing the cave, using stalactites to bridge gaps, and soon you'll reach an area where you need to scale an icy wall to proceed, with an enemy nearby. Smacking the enemy toward the wall will strip away the ice, revealing a climbable layer beneath it that you can use to head on up. Hit the checkpoint and continue on to find a Zebra looking down at a Void Stake. To reach it you'll need to clear away some of the lava terrain on the wall, which you can do in the same way you cleared the ice off the previous wall, or by throwing ice terrain at it to cool it into obsidian. once the path is clear, climb up to the Void Stake, break it, and head down to the next sublevel.

  Down on Sublevel 501, it's a lot hotter, and you'll need to make use of ice terrain and stalactites to cool the lava so you can progress further. Build the Getaway nearby for healing and a health boost, then start traversing the islands and moving toward the objective. Whenever you see a shadow of a stalactite hanging over lava, that means it'll either fall when you get close, cooling the lava and creating a path, or that you can throw something at it to drop it onto the lava, achieving the same effect.

  Once you reach the island with the Fractone made of ice standing on it, grab some Ice and use it to cool the lava blocking the path to the island closest to the objective. Here, you can use the Hand Slap to raise a pillar, leading you to a vantage point where you can throw terrain at a huge stalactite and drop it onto the island below. Drop back down, grab chunks out of that stalactite, and throw them to cool the wall of lava terrain until you can climb up to the top and reach the Zebra Village.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the Zebra Village you can speak to the Elder, who will offer to teach you the Zebra Bananza if you restore the Ancient Record. It's been split into three pieces, and three zebra nearby will tell you exactly where to go if you speak to them.

  To find the first Record Piece, follow the path down to the spot shown in the first image above. You'll need to head over to the ice machine on the left, activate it, and then smash the terrain to redirect the ice into the lava, creating a path to the first piece of the record. Carry it back to the Elder (use it to turf surf over lava as needed, it can't break) and then head back in the same direction again to look for the second piece.

  Use the shortcut cannon in the Village to get back up to the Cooling Tower, and use your new Zebra Bananza to follow the crumbling path all the way up to the top and get inside. Clear away the snow on the floor to find a spot where you can dig down to get inside the cooling tower proper, where you'll trigger a boss fight with Poppy Kong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Poppy Kong turns herself invisible, but you can easily handle her by using Zebra Bananza, working out where she is from the terrain she breaks as she moves, and charging into her to stun her. Repeat this three times to win the battle in no time at all. After she's beaten, speak to her to snag the key that'll open the path leading further down.

  On the next floor of the Cooling Tower, you'll find a Zebra and an Ice Machine. Speak to the Zebra to learn where the path to the next floor is, then dig a path under the ice machine to direct the falling ice onto the lava, cooling it and allowing you to dig down to the next floor.

  On this new sublevel, head right for the big tower in the middle, which has an ice machine switch on it, and pull the switch. Then head to the area to the left of the tower where a crumbly path will build itself as you run on it. Use Zebra Bananza to run across this path and reach the ice machine, where you can then break the blockage and cause ice to fall down toward the lava walls up ahead. once they cool part of the lava wall, use Kong Bananza's charged punch to blow a hole in the lava wall, rinse and repeat until you've made a path of obsidian all the way to the Condenser.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jump into the Condenser to reach the final boss of the Freezer Layer.

  Inflammonite is the boss of this Layer, and you'll be able to take them out pretty quickly and easily thanks to Zebra Bananza. Sprint around to avoid it as it rolls at you, then grab some snow when it falls from the ceiling and throw it at Inflammonite to stun it. After it gets encased in stone, dig it out and smack it to make it run away. It'll create a crumbling path behind it as it slowly gets higher into the air, so chase after it and hit it to deal a ton of damage. When you do this it will ignite again and the cycle repeats. Complete this whole process three times and Inflammonite will go down.

   To trigger the Traces of Chroma quest in
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
   , players must complete The World is Your Canvas quest (Sunspray Summer Resort Part 2) and then use an Asha to paint the building in front of the NPC saying "No vandalization..." in Easybreeze Market
  </strong>
  . This will force Cozatl, the NPC, to speak with you and start the quest.

  Next, travelers are taken to a cafe, where they must use an Asha to help paint it by following certain instructions. Make sure
  <strong>
   the walls are yellow
  </strong>
  while the
  <strong>
   awnings and parasols are a different color
  </strong>
  . After a small cutscene, wait one in-game day to be taken to another shop to complete a painting commission.

  Nothing quite beats an open-world game. Taking those first tentative steps onto a map filled with secrets to uncover, quests to complete, and interesting characters to encounter leaves players feeling a desire to explore and see what they find. It’s a wholly unique experience for the video game medium, but it can be somewhat overwhelming at times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Large game worlds can be daunting, especially in modern times when there are so many stellar games to play and so little time for players to enjoy them. That's why it’s refreshing when a map can be traversed rapidly. Here are some of the best open-world games where exploration is fast, ranked based on a combination of each game’s overall quality and popularity, plus the fun factor of their travel methods.

  Despite positive reviews, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Prototype
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise only ever spawned two entries, but they really made an impact. The debut game in particular, stylized as
  <em>
   [Prototype]
  </em>
  , was praised for its originality at the time. Players take control of an amnesiac shapeshifter, Alex Mercer, who is caught in the middle of a conspiracy and must unlock powerful abilities to take down strange monsters and sinister forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alex’s skills go well beyond combat, with movement around the Manhattan setting being completely fluid and rapid. Not only can he sprint at super speed indefinitely, but Alex can also jump to incredible heights, glide through the air, and scale buildings without losing momentum or taking damage. Descending from a high enough altitude will even leave a crater in the ground, damaging enemies.

  Every entry in the
  <em>
   Just Cause
  </em>
  series is full of thrilling and high-octane action, making players feel like some kind of unstoppable god.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Just Cause 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is arguably the best of the bunch. Its 400-square mile map is one of the most fun to explore, thanks to the gadgets Rico Rodriguez has at his disposal to cause as much mayhem as possible and leave the scene without being caught.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the fictional Southeast Asian island of Panau, Rico can slingshot across the map thanks to the unique grappling hook and parachute combination. Almost anything is possible to pull off stunts like those in blockbuster action films, from vehicle surfing and hanging off helicopters to base jumping from tall buildings and mountains.

  Much like its predecessor,
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set in an enticing open world full of mysteries and enthralling quests. Just as before, Link must travel to each region of Hyrule to unlock fast travel. He can sprint, glide, and ride horses to do so, but the Zonai devices introduced in
  <em>
   TOTK
  </em>
  are game-changing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Fuse power, granted to Link through his new arm, allows for an unprecedented level of creativity when it comes to construction. Some crafty players have built devices that are capable of venturing across Hyrule with great speed and precision, whether hovering, staying close to the ground, or flying high among the newly formed sky islands.

  A PlayStation exclusive and part of a franchise deserving of a comeback,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infamous Second Son
   </em>
  </strong>
  stars the charismatic Delsin Rowe, who can use his newly acquired superpowers for good or evil. The fictionalized version of Seattle is under the authoritarian Department of Unified Protection, but Delsin’s powers make the city his playground as he soars across it and leaves behind nothing but graffiti.
 </p>
 <p>
  As players progress through the game, Delsin’s powers become stronger, but even at their weakest it’s effortless to run up the side of buildings or use things like neon and smoke to zoom around the Emerald City. The standalone prequel,
  <em>
   First Light,
  </em>
  also features similarly gratifying navigation around the map with Fetch’s neon powers.

  In a major departure from the prior games,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Saints Row 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  is somehow even more ridiculous and over-the-top than fans expected, despite the precedent set by its predecessors. Now President of the United States, the protagonist and much of the gang are trapped in a simulation of Steelport by the invading aliens known as the Zin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thankfully, some of the Saints were able to hack into the system and give the player superpowers, many of which can be utilized in combat. Super speed and strength allow for speedy and seamless travel around the map, plus they can even jump over buildings and smash nuisances like vehicles out of the way.

  The conclusion of the stellar
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  trilogy,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Batman: Arkham Knight
   </em>
  </strong>
  features arguably the best gameplay and most fun world to explore of the trio. Gotham City is ready for Bruce Wayne’s superhero persona to investigate, whether making use of his many infamous gadgets or driving in the specially designed Batmobile.
 </p>
 <p>
  The iconic vehicle is not simply a car, but it is a major part of the gameplay mechanics, used to adventure on the city’s roads, complete puzzles, and subdue enemies during combat. Glide mechanics are much improved compared to prior entries in the series, allowing the Dark Knight to stay in the air much longer thanks to the grapnel gun and line launcher.

  is set in an expanded New York City compared to its predecessor, with the addition of Brooklyn and Queens. Peter Parker and Miles Morales are the two playable characters, both of whom can unlock various suits and ability upgrades to improve combat and traversal options.
 </p>
 <p>
  Freely swapping between the two allows for the completion of unique quests for each character, and the expanded city is full of activities. It’s also thrilling to web swing between the skyscrapers of Manhattan and utilize the Web Wings to glide around the metropolis. Wind tunnels even provide an extra speed boost, so the Spider-Men can cover more ground in no time.

  Given the recurring 22-minute time loop, quick exploration is somewhat necessary in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Outer Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  , though that does not mean that there is any particular rush. Blasting off from planet to planet takes a matter of minutes, as the mysteries of the Nomai and the time loop are gradually uncovered throughout a solar system where the star goes supernova every 22 minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite these tight time limits, players are still encouraged to scour every nook and cranny to take in as many nuggets of information as possible. Exploration is unrivaled in
  <em>
   Outer Wilds.
  </em>
  Those who are most observant and curious are rewarded with a unique gameplay experience, and an adventure that will stay with them long after the credits roll.

   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes the classic board game to the next level with exciting events, tournaments, and daily challenges called
  <strong>
   Quick Wins.
  </strong>
  Quick Wins are simple, everyday tasks that reward you with new emojis, stickers, cash, and even dice rolls. Each day, you'll receive three tasks to complete within 24 hours.

  When you complete a Quick Wins task, you earn points that contribute to a weekly progress bar. At the end of each week, you’ll win the grand prize if you’ve completed your Quick Wins every day. This is usually a five-star Purple Sticker Pack, but it can sometimes be a Wild Sticker too. Read on to learn about the Quick Wins you can complete today and get one step closer to unlocking the grand prize.

   <strong>
    Updated July 31, 2025, by Usama Ali:
   </strong>
   Monopoly GO’s Quick Wins remain one of the easiest ways to collect free rewards every day. Each day, you're given three simple tasks, like rolling a set number of dice or landing on certain tiles, that take just a few minutes to complete. Every task you finish earns you useful rewards like dice rolls, cash, and event tokens, all of which can help you progress through an active event. If you finish your Quick Wins daily for seven days straight, you’ll unlock a Purple Sticker Pack at the end of the week. These packs guarantee at least one 5-star sticker, which can help you close sets in the Summer Escape Album. This guide breaks down this week's Quick Wins, so you can get the most out of your daily grind without burning through your dice.

      <title>Brutal, Intimate, and Clever: The 'Core Aesthetics' Behind Wartorn</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/brutal-intimate-clever-wartorn-gameplay-aesthetics-explained/</link>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Wartorn
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a roguelite real-time strategy game under development by Stray Kite Studios, a team co-founded by industry veteran Paul Hellquist. Hellquist boasts an impressive pedigree: over the last two decades, Hellquist has served as the creative director behind
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  , a lead designer for
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  , and as a lead designer for
  <em>
   SWAT 4
  </em>
  , among other projects. With a background largely in first-person shooters, a roguelite strategy game is certainly a change of pace for the seasoned developer, but it's a project he appears to be more than equipped to tackle.

  In a conversation with Game Rant, Hellquist spoke about
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  and its development process. According to Hellquist, each game he works on tends to identify several major qualities to lean into, which are aesthetic rather than mechanical; these "Core Aesthetics" drive every decision behind the game, leading to a project that's aesthetically and thematically unified.

  "Core Aesthetics" refers to the feelings that developers aim to evoke in players, and in
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  's case, the chosen aesthetics include brutal, intimate, and clever. Each of these aesthetic qualities influences the game's direction in some way, such as how brutality influenced the game's often bleak narrative events or its gore and dismemberment features. Hellquist explains:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "Every game that I work on, we identify “Core Aesthetics” that we are trying to achieve. These are the emotions or feelings that we are trying to evoke in our players. For Wartorn, they are: Brutal, Intimate, and Clever. As you can see, these are not mechanics. We start with the aesthetics and then design mechanics that will lead to player behavior (dynamics) that result in players feeling these aesthetics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Brutal influenced the tone of many of the narrative events and other pieces of the story, as well as leading to things like gore and dismemberment, and the idea of trying to help refugees find new hope.
  </p>
  <p>
   Intimate comes through in the relationship between our heroes, Yara and Elani, as well as their connections and yearning for their family. It also influenced how close the camera is during battles, how many squads we allow you to control, and why we name all of the squads.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clever leads to the elemental combos and rogue-lite “builds” entering into the design to allow players to feel like they are finding loopholes in the game design to increase their potency."
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Using aesthetic traits in this way is a unique approach to game design, where many developers often opt to design around specific mechanics or features and then shape an aesthetic around them. By establishing a set of emotions that underpin each design decision,
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  has become an evocative real-time strategy game.

 <p>
  As for a particular quality that was important to nail in
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  , Hellquist singled out the game's gory and visceral combat, which pairs with the intimacy players feel thanks to persistent squads that grow over time—only to be torn to bloody shreds at a moment's notice. He says:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "Getting the visceral combat that we loved from Myth: The Fallen Lords was high on my list. I also wanted more intimate combat where I could grow my squads and come to feel like they have been on the journey and grown with me.
  </p>
  <p>
   After that, the next element to get right is marrying the overworld storytelling portion of the game to the battles. To be honest with you, we are still working on this with the help of our community. I don’t think we have fully achieved our goals here yet, but that is a focus for us during this Early Access period. We are doing something really different and are learning as we go."
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Hellquist admits that
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  still has some work to do in another key area: having overworld events play a deeper role in shaping the game's battles. Still, there's plenty of time for the Early Access game to achieve its vision, and with an experienced developer like Hellquist at the helm,
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  is in good hands.

  As you make your way through the new map of Hyrule in
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  , it's important to know
  <strong>
   how to save
  </strong>
  your hard-earned progress. While making your way from region to region, it's easy to get caught up in the action and forget to take a moment to save. Some games even force you to jump through hoops just to create a new save point. Luckily,
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is not one of those games. Here, we'll show you how to save your progress in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  and how to
  <strong>
   load a previous save.

  Like most
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  can be a bit overwhelming when you are first released onto the massive open-world map. Before you know it, you'll either be completely absorbed in the classic dungeons, or you'll be off completing one of the many side-quests found through exploration. What you may not be thinking about, is
  <strong>
   saving your game
  </strong>
  . It's good for every player then, that
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  has an extremely simple saving process, and a fairly robust autosave mechanic.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Simpsons: Tapped Out
  </em>
  is a mobile game from EA that lets players build their own version of Springfield and manage it. As
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  series itself has been running since 1989 and gots original start back in 1987, there was plenty of material to plug into the game, including iconic characters, businesses, and plotlines. The game has been huge among fans of the series, as it's packed full of references to some of fans' favorite episodes and plots, regardless of what part of the
  <em>
   Simpsons
  </em>
  series they consider to be the best.

  As one might expect, devoted fans to the game aren't happy about this sudden news. On various social media sites, several fans expressed confusion at the announcement, as the title just added new content in the form of the "A Bart Future" update that ran from August until September 18. Some players are also understandably upset at having recently purchased the in-game donut currency, given that the game's days are now numbered. Players were also expecting the game's Halloween update to arrive soon, as
  <em>
   The Simpson
  </em>
  's long-running annual Halloween episodes have been a part of the franchise for ages, and the game was no different.

 <p>
  Sadly, EA has given no indication that the game will be made available in any other way, even as an offline title. It's also not clear why it chose to shut it down just now. EA, like other game companies, has seen numerous layoffs over the last year or so. While
  <em>
   The Simpsons: Tapped Out
  </em>
  was a huge earner for the company initially, it's entirely possible that popularity for it has tapered off and purchases may not be worth the cost of running the game anymore for the publisher. In any case, fans of
  <em>
   The Simpsons
  </em>
  who want to revisit the game one last time should plan on doing so soon.

  Surviving in
  <em>
   Life Sentence
  </em>
  is not easy at all, as danger awaits you at every step. And no matter whose side you take, sometimes even players from your faction can attack you. Therefore, the first thing you should do is look for weapons. Of course, you can buy them or craft them. But these methods take quite a lot of time. Instead, players can redeem
  <em>
   Life Sentence
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":932} -->

  With their help, you will receive various goodies in just a few seconds. And even if they only reward you with Cash, you will be able to buy weapons without any problems. However, a certain time after the release, each of the
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  codes expires. Therefore, you should use them as soon as possible.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <em>
   Dummy UTMM
  </em>
  is a horror fighting game that stands out among other
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  experiences due to its truly creepy gameplay and mysterious atmosphere. The essence of the game is simple - accumulate resources and currency to buy equipment and confront NPC bosses and enemies, of which there are quite a lot.
 </p>

 <p>
  To avoid being destroyed in a few seconds, especially at the very beginning, you can redeem
  <em>
   Dummy UTMM
  </em>
  codes, which will be a great boost for newbies and a nice bonus for experienced players. The rewards from the codes are plenty of useful things, such as weapons, currency, and items that will improve your stats, so don't neglect them.

  Luckily, redeeming
  <em>
   Dummy UTMM

  codes is much easier than confronting dangerous enemies, and similarly to other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, the whole process will take you a few seconds. However, if you don't understand how it works, or haven't redeemed codes before at all, here is a detailed guide for you:

   Launch

   Pay attention to the right side of the screen. There will be a black button labeled Codes. Click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   This will open the redemption menu. There will be an input field and a gray Redeem button below it. Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above-mentioned active codes into the input field.

  <li>
   Lastly, click on the gray Redeem button to submit your reward request.

 <p>
  The long line of
  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  consoles and their portable siblings has given rise to some of the best titles on the market today, many of which (for better or worse) are exclusive to the PlayStation family of consoles.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  It can be a bit of a double-edged sword with these more obscure exclusive titles, or even some cult classic titles that simply never got revived, as the fast-digitizing world of gaming media has left these physical copies to malinger away. PlayStation's considerable backlog of exclusive games have left many titles off the shelves for good — and a few of these titles were, frustratingly, some incredibly high quality games.

  as a series has made a rather interesting, if somewhat convoluted, jump. The title exclusive to Xbox for its first installment, and then became exclusive to the PlayStation 2 for its sequel. Many things remain from the original title, such as the ability to play as Sho, the dedicated detective and soldier from the first title. Joining Sho is a new female playable character, Feanay, who trades out the slow and heavy hits of Sho for a more agile playstyle.

 <p>
  This is a fast-paced action shooter with a lot of fascinating ways to change attack styles and use new techniques to mow down hordes of alien enemies. There isn't much follow up from the first game besides the protagonist and setting, which means anyone lucky enough to stumble onto a physical copy of this will be set to get right into the game. This title actually has a lot of nuance and subtext for what is a flashy game with explosions in space, and while the action will pull players in, like a lot of good sci-fi games, the story will keep them there.

  This still-unsettling title redefined what it meant to be a horror game for an entire generation of players. There are so many moving parts to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and what made it work on a fundamental level as an exploration and horror title — which is ironic considering the uneasy, static nature of the town Silent Hill — is also part of what makes the game so compelling. Harry Mason is a likable, relatable, rational protagonist with the goal of finding his daughter, something that players can get behind.

 <p>
  There is a frequent discussion over the pros and cons of the
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  remake coming down the line, but the first game, while definitely not forgotten by players, does seem content to remain a cultural artifact, with no real way to play it as it's long been off the shelves. Whether or not players can agree on how the sequels surpassed (or failed to surpass) this original title, no one can argue just how influential
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  has been to the genre.

  <em>
   7th Dragon,
  </em>
  as a series, finds itself in a long line of JRPGs that won't hold the player's hand. Completing the title to 100% — or at all — is a difficult task. Similar to
  <em>
   Crimson Sea 2
  </em>
  , this successor title is a sequel to a different console exclusive, but
  <em>
   <strong>
    7th Dragon 2020-2
   </strong>
  </em>
  allows players to jump right in to a party builder JRPG with a lot of fascinating mechanics, similar to JRPGs like
  <em>
   Etrian Odyssey
  </em>
  but with a distinct neo-modern, cyberpunk-ish style.

  The game has some incredible graphics considering its running on the PSP. Its gameplay revolves around slaying monstrous, stylized dragons, and the in-depth combat system really meshes well with the party building.
  <em>
   7th Dragon: Code VFD
  </em>
  on the 3DS was a worthy successor to this title, but it doesn't help the disappointment that this game can't be bought today. Also, Miku Hatsune shows up at one point, so... there's that.

  For a while,
  <strong>
   <em>
    P.T.
   </em>
  </strong>
  took the internet by storm, with every YouTuber and their mother rushing out to play what was supposed to be a 'playable teaser' for a new
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  title. What players got was easily one of the most unsettling and disturbing video games to come out of 2014; and all for free, to boot. The game bent the player's sense of familiarity into something gruesome and awful, with a quaint, suburbian house becoming filled with more and more gruesome displays, underlying a troubling story of abuse.

  was delisted after Hideo Kojima and Konami had some fairly significant (and fairly public) disagreements, leading to Kojima parting ways with the company. Konami further disappointed fans by delisting
  <em>
   P.T.
  </em>
  and scrapping any plans for the
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  game Kojima had in the works, although without the legendary game director there to give it life, perhaps it's best Konami left
  <em>
   P.T.
  </em>
  to drift away like an ominous shadow in a dark hallway.
  <em>
   P.T.

  spiritually lives on through unofficial remakes and Kojima's vision, but players won't be able to get their hands on the original title anymore.

   <em>
    Bushido Blade
   </em>
  </strong>
  was an incredibly unique title at launch, and nearly 30 years later, there are some aspects of it that remain entirely novel. This fighting game doesn't feature any health bars, instead holding the threat of a single lethal blow above both the player and their opponent's heads. Featuring a variety of weapons that are each welded differently, playable characters with different stats, and alternate stances to hold each weapon in, this was a high-lethality fighting game with an emphasis on customization.

 <p>
  Not many games have that same level of dedication to realistically-lethal combat packaged in an action-packed story and built around such unique fighting mechanics. This game and its sequel can not be purchased nowadays, which is a shame considering how well some of these innovations would hold up on modern systems.

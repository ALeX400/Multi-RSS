      Players affected by issues will get their Raid Passes back, but Niantic hasn't specified the regions for this rerun.

  Niantic has announced that it will be organizing a makeup event for Mega Lucario Raid Day on Sunday, August 27, due to some issues that were encountered by a few
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  players.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players will also be getting some rewards as part of the compensation, but Niantic has not announced exactly which regions will get the rerun.

 <p>
  While the previous Ultra Unlock event witnessed the arrival of Maushold in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , all eyes were on the Strength of Steel event. Fans have been eagerly waiting for the arrival of mega evolutions of Metagross and Lucario for years now, and they finally got the latter. Despite the hype around the event, it seems like it has had its fair share of issues.

 <p>
  In a new tweet, Niantic Support has announced compensation for players who were affected by issues during the Mega Lucario Raid Day in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Apparently, some players were not able to get the Mega Lucario Raid Day ticket bonuses after 5 pm. This issue only affected players in certain time zones. To compensate for the problems faced by the players, Niantic is extending the Mega Lucario Raid Day as well as the ticket bonuses to Sunday, July 28, from 12 pm to 5 pm local time for only those players who were affected.

  Additionally, players will also be getting back the Raid Passes they used, and along with that, they will also get 5 Star Pieces and 5 Lucky Eggs in
  <em>

  . While all that might sound quite lucrative, the strange thing is that Niantic hasn't announced which time zones will be getting this makeup event. The fact that Niantic had to rerun the event suggests that quite a significant number of players were affected. However, Niantic keeping the specifics under wraps is something that has left fans perplexed.

 <p>
  This is not the only issue that players faced during the Mega Lucario Raid Day. In fact, some players reported that the Mega Energy awarded when walking with Lucario was also bugged in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Instead of 25 Mega Energy, which is the norm for 5km buddy Pokemon, players were reportedly getting 15 Mega Energy. Whether Niantic addresses this issue as part of the upcoming event is something that remains to be seen.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  was released in 2015, bringing with it a fresh innovation in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise - settlement building. This mechanic went one step further than simply owning a hideout or renting a room by enabling a player to truly manipulate the environment, creating a personalized, imaginative settlement. It doesn't end with just one settlement, though -
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  contains no fewer than 37 settlements, from the relatively understated buildings to the simply enormous, open spaces.

 <p>
  For years, players have worked to construct the most inventive builds possible. With the added assistance of creativity-focused mods, some fantastic settlements have emerged from the
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  community since 2015. However, while there are dozens of possible settlements to claim in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , not all of them are worth it, and only a few among them can be considered "endgame bases." These are the locations where players can retire, build their final settlement, and finally hang up the Pip-Boy.

  <em>
   Fallout 4 was Bethesda's first Fallout game with settlement-building mechanics. Players can create bustling towns filled with people from all over the Commonwealth. There are lots of settlements that the player can unlock while exploring post-war Boston. From Sanctuary Hills to Echo Lake Lumber, there are lots of fantastic places to build cool creative settlements with the tools and talent made available to them through the Sole Survivor's exploration of the wasteland across Fallout 4 and its various DLCs.

  Above the outpost is a large freeway.
  <strong>
   It's possible to build on top of the road,

  making it the perfect place to build a settlement. The road above is long and flat, making it an easy place to build on. Also, it offers fantastic views of the surrounding areas.

    Nuka-World

  </strong>
  the final DLC released in the
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  lifecycle, which coincidentally serves as something of an endgame expansion. It pushes the player into a hostile theme park environment, overrun by raiders and all manner of mutated creatures.

  Bizarrely, in the considerably vast and diverse map of Nuka-World, there is just
  <em>
   one
  </em>
  settlement - the Nuka-World Red Rocket. While it's not the most beautiful setting for an endgame build, it's an iconic brand in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  universe, and it offers a relatively large, open build space.

  Graygarden is one of
  <em>
   Fallout 4's
  </em>
  strangest settlements.
  <strong>
   It is run by a handful of helpful robots.
  </strong>
  The robots that call this place home may be a little odd, but they are surprisingly friendly. The area itself is located on a hillside. This helps to make spotting attackers pretty easy.

 <p>
  As for the build area, while there isn't a lot of free land to build on, players can incorporate the road above into their build. Also, one of the robots, Supervisor Brown, will purchase Mufruit from the player for 2 Caps each. While it's not much, since Mutfruit is easy to farm, players can make a decent chunk of change by simply harvesting the nearby Mutfruit.

  Kingsport Lighthouse was originally occupied by the Children of Atom, who are hilariously 'powering' the lighthouse by entrapping a Glowing One at the top of it. It's a unique location that boasts a large build area, but it's a great endgame settlement for the sheer diversity of what's on offer. Firstly, there's a large, central building, alongside which is a towering, complete lighthouse. At the back of the property is a mostly undamaged pier, which houses further, smaller buildings.

 <p>
  <strong>
   It's one of the best base canvases for a settlement,
  </strong>
  especially considering most of the buildings are undamaged. For players that want a unique retirement home, there's the option to build at the very top of the lighthouse, upon which the player can survey the wide, open world of the Commonwealth Wasteland.

  Croup Manor is tucked away from most of the dangers of the Commonwealth. Located on a stretch of land on the eastern side of the map, this location is right on the water's edge, which helps to keep enemies away. While the manor itself is in pretty bad shape,
  <strong>
   the land around the manor is great for building a settlement
  </strong>
  that can house lots of settlers.

 <p>
  Since the settlement is surrounded on two sides by water, it is pretty easy to defend. A couple of well-armed settlers placed on guard posts should be enough to ward off any attackers.

  Bunker Hill is home to several notable NPCs. It's the place where traveling traders get some much-needed rest. It's surrounded by walls which help to keep attackers at bay, and it has a market in the main building where players can sell their wares.

  While it can be a difficult place to build due to the many existing structures, a skilled builder can do quite a lot with Bunker Hill.

  Echo Lake Lumber is one of four settlements that the player can obtain in Far Harbor. Like most of the locations in Far Harbor, Echo Lake Lumber gives players an unsettling feeling when roaming around this area. While the area is quite large, there are lots of pre-existing structures that can get in the way. But, if the player is an experienced builder, then these buildings shouldn't be much of an issue.

 <p>
  <strong>
   There are some interesting stories tied to this location.
  </strong>
  Players can also decide the fate of the settlers, as there's a creepy guy called Malcolm who has a taste for human flesh.

  Egret Tours Marina is probably the most visually inviting settlement that players can obtain. There are several pre-existing buildings that are in pretty good shape considering how long they have been left to rot. The marina itself is a great place to place a handful of Industrial Water Purifiers to make some extra caps.

  <strong>
   There's quite a lot that can be done with this settlement
  </strong>
  to make it more welcoming to visitors. As far as
  <em>

  goes, players will be hard-pushed to find a more visually pleasing location.

  Located on the western side of the map, Sunshine Tidings Co-op is a nice farming settlement with
  <strong>
   lots of open space and sturdy cabins to build in.
  </strong>
  Before the war, this place was just a regular run of the mill farm. But now, with a little elbow grease and a few materials, this area can be turned into a countryside escape where settlers can go to feel safe.

 <p>
  There's a big barn in the center and a handful of buildings that circle the exterior perimeter of the building area. These buildings provide natural cover and shelter from potential threats. With a bit of creativity, this seemingly regular farm can be turned into a central hub for settlers and traders alike.

  Found nestled in the fog-ridden island in Far Harbor,
  <strong>
   Longfellow's Cabin is a brilliant endgame settlement for one key reason:
  </strong>
  it's
  <em>
   already
  </em>
  an endgame settlement for someone else. When the player meets Longfellow, they're introduced to a surly yet helpful individual who has been leathered and wizened by decades in the wasteland. He decided to house himself away from the core settlements in Far Harbor, opting to get a little peace and quiet.

 <p>
  As a result of this move, Longfellow's Cabin is in an undisturbed area of the map, set in an area full of trees and perched atop a small cliff that boasts clear-ish views of the map. It's one of four settlements introduced in Far Harbor, and it makes a perfect location to build that ideal retirement property.

  Abernathy Farm is one of the settlements that the player will encounter pretty quickly after leaving the vault. Built underneath a large power pylon, Abernathy Farm is home to the Abernathy family. After helping the family, the sole survivor will be able to take control of the settlement.

  Starlight Drive-In is one of the settlements that players can get their hands on relatively early. It is a great end-game settlement due to how large and flat the terrain is. There's a large old-fashioned American diner on one side, a large parking space in the middle, and an old outdoor cinema screen on the other side. This place gives players the ability to build large and unique structures.

 <p>
  <strong>
   The diner and cinema screen are all within the buildable area
  </strong>
  , so the player can incorporate them into whatever idea they may have. As a whole, this area is perfect for building something big and bold that fits in with the local surroundings.

  For the more social player, a perfect endgame settlement can be found in the heart of Diamond City. This is arguably
  <em>
   the
  </em>
  central location in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , coming equipped with several quest-givers, multiple stores and vendors, and being home to key story missions. For a fee, the player can purchase ownership of Home Plate, a relatively small building located in the Diamond City Market. It's not a huge location, and it's entirely enclosed (it's an interior-only settlement), but
  <strong>
   it feels cozy and can be packed out with furniture, thanks to the generous build limit.
  </strong>

 <p>
  It makes sense that a player would retire to this location, particularly if they're playing something of an RP game. Why should the Sole Survivor live outside in the wasteland, suffering from the post-apocalyptic conditions, when they can reside in the relative safety of Diamond City? It's the perfect endgame settlement for any budding
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  fan.

  The Slog is an old spa and bathhouse. There's a pool outside that settlers use to grow Tarberries. There are lots of reasons why
  <strong>
   The Slog is a great place for end-game builds.
  </strong>
  It's in a low-level area, meaning that enemies are pretty easy to take care of. It is easy to fortify thanks to the large spa building next to the pool. And, it has lots of open space to plant crops and make a farm.

 <p>
  This picturesque place is perfect for some cool and unique builds. For example, players can build several levels over the swimming pool and turn the old spa into a modern spa clinic. Overall, there's a lot to love about The Slog. It is a fantastic place to settle down and build.

  It ends where it all began, in Sanctuary Hills.
  <strong>
   This is the first location that the player is exposed to in
   <em>
    Fallout 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  serving as the home of the Sole Survivor. Following a few minutes in an idyllic, pre-war setting, the player emerges from a brief stint in a vault to find that the haven of Sanctuary Hills now stands devastated by 200-plus years of wasteland survival. It's now a relatively blank canvas; a ball of clay ready to be molded by the player.

 <p>
  Ultimately, Sanctuary Hills remains one of the best locations for an endgame build simply for the reason that the player is 'going home.' It's a massive, open space that boasts broad, flat areas and pre-built houses to fill with furniture. It's also set in an attractive part of the map, sitting on a river and surrounded by trees. There are worse places in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  to build an endgame settlement, that's for sure.

  It is easy to overlook this place at the beginning.
  <strong>
   But there's a lot that can be done with this particular area.
  </strong>
  Aside from the road that runs through the outside, it's surrounded mostly by water, making it a fun place to build away from the dangers of the Commonwealth. It also has a nice view of The Prydwen, provided the player hasn't taken out the Brotherhood of Steel.

  Introduced in the
  <em>
   Vault-Tec Workshop
  </em>
  DLC, Vault 88 is the perfect retirement opportunity for players looking to retreat underground, living out the apocalypse in a vault. However, there's a twist, as this vault is a blank canvas; an enormous, sprawling cave with many subsections that can be used to build a massive, complex vault. It's able to be fitted with all the above-ground amenities that a player is used to, along with all the new features introduced in the Vault-Tec Workshop DLC.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":19,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":19,"nbrPlacementsScanned":19,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":946} -->

 <p>
  Admittedly, Vault 88 is the toughest endgame settlement to build on, for the simple reason that the player is starting totally from scratch. It'll be quite a task to accomplish, with every tunnel, door, level, and room needing to be built from the ground up. However, when it's completed, the player is rewarded by having the ability to retire to an underground vault of their very own.

  The
  <em>
   SpongeBob SquarePants
  </em>
  add-on for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  will receive an expansive update on August 20. First released in 2022, the new update will have players venture back to a blocky version of Bikini Bottom and be able to complete various quests such as jellyfish-catching and searching for Gary the Snail. Each quest completed will unlock blueprints for iconic undersea buildings for players to create with new blocks and furniture, including the busy Krusty Krab restaurant and Sandy Cheeks’ air-filled Treedome. While fans of the over 25-year-long Nickelodeon series may be excited about exploring
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  under the sea with this update, Mojang should consider revisiting and updating other crossovers with famous franchises.

  For years, players have been able to mod and add new mobs, items, and textures to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  to create new and exciting experiences in their blocky world. However, these were just fan-made creations and were rarely supported by Mojang itself. It wasn’t until 2013 that Mojang would begin releasing mash-up packs so that players' worlds could officially be changed to mirror some players’ favorite games, shows, movies, and more. Changes to the world often vary, but the mash-up packs typically add new textures, skins, music, and new loading screens when purchased and downloaded. Mash-up packs’ textures can additionally be used on other worlds beyond the pack’s template world.

  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  ’s first mash-up pack released in late summer 2013 on home consoles in the form of the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  Mash-up Pack. Based heavily on the early Mars mission seen in 2012’s
  <em>
   Mass Effect 3
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  Mash-up Pack changed the texture for every block and item to reflect the futuristic technology of the 22nd century. As players explore Mars, listening to
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  ’s iconic soundtrack, they can change their skin to play as up to 36 characters across the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  series. However, mobs didn’t have their texture changed, unlike future mash-up packs such as the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  and Greek Mythology mash-up packs.

  <em>
   Minecraft

  mash-up packs have received occasional updates, but these were primarily limited to new textures made for new items and mobs or skins to reflect new entries in a series, such as the Infinite Master Chief skin in the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  Mash-up Pack. Mojang could update a few mash-up packs beyond these limitations to add more structures and quests to better mirror new or popular entries. Two mash-ups in particular that could use a facelift are the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  Mash-up packs.

  The
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  Mash-up Pack was released in 2016 and was based primarily on 2015’s
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  and 2008’s
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  with recreations of the Prydwen aircraft and the town of Megaton to name a few. With the recent success of Amazon Prime’s
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series and the tease of the second season taking place in New Vegas, Mojang should expand the template world and add locations from
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  TV show. Some of the new locations could be the New Vegas Strip and the NCR capital Shady Sands. There are enough locations in both entities that Mojang could make an entirely new mash-up world which could include new items and textures such as armor based on NCR veteran rangers.

 <p>
  The

  Mash-up Pack was released in 2013 and featured only a few locations from 2011’s
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
  </em>
  , such as the city of Whiterun and the Nordic ruin Bleak Falls Barrow. While
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls

  games are large enough to fill multiple mash-up template worlds on their own, Mojang could expand it to feature iconic locations from
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  . Some of these locations could be the towering Imperial City or the Summerset Isles, while the Nether could be turned into the Daedric realm of Oblivion, with the Nether portals themselves designed to better resemble Oblivion Gates.

  <strong>
   Roguelikes
  </strong>
  are some of the most replayable games available, and sometimes, gamers want nothing more than to get together with a friend or three and try their luck playing run after run of their favorite Roguelike, whether they win, lose, or just try out some crazy new combos, builds, and strategies.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  has quickly become a favorite home for Roguelikes and co-op games alike, and developers have taken note. Whether a group of gamers want to play something with fast-paced runs that almost always end in sadness, or they want to spend hours on a single run just to scrape out a victory, the Switch has plenty of options to choose from!

   <em>
    Don't Starve Together
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a very strange (in a good way) twist on the classic Roguelike formula. It's a survival game at heart, but a survival game where death is permanent if players aren't prepared, and all players dying can end a run, especially early on.

 <p>
  <em>
   Don't Starve Together
  </em>
  is one of the best co-op horror games on the Nintendo Switch. The art is enthralling and creep,y and most groups need to experience loss quite a few times before they finally get the hang of the game. The long runs, however, make every failure worthwhile.

   <strong>
    Risk of Rain 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a fast-paced third-person shooter Roguelike that does a fantastic job fusing the two genres together. There are many characters for players to experiment with, and every run feels winable, especially when players can infinitely stack power ups and basically break the game if they're lucky.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Streets of Rogue
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most unique Roguelikes available on the Nintendo Switch, or any other system, due to its incredible emergent gameplay and variety of playstyles. For example, if a player needs a key, they can take it by force, befriend the owner of the key, leak toxic gas through vents and take the key, or do anything else their imagination can come up with.

 <p>
  <em>
   Streets of Rogue

  can be played basically forever with a group of friends because co-op mode just adds more brains and more hands to the problem, and the solutions available quickly become jaw-dropping!

      As pointed out by Twitch streamer Flats, disabling the Easy Swing seting makes for smoother Venom gameplay in Marvel Rivals.

     <li>
      Venom, a sturdy Vanguard in Marvel Rivals, disrupts enemy attacks with swing and regen abilities, but with Easy Swing on, it can be hard to control where he is going.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has shared a useful tip that will make the gameplay for Venom mains much smoother.

  With this new test underway,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  players can play PvP 6v6 third-person matches on maps based on Yggsgard and Tokyo 2099, two iconic locations in the Marvel universe. The Convoy, Domination, and Convergence modes are available, as are a selection of playable characters such as Iron Man, Punisher, Scarlet Witch, Hela, and Black Panther. Increasing the hype for the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  beta even further, NetEase revealed the debuts of Adam Warlock and Venom, with Thor and Jeff the Land Shark also joining the game recently. For players looking to dominate the battlefield with the famous Symbiote, a
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  tip will significantly improve their Venom gameplay.

  Twitch streamer flats_ow showed on his TikTok how disabling the Easy Swing option greatly changes Venom's gameplay in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . In the video, he reveals that disabling Easy Swing gives players more fluid and precise swinging while controlling the iconic Marvel Symbiote during matches. The reason is that when Easy Swing is off, the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  character will move to any point the player's reticle is pointed at. When it's on, the game will automatically select the nearest grappling points.

  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has three roles, with Venom corresponding to the Vanguards. Like the tanks in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , the Vanguards lead the team on the front line, protecting their teammates while still having the ability to dish out decent damage. Venom, in particular, is considered a solid pick for
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  players due to the Symbiote's potential to disrupt the enemy team's attack. Venom can also last longer on the battlefield due to his swinging and regeneration abilities.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  beta ends on August 5, and players who didn't get a code can try to get one through a friend, or via Marvel Rivals' Twitch Drops. Players who join the closed beta will have the chance to get a special Venom skin that will remain unlocked when the game fully release. Fans of tank roles will be able to try out Hulk, Doctor Strange, Groot, Magneto, and Peni Parker, the other characters who make up
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' Vanguard category.

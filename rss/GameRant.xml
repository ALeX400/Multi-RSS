  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has revealed the existence of a DLC that has not yet been announced.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is one of this year's most anticipated releases, as it marks the return of the beloved
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series. After all, with Spike Chunshoft's new title, players will have plenty of nostalgia to relive and new memories to create.

 <p>
  After all, one of the main features of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is Episode Mode, which gives players the feeling of controlling the anime itself by reliving key moments through the perspectives of characters like Goku and Vegeta. But going a step further,
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  features What If narratives that show alternative scenarios for stories already known. Players can also jump into online ranked or tournament matches to challenge opponents and explore a variety of new mechanics, such as Revenge Counter.

 <p>
  On Twitter, a user named ProDigitalY has revealed that
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  will be getting a new DLC named “Martial Arts Pack.” In two screenshots they show the existence of the DLC, which is listed alongside other content already available, such as the
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  Season Pass, which includes content based on
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super Hero
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  . Although the images don't reveal much information about the contents of the Martial Arts Pack, they do note that it will have localization for Japan, China, Korea, Brazil, and South America.

  While players wait for more information on the Martial Arts Pack, the new game in the

  franchise already has DLC that players can buy. In addition to the Season Pass, Anime Packs 1 and 2 are available, which add iconic songs such as "We Gotta Power" and "Cha-La Head-Cha-La." With the Ultimate Upgrade Pack, players unlock new cosmetics, including an alternative costume for Goku, while the Pre-Order Pack unlocks additional fighters, such as Broly Gogeta and mini Goku.

 <p>
  Even before it hits the shelves,
  <em>
   Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is already celebrating an impressive milestone by attracting many players in Steam's early access. The hype for the game has been so great that it has surpassed the number of pre-orders for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  on PlayStation 5. With
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  's release approaching, and a community excited to finally check out the game, it won't come as a surprise to see Spike Chunsoft and Bandai Namco working to support the title with exciting post-release content to keep players engaged.

  To start this quest, players should first trigger Chapter 10, which starts
  <strong>
   after completing Chapter 9
  </strong>
  and saving Benny from the Akidu Orcs. The players will be sent by an NPC named Hannah back to Canina Village to deliver a package for an NPC named Hardem. After that, they'll need to speak with the Guard Captain, who is troubled by a series of disappearances happening near Grayclaw Forest.

   first part of the puzzle

  is quite simple, as players will need to pay attention to the
  <strong>
   moon-shaped patterns
  </strong>
  and look for a yellow one and a blue one that, when put together,
  <strong>
   form the shape of the full moon
  </strong>
  . It's quite simple, in theory, but as the lights move quickly and dance around, it is quite difficult to manage it on the first try. Here's what players should do to complete this part of the quest:

  The

  is a little more complicated, since it requires players to do some extra steps. But, before beginning to solve the second part, make sure to have a morph with a wolf shape activated, like the '
  <strong>
   Wild Skoll
  </strong>
  ' or '
  <strong>
   Shadow Skoll

  Keep in mind that the
  <strong>
   patterns are random
  </strong>
  , and each playthrough can showcase the patterns in different positions. Make sure that the shapes always form a full circle (Full Moon) or the puzzle will reset. But the thing that always stays the same — no matter the location of the patterns — is that
  <strong>
   each pair comes in two different colors
  </strong>
  . So, players will always need to find
  <strong>
   a blue piece and a yellow piece
  </strong>
  to complete each pattern.

     For players with difficulties distinguishing the patterns, there are two things that might help.
     <strong>
      Lowering the Ambient Occlusion and Effect Quality

  After the puzzle is complete, players will witness a cutscene, and Clay will prompt them to follow him and look for the missing person (who is actually behind the altar). Now, players need to return to
  <strong>
   Canina Village

  and head to the
  <strong>

  to witness how the whole situation is escaping from Clay's control. Players will now be able to

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has created an adorable 3D printed figure of Togepi with a Halloween twist. The cute piece of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  art is only the first 3D print the artist has created, but judging from the quality, it's unlikely to be their last.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans have taken to 3D printing as one of the newest methods of celebrating their favorite pocket monsters. 3D printing involves taking a digital file of a 3D model and sending it to a printer to slowly build layer by layer. 3D printing is time-consuming and a delicate art, but
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans have been enthusiastic about it for the ability to create just about anything they can find online or 3D model themselves.

  Reddit user and artist LolitaRey has previously made
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fanart, but this was their first time making a 3D print based on their own designs. LolitaRey shared their new design with fans of a Togepi ready for Halloween. The 3D art shows Togepi among a bunch of pumpkins, with the Pokemon's iconic shell removed and replaced with the bottom half of a Jack-o'-lantern. Togepi itself now looks a bit like a variant version, with a black overall body and spooky orange eyes. However, there's nothing overly creepy about the piece, as the baby Pokemon Togepi looks as adorable and happy as it usually does.

  Pokemon Fan Is New to 3D Printing, But the Pokemon Fanbase Isn't
 </h2>
 <p>
  While this is LolitaRey's first attempt at 3D printing,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fanart made this way shows no signs of dying down anytime soon. Fans of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise have made everything from custom Poke Balls to figures of the characters themselves, including both the Pokemon and the trainers. While 3D printing requires patience, the results can be genuinely impressive, and it allows for the creation of brand-new ideas that aren't available as official merchandise. Big fans of the series are buying some of these creations to display in their homes, and LolitaRey is one example of an artist selling a custom 3D printed figure.

  As 3D printing becomes more accessible, chances are fans will see even more impressive art. Fans of video games can now do things like create 3D models in Blender, a free program, allowing them to shape their art exactly as they imagine it. Printing out the object is a bit more complex, but clearly, many artistic types are doing so successfully. It will be interesting to see what the fanbase and LolitaRey come up with next.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most iconic video game franchises of all time. The series has spanned decades, numerous consoles and generations, and countless different iterations. Despite the different iterations, one thing remains relatively consistent – the quality of the games themselves. Few
  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  are considered bad, and many (if not most) sit among the best games of their respective consoles.

 <p>
  At this point, Konami does not appear all that interested in reviving
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  with any new releases, although the company might publish the occasional compilation package. Consequently, fans will need to look to the past to get their fill of the

   <strong>
    Updated on October 9, 2024 by Rhenn Taguiam:
   </strong>
   With the Castlevania Dominus Collection giving players access to acclaimed Castlevania classics such as Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia, fans can finally get a chance to play these Metroidvania hits on the modern PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles. However, fans looking for a challenge might want to consider giving older Castlevania entries a shot — especially some older titles that were still experimenting with the franchise’s mechanics. These include what is technically the second title in the franchise, older sequels, and other iterations of the Belmont’s generational fight against Dracula that slowly shaped the trajectory of the franchise’s gameplay and story.

 <p>
  Considered the fourth 3D title in the predominantly side-scrolling franchise,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania: Curse of Darkness
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a surprising departure from the series in a number of ways. Aside from its three-dimensional gameplay, it’s one of the few games in the series to not star a Belmont and not use their signature Vampire Killer whip. Instead, the game stars the Devil Forgemaster, Hector, as he returns to Dracula’s Castle after betraying Dracula, hell-bent on killing fellow Forgemaster, Isaac, for murdering his wife. Set just years after
  <em>
   Castlevania 3: Dracula’s Curse
  </em>
  , players control Hector as he uses his knowledge of the dark arts to fight the very same people he used to ally with.

 <p>
  The more open areas of
  <em>
   Curse of Darkness
  </em>
  showcased various locales that certainly removed the monotony of the castle setup in the game’s predecessor,
  <em>
   Lament of Innocence.
  </em>
  Instead of a whip, Hector can use a myriad of weapons to unleash combos on foes, with movement mechanics such as quick rolls forming the basis of dodging and outpacing opponents. Unique to the game is the concept of the Innocent Devil, or companions that Hector can summon to aid him in combat through effects such as healing, elemental attacks, and other buffs.

  A game as old as the first
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  title is no stranger to remakes, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania Chronicles
   </em>
  </strong>
  proves just how wild the idea can get. Whereas usual titles simply get a “remake” years later and a “reboot” just to spice things up,
  <em>
   Castlevania Chronicles
  </em>
  contains two versions of a remake — both just as interesting to play. The former is the Sharp X68000 version (Original Mode) of the original
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  made for the PS2. These features added items and redesigned stages, all the while retaining the series' infamous difficulty that deliberately prioritized skill-based play.

  Meanwhile, the second Arrange Mode includes graphics and gameplay much closer to
  <em>
   Rondo of Blood
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night,
  </em>
  all in all making the experience more “modernized,” but also more user-friendly in terms of its difficulty. Its Arrange Option allows players to adjust the game's levels, maximum number of players, and even lets players turn off the infamous time limit of older titles.

  When Dracula curses Simon Belmont upon his death,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Simon’s Quest
   </em>
  </strong>
  needs the Vampire Hunter to find Dracula’s remains and destroy them — killing him for good. Set not just in Dracula’s Castle but rather throughout Transylvania, Simon has to liberate villages across seven towns and defeat creatures in dark manors; all for the sake of finding Dracula’s remains. The game’s more open-ended structure made the game all the more immersive, with the mechanics of finding and destroying Dracula’s scattered pieces made vague to add to the suspense.

  <em>
   Simon’s Quest
  </em>
  introduces a day-night cycle that adds variety to its gameplay, as players can only shop by day and constantly have to fight enemies at night. For a rushed sequel, Simon’s movement and attacks feel fluid and deliberate, making killing enemies as fun as it was in the prequel. Unfortunately, the game feels rather lackluster in its graphical direction and grindy nature, as Simon needs to constantly use Hearts — which drop quite rarely from enemies — in order to upgrade his arsenal.

  Although labeled as a port of
  <em>
   Rondo of Blood
  </em>
  and following Richter’s story of saving his lover, Annet, the overall structure of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania: Dracula X
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been radically altered so that fans consider it a new game entirely. Coming with the game’s upgraded graphics and more solid sprite-work is significantly more challenging gameplay. The overall structure of Dracula’s Castle has been altered to feature more pitfalls and punishing foes, with more time-dependent movement, making the experience more challenging overall.

 <p>
  Playing as Maria has been cut from the game, and she’s been made a sister of Annet who needs rescuing, even though they weren’t related in the original title. While there are two separate endings, players need to replay the whole game to explore both possible conclusions. The lack of multi-directional whip attacks forces players to be more intentional with their attacks. All in all, these elements make
  <em>
   Dracula X
  </em>
  one of the hardest
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  entries in the series — which in itself might interest players looking for a challenge in their
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  marathons.

  Konami occasionally tried something different with
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  , and these risks were often mixed bags.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Harmony of Despair
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a difficult game to outright recommend since it is quite a departure from the franchise's status quo, and a player's enjoyment is likely to come down to their tolerance for grinding and whether they have a few friends to play with. Unlike nearly every entry in the series, this 2010 release prioritizes multiplayer, although solo runs are possible as well.

  Rather than a standard story, the campaign consists of largely unrelated levels that conclude with boss fights. Players can pick from six characters taken from across the franchise, and the game's replay value comes from mastering these warriors and engaging in a finicky loot system. Although inconsistent,
  <em>
   Harmony of Despair
  </em>
  's action is generally enjoyable, and it is fun to revisit locations from older games. The characters also have quite a bit of depth, and they should complement most preferred play styles. In multiplayer, this title can be quite fun, but it is mostly frustrating in single-player.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Harmony of Dissonance
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most polarizing entries in the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  franchise, especially since it is sandwiched between two superior releases in
  <em>
   Circle of the Moon
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Aria of Sorrow
  </em>
  . That said, the GBA release has enough positives to be worth a recommendation for die-hard fans, although they should be prepared for a surprisingly easy experience, aimless exploration, and a repetitive campaign. The music is also among the franchise's weaker efforts.
 </p>

 <p>
  Still, the gameplay is fine enough, as is the weapon selection. The visuals are extremely bright, but they are not bad for the GBA and produce some pretty attractive environments.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Lords of Shadow
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released in 2010 and served as a reboot of the entire
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  series. Produced by Hideo Kojima, the game saw players control Gabriel Belmont as he attempted to resurrect his wife.

 <p>
  While some general players and critics bemoaned the changes to the typical
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  formula, many others praised its atmosphere, impeccable presentation and production values, and updated gameplay. The game takes obvious influence from
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , and while that might not be the exact
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  experience that everyone is looking for, it does a good job of replicating that formula. Unfortunately, a disjointed sequel brought
  <em>
   Lords of Shadow
  </em>
  to a premature end.

   <em>
    Order of Ecclesia
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the final installment of the series released for the Nintendo DS. It was also the final
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  title that Koji Igarashi produced, but it served as a wonderful bow. The game contained some truly outstanding production values, which included fantastic graphics and chilling music.

 <p>
  It also contained some difficult but very rewarding gameplay, a mature version of the traditional
  <em>

  mechanics. It's not only one of the

  While some critics complained of its lack of originality and progress, they mostly agreed that it was nevertheless a very fun and respectable entry in the

  The game that started everything, the original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still an impressive work of art all these years later. Naturally, players who are only familiar with the
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night
  </em>
  era might initially struggle to adapt to the 1987 release's gameplay style since it is a wildly different experience.

  However, they will still find themselves playing a game with brilliant level design, atmosphere, and boss fights.
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  is also really challenging, serving as a prime example of that NES difficulty to was a staple of the console. That said, it is generally fair.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dawn of Sorrow
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  game to be released for Nintendo's DS console, emerging in North America in October 2005. It served as a wonderful introduction to the hardware, and it contained all the traditional
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  gameplay we had grown to love throughout the years.

 <p>
  Not only that, but the game expanded on the formula, offering stellar controls, fantastic production values, and an efficiently streamlined approach. By this point, the formula had well and truly been perfected.

  Bringing Konami's license to the SNES,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Castlevania 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  took full advantage of the console's heightened processing power, and this jump is immediately evident if the games are played in release order. Visually, the title was ahead of the curve at the time of its release, although it has not aged as smoothly as
  <em>
   Bloodlines
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Rondo of Blood
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   Super Castlevania 4
  </em>
  was a bit of a step back in some other places, largely thanks to the reduction of RPG elements along with the removal of companions, one of the best parts of
  <em>
   Dracula's Curse
  </em>
  . Still, when viewed as a whole, this SNES release is a classic that works well as an entry point into
  <em>
   Castlevania

  's pre-
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night

  era.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Circle of the Moon
   </em>
  </strong>
  served as a launch title for the Game Boy Advance in 2001, and what a launch title it was. It impeccably proved the technological prowess of the handheld console (well, technological for its time, anyway), complete with lush graphics and butter-smooth animations, which were a major leap for the time.

  This release was often compared to
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night

  , and that is high praise, indeed. It really doesn't get much better than
  <em>
   Circle of the Moon

  Another NES classic,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dracula's Curse
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the proper sequel to the original
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  , although
  <em>
   Simon's Quest
  </em>
  has its positives too. Featuring Trevor Belmont in the lead role and a trio of companions,
  <em>
   Castlevania 3
  </em>
  expands on the core gameplay loop of the 1987 classic in smart and memorable ways.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania: Bloodlines
   </em>
  </strong>
  was something of an outlier for the series at the time of its release. For one, the game launched on the Sega Genesis, taking
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  away from Nintendo's ecosystem. More importantly, the story takes place in the 20th century and does not feature a Belmont protagonist, opting for two new characters instead. While Dracula features in the narrative, he is not the main villain, which was a nice change of pace at the time.

 <p>
  <em>
   Bloodlines
  </em>
  is a 16-bit classic that does not get enough attention, at least compared to a few other entries in the franchise. In terms of gameplay, visual style, music, and level design, the game barely sets a foot wrong. It has aged well too, so it is worth revisiting.

  served as a brilliant launch title for the Game Boy Advance, and

  While some people began to grow sick of the

  to it, with some even calling it the greatest

  Whether playing the original

  fine-tunes everything that came before it, providing a polished and gorgeous campaign with heightened replayability. The latter comes courtesy of branching paths, a gameplay element that came to define most subsequent entries in the franchise.

  Even to this day, the

   Symphony of the Night

  . At the time of its release,
  <em>
   SOTN
  </em>
  was quite a departure from the franchise's previous entries as it emphasized RPG elements, a decision that went on to influence nearly every subsequent project. More importantly, the game has aged shockingly well in nearly every area. The visuals are still breathtaking, while the controls and combat are satisfying, accessible, and precise. The PS1 produced plenty of masterpieces, but very few of them have stood the test of time as well as
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night
  </em>
  .

  Since the release of the Nintendo Switch, a variety of different features have been added to the console to improve player experiences. As with most gaming consoles, Nintendo Switch features a wide range of online capabilities through its online system, including the ability for players to play online multiplayer games and a vast library of older titles from consoles like the NES, Game Boy, and more. Most recently, Nintendo Switch Online saw the addition of several titles this September into its game library, with even more planned to join this October. While this feature mainly allows players to enjoy online gaming with others and experience old school Nintendo games, an additional online feature is in the works by Nintendo.

  Originally announced on Nintendo's official Twitter, a playtest for a new feature for Nintendo Switch's online service will be running on October 10 starting at 8am Pacific Time. No other information was shared, besides the fact that players who have a Nintendo Switch Online and expansion pack subscription will have the chance to take part in this test on a first come first serve basis. Players will have to meet a set of requirements in order to be eligible for the playtest and can sign up for it via Nintendo's website or the link in the Twitter post.

  While this upcoming Nintendo Switch Online feature may be shrouded in mystery as to what exactly it entails, players will soon find out more once the playtesting begins. In the meantime, this may not be all that Nintendo has planned, as there are rumors that another new feature may be added to Nintendo Switch Online regarding the SNES mouse. Regardless, something new seems to be in the works regarding
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch Online
  </strong>
  features.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
   </strong>
  </em>
  confirmed that another Seven-Star Tera Raid battle will be held in November, pitting trainers against Torterra the Unrivaled. The upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  battle will also mark the end of a long-running pattern that featured previous generation Starters as Seven-Star Tera Raid bosses.

 <p>
  Known as the Continent Pokemon, Torterra first appeared in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. Torterra is the fully evolved form of Turtwig and Grotle and is a durable Grass and Ground dual-type Pokemon. With a shell larger than its body, Torterra is known for its tenacity and versatility in battle. Torterra's high health and physical attack and defense statistics, alongside attacks such as Earthquake, Wood Hammer, and Heavy Slam make Torterra a tough foe for any Pokemon team. In
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , Torterra can be obtained by catching a Turtwig in the Terarium's Canyon Biome and evolving it via level-ups.

 <p>
  Following the last Tera raid battle against Feraligatr, another
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  challenge will appear. According to Serebii.net, Torterra the Unrivaled will appear in Seven-Star Tera Raid dens starting Thursday, November 14, at 7:00 PM Eastern, and ending on Sunday, November 17, at 6:59 PM Eastern.
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  trainers who miss the initial Tera raid period will have another shot from November 21 to 24. Torterra the Unrivaled will have the Ground type as its Tera type, and grant the Mightiest Mark to Pokemon trainers who defeat it. However, Torterra's arrival will also mark the end of an era in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , as it will be the final Starter Pokemon from prior mainline generations to be featured as a Seven-Star Tera Raid boss.

 <p>
  Like previous bosses, Torterra the Unrivaled will have a Hidden Ability available to use. In this case, Torterra will have Shell Armor, which protects it against being critically hit. This hidden ability was previously featured in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , during the March 2023 Tera raids against Samurott the Unrivaled. However, Shell Armor can be removed via moves like Skill Swap, Worry Seed, and Gastro Acid. Even without Shell Armor, Torterra the Unrivaled can still use Grass and Ground attacks, with the latter type getting a power increase from Terastallization. Although Flying Pokemon are immune to moves like Earthquake, Torterra can counter with Rock-type attacks like Stone Edge.

  has a whole new puzzle for everyone to try out today. Like all the previous daily puzzles, you need to find all the the hidden themed words inside the puzzle's letter grid. To figure out all these words, you get a single clue to help you through it.

 <p>
  Today's puzzle is a difficult one for a number of reasons. First, there are few words and a couple of them are very long, making them more challenging to pick out from the jumble of letters. Also, the words are just difficult words to spell correctly. If you are stuck, this guide is here to help you.

  player Doug_HF shared a multiplayer map concept called "Hallway" on the game's Reddit page, with the comedic design highlighting a rising frustration about map size within
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's community. Although
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is very popular and thrives when lots of players are active, some of them have made it clear that they would like a little more space when it comes to navigating maps.

  Though players have been having a lot of fun with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  following a lot of anticipation, the game's launch has left some players with a couple of gripes. Some of these issues come down to things like the weapon progression in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , with Streamer Shroud wishing the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  series would switch things up and give players their arsenals earlier. Other players have noted feeling a little boxed in when it comes to gameplay, which has led them to joke about the game's hectic arenas.

 <p>
  On the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  subreddit, Doug_HF shared their concept for a map that, as its name suggests, takes place within one long hallway. The map description jokes in a tongue-in-cheek manner about how this would be the season's smallest map yet, with it also intended for 12v12 play, adding to the sense of absurdity. The existence of this map concept is the result of players growing frustrated with how tiny many of the maps in the game are, and issues with spawn points in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  seem to exacerbate the problem. Although this map design is hyperbolic, it may draw more attention to something that could be easily fixed with the addition of some more large-scale maps.

  An alternative solution to the map problem could resemble the format of stage selection in
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros Ultimate
  </em>
  , where players have the choice to pick from larger versions of certain maps through map voting. This would give people more freedom when it comes to how they decide to play. Some may prefer to have matches in tighter spaces for numerous reasons. For example, one gamer unironically noted that a map like Hallway would be great for pulling off headshots if it were real.

  Many players have decided to join in at poking fun about the game's map sizes, sarcastically suggesting that Hallway might even be too big. Others have compared the joke to the 2009
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  source map 2rooms. Though some players surely enjoy the small base maps of the game, as they can force a more aggressive playstyle that's in line with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's snappier, fast-paced gameplay full of new movement options, there are clearly some conflicting opinions. New maps are coming to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 1 on November 14, which will hopefully give players who prefer mid-large-sized maps what they are looking for.

  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  has been in the video game industry for over 40 years, meaning there's been plenty of time for some games to become extremely rare and valuable. These games don't have to be good, popular, or even finished, to be valuable in the eyes of collectors. As other Nintendo consoles enter classic territory, the list of shockingly priced games grows longer.

 <p>
  Many rare Nintendo games were either promotional games, unlicensed games, or exclusive to rentals. Some of the most expensive games aren't even technically games. There are some games released for the general market, like
  <em>
   Mega Man 5 &amp; 6
  </em>
  , that command a high price, but they are still way down the list in terms of overall worth and rarity.

   </strong>
   As time goes on, various games are deemed valuable or invaluable to collectors, but nothing can even touch some of
   <strong>
    the rarest Nintendo games of all time
   </strong>
   . Whether it's a cartridge that was never meant to get into the hands of regular gamers, or a game that maybe took too long to earn the acclaim it deserved upon release, there are many rare Nintendo games from the company's historic library, including from more recent consoles like the GameCube or Nintendo 3DS. Check out these additional rare Nintendo games that currently fetch a high price in online markets, and keep up to date with just how expensive collectors currently consider them.

  It may seem surprising to newer Nintendo fans just how rare the original iteration of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Earthbound
   </em>
  </strong>
  is for the SNES, but the game's acclaim was quite delayed. It's easy to find versions of it to play through Nintendo Switch Online, but as for the actual cartridge, it usually sells for hundreds of dollars, and even closer to $1,500 for the complete box.

 <p>
  Even
  <em>
   Mother 3
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Earthbound
  </em>
  sequel that's never seen a Western release, typically sells for much cheaper than the localized version of its predecessor. Even years after its release,
  <em>
   Earthbound
  </em>
  remains one of the best and most valuable Nintendo IPs of all time.

  If there are any head-scratchers on this list, it's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Barbie Groom and Glam Pups
   </em>
  </strong>
  . On the surface, there's nothing particularly special about this game, in which players get to pick a pooch and get them ready for beauty competitions. Although it was originally released for the DS and Wii in 2010, the 3DS version from 2013 often sells for quite a lot of money.

  is particularly rare is that, in North America, it only saw a wide release in Canada, so actual physical copies of the game are hard to come by. That being said, even the most diehard collectors agree that this game is not good enough to be valued this highly, despite the popularity of the

   <em>
    GoldenEye 007
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most iconic shooter games of all time, originally released in 1997 for the Nintendo 64. It's seen a lot of ports and re-releases since then, but some fans of the OG game may be enticed by the rare "Not For Resale" version, which sells for over $1,000 on online markets.

 <p>
  Other than the possibility of encountering beta content that isn't in the final release, there's not much value to this rare cartridge aside from completing a "Not For Resale" collection. However, considering it's a must-have for the Nintendo 64, even casual video game fans might be starstruck by this limited edition version of
  <em>
   Goldeneye
  </em>
  .

  Nintendo's ventures into educational games haven't always been successful, mainly because of games like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Donkey Kong Jr. Math
   </em>
  </strong>
  . An offshoot of the iconic retro title for the NES,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Jr. Math
  </em>
  utilizes similar mechanics to the original
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Jr.,
  </em>
  albeit requiring players to solve simple math problems by climbing towards numbers or mathematics symbols.

 <p>
  Despite selling in cartridge form for over $2,000,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Jr. Math
  </em>
  has made several appearances on Virtual Console, and as of 2024, it has made its debut on the Nintendo Switch Online service. Still, even as far as educational games go, this was a huge misfire from Nintendo, but one that's still valued by collectors nonetheless.

  At first glance, the extremely rare
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Box
   </em>
  </strong>
  seems like a simple Pokemon storage simulator, but it's much more than that. The GameCube title was sold in limited quantities at Nintendo World in New York City, and was also sold in a bundle with the GameCube itself in Europe.

  While the main advertisement for this game is its functionality as a storage system for Pokemon from GameBoy games like
  <em>
   Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   LeafGreen
  </em>
  , it also included an emulator for
  <em>
   Ruby &amp; Sapphire

  , making it one of the few ways to play a mainline
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game on consoles like the GameCube or Nintendo Wii before
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield,
  </em>
  which holds a lot of value for some fans by itself.

  The original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mega Man
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a bit overlooked when it first appeared on store shelves. This is partly due to its infamously terrible box art. Another reason was that anyone who played the game was quick to point out the high level of difficulty to others. A sequel wasn't even planned, and it only received one thanks to the team of developers who completed it in their spare time.

  The first batch of NES games were held together with five screws. This was replaced with a cartridge that replaced two of the screws with plastic clamps. The original five screw

  The vast majority of people who own
  <strong>
   <em>
    Donkey Kong 64
   </em>
  </strong>
  , for the Nintendo 64, own the version with a yellow cartridge. There were a few promotional copies that had a gray cartridge. These versions also have "Not For Resale" printed on the label, and the ESRB rating is RP (rating pending) rather than E (everyone).

 <p>
  These gray versions of
  <em>
   Donkey Kong 64
  </em>
  are extremely rare, hence the greatly increased price versus the yellow cart. The official value of this game hovered around $400 until October 2022, when it ballooned to around $1,500.

  Not many gamers noticed
  <strong>
   <em>
    Power Blade 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  back in the day. The reason for this is simple: it was released for the NES a year after the release of the Super Nintendo console. Gamers had already moved on from the NES and were playing games on the Sega Genesis, SNES, and Turbografx-16.

  <em>
   Power Blade 2
  </em>
  is s side-scrolling action platformer, and a good one at that. The fun factor of the game and the game's rarity have both contributed to a steady increase in value over the past decade. However, it wasn't until around mid-2021 that the price began spiking to its current $1,000 value.

  The odd one out in a vast family of games,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Majora's Mask
   </em>
  </strong>
  always enjoyed a cult following but was never a fan favorite. It's the only game in the entire franchise that's a direct sequel to the one before it in a series that's known for a wonky, non-linear timeline. Critics raved about the game's graphics and the compelling story even if fans were undecided.

 <p>
  The game has stood the test of time and is currently enjoying a resurgence. New and sealed copies are going for more than a thousand dollars and the price is rapidly going up, especially for any special or collectors editions that are rare and hard to find. The example given here is the one with the holographic label, which is currently on top in terms of rarity and value.

  This is an unlicensed compilation cartridge for the NES. This game was originally titled
  <em>
   Caltron 6-in-1
  </em>
  , but when Caltron went out of business their remaining stock was purchased by Myriad Inc. and resold as the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Myriad 6-in-1
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The 6 games on the cart are clones of popular games – like
  <em>
   Space Harrier
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Buster Bros.
  </em>

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Caltron
  </em>
  version is rare, but the Myriad version was limited to 888 copies. Each copy was numbered, and for those who had a copy with matching serial numbers (for the cart, instructions, and box) the value significantly increased. A copy of the
  <em>
   Myriad 6-in-1
  </em>
  commonly sells for about $1,200.00, but a complete-in-box copy goes for about $3,500.00.

  A game that's currently enjoying a resurgence thanks to the nostalgia factor,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hagane: The Final Conflict
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a classic side-scroller that mimics other favorites like
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden
  </em>
  . Like so many other games that were released on the SNES platform in the mid-1990s, it arrived too late to make an impact before the N64 arrived and sucked all the air out of the gaming room.

 <p>
  Circulation was limited; few copies are still available for collectors. Old-school platformers are riding a trend right now as it is, and this game is fairly rare, which adds even more to its value. New and sealed copies are selling for about $7500, with prices for loose and used copies also trending upwards.

  These were games for the Gameboy Color, and not many people seem to remember them when discussing
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games. These two games featured gameplay and a graphical style very similar to the original
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  title. The game incorporates the changing of the seasons into the gameplay; with some areas only accessible during a certain season.

  There were only 500 copies of the Limited Edition released, which included both games as well as promotional items – like a shirt and an actual, working boomerang. The price is currently around $1,200.00, but a complete-in-box copy can fetch about $2,200.00.

  These cartridges are exceptionally rare since they were made specifically for professional target audiences and training practice. The game came as a complete package that included the entire Super Nintendo Entertainment System, a loose version of the game, and a training rifle.

 <p>
  Only loose versions are currently available, as the game was never intended for resale or retail display, and these are going for a nice chunk of change at just over $2,500. If a complete package were ever to become available, or an unsealed one, the price would be exponentially more, as they probably don't even exist.

  <em>
   Speed Racer
  </em>
  is already a beloved game and one of the more famous early Nintendo titles. This Super NES cartridge combines two popular racing games and plenty of fans seek out the ROM just to experience the games if they can't find the cartridge.

 <p>
  With a price tag of more than $11,000 for a new, sealed copy, it's not a surprise that the cost of this game is out of reach for most. Complete used copies sell for over $5,000 and even loose copies are priced at $2500. Nostalgia value combined with the rarity of the game has kept the price fairly steady.

  This is one of those games that just can't be made anymore, which is one of the reasons that it's valuable.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Peek-A-Boo Poker
   </em>
  </strong>
  isn't just a card game for the original NES. The player's opponents are all women, and they spend most of the game flirting in various states of undress. Complete copies cost $1600, and loose copies for $1200, which is a lot for the cartridge on its own.

 <p>
  Other reasons for the high price include that it was an unlicensed game, and it contained some raunchy content that Nintendo would have rejected out of hand because of its "family-friendly" philosophy. It's a dicey investment since the price tends to fluctuate, but if collectors keep their eyes on the market, the resale value is worth it.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Aero Fighters
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a game that was poorly received back in the day. This game was an arcade port of a vertically scrolling shoot 'em. The SNES version suffered from extensive slow-down; which is the one thing one doesn't want in a SHMUP.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  This game also went under the radar due to it being released shortly after the release of the SNES. Many gamers were still happy with their NES, and by the time they upgraded to the SNES, this game was no longer on store shelves. This is one of the easier games on this list to find, but it will cost about as much as three new PS5s.

  The original
  <em>
   Cheetahmen
  </em>
  game appeared on the
  <em>
   Action 52
  </em>
  cartridge for the NES.
  <em>
   Action 52
  </em>
  is also a fairly rare game and was made infamous by The Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) on YouTube.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cheetahmen 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a broken game that was clearly unfinished. The outer cartridge case is just a re-purposed
  <em>
   Action 52
  </em>
  cartridge with a simple gold label. The only reason the game went public at all was when a box of them was found in a warehouse.

 <p>
  There were less than 2,000 of these produced, making them rare to find no matter where collectors look on the internet. These generally sell for about $2,000.00. There are a lot of reproduction
  <em>

  cartridges out there, so those looking to buy one need to make sure it is genuine.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Amazing Tater
   </em>
  </strong>
  only appeared on the radar as a collector's item in 2017, and after it was discovered, the price went up to $1,700 and has only risen ever since (for a complete-in-box copy). Even loose copes are worth about $500. Part of the reason why is that it's a Gameboy cartridge. Games for that iconic portable console are ones that collectors are always keen on finding; it has a smaller library, and the cheaper prices are not too prohibitive for collecting all the games in the library.

  The game itself consists of puzzles and features a charming group of vegetable characters, in particular the main character, who happens to be a potato. This game is fun to play and also a great investment, since the price keeps rising. There is another game in this series called
  <em>
   Spud's Adventure
  </em>
  . It is worth as much as
  <em>
   Amazing Tater
  </em>
  (for a loose cart).

 <p>
  Collectors are often after this game partly because of its unique history. Its value is high due to the fact that this cartridge is quite rare, but the story as to why has been lost to the ages. Rumors speculate that it was never available in retail in North America, and could only be acquired as part of a promotional deal with Blockbuster video, hence the relatively small number of them.

 <p>
  Other versions of the story indicate a limited, late release and a poor marketing campaign. Either way, this cartridge is very difficult to find and therefore priced at more than $3500 for a complete-in-box copy.

  The original

  is itself a game that commands a fairly high price but is not particularly rare. When Capcom remade this classic game in 2013 they decided to release a very limited kit that includes a functional gold copy of the original NES cartridge along with some other promotional items – like a really cool lunch box.

  There were only 150 of these kits produced, so the prospect of finding one is very slim. If collectors do find one, the average price is $1,600.00.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has seen one of its biggest updates since its 2023 launch with the release of its
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  DLC and Season 6 content. From the new class known as the Spiritborn to enemies called Realmwalkers, the fresh content in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  brings more action to the forefront. However, when it comes to the Infernal Hordes mode, players trying to enjoy couch co-op have been running into a significant bug that keeps them from completing their runs.

  Despite the influx of new content Season 6 and
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  bring, couch co-op in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has faced a string of bad luck. Another issue arose last month when players realized that the DLC's Dark Citadel raid-like didn't support couch co-op. Now, players who are trying to experience Infernal Hordes via this method are getting stuck mid-run with no clear way out.

  A Frustrating Bug Makes Infernal Hordes a Real Pain
 </h3>
 <p>
  As of now, it seems as though this issue with Infernal Hordes is mainly a couch co-op problem. The wave-based mode can be a fun way to take on onslaughts of enemies, but unfortunately for couch co-op, players are seemingly being softlocked out of completing the trial. A Reddit user known as MaidenlessRube expressed their frustration on the
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  subreddit, stating that this issue happens regularly when attempting the mode in local co-op. New waves will stop spawning, leaving players stranded within the mode with no way forward. This isn't the first issue Infernal Hordes has had, either.

  Continuous Bugs That Keep Players From Completing Objectives

 <p>
  A similar bug that has previously affected players in Infernal Hordes is with the mode's final goal. Once the ongoing waves of enemies reach the final stage, players will be tasked with taking down the Fell Council. However, according to feedback posted on the official Blizzard forum found on the company's website, some players have defeated the Fell Council, but nothing happens, leaving them unable to continue.

  Although this isn't the same couch co-op bug that is plaguing players, it was still a shockingly similar softlock issue, which can deter some from playing Infernal Hordes completely. Player Allisonk98 stated on Reddit that the softlock "happens so much I hardly play anymore."
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  got a recent hotfix, and yet this hasn't changed anything about the Infernal Hordes problem.

  Blizzard Has Yet to Fix the Issue
 </h3>
 <p>
  At the time of this writing, there is currently no known plan from Blizzard to fix the Infernal Hordes local co-op issues. While the developer has responded to the Spiritborn's overpowered gameplay, players who want to experience Infernal Hordes with a fellow player may have to wait a little bit longer to get the problem resolved. What's even more frustrating for players is how long this issue has gone on. According to MaidenlessRube, "this has already happened since the beginning of Season 5."

 <p>
  There is no telling how long this issue will persist for couch co-op players. Unfortunately, since it was recently revealed that most
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  players are solo, it may not be a priority for Blizzard at the moment. Only time will tell if this bug gets fixed soon, but for those who have been wanting to try out Infernal Hordes in local co-op, it may be best to proceed with caution.

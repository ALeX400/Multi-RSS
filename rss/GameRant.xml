  A
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan recently designed several sneakers based on popular shiny Pokemon throughout the games. Featuring community favorites such as Gyrados, this
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan created some fun and interesting designs for these sneakers, while staying true to the designs of the original Pokemon.

 <p>
  The
  <em>

  community has been known to create some truly great fan art. Ranging from Pokemon clay sculptures to original designs for new Pokemon, the community is always finding ways to interact with the franchise while flexing their creative muscles. Like any fan base, the
  <em>
   Pokemon

  community continuously finds unique ways to express their love of the franchise and its interesting Pokemon.

 <p>
  Reddit user MelodicWeb2161 took this love of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise to the next level by designing a unique line of sneakers based on popular shiny Pokemon found throughout the different games. Their collection featured designs based on shiny versions of Gyrados, Yveltal, Groudon, Gigalith, Staraptor, Decidueye, Luxray, and Haxorus. The designs took into account the color scheme and overall aesthetic of each Pokemon, even including small details such as Gigalith's iconic eyes being incorporated into the Nike logo on that specific design.

 <p>
  Alongside the addition of Gigalith's eye being incorporated into the logo, several other aspects of these shiny Pokemon were accounted for in the sneaker designs. Both Groudon and Gigalith's designs also come with studs attached to the shoes' toebox, mimicking the spikes present on each of these Pokemon. Luxray's design features the star tail of the Pokemon on the shoe, similar to how Decidueye's shoe design includes the iconic leaf and cross that is on that Pokemon's chest. Even Yveltal's lightning-esque pattern is featured on that Pokemon's shoe design.

  This isn't the first time that a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan designed sneakers based on a Pokemon. In fact, this Reddit user had designed several other sneakers based on shiny Pokemon before drawing up these designs. Alongside that, this Reddit user also creates physical versions of these shoes, as mentioned in the comments of the post.

  Whether it is creating physical art of shiny Pokemon on sneakers or drawing up original designs for Pokeballs, the
  <em>

  community is clearly not lacking in the creativity department. Fans continue to find new ways of interacting with the franchise, and it seems that there is no end in sight to the community's endless love for Pokemon. With more exciting

  While a lot of the marketing for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Space Marine 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  focuses on the Tyranids, players will also be coming face to face with the Thousand Sons, a chapter of Chaos Space Marines that is made up entirely of Psykers. During the Horus Heresy, the Thousand Sons turned on the Emperor and became a traitor legion, later falling to Chaos completely.

 <p>
  The Thousand Sons follow Tzeentch, the Chaos god of change, and will bring a sharp change of pace when fighting them compared to the Tyranids. While the Tyranids focus on overwhelming the enemy with sheer numbers, the Thousand Sons will be on much more equal footing against the Ultramarines you'll be playing as. Here's every Thousand Sons enemy confirmed to be in the game.

  Tzaangors are abhuman beastmen followers of Tzeentch that act as the lowest level in the Thousand Sons army. These creatures are born in a few different ways, all of which spawn from Tzeentch creating them from those who have been touched by the warp.

 <p>
  Tzaangors may not seem like much against a Space Marine, but they are incredibly aggressive and violent. Chaos Cultists are roughly the same size as Tzaangors but have kept their human characteristics and choose to fight with guns instead of melee weapons in this game. While these are two units, they seem fairly similar in terms of stats and how easy they are to cut down with a chainsword, making them the melee and ranged basic Thousand Sons units you'll be fighitng.

  Rubric Marines are the basic Space Marines of the Thousand Sons. They have a few different weapons that are unique to their chapter, such as the Warpflame guns. As all Rubric Marines are Psykers, a lot of their weapons channel power from the warp to make them a bigger threat than just your average bolter.

 <p>
  Rubric Marines will stand at eye level against Titus and his Space Marines, making them a much larger threat individually than most single Tyranids. While Rubric Marines tend to favor ranged weapons, some also use Force weapons that also channel the warp and can be even more deadly than a Chainsword.

  Scarab Occult Terminators are the Thousand Sons version of a terminator that wears much heavier armor than that of a normal Space Marine. With their larger armor size and capacity, they are able to wield heavy ranged weapons such as a Soulreaper Cannon in one hand, while still having a Force weapon out and ready in the other.

 <p>
  Scarab Occult Terminators will be much harder to kill than regular Rubric Marines, yet also much more deadly, meaning they should be your first target in fights against multiple enemies at once.

  While all members of the Thousand Sons are Psykers, some are much more in tune with the warp than others. Exalted Sorcerers are some of the strongest Psyker in an army made of Psykers, and are leaders within the chapter.

  Helbrutes are chaos-infected Dreadnoughts, whose weapons vary greatly. Dreadnoughts are essentially living coffins for mortally wounded Space Marines that keep them alive and fighting alongside their brothers. When the Thousand Sons fell to chaos, these Dreadnought became infected with demonic powers that strengthened the already deadly force of the Dreadnought.

 <p>
  The fire itself is infused with the demon's hatred and warp energy, making it very deadly, even to a Space Marine. Due to the size and strength of Heldrakes, it's clear they will at least be a mini-boss enemy, if not a difficult boss fought at the end of a mission. It's also quite common for Heldrakes to hunt in packs, which would be an incredibly challenging fight for even an experienced Space Marine.

  There are plenty of animal protagonists found in the world of video games, but there are also plenty of villainous animal antagonists who are just as memorable as their heroic counterparts.

 <p>
  Here's a look at some of the best animal villains in gaming, but a few rules are going to be bent to narrow down who is qualified for the list. First off, mythical animals are allowed, despite not being real animals. They are based on real animals after all, so it only seems fair to let them in. Anti-heroes and animals that appear as boss fights are also fair game, especially those that are particularly iconic.

  First up is a character that isn’t really a villain per se, but more of an antihero. Shadow the Hedgehog appears here as he is often known as the antithesis of Sonic the Hedgehog and his morals can be a little questionable since he is willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve his goals.

 <p>
  Shadow first appeared in
  <em>
   Sonic Adventure 2
  </em>
  in 2001, and he was originally intended to be a pure villain to Sonic, but the positive fan reaction to his dark and brooding nature changed the way his character developed, becoming a rival of sorts to Sonic rather than a straight-up bad guy. His original design as a villain and his continuing feud with Sonic make him a compelling antihero to add to the other, more villainous characters listed here.

  Next are two characters that are put together, because even though they are separate boss battles across two games, they are pretty much the same, even though Spawn of Oggdo is more difficult than the original Oggdo.

  The first Oggdo Bogdo is a giant, frog-like predator, and boss fight found on the planet of Bogano in the Outer Rim that players can face while playing
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
  </em>
  . He is then avenged by his child, Spawn of Oggdo, in the second game
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  in a boss battle that is even more difficult (and causes a lot of rage quits around the world). These frog boys are some of the most frustrating animal boss fights in gaming.

  Alduin is one of the major antagonists from across the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  franchises, and he makes the cut despite being a mythical dragon. As well as being known as the World-Eater, Aludin also has a reputation as the Twilight God and the First Dragon.

 <p>
  Although he is referenced in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind
  </em>
  , it is in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
  </em>
  where he becomes a major threat, as he is the main antagonist of the game that the player will eventually need to defeat during the main questline. His huge stature, demonic dragon design, and major role in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  make Alduin a prominent animal villain in gaming.

  King Dedede is another character that was originally designed to be a villain but has since developed into more of a playful rival and even a friend to Kirby in the latest games. King Dedede is a giant blue penguin-like creature who wields a hammer and wears a fancy red and white royal robe.

 <p>
  Despite no longer being a villain in the
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  games, Dedede still makes it onto our list as he did spend his first few appearances being a villain, such as in his first appearance in
  <em>
   Kirby’s Dream Land
  </em>
  where he stole the food from the residents of Dream Land simply to cause sadness among the people. Even though he has since turned over a new leaf, some - unlike Kirby - cannot forgive and forget his crimes.

  There are all sorts of animal villains/minions in the
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  series, with some being more villainous and others converting to the side of good at some point in the series. Dingodile makes the cut for this ranking, as he is primarily an antagonist throughout the

  </em>
  games.

  Dingodile is a half-dingo, half-crocodile hybrid, and by the time the events of
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time
  </em>
  rolls around, he has retired from his role as a villain to open up his own diner (which serves only the worst possible food). When the diner is destroyed, he ends up pulled into an interdimensional rift and eventually teams up with Crash and his sister Coco along with an alternate version of Tawna Bandicoot.

 <p>
  Dingodile is an iconic animal villain thanks to his unusual hybrid design, iconic flamethrower weapon, and his thick tail, which he also uses against enemies. He was once simply a villain but is now more of a contractor (and a small business owner) who will offer help to friends and foes alike if it benefits him.

  Some of the animals here have been morally gray rather than straight-up evil, but the same can’t be said for King K.Rool. As his little golden crown suggests, he is the ruler of the Kremlings (a crocodile-like species) from the Donkey Kong series. His name is also a dead giveaway when it comes to what type of ruler he is, as the Kremlings aren’t particularly fond of K.Rool because of his cruel nature, even to his own people.

 <p>
  K.Rool is a large, obese Kremling with an eye-catching golden belly, golden bracelets, and a red cape. He enjoys terrorizing his people, but his main role in the series is to play the villain to the Kongs. His hobbies include stealing the Kong's bananas, likely to try and starve them, and kidnapping. K.Rool is a particularly volatile villain, with an unhinged nature that makes him unpredictable. His huge, misshapen, and somewhat crazy eyes only hint at the insanity that this Kremling is willing to impose on Kong and his subjects, making him a particularly noteworthy animal villain.

  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  might be known as an ally to Mario and a standalone hero in his own right by gamers today, but he began life way back in 1981 as the title antagonist of the
  <em>
   Donkey Kong a
  </em>
  rcade game. Mario was the protagonist of the game, and players would dodge barrels thrown by Donkey Kong to reach him and rescue his kidnapped victim Pauline.

 <p>
  All Donkey Kong did was throw stuff at Mario, but the game and his character were so popular that he ended up getting a fully fleshed-out backstory, his own game series, an animated television show, and even a family of fellow Kongs who would also get their own video games. Donkey Kong is much more than just a villain all these years after his initial conception, but his role as one of the first major animal antagonists in a game makes him one of the most iconic animal villains in gaming history.

  Arguably one of the most iconic villains in gaming, Bowser wins the top spot despite being from a fictional species of turtle-like creatures called Koopas. In this ranking, he counts as a mythical animal of sorts, as despite his turtle-like traits, he also has various similarities to a dragon, such as his ability to breathe fire and certain elements of his appearance.

 <p>
  As mentioned, Bowser is not only an iconic animal/creature villain, but he is generally one of the most well-known and well-received bad guys in video game history. Following his debut in
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  in 1985, Bowser has gone on to become a staple in the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  franchise. His endgame goal usually revolves around kidnapping Princess Peach, conquering her kingdom, and making her his queen, which sounds a lot weirder than it actually is. It’s a simple premise, but one that connected well with gamers.

 <p>
  Bowser became even more popular after the release of the animated
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros Movie
  </em>
  in 2023, as the writers doubled down on his desire to make Peach his queen to the point where the character sings a song proclaiming his love for her (sung by his VA Jack Black). The song made it into the charts around the world. It's clear that Bowser has become much more than a simple video game animal villain. He has become a pop culture icon in his own right, and because of this, he has more than earned his place as number one.

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has made an impression by revealing that they have an eight-year-old egg in their inventory.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has a variety of mainline game mechanics, including egg hatching.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players obtain eggs in different activities and can get critters of varying rarities and types. While some are more common, there are still Pokemon that
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  trainers can get only through eggs.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":402} -->
 <p>
  It all starts when, having obtained an egg, the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  player places it in an incubator to discover the Pokemon that will come out of it. The next step is to walk the required distance to hatch the egg, which can be 2km, 5km, 7km, 10km, or 12km. It's also worth noting that while the 2km eggs are the most common because they are obtained by spinning PokeStops, the 12km eggs are considered rarer since they drop as a reward when trainers defeat the Team GO Rocket leaders. Getting an egg is a highlight for a
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  player, but one trainer has revealed that they have an impressively old egg.

  Surprising other players, Reddit user PokeBlake33 revealed that they have an eight-year-old egg in their
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  inventory. They shared a screenshot showing their 2km egg received on August 20, 2016, in Berkeley, U.S.A. In July 2016,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  was launched after an April Fools test on Google Maps, and quickly became a huge phenomenon that would create a community of millions of players from around the world.

  While the egg the OP has in their

  <em>

  </em>
  player showed that the oldest egg they own is from July 31, 2016, and curiously, two other players showed that they have eggs from the same date. A fourth trainer revealed they were about to hatch a
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  egg from July 14 of the same year, but didn't note which Pokemon they got.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been adding Pokemon to its Pokedex for years, but one of the most popular is Rayquaza, the Legendary dragon Pokemon from Generation 3. Considering players can turn it into
  <strong>
   Mega Rayquaza
  </strong>
  by using Mega Energy, it is no wonder everyone wants this Pokemon.

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: mid intro! -->
 <p>
  However, before
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players can Mega Evolve their Rayquaza, they will need to teach the Legendary Gen 3 Pokemon a specific move called
  <strong>
   Dragon Ascent,
  </strong>
  which isn't the easiest move to teach the Pokemon. Here's how to do that and get the amazing Mega form.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, as of this writing,
  <strong>
   the only way to teach Rayquaza Dragon Ascent is to get a Meteorite.
  </strong>
  In order to obtain this item, players will need to complete specific Research Tasks or defeat Mega Rayquaza in a Raid and hope that a Meteorite is given as a prize for winning.

 <p>
  Giving Rayquaza this item will make it learn Dragon Ascent, which is needed before Mega Evolving it. Thankfully, giving it to Rayquaza is super simple; players just need to click on the Pokemon and navigate to where it says Evolve. Once there, select the option and the Meteorite will be used on the Pokemon, Mega Evolving it.

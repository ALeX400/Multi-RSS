  Announced during the June 18 Nintendo Direct showcase,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Donkey Kong Country Returns HD
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be coming to Nintendo Switch on January 16, 2025. Retro Studios revived the
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  series with
  <em>
   Returns
  </em>
  in 2010, but as exciting as this may be, it wasn't quite the announcement fans were expecting. The community has been waiting for years for Nintendo to produce an original
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  title for the Switch, as it remains the only Nintendo home console without one. Regardless, the remastered Wii game has plenty to offer as a re-release, including enhanced graphics and extra levels.

  The first-ever spin-off game tied to the popular
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  character was
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  , a 1981 arcade game originally released on the Atari 2600 before eventually branching out to the NES, Nintendo 64, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and the since-defunct Wii Virtual Console catalog.
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Jr.
  </em>
  was released in 1982 as a direct sequel, followed by
  <em>
   Donkey Kong 3.
  </em>
  In 2010, Nintendo released one of its most acclaimed spin-off games,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns
  </em>
  for the Wii. Four years later, it was succeeded by a sequel titled
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze
  </em>
  . After becoming such a huge hit with fans all those years ago, the
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  series even has an expansion coming to Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios.

  As part of the June Nintendo Direct, an HD version of the game called
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns HD
  </em>
  was revealed to be coming to the Nintendo Switch in 2025. Not only has it undergone some major enhancements, but it will also include all bonus levels from the Nintendo 3DS port,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D
  </em>
  , for a total of 80 levels overall.
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns
  </em>
  is undoubtedly one of the best Donkey Kong games, chronicling the adventures of Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong as they traverse Donkey Kong Island to steal back their banana stash from the Tiki Tak Tribe. As in the original, players will be able to enjoy the game solo or in co-op mode, choosing to play as either Donkey or Diddy Kong.

  Following Microsoft's acquisition of Rare, the game's original developer, the
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  series became less prominent over time, often overshadowed by the beloved
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  franchise.
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country Returns
  </em>
  was kept under wraps throughout its development, but fans had their suspicions even before the title was announced at Nintendo's E3 conference in June 2010. The project had been a labor of love from the very beginning, claimed designer Tom Ivey in an interview, explaining that the crew had to work overnight during the game's final stages, while producer Kensuke Tanabe had to take some time off due to severe back pain.

  For almost four decades,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  has established and remained faithful to a solid formula, even in spite of massive transformations like
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and its successor,
  <em>
   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . The series has always kept the beloved hero Link at the forefront in some capacity, despite the series being named after Zelda, the princess that Link either rescues or fights alongside. Now,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  is defying conventions by allowing players to control Zelda herself, with a twist on gameplay and combat never-before-seen in the
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  franchise.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , Link has vanished, leaving Zelda in charge of saving Hyrule from disaster. While fans have become familiar with Link's classic sword-based combat, along with his wide variety of tools, combat has undoubtedly changed in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  with Zelda as the playable protagonist. The series has proven over time that Zelda is no stranger to combat, but it is nonetheless different in this next installment. Specifically, she will be using her newfound Tri Rod and the "echoes" that it can create as her primary weapon and tool in battle.

 <p>
  One of the most significant ways
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is adjusting
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  's combat is by giving Zelda the ability to create echoes of monsters to fight alongside her. Whereas Link typically engages in direct combat with his enemies, Zelda will be able to utilize the ability of other monsters to keep her enemies at bay by summoning them during a fight. Zelda can also place bait to attract other enemies to a specific location where she can then summon her own monster to ambush them.

  Zelda's Tri Rod Can Create Echoes of Items That Can Be Used Against Her Enemies
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  series has not shied away from putting a sword in Zelda's hands in various installments, but it appears
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  may neglect doing so. In
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , Zelda has largely no need for a sword thanks to her newfound Tri Rod and the endless number of echoes it can create, including monsters. Even so, Zelda doesn't necessarily need to rely entirely on the monsters she summons to defeat her foes in
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , as she can also summon items that she can then use to deal damage to the enemies she encounters.

 <p>
  For example, Zelda can create an echo of a rock in
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  that she can pick up and throw at her enemies to damage them. This will come in handy for those moments when players have no monster echoes available, which will most likely be early on in the game. This will also give Zelda an edge in her fights, as she will be able to deal damage to foes while any monsters she summons are dealing their own. Link has long been able to pick up items and throw them, but it's likely this ability will be even more useful in
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  than it ever has.

 <p>
  Zelda may not be engaging her enemies in
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  as directly as Link has in the past, but it appears that shouldn't stop her from overcoming her foes and making her way through Hyrule. It will be interesting to see what monsters and items Zelda can create using the Tri Rod in
  <em>
   Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , as well as how it all comes together to make its combat feel fresh and original.

  During the June 18 Nintendo Direct, Innersloth revealed a new update for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Among Us
   </strong>
  </em>
  that included three new Roles for players to use in matches, gave the lobby settings interface a new look, and added some presets for different game modes. The v.2024.6.18 update for
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  is available to download now on all current platforms.

 <p>
  The new
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  patch arrived in the middle of a busy 2024 for Innersloth. Though the player count of
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  has waned over time, that has not stopped Innersloth from supporting the game or using its popularity to give back to other indie developers. During the 2024 Summer Game Fest Live broadcast, Innersloth revealed the Outersloth Fund as a way to help single or small-team indie game developers fund their projects and see their ideas reach new audiences. Some of the games revealed as part of the Outersloth Fund are
  <em>
   Mars First Logistics
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Battle Suit Aces
  </em>
  , and

  While it was revealed by accident a week prior, a new
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  update is now available for all players to enjoy. The v2024.6.18 update for
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  is a 224 MB download on Steam and offers three new Roles that players enable in the game lobby. Innersloth showed the new roles in action in a short animated trailer. Two new roles, the Tracker and the Noisemaker, can be used by Crewmates, while the Phantom is exclusive to Impostors. True to its name, the Noisemaker will sound an alert to other Crewmates when killed, which can be used to help Crewmates snuff out Impostors. Similarly, the Tracker can place a tracking device on any player for a short time, which allows the Tracker to see their target's movements on the map. The Phantom can turn invisible for a few seconds and either ambush unsuspecting Crewmates or make a quick escape after securing a kill.

 <p>
  As part of the
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  2024 update roadmap, Innersloth revamped the lobby settings menu to make it easier for players to make changes before a match begins. Plus, new game presets called Core Settings and Roles Galore allow players to quickly establish what game mode they are hosting. Two new Hide N Seek presets called Pitch Dark and Flashlights were added as options. Bug fixes for The Fungle and Airship maps and the iOS version of
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  were included with the update.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The city-building genre is one of the most saturated genres on Steam. Games such as
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Against The Storm
  </em>
  are just a couple of standout examples from recent years. Many of these games, such as
  <em>
   Cities: Skylines
  </em>
  , have a massive scale, while others, like
  <em>
   Minami Lane
  </em>
  , are incredibly small-scale.

 <p>
  Other games, like
  <em>
   Townscaper
  </em>
  , don't feature any management mechanics, focusing purely on creative building. These examples, however, focus on building smaller-scale towns and settlements, all of which feature management mechanics.

  This minimalist pixel-art town-builder combines city-building mechanics with a focus on supply chains, as seen in games such as
  <em>
   Factorio
  </em>
  . Thankfully, these elements are well-crafted, resulting in a relaxing but consistently engaging game about building production chains.

  minimalist visuals, elevated by bright colors, complement the game's relaxing atmosphere.
  <em>
   MicroTown

  manages to be a frequently charming experience.

  This rogue-lite city-builder gives players control of a bustling village/town attempting to survive a variety of catastrophic events.
  <em>
   DotAGE
  </em>
  is a turn-based game, taking a great deal of inspiration from the world of tabletop games. The most notable use of tabletop game mechanics in
  <em>
   DotAGE
  </em>
  is its elements of worker placement, tasking players with assigning their workers to tasks every day.

 <p>
  <em>
   DotAGE

  also features rogue-lite elements in the form of a run-based structure and meta-progression, which makes the game feel somewhat more bite-sized than larger city-builders. This breezy structure also complements the game's small scale.

 <p>
  This dreary town-building strategy game focuses on keeping the townsfolk alive in a harsh and unforgiving environment. One unique element of
  <em>
   Banished
  </em>
  is its lack of research trees, with the only requirement for each building being the necessary resources to build it.

 <p>
  Efficiently trading with foreign merchants, farming crops, and carefully managing the surrounding environment are key factors to the town's survival. In
  <em>
   Banished
  </em>
  , resources are frequently scarce, which results in a game that's very much about resource management and risk assessment. While the game is often challenging, the difficulty settings help to make it more accessible.

  <em>
   Cardboard Town
  </em>
  is a distinctive, small-scale city-builder that tasks players with building towns by playing various cards. Players use these cards by spending money, which represents the player's potential number of actions. Every day, players draw new cards, placing down new buildings to increase their population and prepare for incoming disasters.

  <em>
   Cardboard Town

  features a doom timer that keeps players on their toes throughout, forcing them to make tough decisions at every turn. This, in combination with most buildings requiring an adjacent road, adds weight to each choice. Alongside its well-crafted gameplay loop,
  <em>
   Cardboard Town
  </em>
  also features a pleasant, colorful paper-craft aesthetic.

  <em>
   Outlanders
  </em>
  is a charming, minimalist indie game about building towns, with a focus on strategy. The game features a wonderful flat-color art style and a distinct lack of conflict/combat, maintaining a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. This atmosphere is only improved by the game's immersive soundscapes and charming music.

  Despite its lack of battles,
  <em>
   Outlanders
  </em>
  challenges players with its mission-based structure. However, for players that want complete freedom to build their town, the game thankfully offers a sandbox mode. This mode's creative gameplay complements the game's atmosphere, offering a laid-back experience for players that become frustrated with the game's missions.

  Putting players in the shoes of the town mayor,
  <em>
   Go-Go Town
  </em>
  is a cute and colorful indie game about building and managing a charming town. Unlike most management games,
  <em>
   Go-Go Town
  </em>
  gives players control of their own character, allowing them to cycle and drive around the streets, caring for the townsfolk and the town itself. Though its cheerful art-style is the main initial draw, there's plenty to do in this laid-back town management game.

  Running around performing errands can be a time-consuming task in
  <em>
   Go-Go Town
  </em>
  , but thankfully, the game offers ways to automate certain tasks using the townsfolk themselves. Much of
  <em>
   Go-Go Town's
  </em>
  gameplay is focused on hiring and managing staff, building new locations for tourists, and converting tourists into townspeople. Although
  <em>
   Go-Go Town
  </em>
  is currently in early access, its polished gameplay is a promising start.

  's card mechanics. The next set, releasing July 5, is
  <em>

  During Summer Game Fest's Play Days event, Game Rant got to sit down and check out the
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  x
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  starter kit in two Standard games. We first played with a Red/White deck, which was described as an Equipment-focused deck, and then a Blue/Black more Assassin-based deck. While we had two completely different games, each was fun from a technical standpoint and fulfilling as a diehard
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  fan.

  General Impressions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Before jumping into the games, we did take a moment to look through each deck. The card arts are truly divine and everything I've wanted to see out of this crossover. There are younger versions of Ezio that really capture his naivete and priorities, while Ezio, Blade of Vengeance, captures his skills as a full-blown Assassin. That subtlety is not lost with Eivor either, as her card captures her heritage and warrior spirit in just as much detail. Perhaps the most impressive visual was, surprisingly, Achilles Davenport, who is captured in a way that neither
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  nor
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Rogue
  </em>
  displays him - at his best as an Assassin.

 <p>
  What's more is that it runs the entire gamut of the franchise. I can't say for certainty that every novel concept or game is represented here, but it feels like it. Fans can even expect to see some of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  's mythological forays represented here, with there being a powerful minotaur card (a la
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  ), Jotuns (a la
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Valhalla
  </em>
  ), and modern elements like Abstergo Entertainment.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, we ran into a common
  <em>
   MTG
  </em>
  issue when playing the Red/White deck. We simply were not drawing enough lands, but at the very least, neither was our opponent. We each got out about 4 lands and basically never drew another, but Assassins are used to working within limitations. We set out to do the best we could. We didn't get to do much with the equipment elements of this deck, but we did have Bureau Headmaster and Headsplitter out together at one point that was able to, at least, keep our opponent at bay around that time. The Blue/Black deck did have a few insta-kill cards, like Murder, so keeping some kind of creature on the field felt necessary. However, one thing we did notice was how good of a deck this was at controlling our opponent as well. Luckily, this Red/White deck proved to be a pretty easy
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  deck to learn.

 <p>
  Detained by Legionnaires kept our opponent at bay a couple of times, while Misthio's Fury (while Headsplitter was out) kept their field limited and dealt damage too. The tide of the game seemed to turn when our opponent finally had another land, but around this time, we managed to have a decent number of creatures on our field and brought out Labyrinth Adversary as well. We used the rest of our field as defenders, paid the mana cost for Labyrinth Adversary's card effect each turn, and whittled away at the opponent's health. We're lucky they didn't have a Murder card when we pulled out our
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  Minotaur, and a lot of this game felt like pure luck as the Standard format sometimes does. One thing was clear, however. Despite being severely limited the entire game, the fun itself was not limited.

  Our opponent used this Blue/Black deck against us when we ran the Red/White deck, so against our second opponent we chose to use this set. Unfortunately, we ran into the opposite problem of our first game: we were flooded with too much mana. That's Lady Luck for you, but just like the first game, it was still a lot of fun (and we won too). This
  <em>
   Magic: The Gathering
  </em>
  starter deck is more built around getting Assassins out, making the most out of the new Freerunning keyword, and otherwise playing the game at one's own pace. We managed to do this by taking out powerful enemies with weaker Deathtouch cards, using Murder at the right time against a strong card, and popping a couple of Tranquilizes on enemy walls.

 <p>
  Each deck had a wall card to support its assassins in the air, and we found that Tranquilize did a lot of work in preventing our opponent from using theirs. We also managed to get Ezio, Blade of Vengeance, out and kept poking at our opponent in hopes of drawing something that wasn't a land (spoiler alert: we did not), but constant pokes, the use of Tranquilize, and a few other Assassins got us the win.

  Overall, it feels like we barely scratched the surface of what each deck was capable of. These may just be starter decks, but they take full advantage of the core conceits of the

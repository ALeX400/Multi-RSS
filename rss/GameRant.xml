  While exploring the world, players will need to pick a job and use the skills from it (and other Jobs that are great) to keep up with the various missions that they are tasked with completing. Here's how to level up these Jobs faster so that players can grab skills that require more experience.

  Leveling up Jobs in
  <em>
   Steamworld Heist 2
  </em>
  is actually pretty easy; however, there are ways to increase how quickly players are able to level them up so that they can obtain some of the best skills for those Jobs, and so they can add some skills to other Jobs that may not be their main one. Here's how to level up those jobs quickly:

  <em>
   <strong>
    Palworld
   </strong>
  </em>
  may still be in early access, but it already has a ton of content that makes it an interesting and engaging entry within the monster-capturing genre. With changes like the recent major Sakurajima update, the game is looking to continue its growth, and doing so has allowed it to garner people's attention. However, there are those who are concerned regarding the direction of the game, specifically about how Pocketpair is going to handle big changes in the future. Depending on what the developer does,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  could either increase the speed of its evolution and gain more traction, or it will end up with previous efforts wasted.

  Since
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  's release in January 2024, the game has seen a number of changes, with one of the biggest being the Sakurajima update released on June 24. The recent major modification to Pocketpair's creation has seen it gain a lot of content that has enhanced its many aspects, even going as far as introducing a PvP mode to the delight of many fans. Such a huge update ended up helping
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  to stay relevant within its community and the gaming industry. However, it does leave some speculating as to when the next major patch could happen, seeing as to how beneficial it is. Pocketpair may want to consider releasing one sooner rather than later, as it will give the game's early access the momentum it needs until its full release.

  A game such as
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  has the potential to have a lot of interesting content due to it being a mix of monster-capturing and survival gameplay. The Sakurajima update has proven that big changes can lead to much appreciation from the community, which in turn also results in other positives. Pocketpair shouldn't wait for a long time to release even more big changes for a number of reasons, including:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Waiting for too long for big game-changing additions could make people lose interest, which could result in the player count declining for
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Announcing big changes with new and unique content will get people interested and talking about it, allowing it to remain relevant.
  </li>
  <li>
   Anything added via major updates now can still be improved, changed, or removed before the final release, allowing the developers enough time to figure out what works and what doesn't.

 <p>
  If Pocketpair decides to churn out another huge patch soon, it is likely that another massive player count spike for

  What a Major Update Can Do To Keep Palworld Hype Going
 </h3>
 <p>
  A
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  update that fixes bugs and makes balance changes will definitely be appreciated by players, but big patches will need more than just that. The recent major modification to the game introduced things like a new island, mode, Pals, and other fascinating content that made people want to play. The next one may consider finally introducing a story mode, as
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  has all the resources necessary to justify its inclusion. Such a big addition could even lead to more game-changing content for future updates, an example being another faction with its own background and new area. Pocketpair should consider adding these while
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is still riding high from its recent major changes, as doing so will help keep people's eyes on the game and perhaps ensure it stays alive for a long time.

 <p>
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  can't rest on its Early Access laurels if it wants to continue establishing itself within the monster-capturing and even the survival genre scene. Pocketpair has to make sure that the next major patch isn't too far away, as it needs to use the momentum of the Sakurajima update to keep its current players satisfied while also attracting more new ones. If it's not implemented soon, the game risks falling off before ever realizing its full potential.

    Cult of the Lamb

  has received a fair bit of free content since its release. When Sins of the Flesh came out at the start of 2024, it added some traits to the game, shaking up the game according to the free update's content. Later on, Unholy Alliance, another free expansion for the game, introduced even more follower traits to
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>

  The manga for
  <em>
   <strong>
    My Hero Academia
   </strong>
  </em>
  may have come to an end, but that doesn't mean the end of the line for games based on the series.
  <em>
   My Hero Academia
  </em>
  may not have been around as long as series such as
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  , but it's one of the bigger names in recent anime. There have already been a few games based on the series, most notably the
  <em>
   My Hero One's Justice
  </em>
  fighting games. There could still be a future for the series in the realm of gaming, especially with how much more
  <em>
   My Hero Academia
  </em>
  has to offer.

 <p>
  Regardless of how many games
  <em>
   My Hero Academia
  </em>
  has, its rise in the anime world has been impressive. Among the series that made their debuts in the 2010s, it has arguably made the biggest impact. The series follows the story of Izuku Midoriya, also known as Deku, a boy who aspires to be a hero despite having no Quirk, the series' name for superpowers. However, a chance encounter with his idol All Might led to him inheriting the latter's quirk and getting a chance to live his dream. The series became one of Shonen Jump's biggest recent hits by far, spawning multiple spin-offs and original movies.

  A Future MHA Game Can Follow the Cast as Pro Heroes
 </h3>
 <p>
  Following the release of the battle royale
  <em>
   My Hero Ultra Rumble
  </em>
  , there is still plenty of ground that the series can cover in the gaming world. At the end of the series, Class 1-A have moved on to professional hero careers. It would be cool to see a game follow up on these early years of their time as pro heroes. Players could have a chance to play through villain encounters as various characters, potentially including those that often stay out of the spotlight such as Sero, Ashido, and Shoji. The cast's pro careers would be a fantastic source for future
  <em>
   My Hero Academia
  </em>
  games.

  Deku's New Hero Suit Can Be Explored in Games

 <p>
  Deku's own future also provides a new angle. Ironically similar to Deku's appearance in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , he no longer has One for All at the end of the series, having sacrificed his Quirks in the final battle. However, the ending also reveals that he still had the ability to be a hero thanks to an advanced battle suit that grants him enhanced abilities. His previous game appearances all featured his fighting style when he had One for All, but how he uses his new suit hasn't recieved the same treatment. A
  <em>
   My Hero Academia
  </em>
  game set after the manga could show off Deku's new style.

  There is one more obvious hook that could be used for a new game. The next
  <em>
   My Hero Academia
  </em>
  game could let the player play as a UA student, either alongside Class 1-A or in the new class taught by Deku. Players could design their own hero, choose their quirk, and customize their fighting style. They could perhaps even form friendships and team up with other heroes-in-training. This game could send players on missions that further expand the
  <em>
   My Hero Academia
  </em>
  world in several ways. A new game could be the best way to explore
  <em>

  's next generation.

  <em>

  's main story is over, but such a major franchise is unlikely to fade away easily. While it may not match

  's library of games, there is still a world of potential for future
  <em>
   My Hero Academia

  games. What happened after the final defeat of One for All is too tempting a concept not to explore in at least some way. Not to mention, it could let fans revisit some of their favorite characters in-game.
  <em>

  still has plenty left to do in the gaming industry.

  Carrying two
  <strong>
   Exothermic Charges, Thermite
  </strong>
  is a staple of most attacking lineups due to his powerful gadget that offers the biggest opening of any hard breacher in the game. Exothermic Charges are vital for gaining access to an objective, opening more entry points for attackers, and reducing the areas that defenders can safely play in.

 <p>
  While a powerful piece of kit, it does have some drawbacks. If a reinforced surface has denial on it (electrification or a Signal Disruptor), Thermite will need assistance to open the wall or hatch. Also, the Charge must be placed by hand on a surface, leaving Thermite exposed while deploying his gadget.

  <strong>
   Maverick’s Blow Torch
  </strong>
  can breach any surface, reinforced or soft, by burning a hole in it (even if it's electrified or Mute jammed). It can make small holes, crouch holes, and can even open reinforced hatches and whole reinforced walls if mastered. This takes more time than other hard breachers, but in the right hands, players can single-handedly open anything they choose. However, while holding his Blow Torch and breaching a surface up close, he is very vulnerable and usually requires cover from teammates.

 <p>
  The Breaching Torch has a limited fuel count that decreases as he uses it. If used sparingly, it can breach two reinforced hatches or two reinforced walls. Alternatively, making small holes that defenders may not notice can allow him to stealthily eliminate the enemy. The Breaching Torch is a powerful gadget, but one that requires practice to master.

  <strong>
   Ace
  </strong>
  gets three
  <strong>
   Selma Charges
  </strong>
  that can breach reinforced and soft surfaces. One Selma opens a medium-sized hole that players can vault or crouch through. If players want to walk through the breach, then two Selmas deployed at the right distance apart will do the trick. Selmas may open smaller holes than Thermite’s Exothermic Charges, but they can be thrown from a distance onto a surface, making them safer to use.

  Selma’s biggest weakness is against reinforced hatches. Two Selmas open one reinforced hatch, which is the worst of any hard breaching gadget. The best option for opening hatches is Hibana’s X-Kairos Launcher, which nearly made this list, but since it only opens small holes in walls, it just missed out.

  <strong>
   Montagne
  </strong>
  is one of a few operators in the game that is picked solely for his primary gadget. Since the shield rework, Monty has become one of the best attackers in the game if used in coordination with a team. His
  <strong>
   extendable shield
  </strong>
  allows him to get in the face of defenders without taking damage. He can then relay this information to his team, via yellow pings and callouts, allowing his teammates to take out the enemy.

 <p>
  The ability to extend and retract his Shield also makes him more of a threat than other shield operators. If enemies look away from him, he can retract his Shield and bash them onto the ground up close or shoot them with his pistol at range (although shooting exposes his head). This makes Monty a formidable opponent that enemies often need to double up on to get the better of.

  On its release,
  <strong>
   Grim’s Hive Launcher
  </strong>
  was one of the worst primary gadgets in the game. However, after multiple buffs, it is now one of the best at gathering intel and clearing positions. The Hive Launcher can fire up to five canisters that each release a swarm of robotic bees which last for 16 seconds and mark enemies caught in its 4.6-meter radius, giving attackers a live red ping of the defender’s position. The Hive launcher has two fire settings; sticky and bouncy. The second option allows players to bounce the canister around corners, leaving them less exposed to gunfire.

 <p>
  Grim's Hive Launcher is perfect for bombsite executions as it limits where defenders can play to deny a plant. It is also great for clearing power positions that defenders love to play in, causing enemies to decide whether to stay and take an unfavorable gunfight, or retreat and give up space to the attackers.

  <strong>
   Capitao’s Tactical Crossbow
  </strong>
  may not be a high-tech gadget, but it’s a versatile and powerful one. He gets four bolts in total, two smoke and two asphyxiating, which players can easily switch between.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  When asphyxiating bolts hit a surface, they drop and spread fire across the ground in a 5-meter radius. The fire lasts for 10 seconds and deals 36 damage per second to anyone inside it (friendlies included), essentially blocking off an area of the map for a limited time. It's perfect for clearing power positions as it forces defenders to either aggress or fall back. It’s also good at locking down areas during a bombsite execution, preventing defenders from aggressing onto the planter.

 <p>
  The Smoke Bolts expand on impact with a surface, creating a cloud of smoke that is larger than regular smoke grenades and can be applied more precisely. Its main purpose is to block off lines of sight, allowing a safer entrance into the bombsite.

Players can scan these footprints to reveal an enemy’s position via a red ping that updates every five seconds. The scanner has no limit to how long it can be active, but it is limited to three scans and only one scan can be active at a time.

  There are few gadgets in Rainbow Six Siege as powerful as
  <strong>
   Thatcher’s EMP Grenades
  </strong>
  . They are a throwable gadget that disables all enemy electronics in its 5.2-meter range for 10 seconds. With three available to him, he can do a lot of damage to the defensive setup.

  EMPs can deactivate traps and cameras, allowing teammates into areas without their position being revealed. They can disable anti-projectile devices like Jager’s ADS and Wamai’s Magnets, and stop plant denial such as Maestro’s Evil Eye Cameras and Echo’s Yokai Drones, which can facilitate a bombsite execution. The most common use is to disable wall denial which allows hard breachers to open reinforced walls and hatches.

 <p>
  Since the introduction of the secondary gadget, Impact EMP Grenades, other operators can now achieve a similar effect but on a smaller scale. However, Impact EMPs have a small area of effect and require precision and information on where defender gadgets are. Therefore, Thatcher’s EMPs are still the easiest way to render defenders' electrical gadgets useless.

  Few sounds in
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  fill players with fear more than the screech of a
  <strong>
   Candela
  </strong>
  moments before it explodes at their feet and totally blinds them. Candelas have a three-second fuse timer which can be reduced by holding it. Furthermore, players can attach Candelas to soft surfaces and their projectiles fire onto the other side. However, usually, Candelas are thrown, bouncing off surfaces and rolling along the ground before detonating. If a Candela has been held for three or more seconds, it activates immediately upon hitting the floor.

 <p>
  Candelas may seem like a glorified stun grenade, but their wide range and flexible fuse time make them a powerful gadget for clearing power positions and executing onto the bombsite. Plus, with
  <strong>
   Ying’s special glasses
  </strong>
  , she cannot be blinded by her own flashes, allowing her to push in behind her Candelas and take out any blinded defenders.

  At the top spot is
  <strong>
   Dokkaebi’s Logic Bomb
  </strong>
  , an annoyingly good ability that makes all defender phones ring for 12 seconds, revealing their location via sound and stopping defenders from accessing cameras until the effect wears off, they step into a Mute Jammer, or they manually silence their phones. To turn off their phones, defenders must enter a five-second animation, giving attackers time to converge on their position and take them out.

 <p>
  With two Logic Bombs available to her, Dokkaebi can use one early to clear roamers and save the second for a bombsite execution, stopping defenders from accessing plant denial such as Yokai Drones or Evil Eyes. Dokkaebi is also able to hack into defender cameras by accessing the phone of a dead defender, giving her team huge amounts of valuable intel.

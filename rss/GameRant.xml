  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  launched together and they have many similarities. Both are open-world RPGs but
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  gets players right into the action faster than
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  . And Nintendo's latest remaster is huge.

  Players will find no need to want more content in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  from story missions to side quests. While some of these side quests in particular may seem trivial, they open up some interesting stories and gameplay opportunities. Let's go through what players can expect to see in the first ten hours or so without diving into any story particulars to save on spoilers.

  This game has one of the weirdest maps to interact with as each region is divided into a hexagon. In some of these hexagons, players can plant a probe, one of several varieties, to gain bonuses. The Probe-fessional is a side quest in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  that will teach players all about this mechanic while earning some extra rewards. One of New L.A.’s survey chiefs, Kirsty, asks players to plant and tether three probes together in the wilds. It’s as simple as that plus an extra lesson thrown in.

  Better Latte Than Never is one of the funnier quests players can tackle early. In the commercial district of New L.A. players can run into Jo, a barista, who is having a panic attack. She broke the coffee machine and needs players to get some replacement parts before the store opens.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a simple fetch quest for an RPG which is marked on Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition’s map. There’s a bit more to it involving Jo’s klutziness but that’s not worth spoiling here.

  Myles to Go is a delivery mission that players can start once they find Satie who is close to HQ. She needs players to deliver some items to a soldier, Myles, who she has lost contact with. Once players track him down on the map, Myles will ask players to take on a monster for him. The EXP and monetary rewards are decent for this one along with the satisfaction of helping fellow teammates. The extra bonus is getting an eyepatch to customize their character with for players who like to give their characters a pirate look in their RPGs.

  Once players get through some of the prologue missions, they will unlock the concept of Affinity Missions. Players need to bond with their teammates to unlock Affinity Missions and this one is tied to Elma in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  . We Were Soldiers will begin with the team being tasked with surveying wreckage from the colony ship, White Whale, to get parts and answers. It’s a large effort, involving multiple squads of BLADEs going on patrol. This leads to a giant monster fight, of course, but it shouldn’t be a problem if players have kept constant with their leveling up.

  The Repair Job is another Affinity Mission in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  and this one is tied to Lin. She’s the technician of the group and is kind of like an homage to Shion from Monolith Soft’s first
  <em>
   Xeno
  </em>
  project,
  <em>
   Xenosaga
  </em>
  . Lin’s goal in this mission is to prove her technology has what it takes to help New L.A. thrive which is being questioned. This is a side quest more about character development than it is about fighting monsters. Lin is one of the better characters in the game, so this one is worth completing for the revelations alone.

  As great as the story-based side quests are, players should not ignore Basic Missions. There is a terminal located outside of BLADE’s HQ, offering dozens of basic fetch quests all of which will be marked on the map upon taking them on. Defeat monsters, gather materials, survey areas, and so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best part about Basic Missions is that they can be repeated. It’s an easy way to get EXP and money quickly early on in
  <em>

  </em>
  with some quicker to repeat than others.

They can join others in full co-op missions but there are fetch quests kind of like Basic Missions that don’t require other players. While online, the map will be sprinkled with blue markers called Squad Tasks. These run the gamut from taking down rare monsters that operate like mini-bosses to basic bounty hunts for smaller critters. Every Squad Task completed will earn players a special currency they can then spend on materials in an online store. These materials can even help complete Basic Mission tasks which players can exploit if they are strategic.

 <p>
  After the whirlwind success of the first game, a sequel to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </em>
  </strong>
  always seemed like a forgone conclusion, but with the second game now formally announced, fans can finally set to work making some predictions about what and who might show up in the hotly anticipated follow-up to one of 2023’s biggest titles. Exact details about the game are next to nonexistent at the moment, leaving plenty of room for speculation and hype-building. There’s plenty of untapped Wizarding World lore to explore in the sequel and plenty of fan-favorite characters, locations, and creatures that did not make an appearance in the original.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  But the events of the games take place a considerable length of time before the mainline series; about 100 years to be exact. That puts a fairly strong limit on the types of characters that can make guest cameo appearances in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  , but there are still plenty of familiar faces fans can anticipate making an appearance in the second game from Avalanche Studios.

 <h3 id="more-members-of-sirius-black-39-s-family-tree">
  More Members of Sirius Black's Family Tree
 </h3>
 <p>
  Fans of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  will remember Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black as the stern, condescending and generally unlikable professor that banned quidditch for the game’s school year. But even casual fans of the series will have recognized his family name. Phineas was one of Sirius Black’s ancestors, a member of the pureblood Black family. The Blacks had been a fixture in magical society throughout time until the clan seemingly died out during the events of the books. But as far as the games’ timeline is concerned, there’s still plenty of them kicking around.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Order of the Phoenix
  </em>
  , Harry sees an elaborate, sprawling tapestry of all of Sirius Black's ancestors, living and dead. Phineas was hardly the only Black running around at the time of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , and there's fertile ground to introduce more of the family. By all accounts (including Sirius’ own), the family at large has never been a particularly friendly group of customers, but maybe
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  can introduce some family members that are a bit more personable than the former headmaster.
 </p>
 <h3 id="merope-gaunt">
  Merope Gaunt
 </h3>
 <p>
  Depending entirely upon how long of a gap there is between the games, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see Merope Gaunt appear in a later installment of the
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  series. According to the timeline, Merope was born in 1907 and is most notable in the series as the mother of Tom Riddle Jr. who later becomes Lord Voldemort.
 </p>
 <p>
  Merope’s relative, Ominous Gaunt, appears in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , though how exactly he is related to her remains unclear. Pureblood families in the Wizarding World are so obsessed with their own warped idea of purity that, given enough time, their family trees start looking like more of a wreath. This was one of the reasons Rowling noted as the source of Merope’s many health issues in her early years, along with callous abuse from her father Marvolo. While it remains a matter of debate if Merope ever actually attended Hogwarts in her teens, she would make for a fascinating NPC to interact with, as Merope's infatuation with Tom Riddle Sr. was what ultimately set the events of the series into motion.
 </p>
 <h3 id="dobby">
  Dobby
 </h3>
 <p>
  This one may be a bit of a stretch, but consider that the series has never established a clear upper limit to how old house elves can be in the Wizarding World. It is, however, common knowledge that individual elves will serve one singular family for generations. Given that Dobby died in March 1998, it’s entirely within the realm of possibility, if not likely even, that he would be around and active during the events of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  As one of the most beloved characters of the series, a cameo from a much younger Dobby would be a treat for series diehards and casual fans alike and would give some much-needed insight into the house elf’s earliest days. Perhaps players can see how he came to be owned by the Malfoy family. Or, if that’s out of the cards, maybe the developers can subvert audience expectations by having the Malfoys of yesteryear be genuinely caring and loving toward Dobby, treating him as a member of their family rather than the brutalized servant Lucuis and Narcissa treated him as.
 </p>
 <h3 id="albus-dumbledore">
  Albus Dumbledore
 </h3>
 <p>
  More than anyone else on this list, a young Dumbledore is an absolute must for any
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  sequel. The original game takes place during the school year of 1890. An 11-year-old Albus Dumbledore canonically attends his first year of Hogwarts in 1892, just two years after the events of the first game. The player character from
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  will still be enrolled as a seventh year by the time Albus gets sorted into Gryffindor.
 </p>
 <p>
  It goes without saying that the storytelling potential here is massive. Throughout the series, Dumbledore is portrayed as this almost mythic figure; the kindly, wise old mentor who always has all the answers. It isn’t until the final book (and later the
  <em>
   Fantastic Beasts
  </em>
  films) that the series starts peeling away the layers of “Dumbledore the legend” and really starts getting into who he was as a man: Albus' troubled family life, his tragic relationship with Grindelwald, and his sometimes ethically questionable decision-making when it comes to his handling of Harry’s safety.
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of what makes Dumbledore such a beloved and resonating character is that the reader’s journey with him is emblematic of the way people tend to see their own parents; at young ages they are larger than life figures, but with age and experience it becomes clear they are people too with their own histories, problems, and shortcomings. Meeting a first-year Albus would continue this series-long trend of deconstructing the idealized version of Dumbledore so many fans built up in their minds. Gamers could see who he was before he became a legend with the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders, ensuring that Dumbledore is perhaps the best and most important cameo Avalanche could deliver with
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy 2
  </em>

 <p>
  Capcom has big plans for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which can be seen via all the upcoming content heading to the game. A big update is expected to arrive soon, and with it comes many things players are looking forward to. One of those that has caught the attention of many is the Grand Hub, a new location meant to be a centralized area for socializing and forming parties with people actively enjoying the game. Its implementation will certainly one-up the already established base camps, and will likely change the world of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  for the better.

  During the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  showcase on March 25, 2025, Capcom revealed the first title update heading towards the game. The Grand Hub was one of the pieces of content shown to be planned to come with the patch, causing a lot of anticipation and excitement among the viewers. Given the number of things it's expected to have for players to enjoy, it will almost certainly shove base camps to the side and become the new spot to do everything from, as long as it lives up to the hype.

 <p>
  April 4 will be a big day for
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , as the brand-new update, together with the Grand Hub, makes its debut for everyone to enjoy. The new hangout spot for players can be seen as a substantial upgrade from base camps, and it's all because of what it plans to provide:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Activities that give players a break from hunting, such as participating in arm wrestling competitions with other hunters, or the new Barrel Bowling mini-game
  </li>
  <li>
   A diva who performs songs every night, giving everyone in the Grand Hub a show that can help alleviate some of the stress and tension that comes with hunting in-game monsters
  </li>
  <li>
   An arena counter that lets players participate in quests involving the new leaderboard system, enticing hunters to see how they fare against others in killing monsters in the shortest time possible
  </li>
  <li>
   A new canteen where everyone can eat together, and whose carefully prepared meals may even be better than those of the current best foods in
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Unless Capcom does something to improve the current state of the game's base camps, they'll likely be left behind in favor of the Grand Hub whenever it's convenient. This is likely only the beginning of the new hub's features, too.
 </p>
 <h3 id="what-the-new-grand-hub-could-bring-back-that-monster-hunter-wilds-rsquo-base-camps-cannot">
  What the New Grand Hub Could Bring Back That Monster Hunter Wilds’ Base Camps Cannot
 </h3>
 <p>
  After capturing a monster in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , they're usually left in whatever area they're caught and will eventually get up and leave as if nothing had happened. However, instead of that,
  <em>
   MH Wilds
  </em>
  could send them somewhere where players can marvel at them. This was available in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter World
  </em>
  , and perhaps
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  could bring it back with the new Grand Hub. It should have the space necessary to include a viewing room or something similar for captured monsters, something that cannot be said for base camps. Giving players a consistent way to see whatever they've taken the time to catch instead of kill would be a great new avenue of immersion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Playing
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  will not be the same when the Grand Hub finally arrives in the game via the update, as it brings a lot that can affect both the single and multiplayer experience. While base camps will still play a vital role for narrative purposes, the eventual patch will certainly demote them to stepping stones on the road to and from the much more sophisticated Grand Hub.

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has revealed important details about a new elemental reaction that is expected to become part of the game in the upcoming months. Elemental reactions are a core mechanic in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , and they can be triggered by combining different elements on an enemy target.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the moment, there are seven different elements in the world of Teyvat, with Dendro being the most recently added one. With the introduction of Dendro,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  also added numerous elemental reactions, which completely shifted the meta, making some elements much more powerful while others became almost obsolete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the last couple of days,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has been hinting at a new Cryo elemental reaction that will be tied to the Imaginarium Theater domain, at least for now. A credible leaker named HomDGCat has revealed more details about this reaction, and it will apparently be triggered by combining
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's Dendro and Cryo elements. This means that, over two years after Sumeru and Dendro arrived, Cryo will finally be able to interact with Dendro, one of the major complaints in the community. Many fans hope that the Imaginarium Theater will serve as a testing phase for the new reaction, as there is no real reason why it should not be implemented in the rest of the game.

 <ul>
  <li>
   After enemies take both Dendro and Cryo damage, they will receive a 45% damage buff for those types of elemental damage. The reaction will cause a Frost Thorn to appear, dealing Cryo and Dendro damage over time.
  </li>
  <li>
   Path 1: After enemies within Frost Thorn take Electro damage, the DoT will convert to Electro damage and reduce enemies' Electro RES.
  </li>
  <li>
   Path 2: After enemies within Frost Thorn take Electro damage, the Frost Thorn will stop attacking. Instead, enemies will take 135% increased Cryo, Dendro, Electro, and Physical damage, and characters will receive a 300 Elemental Mastery buff, which is great news, especially for Dendro users in
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Even though players have not yet had the opportunity to test this elemental reaction, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with many comments claiming that a similar reaction should be implemented in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's overworld. This reaction would significantly improve the viability of Cryo, Electro, and Physical characters in the game. Some fans suspect that HoYoverse will monitor how the two different paths perform and eventually make one of them a permanent part of the game.
 </p>

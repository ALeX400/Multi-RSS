    <ul>
     <li>
      Squall Leonhart from FF8 is seen as introspective &amp; relatable despite being perceived as detached &amp; dull due to his inner struggles.
     </li>
     <li>
      Rinoa Heartilly is an amiable character, but some find her naive and corny, possibly due to FF8's focus on weapons over characters.
     </li>
     <li>
      Lightning from FF13 is headstrong and cool to some, while others view her as cruel and have unfavorably compared her to Cloud from FF7.

  Games in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  series tend to be character-driven experiences. For all the wonderful world-building and innovative mechanics, the RPGs live or die on their ability to captivate their audience with a cast of charming personalities.

 <p>
  There have been solid hits and sore misses, but some characters have a strange tendency to polarize the fanbase. Whether it's because of their personality, looks, or actions, fans are divided into those who love them and those who hate them.

 <p>
  Of all the modern
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games, many fans agree that the friendship between the party in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 15
   </strong>
  </em>
  was characterized the best. The road trip and all that follows is a backdrop to Noctis' growth from a sheltered child to a responsible adult and ruler.

 <p>
  However, some gamers took one look at his then-already outdated emo attire, sampled his early characterization, and wrote him off as flat and childish (for example, his refusal to eat vegetables). Noctis' best side comes from his growth, which happens late in the game, and it doesn't help that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15's
  </em>
  full story is delivered in a scattered fashion across non-game media.

  Some players may associate this
  <em>
   <strong>

  character with perpetual whining and needless antagonism towards Snow, but to be fair to Hope, he experiences profound personal loss and trauma early in the story, followed sharply by his becoming a l'Cie, which is, in all fairness, a reasonable explanation for holding onto such undying anger.

 <p>
  Players meet Hope at the worst moment of his life, and many forget that he is also just a child who, extreme circumstances aside, would have trouble dealing with his emotions anyway. However, many have pointed out that
  <em>
   FF13's
  </em>
  writing failed to make him a sympathetic figure. His fans tend to cite his rapid character growth and the end result: a true symbol for humanity worthy of his name.

 <p>
  For their first game with voice acting and expressive human models and faces, Square Enix really leaned into the character-driven narrative for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 10
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Its success hinged upon whether players would relate with the cast and bond with the audience surrogate, Tidus. While he won many fans over with his can-do optimism and innovative, fish-out-of-water perspective, many players found Tidus' shenanigans tedious.

 <p>
  Those with a dislike for the star of the Zanarkand Abes will point to his downer opening narration, his tendency to stick his neck in other people's sacred rituals and business, and the infamous laughing scene. While his antics do come across as occasionally laughable, Tidus demonstrates humanity and a string when the situation calls for it. Plus, he proves himself a champion in the Blitzball arena.

 <p>
  As far as characters go in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  , Rinoa is probably one of the more grounded in terms of looks and backstory. Although her father was an important political figure, she is not a princess or chosen hero, nor is she a supernatural being (at least at the beginning). Rinoa is headstrong and willful, going as far as to plan a revolution to liberate her home city of Timber. She looks and acts like a regular young adult or teen girl with her own history of relationships, her own ideas about politics, her big pet dog, and her dreams.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":944} -->

 <p>
  Unfortunately, it is for these exact reasons that many (male) fans see her in a negative light. However, some Rinoa detractors will point out that, due to the generic nature of the cast (thanks to the Junction System), players have nothing to focus on besides their weapons and limit break abilities. Rinoa has a flimsy-looking wrist-mounted projectile weapon, which she uses to occasionally shoot her dog at enemies at low health, among other campy moves. Finally, some fans just didn't gel well with
  <em>
   FF8's
  </em>
  love story theme, and Rinoa is one of the two characters in that romance.

  For a main character who spawned two sequels (including one with her name in it), it is strange that Lightning
  <em>
  </em>
  is either beloved or reviled by the fans. Many see her as cold and cruel, especially when she directs violence against members of her own party throughout
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 13

  Lightning has often been unfavorably compared to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  's Cloud and described as a "lesser clone" of him. However, many view her as a refreshing change of pace for female characters in the series, who (with a few exceptions) tended to be on the more passive side, rarely taking a leading role. In contrast, Lightning's stoicism and strength give her a strong personality.

  As one of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  's most polarizing games in general, it makes sense that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 8's
   </strong>
  </em>
  lead character would also garner divisiveness among the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  community. Squall is often decried as a moping, cold depressive with an attitude problem. His perceived "attitude" is not helped by the English translation's insistence on overusing his notorious "Whatever" catchphrase when the original script called for more ambiguous and indirect language.

 <p>
  One thing to consider about Squall's characterization is that much of the "whining" is read directly from his thoughts. Unlike other leading men in Final Fantasy, Squall's inner doubts and fears are put on full display. In other words, many players prefer the masculine ideal of an invincible supersoldier over being able to see the realistically troubled thoughts of a young man.

  The vast and expansive Sci-Fi fantasy world of
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  has a lot to offer to newcomers, be it fans of the books or tabletop games, or just newcomers who want to see what the hype is all about. While the franchise is very established in certain gaming genres, it has branched out to the likes of hack-and-slash, turn-based strategy, and first-person shooters as well. With the diversity of this historic franchise in mind, here are a few
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  games spread across multiple genres that are ideal for newcomers or players who aren't longtime fans of the universe.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Boltgun

  </em>
  is a nostalgia-driven FPS game in a similar vein to
  <em>

  . The most impressive thing about this game is how the retro-style visuals have been executed. The colors are vibrant and eye-catching, and the graphical style blends into the game beautifully. For newcomers or those wary of the dense
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000

  lore, this game has a simple, somewhat barebones story that is easy to get into.

 <p>
  <em>
   Boltgun
  </em>
  features tons of cool weapons that feel unique and are fun to use. There's actual weight to the combat, and enemies aren't just bullet sponges. The game isn't exactly hard, but it's filled to the brim with action and swarms of enemies for players to gun down in service to the Imperium. While
  <em>
   Boltgun
  </em>
  doesn't exactly tread new waters, it's an excellent boomer shooter blended into the
  <em>
   40K
  </em>
  universe in a commendable fashion, and FPS fans are sure to enjoy it as their first foray into the franchise.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Darktide
   </strong>
  </em>
  is similar in concept to
  <em>
   Warhammer: Vermintide 2,
  </em>
  with the biggest differences being how the game is enshrined in the 40K universe through its narrative — and how players can fully customize their characters, rather than customizing a preset class. In
  <em>
   Darktide,
  </em>
  players can team up with up to 3 friends to take on swarms of infested enemies. The game involves the player joining the Inquisition atop the Mourningstar and attempting to fight back against a chaotic plague.

 <p>
  Barraging through hundreds of enemies with an incredible soundtrack playing in the background alongside a couple of friends is an amazing experience, and while the game isn't too complex, it does the basics very well. Moreover, it's super easy for any newcomer to the series to jump into as the game doesn't rely on any previous knowledge of the
  <em>
   40K
  </em>
  universe, nor is it a direct sequel to anything.

  The combat is polished to a fine shine, and there are tons of different missions, each with their own unique map design coupled with some great visuals and an incredible soundtrack to tie it all together. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Mechanicus
  </em>
  is perhaps a bit too simple for a strategy game. If players get the right skills early on, the game can be very easy, with the fun diverting from tactical nuance to satisfaction at just steamrolling every enemy. Despite this one caveat, it's a solid game for fans of the genre — or for newcomers looking to dip their toes in the world of
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  made the controversial decision to remove some important features from the original game. However, it proved to be the right call as the game is considered one of the best under the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  umbrella. Playing as the Space Marines, players can fight through multiple interplanetary campaigns in this real-time strategic setting. While
  <em>
   Dawn of War 2
  </em>
  doesn't feature any base buildings, it makes up for it through a litany of other RTS features: a variety of different game modes, including co-op and multiplayer, four different army factions, and dozens of hours of content to boot.

  <em>
   Dawn of War 2
  </em>
  is an excellent RTS game that interweaves a fantastic
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000
  </em>
  story with some classic, polished RTS gameplay. Players, as always, have access to tons of customization options, weapon variety, armor pieces, and items to go around for the whole army. Coupled with a deep skill system and the game's large scale, it's very easy to sink dozens and dozens of hours into this game.
  <em>
   Dawn of War 2
  </em>
  is a great game regardless of the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  moniker, and one well worth trying out to this day for anyone even remotely interested in this grimdark setting.

      <title>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP Developer Pushes Back Against Censorship Claims</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-developer-censorship-claims-response/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda recently addressed the reception surrounding the recently released
  <em>
   <strong>
    Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP
   </strong>
  </em>
  , specifically addressing the claims about censorship.
  <em>
   Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP
  </em>
  was released earlier this September, bringing the 2012 cult classic zombie hack-and-slash game to several modern platforms. Players control cheerleading zombie killer Juliet Starling, battling the undead before they overrun her high school on her birthday.
  <em>
   Lollipop Chainsaw
  </em>
  was originally penned by Hollywood director James Gunn and directed by Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda, AKA Suda51, of
  <em>
   No More Heroes
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Killer7
  </em>
  fame. The remaster, however, doesn't involve either Gunn or Suda, with it being done in-house by Dragami Games.

 <p>
  After a couple of delays,
  <em>
   Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP
  </em>
  was finally released for Nintendo Switch, PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S systems on September 12. PS4 and Xbox One ports of
  <em>
   Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP
  </em>
  are coming later in November as well. Despite being an anticipated game, there was also a lot of trepidation, due to the lack of involvement from the original creators, as well as the scaling back of the game from a remake to a remaster. While fan reception is generally favorable, the critical reception to
  <em>
   RePOP
  </em>
  is more mixed, with numerous changes in gameplay, glitches, and lack of options on PC.

 <p>
  Yoshimi Yasuda recently addressed several of these issues in an extensive post on Twitter, including some apparent claims of censorship. Yasuda expresses his disappointment over how influencers and journalists have been spreading false news, specifically regarding
  <em>
   Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP
  </em>
  's new RePOP mode and how he proposed it as a censored mode and negotiated to make the original mode uncensored. He explains that the publisher received the ESRB's approval for the specifications, which means that players are playing a version that is applied to all platforms without any instructions for modifications.

 <p>
  RePOP Mode is one of
  <em>
   Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP
  </em>
  's new features, where it replaces the gore with a pop art style. The original mode makes the game as it was released in 2012, though with a number of changes due to the engine change from Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 5. Like the original game,
  <em>
   Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP
  </em>
  is rated M for Mature by the ESRB due to the amount of blood, gore, drug references, and intense violence present.

  Yasuda also addressed the gameplay changes fans have felt, where Juliet feels slower to control and gameplay mechanics have changed to make the game feel more difficult. Yasuda notes this is a result of
  <em>
   Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP
  </em>
  changing over to Unreal Engine 5, and how the original physics system didn't work with
  <em>
   RePOP
  </em>
  and had to be reconfigured using the Kawaii Physics plugin. Other unfavorable changes fans have raised concerns over is the replacement of the original game's licensed music.

      <title>17 Games That Let You Role-Play As A Merchant</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  A different kind of conquest awaits those in video games who prefer to win not through violence, but through economic superiority. After all, why kill one's enemies when one can just buy them instead? Money makes the world go round, and there's nothing more satisfying than seeing the numbers rise, instead of the pile of bodies, which is bad for business.

 <p>
  For that matter, some players might want to take the chill pill and engage themselves in the art of commerce. It just so happens that certain games allow players to flex their economic know-how in ways that make trade and mercantilism more interesting than saving the world through violence. Whether as a traveling merchant or a business magnate,
  <strong>
   these games allow players to become the invisible hand of the market
  </strong>
  .

  <em>
   Games that let players take up trading as a side gig are far more common than those that bring mercantile activities to the forefront. When players are looking for a deep role to play as merchants, their itch is only tickled, not scratched, by these sorts of games. Luckily, a select few titles are built entirely around the buying and selling of goods, with the economy being very much their main focus. The list has been updated with two games that do just that.

  A roguelike sandbox RPG with an incredible gameplay loop, the open-ended nature of

  Being a merchant is just one of the many things players can accomplish in this game, with the mechanics here being just satisfying enough for players to get invested in. Of course, given how broad the mechanics of
  <em>

  are, it won't take long for players to either start a new playthrough or change the setup of their character to focus on something else instead.

   <em>
    Elite Dangerous
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a game with a massive learning curve, to the point where a lot of players will give up on the experience after a few hours. This is a shame, since
  <em>
   Elite Dangerous
  </em>
  has the potential to be something incredible if players spend the time required to understand what makes this game tick.

  There are many acts that players can perform while flying around in their spaceship, and one of the simpler ways to earn a living in
  <em>
   Elite Dangerous
  </em>
  is to become an intergalactic trader. This may seem simple, but players must go through their fair share of hurdles and the like before they can really start raking in the credits.

  is a handful of a game and some players even consider it a second job due to how much time and attention it demands from players. One of its many busy activities is being a literal trader. Players get to buy and sell goods to and from faraway places with their own horse-drawn wagons.

  That's just one of the many ways to earn a decent amount of in-game currency in
  <em>
   Black Desert Online

  . If players also have a ship, they can opt to barter in the many distant ports in the game; with the size of the game's map, it might as well be a merchant's playground.

  is a space-faring game with simple graphics but don't be deceived by the apparent comfort that it brings; this title is one of the most complex space sims ever made. But to cut to the chase, yes, players can indeed roleplay as a wandering space merchant here.

  They can even manipulate and corner the black market depending on the amount and rarity of the goods they sell. The in-game economy is alive and organic, meaning players with a decent grasp of economics can make a profit and even commit to just being an in-game merchant.

  While it's well-known for its epic space battles consisting of thousands of players,
  <strong>
   <em>

   's
  </strong>
  underrated aspect is its player-driven economy. It's what fuels the players in their endeavors be it amassing an armada or running a space business. Players can certainly be roving traders here in their very own space vessels.

 <p>
  The simplest way to do this is by buying low in one region and selling high in another region. If players want something higher risk and higher reward then they can also enlist in some 0.0 Space Trading where they can get robbed by other players while carrying some valuable cargo. Pretty intense as far as merchant life goes.

  Sure enough, players can be traders by also buying low and selling high in different regions. The danger here is ten-fold since players and their poor caravan can get attacked and even enslaved by other players who are having too much fun with banditry and godlessness.

  A sequel to the popular indie game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Trader Life Simulator 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an upgrade of its underrated predecessor. There's not much role-playing involved here as players merely run a shop that they must turn into a supermarket by, of course, buying and selling.

 <p>
  There's a huge variety of things to buy and sell in this game and they're usually the stuff that one can find in supermarkets. If players are looking for a Walmart manager simulator except with a prettier store than Walmart, then this game might scratch that itch.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the belated sequel to the legendary and one-of-a-kind medieval sim RPG,
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade.
  </em>
  It's about as expansive and complex as the previous games but with the added benefit of upgraded graphics and more refined systems.

 <p>
  Among these systems is a gameplay mode or mechanic that lets players avoid the ridiculous feudal power struggle and just focus on being a roaming merchant caravan or trader instead. It still lets players win and conquer the whole game world if they get rich enough to buy territory or cities. The game is also highly-moddable, further adding to its intricate systems and mechanics.

  For those who fancy the trader lifestyle but with a fairy tale background similar to some vocations in the
  <em>
   Arabian Nights
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Caravan
   </em>

  will sate the players' need for a roving merchant lifestyle. It's also a story-driven game with some solid trade simulator mechanics.

  As part of a merchant caravan seeking to make riches, players will have to traverse deserts and many other perils in uncharted territories to bring goods to their customers. The game is heavily based on the Arabian Peninsula while also borrowing some themes and esthetics from the countries spanned by the Silk Road.

 <p>
  Also known as
  <em>
   Anno 1404,
   <strong>
    Dawn of Discovery
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the series' most impressive entries. Like most other
  <em>
   Anno
  </em>
  titles, this game is first and foremost, a city builder where players set up production buildings and keep their population happy to produce goods.

 <p>
  Players can then trade these goods to other civilizations or factions in a rather expansive network of naval trade and commerce. So in a sense,
  <em>
   Dawn of Discovery
  </em>
  is also partly a naval commerce simulator on top of being a city-builder. The best part is that it's set during the infancy of the Renaissance period when trade and naval technology were booming fast.

    Capitalism 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  probably doesn't need much explanation for a lot of players. It's a game about getting rich through market manipulation, business deals, and production streamlining. It's an in-depth strategy game that covers the multiple aspects and facades of running a business empire.

 <p>
  The game is old, however, since it was released a solid two decades ago. But it stands as one of the most comprehensive business simulations in the video game industry. A few games managed to capture the scope and care that

    Evil Bank Manager

  takes the mercantilism aspect a step further past the boundaries of ethical and moral concerns, as is implied by the title. In this business sim game, players have the goal of accumulating as much fiat currency value as possible either by printing money or becoming a Federal Reserve.

  Getting there is never a clean climb as players will have to conspire, scheme, and manipulate their way into becoming the wealthiest capitalist in the world through banking. If they become rich enough, then players can also start developing their own technologies or maybe even send a car or a rocket into space just because.

  <em>
   Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale
  </em>
  is a shop management sim where players take on the role of Recette Lemongrass, a girl in debt who needs to sell items in her shop to pay it off. These items can either be obtained through smart trading from other shops in the game or by defeating monsters in the wild

 <p>
  One of the game's best features is the amount of customization players can do with their shops. Everything from the furnishings to the drapes to the items in stock is up to the player to decide. To get better deals from the other vendors and the buyers, Racette has the ability to haggle and bargain to make the most profit.
  <em>
   Recettear
  </em>
  has a surprising amount of depth, as the world's economy is intricate, and even seemingly small decisions, like where the player places an item inside their shop, have an effect on gameplay.

   <strong>
    The Guild 2

  might just be the perfect companion to
  <em>
   Dawn of Discovery
  </em>
  . While that game is a top-down city-building trading sim,
  <em>
   The Guild 2
  </em>
  is an immersive medieval sim that is also set sometime during the Renaissance. Players are free to choose whoever they want to be in this rather turbulent era.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Renaissance
  </em>
  expansion will broaden the players' horizons as it adds even more professions or life paths, allowing players to become fully-fledged merchants with their own means of production. At a decade old, the game is heavily outdated in terms of visuals and mechanics but not many can match its scope and ambition when it comes to letting players become medieval merchants.

   <strong>
    Merchant of the Skies
   </strong>
  </em>
  offers a breathtaking new kind of scenery as far as trading games go. Because players get to travel the skies as their trade routes. Not many merchant-based games can offer that kind of experience. But of course, the goal has always been to make the business thrive.

  This pixel art game is all about letting players build their very own trading company in the clouds to cater to aerial cities. It's also an indie game, meaning it has free reign to choose whichever creative direction it wants to take and this shows in how
  <em>
   Merchant of the Skies
  </em>
  defies or combines a lot of genres.

  has a suggestion better than clouds: space! It's the final frontier for mankind and thus, the perfect setting to establish a trading empire.
  <em>
   X4: Foundations
  </em>
  is mostly a universe simulator game, but players can assume a more merchant-focused role with their space vessels.

  To that end, it's like the space-age version of
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord

  which is always a welcome amalgam of genres. The game does allow players a surprisingly vast number of different life paths, they can be a space conqueror, explorer, pirate, or just a humble merchant.

  <em>
   Merchant
  </em>
  is a medieval business tycoon simulation, with the only purpose of the game being to make the player feel like they are playing as a medieval tradesman, but with a twist. In
  <em>
   Merchant
  </em>
  , players are more than just humble traders selling their goods for profit and buying on the cheap; they are managers who send out heroes to defeat monsters and crafters to craft items to sell.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Merchant starts by equipping a hero with a set of gear, bought from the gold in the Merchant's coffers, and sending the hero out to defeat monsters. Once the hero comes back with the loot, it is then given to the crafters to refine into something valuable. Only then can the goods be sold for a profit at the shop. Players have the freedom to choose which heroes they send out to battle, what gear to equip them with, and which crafter gets to refine the loot. It's an addictive gameplay loop that only gets better with time.

  One
  <strong>
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has recently stumbled on a silly Easter egg serving as a nod to
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  . Their discovery adds to the growing list of references that fans have found in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  over the past several days.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  is scheduled for release on February 18, being set to debut as Obsidian Entertainment's first RPG since 2019. However, players who purchased the $89.99 Premium Edition of the game have already been able to play it since Thursday, February 13.
 </p>
 <p>
  The group of
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  early access adopters includes Reddit user TrashPuppy97, who recently stumbled upon a humorous Easter egg referencing
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  . Obsidian's nod to Nickelodeon's hit series was implemented in the form of a sales manifest, which is implied to have been written by Cai, one of the recurring characters from
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  . The document's author notes that "the last market was hostile to cabbages" and expresses hope that things will be different in Eora. This parallels Cai’s constant struggles in
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  , where his Cabbage Corp. repeatedly faces disasters, often ending with his iconic cry: "My cabbages!"

 <p>
  This silly nod to
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  is not the only Easter egg that early adopters have so far discovered in Obsidian's new RPG.
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  shares its universe with the
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  games, so it's also filled to the brim with references to
  <em>
   PoE
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   PoE 2: Deadfire
  </em>
  . Some fans have also found subtle nods to a few non-Obsidian titles like
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  included in the game's documents and dialogue.

  The RPG's early impressions appear to largely skew positive, as underlined by its "Strong" rating on OpenCritic, derived from an average score of 81 and an 85% reviewer recommendation rate. Many reviewers praised
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  for its meaningful choices, rich lore, strong art direction, and satisfying combat, among other qualities. In terms of grievances, one fairly common point of criticism is the game's ending, which numerous critics characterized as anticlimactic.
 </p>
 <p>
  It remains to be seen whether
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's player impressions will match its critical reception once the game is launched globally. Obsidian's newest title will be the second big-budget first-person RPG to launch in February 2025, being scheduled to debut only two weeks following Warhorse Studios'
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  . Looking at the immediate future, ARPG fans can also look forward to
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , which are set to arrive on February 28 and March 20, respectively.

      <title>No Man's Sky: Why You Should Start Over in 2025</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  Back in 2016,
  <strong>
   <em>
    No Man's Sky
   </em>
  </strong>
  hit the scene, and it has continued to evolve through the years, now making it one of the strongest space exploration titles around. Its launch may have been controversial, but
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  was able to bounce back from its rocky beginnings. Now,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  is bursting with life, making this year one of the best times to either jump back in or try out the open world survival adventure for the very first time.

  When it comes to procedural generation,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  serves as a strong example of how this can be done incredibly well. Long gone are the days when
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  was in hot water for not featuring promised features within its world. In 2025, it feels like a completely different game for players who have been along for the ride since the beginning. Even better, the recent Worlds Part 2 update takes the space adventure to the next level, giving players the perfect excuse to start from scratch.

  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  's 5.5 update, also called Worlds Part 2, expands the game's continuously evolving world even more now, bringing plenty of great features to the table. From additions that add more life to planets to quality of life changes, Worlds Part 2 brings forth a new era for
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  . The brand-new state of the game can be a great way for players to experience Hello Games' ambitious title in a fresh light.

 <h3 id="changes-introduced-in-no-man-39-s-sky-39-s-5-5-update">
  Changes Introduced in No Man's Sky's 5.5 Update
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Introduction of the purple-class star system
  </li>
  <li>
   New worlds within the purple-class star system
  </li>
  <li>
   Improvements to the terrain generation algorithm
  </li>
  <li>
   Upgraded water features, like more lifelike environmental diversity, and more realistic deep water exploration
  </li>
  <li>
   Enhanced lighting
  </li>
  <li>
   New story-driven missions
  </li>
  <li>
   Greater diversity of planets
  </li>
  <li>
   New procedurally-generated creatures, specifically of the underwater variety
  </li>
  <li>
   Abandoned mode, which removes all advanced alien life
  </li>
  <li>
   Bug fixes, quality of life and UI upgrades, and file optimization
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Based on this overview of the changes made in Worlds Part 2, this is clearly no small update. With the introduction of version 5.5, exploration in
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  has now reached new heights, as every corner of these planets has been given updated life. One of the most exciting additions is the arrival of the purple-class star system, which adds a whole new option for planetary discoveries.

 <p>
  When it comes to the open world survival genre,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  has been excelling for a while now, but the Worlds Part 2 update is a great showcase of just how much more the game can grow in the years to come. Next year,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  will be celebrating a decade of adventure, and that's a difficult milestone to achieve in such a constantly changing gaming landscape.
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  making exploration the heart of its gameplay has really helped its longevity, especially with its procedural generation being so strong.

  Whether someone has spent hours with
  <em>

 <p>
  There are plenty of great
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  games that are inspired by manga and anime, but few, if any, are quite as good as
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  . As its name suggests, it's based on Tite Kubo's
  <em>
   Bleach
  </em>
  and offers players an incredibly enjoyable combat experience that Ichigo himself would be proud of. As in most other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, that experience can become even better with the help of
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes.

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Players can redeem
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes to claim a ridiculous amount of free Product Essences, which they can then take to Kisuke in The City to get rerolls on every individual path. Product Essences can also be used to acquire cosmetic items, which is why fans of the game are always on the lookout for all of the latest
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes.

  </strong>
  <em>
   Today saw the release of

   <strong>
    375kLikes

  As with similar
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, the process of redeeming codes in
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  is relatively straightforward and does not require much knowledge or effort on the player's part. Even so, those having trouble can find
  <strong>
   step-by-step instructions
  </strong>
  on how to claim in-game rewards listed below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   First, it is necessary to launch
   <em>
    Peroxide
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Then, if players are entering the game for the first time, they'll need to
   <strong>
    go through the tutorial.
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   Once the tutorial has been completed, in the upper left part of the screen, players should
   <strong>
    find and select the start button
   </strong>
   . It is located to the right of the chat button.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the resulting menu, players should
   <strong>
    type or paste any of the active
    <em>
     Peroxide
    </em>
    codes
   </strong>
   listed above and then press Enter.

      <title>Days Gone Remastered is Bittersweet for the Franchise</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/days-gone-remastered-ps5-franchise-no-sequel/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Days Gone
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first original IP from Bend Studio, the Sony-owned studio behind
  <em>
   Siphon Filter
  </em>
  , in over a decade. The Oregon-based company spent six years making this open-world action-adventure game, and it dramatically increased its employee count in order to accommodate the title's development. Leading up to its release, there seemed to be a lot of enthusiasm from both developers and fans surrounding
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  . Sony appeared very confident in the title; so much so, in fact, that the company showed it off twice during its legendary E3 2016 conference.

  The hype train for
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  unfortunately came to a crashing halt, however, when the game was finally released in early 2019. Upon its debut,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  was met with a mixed critical reception. The game got an underwhelming score of 72 on OpenCritic, and it garnered very few accolades from major gaming outlets. Most of Sony’s blockbuster AAA games at the time had obtained OpenCritic scores in the 80s and 90s, so many fans were surprised that
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  had received such a low rating. In spite of its middling critical reception, though,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  became something of a cult classic within the gaming community. The game sold millions of copies across PS4 and PC, and it’s soon going to get a second shot at life on PS5, as well.

  Days Gone's PS5 Re-Release Includes a Lot of New Content
 </h3>
 <p>
  During the recent PlayStation State of Play, Sony announced that Bend Studio's open world epic would receive a remaster for the PlayStation 5 on April 25, 2025, which will include graphical enhancements, alongside some new modes and gameplay features. This new version, called
  <em>
   Days Gone Remastered
  </em>
  , will feature a permadeath mode, an arcade-y horde assault mode (in which players have to fight endless waves of Freakers), and a speedrun mode. Like many of Sony's recent remasters, this edition of the game will be offered to all current
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  owners as a $10 upgrade, though it will otherwise cost $50.

 <h3 id="the-days-gone-remaster-is-nice-but-many-fans-would-have-preferred-a-sequel-instead">
  The Days Gone Remaster is Nice, But Many Fans Would Have Preferred a Sequel Instead
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Days Gone Remastered
  </em>
  does include a decent amount of extra content, it's hardly what most fans of Bend Studio's latest game were hoping for. The original
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  may be a six-year-old title, but it still looks and plays great on PlayStation 5. In fact, thanks to a patch that came out in 2020,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  runs at a stable 60 FPS on PS5 with a dynamic 4K resolution. Instead of an unnecessary remaster like this one, many gamers would have no doubt preferred a proper sequel to
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <h3 id="although-days-gone-2-was-initially-scrapped-it-could-be-greenlit-if-the-remaster-sells-well">
  Although Days Gone 2 Was Initially Scrapped, It Could Be Greenlit If the Remaster Sells Well
 </h3>
 <p>
  Apparently, a few years ago, Bend Studio did actually have plans to make a
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  follow-up. According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, the company sent Sony a pitch for
  <em>
   Days Gone 2
  </em>
  shortly after the release of the first game, but it was ultimately rejected. Several reports alleged that, despite good sales, Sony internally viewed
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  as a disappointment. The game's mixed critical reception and strenuous, drawn-out development cycle were allegedly factors that played a big role in Sony’s decision to reject a sequel to it. After
  <em>
   Days Gone 2
  </em>
  was scrapped, Bend Studio started developing a new live service multiplayer title, but it was canceled earlier this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it is nice that Sony hasn't completely forgotten about
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  and is still giving it attention with its upcoming PS5 remaster, it would have been far better if the company had just given Bend Studio the opportunity to release a sequel instead. If
  <em>
   Days Gone Remastered
  </em>
  sells well, then perhaps Sony will give Bend Studio the approval it needs to make
  <em>
   Days Gone 2
  </em>
  , especially since it currently isn't working on any known projects. At the moment, though, this is just a pipe dream, and the future of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Days Gone
   </em>
  </strong>
  IP, aside from this remaster, is a complete mystery.

  Horde survival is often a feature of RTS games, but it's less often that games focus on horde defense. There have been plenty of interesting takes on the genre that do lean into horde survival as the central mechanic, though. Pitting players against endless waves of enemies or a constantly respawning threat can be a good way to keep tensions high as players progress through other objectives.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's easy for these kinds of mechanics to become frustrating and stressful if handled poorly. But, if the player is given the strategic options they need to deal with the threat, horde survival can provide a compelling gameplay balance. There are multiple ways to approach even this niche of the RTS genre though, and there are some great examples of unique mechanics and structures among the games in this topic.

  Combining deck building, horde defense, RTS mechanics, and even separate single-player and battle royale multiplayer modes,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warcana
   </em>
  </strong>
  has a lot of different aspects to its design. Players assemble a deck of cards to build base structures, which can generate units and more cards for summoning buildings and units. Each card has a tech tree, so the cards a player plays early will determine their strategy as the game progresses.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the player is building their base and forces, so are their opponents. In the battle royale multiplayer mode, massive armies clash across the map. In the single-player mode, the player must survive endless hordes of enemies as they build up their base and armies. Battles in
  <em>
   Warcana
  </em>
  involve hundreds of thousands of units at times, and the visuals of the chaotic battles are conveyed well by its vibrant pixel art style.

   <em>
    Deep Among The Swarm
   </em>
  </strong>
  may have a simplistic visual style, but its roguelike base-building and RTS horde defense gameplay loop are fun and engaging. Each run of this roguelike game sees players drilling into an infested alien planet. Where the drill stops, players must establish a base and gather the necessary resources to advance and let the drill move further. While that's going on, the player is under constant threat from the swarm.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the player digs, collects resources, and clears out swarm nests, the aggression of the swarm increases. What starts as a slow trickle of enemies soon becomes a torrent of foes that players must establish defenses and use their squads to deal with. As it's a roguelike game, players will inevitably fall to the swarm at some point, and the meta-progression elements allow for upgrades and improvements that help with subsequent runs. The horde survival keeps the resource-collecting gameplay tense and interesting, and
  <em>
   Deep Among The Swarm
  </em>
  nails the "one-more-run" roguelike feel.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Conan Unconquered
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings horde defense RTS gameplay to the
  <em>
   Conan the Barbarian
  </em>
  universe. The game has players building a desert stronghold while defending from endless waves of enemies. Since this is a
  <em>
   Conan
  </em>
  game, enemies and units go beyond regular soldiers - there are mages, necromancers, and mythical creatures to worry about too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Conan Unconquered
  </em>
  will especially appeal to cooperative RTS gamers, as the whole thing can be played in co-op with a friend. The game is designed to be replayable, with randomly generated maps to conquer, rather than a story-driven campaign. Players also get their own hero units to command against the hordes of the evil wizard Khotan, whether solo or co-op and the titular Barbarian himself is an option. The strategic gameplay and base-building options go deep enough to satisfy most RTS veterans, too.

  takes a similar approach to its gameplay to the horde survival king,

  .
  <em>
   Alien Marauder

  takes the gameplay to a sci-fi setting, though, with an aesthetic that's more akin to

  or
  <em>
   Starship Troopers
  </em>
  . The game tasks players with colonizing new planets to look for resources for an ailing futuristic human society that has spread out into space.

 <p>
  Players have to build these colonies while they're under constant assault by alien hordes known as the Vexans. The hordes in

There's an impressive amount of variety to the RTS gameplay with upgradeable structures, varied heroes with units to command, and talent skills for the player to unlock. Even though it's still in early access,

  <strong>
   <em>
    Age of Darkness: Final Stand
   </em>
  </strong>
  uses a dark fantasy aesthetic along with some interesting procedural map generation and roguelike mechanics to create a unique survival RTS. Players live in a perpetual nightmare of dynamic "Death Fog" that conceals terrain and enemies, expanding by lighting up the area and pushing back the darkness. The horde survival gameplay is intense, with tens of thousands of enemies able to swarm the player at a time.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there is a short-lived campaign, as well as PvP multiplayer, fans of horde defense will be most interested in the survival mode. This can be played single-player or co-op and features the aforementioned procedural maps and roguelike elements. This mode sees players building under pressure while preparing for a periodic "Death Night" where the largest horde descends. Death Nights come with a random debuff known as a Malice, but if players survive, they get to choose from three random Blessings to improve their abilities. This adds some much-needed variety to multiple runs.

  For players who want a more light-hearted take on the horde survival RTS, there's no better game than
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diplomacy is Not an Option
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Here, the peasantry is in revolt against the king, and it's the players' job to suppress the rabble. The amount of depth in the game is immense, and there are many simulated elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Base building and maintenance also tracks survival elements for the populace like hunger and disease, and combat physically simulates projectiles like boulders from catapults to create organized chaos. It's medieval siege warfare dialed up to ten.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Diplomacy is Not an Option
  </em>
  is also not afraid to swerve from tongue-in-cheek silliness to pure fantasy. Eventually, players will have to deal with hordes of the undead and magic powers that can be used both for and against them. It's not the longest-lived strategy game, but it's a unique and fun blend of survival, RTS, and tower defense.

  Released in 2019, the post-apocalyptic zombie survival RTS
  <strong>
   <em>
    They Are Billions
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the quintessential example of a horde survival RTS. Players take the role of a colony manager for the last few thousand surviving humans on Earth in the middle of a global zombie infection. Hordes of the undead exist around the world with their own AI and will pose an ever-present and growing threat to the player as they hunt for resources to ensure the colony's survival.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the key aspects of
  <em>
   They Are Billions
  </em>
  is how the infection influences gameplay. If an infected zombie gets into an area with colonists, they'll become infected too, creating a potential cascade of the undead that means it's vital that players keep civilian structures protected. The game also takes a lot of credit for being among the first to successfully combine the static horde survival of tower defense games with the dynamic base building and unit management of the RTS genre in this way.

  Series creator Hideo Kojima guided the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise from its inception in 1987 until 2015's
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
  </em>
  . While the game designer departed with publisher Konami under bad circumstances, he has since released the incredibly unique
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  , with its sequel and other curious games like
  <em>
   OD
  </em>
  on the way, proving that he is not done sharing his art with the world.

 <p>
  Even if
  <em>
   The
  </em>
  <em>
   Phantom Pain
  </em>
  was the last thing he did in the franchise, the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  series has created an eternal legacy within the medium, providing it with some of the best and most iconic stealth games ever made. Its labyrinthine story spans six different decades, and it can be hard to
  <strong>
   keep track of the
   <em>
    Metal Gear
   </em>
   chronology
  </strong>
  , so this list should (hopefully) clear up any confusion.

   </strong>
   At this point, this timeline practically has all the key mainline games in it, along with its intriguing spin-offs, alternate timelines via other Kojima projects, and some lesser-known (somewhat) canon titles like Metal Gear Solid Mobile. There aren't a lot of titles left, and some, like Metal Gear Solid Touch, are just retellings of other games reframed as touch-based shooters for smartphones.

 <p>
  Still, there are some remakes and alternate ports out there. They may tell the same story as their first iterations, but some of them change details, albeit not to the degree of Capcom's retellings of Resident Evil 1-4. For example, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes had different cutscenes, a different translation, and different setpieces. But is that game's version of the Shadow Moses Incident what every other MGS game followed? Or is the PS1 game still the basis on which the other games wer built? This update contemplates this, alongside the upcoming MGS Î”, and some clarifications for the Spin-Offs section.

  Despite being the third numbered entry,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
   </strong>
  </em>
  started everything chronologically and would plant the seeds for the overarching conflict across the games, albeit in retrospect. Naked Snake's mission to stop a rogue Soviet faction from launching a nuke revealed Big Boss' origin story, as well as that of the series' multi-agent Revolver Ocelot and of the mysterious Patriots. They all seem so innocent at the start of the game, only to reveal other facets by its end.

 <p>
  Gameplaywise, it was a big improvement on the prior
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  games, with the new CQC mechanics improving on Snake's hand-to-hand combat options and a whole host of secrets to find in its new jungle setting. Its new characters left an impact, too, with Snake's mentor, The Boss, being a particular favorite. Fans had hoped Kojima would get to make an even earlier prequel detailing her past. It may still be on the cards if
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Î”
  </em>
  does well. But without Kojima at the helm, it isn't the tantalizing prospect it used to be.

  The reason
  <em>
   MGS3
  </em>
  's remake is called
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid Î”: Snake Eater
   </em>
  </strong>
  (Î” being 'delta') is because the symbol represents "a difference without changing structure", referring to its use in mathematics and science to represent macroscopic changes in variables. In other words, the game is aiming to be a bigger, grander version of
  <em>
   MGS3
  </em>
  , but it will still follow the same story, complete with the same vocal performances from 2004.

 <p>
  On the one hand, some may find this disappointing. The reason the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  remakes caught on so well was because of the changes they made to the original stories. It helped them stand apart from their forebears. On the other hand, re-localizing
  <em>
   MGS3
  </em>
  could've been seen by fans as Konami further trying to remake Kojima's work in their image. With the recent furor over its default look foregoing
  <em>
   MGS3
  </em>
  's yellow filter (available as a 'Legacy' option), it's definitely safer for them to update the game's graphics and gameplay for modern times than to rewrite the story in its entirety.

  <em>
   MGS3
  </em>
  to be 'the best game' for doing that. Its stereoscopic 3D could really bring out its jungle foliage, and its gyroscopic capabilities of the device could help Snake balance on bridges and branches.

  Players could also use the 3DS camera to make their own PhotoCamos, which could help players sneak more easily if they produced the right patterns. Otherwise, it's basically the same game and story with some graphical alterations (e.g. all the Kerotans have been replaced with Yoshi's). However, it was originally meant to have optional Side Ops like
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  using Tselinoyarsk's different locations for different missions. The feature ultimately wasn't finished, though it can still be accessed with a little hacking.

  , the handheld spin-off, is considered somewhat canon, as it's referenced in later games. However, it's only tangentially, and few (if any) of its story beats are ever followed up upon. It was about how Big Boss and a young Roy Campbell teamed up to stop the FOX Unit, which had gone rogue under its new leader Gene, a super soldier designed specifically to succeed The Boss. It's also the chronological debut of Frank Jaeger, who'd later become Solid Snake's mentor and frenemy as Grey Fox from
  <em>
   Metal Gear 1
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   MGS1
  </em>

  The game introduced many elements later titles would expand upon, like recruiting enemy guards and taking them out on missions as extra playable characters. However, they aren't as refined as those later games. Dragging guards to a drop-off point isn't as snappy as sticking a Fulton Balloon onto them. As such, it's not considered an essential game to the timeline and has often been skipped in favor of its sequel,
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  . But if it turned up on, say, an
  <em>
   MGS:
  </em>
  <em>
   Master Collection Vol.2
  </em>
  , it might find a new audience that could appreciate its gameplay.

  Unlike
  <em>
   Portable Ops,
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
   </em>
  </strong>
  had Kojima at the helm and thus got more recognition. That and it managed to reach a wider audience when it was included in the
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid HD Collection
  </em>
  for the PS3 and Xbox 360. On the face of it, it's about Big Boss, now disassociated with Major Zero, and the US investigating a US-affiliated organization setting up nukes in Costa Rica. But it also shows the ideological divide between Big Boss and Zero, as they come to very different conclusions on how to make the world one.

  The game is rated T, so it is not as violent as other entries (e.g., Big Boss' knife is replaced with a stun rod), but its drama can still hit hard, as can its weirdness, as it features singing AI robots, dating side-missions, and fights against dinosaurs from Capcom's
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  . While the game was made with the PSP in mind, it played excellently (if not better) on the PS3 and Xbox 360. It missed out on being included in the
  <em>
   Master Collection Vol.1
  </em>
  , but hopefully, it'll feature in
  <em>
   Vol.2
  </em>
  .

  Funnily enough, Kojima originally considered calling
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  'Metal Gear Solid 5' but felt fans would be upset with the next entry being a PSP game. So, he made the official
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5
  </em>
  a full-on sequel to
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  instead, taking place mere days after the end of its second, hidden ending. Or at least that was the plan. Instead, to recoup the cost of the game's production, the immediate part showing Big Boss saving his
  <em>
   PW
  </em>
  teammates Chico and Paz from Camp Omega in Cuba was released separately as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Fans, in retrospect, even figured where it would've appeared if it was released as part of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
  </em>
  , popping up just after saving Kaz from Russian captivity in Afghanistan. But in its released form, it felt more like a very pricey demo for
  <em>
   MGS5
  </em>
  . The main story mission took about an hour to beat, and less so for veteran players. But it came with plenty of extras, like the quirky DÃ©jÃ  Vu and Jamais Vu missions. Nowadays, it can be found for much cheaper prices, and is often packaged with
  <em>
   MGS5
  </em>
  as

  Had
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
   </em>
  </strong>
  been given the development time to do all it set out to do, the series would have finally come full circle, connecting the prequel games to the original
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  . Instead, thanks to the strained relationship between Kojima and Konami, the result was missing some key ingredients. For example, Kojima hinted players could return to
  <em>
   GZ
  </em>
  's Camp Omega, which they can't. Many of the Side Ops are repeated because the developers didn't have time to make original ones on par with
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  .

  Then, most notoriously of all, the "Kingdom of the Flies" mission, which saw Venom Snake and Eli's arcs get wrapped up, was never finished, reduced to a work-in-progress extra on special editions of the game. Still, the story had some good ideas, and the gameplay was top-notch. If only it had a Director's Cut edition like
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  to close off those missing plot threads. Then Venom Snake's journey of revenge against Skull Face for the death of his comrades and the destruction of Mother Base would've been much more satisfying.

  With the prequels now put aside,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the real-life start of the series. The one every game follows on from. Solid Snake makes his debut as a rookie agent for the elite group FOXHOUND. He's sent into the military nation Outer Heaven by his COO, Big Boss, to save his mentor, Grey Fox, and stop the titular nuclear bipedal tank. This game is quite quaint by today's standards, with some jank here and there (having to constantly equip and de-equip pass cards, etc.), but it shows many of the traits future stealth-action classics would follow.

 <p>
  While it still has its twists (some of which have changed thanks to
  <em>
   MGS5
  </em>
  ), its storytelling is surprisingly quick and straightforward, thanks to the MSX's memory constraints. Kojima's trademark verbosity would have to wait until its sequel to arrive. The easiest way to play it today is via the
  <em>
   Master Collection
  </em>
  <em>
   Vol.1
  </em>
  . The NES port, while infamous for its infamous localization job ("I FEEL ASLEEP!"), isn't as solid as the MSX original (pun unintended), though it's still better than the stodgier C64 version, with its tiny sprites, braindead AI, and awful music.

  The canon sequel

   ,
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  saw Solid Snake come out of retirement to infiltrate a new military nation, Zanzibar Land, to save the abducted scientist Dr Kio Marv and retrieve OILIX, a genetically modified organism that could produce a cleaner, safer alternative fuel source to oil. The game feels much more like
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  , as the MSX2's extra memory meant Kojima could add more of his narrative touches, like grandiose speeches, high drama, and sudden twists
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  like Snake's connection to Big Boss, and to his old allies like Grey Fox.

  The extra memory also helped the gameplay feel more like its followups, like the radar showing soldiers &amp; their field of vision and mech bosses that could actually move and fight, like Metal Gear itself. Other set pieces would actually get carried over wholesale to
  <em>
   MGS1
  </em>
  , like the run &amp; gun tower section and the elevator ambush. Maybe Kojima and Co thought they could get away with it because
  <em>
   MG2
  </em>
  wasn't officially released in the West until it was included in
  <em>
   MGS3
  </em>
  's 'Subsistence' re-release. It's also available in the
  <em>
   HD Collection
  </em>
  and
  <em>

  The MSX games may be where the series started, and Kojima had a cult following in Japan via his visual novel games. But it was
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid
   </em>
  </strong>
  that truly skyrocketed the series and Kojima to their legendary status. It sees Solid Snake head to an Alaskan island to stop his old unit FOXHOUND from using Metal Gear REX to launch a nuke and face his own past in the process. Big Boss may be gone, but here he learns about how he was 'created' from Big Boss' genes and meets Eli, aka his twin brother Liquid Snake, for the first time.

 <p>
  While future entries would add neater extras like CQC and the ability to mod weapons,
  <em>
   MGS1
  </em>
  still holds up well today with its smooth, silky, stealthy gameplay. It had some iconic setpieces of its own, like Psycho Mantis' memory card reading, and the fight against REX itself was an exciting experience. Not even its Gamecube remake,
  <em>
   The Twin Snakes,
  </em>
  could really top the PS1 original, but some fans would still like to see it remade. Depending on how
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  Î” does, they might get their wish.

  It's not that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a bad game. Players had to adjust to the GameCube's controls, and its new features, taken from
  <em>
   MGS2,
  </em>
  made getting through the old
  <em>
   MGS1
  </em>
  layouts easier overall. But it had some neat features, like reducing the old game's backtracking by providing shortcuts (e.g. the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building now hides a PSG1-T for sniping Sniper Wolf). Some fans even prefer the new voice acting, which would become the basis for the VA's future performances (no more accents for Mei-Ling and Naomi).

  Still, the localization was redone to be more faithful to Kojima's writing at the cost of sounding more stilted ("You yourself! In Zanzibarland!"). Then action director Ryuhei Kitamura's new cutscenes were over the top, as Kojima himself wanted them to resemble his movies. It left fans wondering which version of
  <em>
   MGS1
  </em>
  is canon. Kojima stood on the fence, hiding

  's
  <em>

  </em>
  s
  <em>
   Zone of the Enders 2
  </em>
  poster in
  <em>

  </em>
  . Most decided that
  <em>
   MGS1
  </em>
  is canon, while
  <em>
   TTS
  </em>
  is what Otacon is imagining in
  <em>
   MGS4
  </em>
  when Snake recalls the game's events.

   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid Mobile
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an early mobile game that is almost impossible to find through legitimate channels these days. It's not a hidden gem either, as it seems to have passed by players without much notice despite winning the Grand Prix and Operator's Choice prizes at the 2008 International Mobile Gaming Awards. The most interesting aspect of it is its story, as it has the same semi-canon status as
  <em>
   MGS: Portable Ops.
  </em>

  Set between
  <em>

  </em>
  and
  <em>
   MGS2
  </em>
  , it saw Solid Snake work with Dr. Victoria Reed in order to obtain intel on the construction of a new Metal Gear model. However, it turns out to be a ploy to trap Snake in a VR simulation (Victoria Reed = VR). It's ultimately inconsequential, as Snake gets mindwiped at the end. The most tantalizing part of its ending suggests he was being controlled by the Patriots,and that they were going to move on to see what 'Jack' (Raiden) could do.

  The first part of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes place in 2007 and shows Solid Snake infiltrating a Tanker to expose the Marines' new project, Metal Gear RAY. Then Kojima threw fans a curveball when the second chapter was set on the Big Shell Plant two years later and replaced Snake with Raiden. He was always planned to be the main protagonist, though Konami, Kojima, and co managed to keep him a secret (bar the GBC post-credits teaser) until after the game's release, replacing him with Snake in the game's E3 and Tokyo Game Show trailers.

  While this angered some fans, they gradually accepted this ruse and its mind-bending plot as its themes about the control of digital information and society became more prescient since its 2001 release. It was also the first game to mention the Patriots and the AI controlling things on their behalf. Their presence throughout the Plant Chapter's run is one of
  <em>
   MGS2
  </em>
  's most interesting aspects. Not that the game's ideas came out of nowhere. Its identity-twisting elements, and even some characters, were based on ones from the book
  <em>
   City of Glass
  </em>
  .

  To date,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the final chapter in Solid Snake's story. It sees him as a prematurely-aged old man with one last mission in him: kill Revolver Ocelot, the Patriots' multi-agent now completely possessed by Liquid Snake.
  <em>
   MGS4
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  began life as a PS3 exclusive and, as of this writing, is still stuck on the console. There are rumors it'll feature in a potential
  <em>
   Master Collection Vol.2
  </em>
  , so fans might not have to fish out their old consoles just to see how Snake's story ends.

  Inspired by the 1970s Italian drama
  <em>
   Sacco &amp; Vanzetti
  </em>
  , Kojima originally planned to have Snake &amp; Otacon executed for the crimes they were framed for, like the movie's leads. His colleagues ultimately talked him out of it, giving them a happier ending where Snake gets to shut down the Patriots and make amends with his late father, Big Boss. While the gameplay is fun, its story and cutscenes begin to wear out their welcome as they're some of the longest in the series, including the game's 90+ min finale.

  After a long development that saw this spin-off move from being worked on by Kojima Productions to being finished by PlatinumGames,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Rising: Revengenace
   </em>
  </strong>
  is
  <strong>
   the last game in the main
   <em>
    Metal Gear
   </em>
   chronology
  </strong>
  . Even though it's a character action game, similar to
  <em>
   Bayonetta
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  , the story remains a distinctly
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  tale. It sees Raiden, now working as a bodyguard, trying to stop Desperado Enforcement from starting a war, complete with a conspiracy involving kidnapped children, AI, and nanomachines, son.

 <p>
  The game
  <em>
  </em>
  was really popular on its 2013 release, and a sequel seemed guaranteed until Konami and Kojima's fallout. Even a decade later, the game is fondly remembered for its fast gameplay and wacky characters. Even so, it still has semi-canon status, as it hasn't been confirmed as an official follow-up to
  <em>
   MGS4
  </em>
  . But since it takes place at the very end of the timeline, it doesn't tread on the other game's toes. That and, unlike
  <em>
   MGS: Portable Ops
  </em>
  , Kojima liked it enough to make it the basis for
  <em>
   GZ
  </em>
  's 'Jamais Vu' mission.

  The black sheep of the
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  series is also the earliest chronological alternate timeline.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metal Gear Survive
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a zombie survival game following a group of Big Boss' MSF soldiers, who were somehow sucked into another dimension via a wormhole after Mother Base gets destroyed at the end of
  <em>
   GZ
  </em>
  . From there, they have to find other survivors for the Wardenclyffe Section and find a cure for the zombie infection. The game is its own thing entirely, made without Kojima's input, and isn't connected to any of the
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  games beyond its predecessors.

  Given it came out after Kojima's rough departure from Konami, and in the aftermath of ex-employees and contacts revealing how bad Konami's working practices were, the game had a lot of negativity surrounding it. Its gameplay didn't help, as it was basically
  <em>
   MGS5
  </em>
  with shoehorned-in crafting, hunger, and thirst mechanics. It also charged players real money to make new save files. With no link to Big Boss, the Snakes, the Metal Gears, or anything else to do with the series, there's little reason to play
  <em>
   Survive
  </em>
  beyond curiosity.

  Some older gamers might have a fondness for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Snake's Revenge
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as the gameplay is actually a touch better than the NES
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  , and offered some new mechanics like the sidescrolling action sequences. Nonetheless, it wasn't a patch on the MSX games and was made without Kojima's involvement. In fact, according to him, one of its staff members met him on the train, told him about the game, and asked him to make a proper sequel to the MSX game. He'd do so with
  <em>
   Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Not that Kojima was likely to play
  <em>
   Snake's Revenge
  </em>
  for himself at the time. Despite being developed by Konami in Japan, the game was exclusive to America and Europe. Outside of emulation, Japanese players didn't get to give it a go until it was included in the
  <em>
   Master Collection Vol.1
  </em>
  . While non-canon, they might've gotten a kick out of its story, which saw Snake and two accomplices, Nick Myer and John Turner, take down a cybernetically-enhanced Big Boss from nuking multiple targets across the world.

  follows an alternate timeline from the MSX games. Snake returns to what's left of Outer Heaven to stop the Gindra Liberation Front and the special forces unit Black Chamber from activating a new Metal Gear prototype, Metal Gear Gander. The gameplay follows the MSX games' lead too, playing like
  <em>
   MG2
  </em>
  with its radar and weapon/item selects, but with a stage-by-stage structure akin to
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  , complete with rankings ('Terrible' to 'Excellent').

  It also offered 90 VR missions, which teased the appearance of another
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  protagonist who, at the time of the game's release, hadn't been officially revealed yet. Unfortunately, it has never been re-released since its debut, and finding both a working GBC and an affordable copy of the game isn't so easy nowadays. Until it appears in a compilation (maybe
  <em>
   MC Vol.2
  </em>
  ?), players should seek out its European release, which not only supports multiple languages but has the exclusive 'IdeaSpy 2.5' codec calls that appear on a second playthrough.

  When fans were wondering what
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Acid
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the first handheld
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  since
  <em>
   Ghost Babel,
  </em>
  would be like, they probably weren't expecting it to be a tactical, collectible, card-based RPG. It doesn't follow any of the other games in the series, as Snake and his partner Teliko have to save a US senator from terrorists and learn just what the secret Pythagoras project is. To do this, they use the Active Command Intelligence Duel to optimize the right deck of cards to sneak around obstacles and take down the enemy mercs.

 <p>
  Back in the PSP's early days, it was one of the handheld's strongest offerings, as neither
  <em>
   MGS: Portable Ops
  </em>
  nor
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  would come out for a few years. It was also effectively exclusive to the handheld, with only an obscure, less good Java port for mobile phones. Nowadays, while it's fine enough for fans of card-based games, it's a little too strange for a
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  game, which is saying a lot for a series that has bisexual vampires and soldiers who can control bees. It would only get stranger, too.

  Many of the

  spin-off games were largely created by three men: Tomokazu Fukushima, Shuyo Murata, and Shinta Nojiri. The trio cut their teeth on the main
  <em>
   MGS
  </em>
  games, often writing its extra details, Codec calls, alternate modes, and more. But without Kojima's oversight, they made the beloved
  <em>
   Ghost Babel

  ,
  <em>
   MGS2
  </em>
  's surreal 'Snake Tales,' and
  <em>
   Metal Gear Acid
  </em>
  , proving they could be just as strange.
  <strong>
   <em>

  proved they could be even stranger than that.

It sounds straightforward enough until the plot reveals Snake is a lab-grown clone of the real deal, Venus is a turncoat, and they're both helped by a hacker who can hypnotize people through the web.

 <p>
  It appears that
  <strong>
   Twitch
  </strong>
  streamer Sweet Anita will have to take a break from streaming for some time. Sweet Anita is a popular variety Twitch streamer who primarily plays games like
  <em>
   Apex Legends, Overwatch, and Among Us.
  </em>
  Anita has cultivated a somewhat an audience that not only tunes in for the games she plays, but tends to be open to hearing her perspective on various topics, such as mental health and navigating adulthood.

 <p>
  Sweet Anita often has clips go viral, as the streamer is prone to saying things and occasionally acting in ways that can be construed as inappropriate because of her Tourette's syndrome. Some of these moments, such as a tic causing her to toss a cup at a wall, can catch viewers off guard, and her sense of humor leads to herself, her friends, and her fans getting a laugh out of it. Anita has voiced that streaming tends to be a particularly welcoming environment for her and her neurological disorder in ways that other jobs have not been. Compared to other Twitch streamers like Kai Cenat, Anita fosters a more relaxed vibe.

  Sweet Anita posted on social media that she is taking a break from streaming. She notes that having three illnesses at the same time has been debilitating. Anita reassures fans that she will return to streaming when she has recovered, and though she has not disclosed what illnesses she is afflicted with, she has mentioned struggles with an autoimmune condition in the past, so there is a possibility that a flare up related to that condition is what has been troubling her recently. At other times, Sweet Anita has faced harassment from stalkers and viewers and has chosen to take breaks as a result of that.

  In February, Anita was forced to suspend other plans after getting Covid, which prevented her from going to the streamer awards. After hearing about her current situation, Anita's fans and colleagues have voiced their support for her, emphasizing that she should take as much time as she needs. Sweet Anita generally only seems to take these kinds of breaks when she is facing a serious problem, and the surprise and concern from Anita's fan base appears to echo this.

  Prior to being able to make an income streaming on Twitch, Anita would collect and sell seaglass, which required a more demanding schedule. Being able to take a necessary rest like this is likely a welcome difference compared to her prior situation. Many are looking forward to Sweet Anita's return to the platform, but more importantly, fans are surely hoping that she recovers from her illnesses.

  The universe of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Borderlands
   </strong>
  </em>
  is plagued by corporate greed and insane quests for ultimate power. Vault Hunters constantly try to find the ancient relics left behind by mysterious creatures who evade comprehension and powerful villains who wield terrifying powers that bring the residents of Pandora into line.

 <p>
  Among this chaotic rabble, a select few characters shine through as immensely powerful. Whether as playable characters who make the whole game feel like a breeze or through lore-shaking story beats, these characters steal the spotlight and come out looking like the bravest and boldest in the whole known universe. According to the lore, these are the strongest characters in
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  .

  Making her first appearance as an unlikely ally in the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  DLC,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Secret Armory Of General Knoxx
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Athena worked as the leader of a squad of assassins for the Crimson Lance. The Lance was a private militia, paid for and trained by the Atlas corporation. Rising to the top of the ranks and becoming one of their best operatives already sets her well ahead of most of the marauders on Pandora, but Athena was tricked into killing her lost sister and turned against the evil organization, teaming with the Vault Hunters in the first game to take down the general from the DLC.

  She makes a debut as a playable character in

 <p>
  With a backstory as a vigilante on her home planet, Amara is in good company with the other Sirens. Each of these characters has a powerful psychic ability that can warp the world and wreak havoc with huge effects. Amara herself commands giant fists that can burst into enemies for massive damage, and she can even astrally project herself short distances and cut through hordes of foes in front of her.

  Every Siren has only grown in power during their time off-screen, and while Amara was already one of the more powerful options for players in

  , she can only improve, making her a likely contender for an even higher spot when a new game in the series releases.

  Available as a DLC character in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Krieg is a lovable lunatic. After players have mowed down countless numbers of psycho enemies, becoming Krieg can be unusual, especially since fans will be subjected to his incomprehensible rambling and crazed screams. He was experimented on but managed to escape, and a fragment of his sanity remains to ensure he only attacks those who deserve it, allowing him to protect his friends.

 <p>
  In combat, Krieg wields a huge Buzz-Saw Axe, which can either be swung like a melee weapon or thrown for huge damage. Krieg himself is nearly impossible to down, with abilities that have him rushing into enemies and detonating himself or even breathing fire. His lack of any self-preservation serves him well in his vault-hunting adventures.

  Another Siren to add to the list of
  <strong>
   powerful
   <em>
    Borderlands
   </em>
   characters
  </strong>
  , Maya is a playable character in
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  , who returns in the third installment as a very impactful character in the story. She was used as a threatening weapon of mass destruction by the religious order that trained her and escaped to find her fortune (and possibly the origins of her strange powers) on Pandora.

 <p>
  Her Siren power, Phaselock, allows her to hold her enemies in another dimension, and if players build her right, these enemies take more damage, explode, or even cause nearby foes to fire on their allies. Her supernatural powers make her a force to be reckoned with, and
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  sees Maya training a new successor who will gain her Siren powers before her untimely death.

 <p>
  Touted by many to be the easy mode in
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  , Salvador is undeniably awesome. The short, muscled man can wield any two guns at once, meaning that he can fire off rocket launchers and snipers at once if he chooses.

 <p>
  With a bevvy of skills that make him impossible to kill while he is 'Gunzerking,' Salvador can have a terrifying damage output that many fans consider to be overpowered when compared to any of the other characters in his party. With a love for excessive violence and a list of crimes that includes cannibalism and public indecency, players should be glad that Salvador is on their side.

 <p>
  A pair of Sirens who were born as conjoined twins pose the ultimate threat in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  . Tyreen and Troy Calypso both have access to the extra-dimensional abilities of Sirenkind, and their powers let them drain their enemies, usually resulting in their deaths. They even managed to drain Lilith of her Siren abilities, although she survived.

 <p>
  Given that they can acquire more powers and that they share a supernatural bond, the twins are immensely powerful together; Tyreen alone managed to fuse herself with the Destroyer to become an all-powerful monster.

  Lilith has featured in every single mainline
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game. In the first installment, she is the playable siren, who uses her Phasewalk power to vanish from sight, travel a short distance, and then explode back into reality to deal damage to enemies around her. By the second game, Lilith has become a much more potent Siren. She can travel much further distances and even bring characters with her when she teleports.

 <p>
  Her powers seem to have no limit so long as she can use Eridium as fuel, and she inherits command of the Crimson Raiders and leadership of Sanctuary to become a skilled tactical presence, too. Her wanted poster lists 'Witchcraft' as one of her crimes, and she manages to start a cult only by showing off her flaming abilities. Although she claims her powers come from her good looks, fans can expect to see more background on the Sirens in the next release from
  <em>
   Gearbox
  </em>
  .

  While there are many facets to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  's gameplay, for many, the build tools are the main attraction. After all, creating a family is pointless if players aren't able to create their dream house to put them in. Since
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  's 2014 release, gamers have shared many incredible builds in the game, making full use of the build tools on offer to bring together their wildest dreams. Some go simple and create the most glamorous home possible, while others try to flex their creative muscles a little. One gamer even built
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  's Grove Street in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , showcasing how the game is often used to recreate famous areas from other franchises, too.

  Redditor nadjachase shared their awesome creation, which adds a functional cruise ship to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . According to the user, they used The Sims 4's debug items to get the frame of the ship, size it perfectly to the lot, and build the individual rooms inside it. This is harder than it seems, as making it the perfect size for the rooms that Sims can actually use is an extremely tough task. Even more impressively, the cruise ship was made entirely without CC, meaning anyone who wants to download it from their gallery under the name SassyShrew9716 can do so without downloading any mods.

  The individual rooms featured on this cruise ship build are awesome. There's a spa and a restaurant, as well as three romantic cabins that complement the new

  Despite being almost 10 years old,
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  remains arguably the best life-simulator game on the market. Something about the experience Maxis' title offers makes it tough to beat, which is why players haven't yet moved on, either. Although it seems as though
  <em>
   The Sims 5
  </em>
  is in development under the name Project Rene, it isn't clear when gamers can actually expect that game to be released. The staying power of
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  is immensely impressive, and as long as players are still creating awesome builds such as this cruise ship, gamers shouldn't expect it to go anywhere any time soon.

  The latest content update for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Gran Turismo 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been revealed, bringing with it a new track, several cars, and much more. After November 2023's SPEC 2 update for
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 7
  </em>
  , update 1.49 is the biggest update for the PlayStation racer since its launch in 2022.

 <p>
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 7
  </em>
  's launch wasn't the smoothest on account of server issues restricting access for several players and microtransactions that were only enabled after reviews were published. However, developer Polyphony Digital has heavily improved the game since then thanks to free monthly content updates. The updates usually add a handful of new cars, missions, and GT CafÃ© menus, but the huge SPEC 2 update introduced a plethora of new features to
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  , and the newest 1.49 update nearly matches it on that front.

  Polyphony announced a week ago that it would introduce
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  's next update on July 6 as part of the opening round of the Gran Turismo World Series 2024 in Montreal. The more eventful reveal than usual led many fans to believe that update 1.49 might be quite ambitious in scope. As it turns out, the speculation was right, as one of the headline additions of
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  's 1.49 update is the picturesque
  <strong>
   Eiger Nordwand circuit
  </strong>
  , which last appeared in
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 6
  </em>
  during the PS3 days. Moreover, it's also the first circuit to be added to
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  in over seven months, which should come as a relief to those clamoring for more tracks since SPEC 2.

  Update 1.49 also brings six new cars into
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  with many fan-favorites, and the Sophy AI Driver Agent (for PS5 players only) has also been expanded with two new circuits, namely the NÃ¼rburgring (24h and Nordschleife) and Autodrome Lago Maggiore. Building upon
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  's reputation as one of the most realistic racers ever, Polyphony also promises "new" driving physics, Michelin-branded tires, and additional wheel customization options in the in-game GT Auto shop. Finer details about update 1.49 are currently under wraps, but a

  The range of content in update 1.49 is something
  <em>
   Gran Turismo
  </em>
  fans will no doubt be looking forward to. Although
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  is considered among the best racing games available on PS5, recent content updates have felt somewhat stagnant in both quality and quantity. 1.49 brings with it a much-needed breath of fresh air for
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  after several months.

  </strong>
  's Jungle Getaway Update introduced a brand-new Star Path called The Night Show. Like previous Star Paths, The Night Show Star Path gives you a bunch of duties to work through in exchange for valuable tokens and rock show-themed rewards. However, some
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  's Star Path duties can be tricky to figure out with so many forageable and collectible items to find in the game. When the task becomes available, you might wonder
  <strong>
   how to dig for pottery material
  </strong>
  , especially with the Hourglass Royal Tool capable of unearthing all kinds of objects.

  While the meaning of pottery material might seem shrouded in mystery, digging some up is a pretty straightforward duty once you know what to look for and where to look.
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  's mysterious pottery material is also a handy crafting resource in several crafting recipes in the game.

  To dig for pottery material in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  , you need to unearth some
  <strong>
   clay
  </strong>
  , the forageable item that the game calls 'pottery material.' You can find clay in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  by digging in the ground with your
  <strong>
   Royal Shovel
  </strong>
  in the following biomes:

 <p>
  To tick off this particular Star Path duty, you must dig up
  <strong>
   30 clay.
  </strong>
  Fortunately,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  each time you dig up what looks like a single muddy lump, you usually get
  <strong>
   two or three pieces of clay
  </strong>
  . Helpfully, this means you only need to dig up
  <strong>
   around 10 to 15 lumps of clay
  </strong>
  to complete this task, making digging for pottery material a pretty quick Star Path duty to cross off your list. Of course, if you bring a digging companion along or use a splash of
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley'
  </em>
  s Miracle Shovel Polish, it could be possible to speed up this process even more with the possibility of more clay drops. It's also best to try digging in different spots across a biome for the best chances of clay to appear, rather than just digging into the same spots.

     When digging for clay in

     , you will likely unearth other items first, such as Gold Star Coins and Soil. However, you can find clay in most areas in the Glade of Trust, Forgotten Lands, or Sunlit Plateau, so you don't need to dig in any particular spot.

  With
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel's Spider-Man 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  's story now officially closed for good, the only option now is to look ahead to the third installment, which will reportedly conclude the mainline series. By the end of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  , Peter Parker has handed off the torch to Miles Morales, after he spent the majority of the game's story with his mental health and relationship with Mary Jane on life support and now needs a bit of a break. Assuming
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  will have Peter on the bench for some portion of the game, it would be remiss to leave him there for long.

 <p>
  There are countless ways
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  could re-introduce Peter as a playable character, but timing is arguably the most important. As the beloved hero has now been cemented as a pivotal part of
  <em>

  's legacy, Peter needs to rejoin the fray in the next installment sooner rather than later, and it needs to be in an epic way.

  Peter Parker Should Arrive by Marvel's Spider-Man 3's Third Act

 <p>
  At the latest, Peter should step back into the spotlight by the start of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  's third act, perhaps to help out in the fight against the game's biggest baddies. This would not only make his introduction necessary, but it would also potentially lend to its explosiveness. That being said, Peter arriving on the scene even sooner might be preferable, as he is the core hero of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  's overarching story. At the very least, perhaps players might be given an opportunity to see Peter running errands around town using his Spidey skills and maybe even introduce an inner conflict in the process that shows him struggling with retirement.

 <p>
  It's assumed that Miles and Silk will be the main playable characters for the majority of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  's story, but it may not sit well with fans if it takes too long for Peter to arrive on the scene. Furthermore, as
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  will be the last game in the mainline series, it needs to give a proper end to Peter's story, as it all started with him anyway.

 <p>
  Even more than just making sure Peter Parker shows up by
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  's third act, it might even be better for the series to launch another spin-off title similar to
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  ahead of the third mainline installment's release. Just as
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  was used as a means to introduce the titular character and connect him with Peter Parker, a spin-off subtitled "Silk" could do the same for that character and give her proper screen time in the process.

 <p>
  There are a couple of big reasons why another spin-off might be the better route for the series to take ahead of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  . Firstly, if Silk is to be a prominent, playable character of any kind and not merely a side character who's helping Peter and Miles, she needs a proper introduction and a chance to have the same attention that has been given to Peter and Miles in their own games. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, another
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  spin-off before the next game would potentially allow Peter the opportunity to join the fight even earlier in
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  , as its story wouldn't have to spend time fleshing out Silk's character and her relationship with the other heroes.

 <p>
  It's unclear where
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  might go from here, especially after the unfortunate leak at Insomniac seems to have put a kink in the developer's plans. Regardless,
  <em>

  can't keep Peter on the bench for very long, and either making him playable early on or by the series launching another spin-off title before the third game might do the trick.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Silent Hill 2 Remake
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has created an alternate introduction to protagonist James’ trials in the titular town, and the jarring creation is not what fans expected. Konami’s horror franchise is iconic for its dense, foreboding atmosphere with memorable enemies, and James’ story is not only one of the more shocking tales in the series, but it’s also dark.
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  does a fantastic job of reimagining the classic PlayStation 2 game for modern technology, and fans are swept up by the alternate endings on offer.

 <p>
  Developed by Bloober Team, the remake returns James to the foggy, dream-like setting of
  <em>
   Silent Hill,
  </em>
  while he searches for his deceased wife Mary. The remake found immediate success after its October launch and several subsequent updates focused on improving its gameplay experience. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  players recently discovered a game-breaking Labyrinth bug in Patch 1.04 while trying to solve the rotating cube puzzle, and despite players enduring a week of no progress, the developer has now resolved the issue.

 <p>
  Posted on Reddit by Cobbtimus_Prime, a one-minute video presented an original animation showcasing James’ arrival in
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  . Set to
  <em>
   Don’t Stop Me Now
  </em>
  by Queen, the game’s usually somber tone is immediately flipped on its head when a smile crosses the protagonist’s face, and he proceeds to skateboard through the town’s streets while listening to the song through headphones. After kicking a Nurse out of his path, James ends the animation with a dance routine.
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  ’s Mannequins have unique details to observe throughout the game, and the enemies also join James in the dance-off, echoing Michael Jackson’s
  <em>
   Thriller
  </em>
  music video.

  The horror community is constantly in awe of fans’ unique creations, including one
  <em>

  </em>
  fan’s poster made from screenshots. However, Redditors were not prepared for this hilarious animation they called “peak cinema,” and called for the alternate introduction to be considered canon by Konami. Fans also joked they were waiting for “James Sunderland Pro Skater 2,” and one user wanted an alternate ending to be created set to Queen’s

  While the comical alternate intro was being created, one
  <em>

  </em>
  player discovered alternate ending tips hiding in plain sight, offering clues to fans who were gunning for a specific ending. With several, different endings baked into the remake, it’s only fair someone took a stab at an alternate intro, even if the tone directly contradicts

  ’s essence. Still, the community is glad to see creativity at its peak.

  From the classic movie tie-in games like
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  (2002) to the fan-favorite
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  (2018), nearly every Spider-Man game features this essential character trait that makes Spider-Man one of the best heroes ever. Although not all quotes from the wall-crawling hero are funny, sometimes Spider-Man stories take a more serious turn, allowing for some jaw-dropping moments. Here's a look at some of the best Spider-Man quotes from games.

  During a Demon warehouse mission, when a new wave of enemies appears, Spider-Man can be heard saying "So I think the new guys have to tag the old guys, and they have to go to their corner. No?”. This quote refers to professional wrestling and is a funny callback to the wrestling scene from
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  2002 and Spider-Man's first comic appearance in
  <em>
   Amazing Fantasy #15
  </em>
  , published in 1962, where a young Peter Parker enters a wrestling ring to earn some extra cash.

  Although many fans have a love-hate relationship with this game, especially with the combat system, one thing the developers did get right was the humor and character of Spider-Man. A fan-favorite scene from this game is widely regarded as one of the funniest
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  video game scenes.

  After Spider-Man saves an innocent bystander from an attack by the Skulls, the lady thanks him and mentions she lost her purse on a rooftop nearby. Spider-Man responds with “On a different Rooftop?... Different from this one?... Are you serious?... Are you taking some kind of tour of city rooftops?... Okay, whatever, I'll find your purse for you.” This funny interaction, combined with a confused-sounding performance from Tobey Maguire, has made this scene very popular among Spider-Man fans.

 <p>
  A random quip can be triggered during one of these events where Spider-Man says aloud "Gotta stop these guys before they end up in Driver's Ed videos.” This quote is a subtle nod to a popular online trend where people upload footage of bad drivers to social media. This quote feels like something that a modern-day Spider-Man would say.

  <em>
   Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions
  </em>
  is one of the best
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  games for its unique storyline and gameplay mechanics. Players get to play four different versions of Spider-Man and they, of course, all have different quips and quotes that they say throughout the game.

 <p>
  During a battle with Electro, Electro uses power generators to recharge his abilities. While draining these generators, he often makes creepy and passionate gestures towards them. This prompts Spider-Man to say “Uh, eww! Do you and your generator, like, need some time alone?”. This funny quip highlights Spider-Man's ability to turn any action into an entertaining joke.

  This quote also serves as a nod to a running joke among the Spider-Man community, where it is believed that the writers hate Spider-Man. This joke came about because every time something good happens in Spider-Man's life, like a great new job, or a successful relationship, the writers decided to completely ruin Spider-Man's happiness in the next few pages.

  In a scene where Harry and Mary Jane are questioning Peter about the symbiote, Peter loses his cool and calls out Harry for having to rely on his pills. This quote reflects how different Peter is when he is in contact with the Venom Symbiote and is one of the harsher scenes we see in the game.

  Although
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 2

  takes Peter on a darker journey, we still get to see some of the usual friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. During an encounter with one of Kraven The Hunters' men, Spider-Man makes this popular joke.

  Spider-Man notices that this thug is wearing a bear skin and says the quote "Ok, before we get down to business, there’s something I have to tell you…I’m fresh out of honey!”. This quote caught a lot of fans off guard, as Spider-Man isn't usually this funny and lighthearted while wearing the Venom symbiote.

  did a good job of showing how unhinged Peter Parker can become while wearing the Venom symbiote. During a heated argument with Mary Jane, Peter says “I'm The Hero Here, Not You”. This powerful quote helps to represent the effect that the Venom symbiote is having on Spider-Man.

  He would never usually say anything intentionally to insult or upset Mary Jane, but in this scene, he says it almost too easily. This scene resonates well with the fans as a big issue many fans had with the first game was spending too much time playing as Mary Jane. This quote reflects their opinion, stating that Spider-Man is the hero they want to play, not Mary Jane.

  During the heartbreaking scene of Aunt Mays' death in
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  , Peter is given an impossible decision to make. Aunt May has been exposed to the deadly Devil's Breath virus, but luckily, Peter has the cure. However, before he can give it to Aunt May, he is informed that they need to study the cure before they can make enough for the whole city.

  Peter had to choose to save Aunt May or to save the lives of all the citizens of New York. In a heartbreaking scene, Peter breaks down by Aunt May's side, saying “I don't know what to do…”, she replies with “Yes you do”. Peter ultimately decides not to use the GR-27 Antiserum and has to watch Aunt May die beside him.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an excellent title to let players live out their wildest fantasies of being a student at this beloved magical academy. While the game may not be an excellent simulation of what it's like to be a student in Hogwarts, learning a bunch of iconic spells and smashing enemies to bits with these attacks make for a great time.

  The combat is one of the best parts of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , allowing players to combine certain spells to unlock efficient magical combos. Players who want to unleash a three-spell array of destruction can use several incantations in quick succession to decimate most foes in style.

  Levioso is one of the earliest spells that players learn in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  . It's an excellent spell to helplessly levitate smaller enemies, making them prime targets for some devastating combos.

 <p>
  A great spell to pair with this levitation charm is Descendo, slamming airborne enemies to the ground with a resounding impact. As a final touch that adds insult to injury, players can cast Bombarda to blast these enemies away before they can get their bearings together.

 <p>
  The Unforgivable Curses are a ton of fun to use in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , even if some people would agree that the lack of consequences for using these spells can hurt the immersion of this title somewhat. However, players who decide to enjoy their wildest power fantasies can chain all three spells to make enemies pay.

 <p>
  The payoff of using the Killing Curse is even more satisfying when players plant a curse mark on multiple enemies and insta-kill them in one single cast. With perks like these, it's hard to see why any player would shy away from learning Dark Magic. One thing to keep in mind is to wait after casting Imperio before finishing off the combo so that the mind-controlled enemy can mark as many enemies as possible with the curse.

  Accio is an excellent and simple spell that players can use to pull enemies close. This leaves them vulnerable to some powerful spells where the fifth year can utilize this advantage to great effect.

  After using Accio, a cast of Levioso will render enemies a sitting duck as they are blasted with a short-range cast of Incendio. This is one of the most damaging spells in the entire game, and maximizing its damage by pulling enemies close makes for a fun combo of spells to pull off in quick succession.

  Finally, after enemies have been damaged extensively by this move, players can push them away to maintain a safe distance. This last stage of this 3-hit spell combo is important against enemies with damaging melee attacks who can potentially make the fifth-year student pay if they stick around in their range for too long.

  Diffindo is one of the most brutal spells in a player's arsenal, cutting enemies for serious damage. To make this spell more effective in battle, players can force an enemy to become a sitting duck as they are blasted with a cast of Diffindo.

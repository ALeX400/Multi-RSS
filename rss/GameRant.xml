   <strong>
    Path of Exile 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  has a lot of classic ARPG elements, with one of the bigger ones being how much loot you'll find while you play. When constantly creating new Instances and traveling to new areas, you'll find all sorts of items, some that are worth equipping, and some that aren't.

 <p>
  Just because an item isn't worth equipping right away doesn't mean you shouldn't still pick it up. There are many uses for loot, especially for those of the blue rarity or higher, that make it always worth hanging onto everything you can until you return to town next. Here are all the things you can do with extra loot.

  The first thing you should do with all new loot is identify it using a Scroll of Wisdom. You can also
  <strong>
   use The Hooded One to mass identify your items
  </strong>
  after progressing through the main story about halfway through Act 1. Once identified, you'll see all the stats of something to really know if it's worth using or not.

  If a particular piece of gear is very strong and you wish to hold onto it, you can also put it in your stash for later use or use on another character.

  Status Ailments can't be healed, and instead, you'll either have to avoid them or simply put up with the effects for the short amount of time they are active. Here's every ailment and what they do to the target, as the effects are the same on players and enemies.

  Ailments don't take away from the damage being done by an attack, and instead add an after-effect on the target. These ailments only have a chance of occurring, with many of them being built up with many hits in a row from a specific damage type, much like Stun. In total there are seven ailments:

  The odds of an ailment being inflicted on you are based on the amount of damage done to you by the corresponding damage type, so to avoid an ailment,
  <strong>
   you'll need to avoid its damage type
  </strong>
  . Other than physical, there are four other types of damage, here are what ailments they can cause:

 <p>
  While not every attack with those types of damage has a chance of causing one of the corresponding ailments,
  <strong>
   resisting the damage overall will lower your chances of being inflicted with the ailments
  </strong>
  . It's possible to get your resistances very high with passive skills, though it's impossible to fully resist any damage type no matter your build.

  For almost a decade,
  <em>
   <strong>
    League of Legends
   </strong>
  </em>
  was Riot Games' only release, but in recent years the
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  universe has significantly expanded with games set in Runeterra coming out left, right, and center, as well as the critically acclaimed Netflix series,
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  .

  Not only have Riot themselves released new games, but they have also partnered up with other developers to publish
  <em>
   A League of Legends Story
  </em>
  games under the Riot Forge publishing label. Thankfully for fans of
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  , this is only just the start with a fighting game and an MMO in the works, among other projects.

   While the Riot Forge project was unfortunately shut down in early 2024, fans of the League of Legends universe still have new games to look forward to with the release of 2XKO, a fighting game, hopefully arriving in 2025 and featuring many fan-favorite champions. Riot also just announced that they will be making a physical card trading game, and there is always the MMO to look forward to, although it will likely be many years before it sees the light of day.

 <p>
  Bandle City is easily the most whimsical region within the
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  universe, and it is where loveable yordles come from. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players must try to reconnect the portals that keep Bandle City united. To do so, players must hone their magical knitting skills, as the game is primarily a crafting RPG.

 <p>
  The game is incredibly cozy, both in terms of aesthetics and sound design, but players looking for a game to help them relax should be warned that the crafting can get quite complicated. There is a story, however, and players will meet a handful of their favorite yordles from
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  such as Tristana and Rumble.

   <em>
    Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the whimsical adventure of two best friends, a boy called Nunu and his pet yeti, Willump. The game is by far one of the most beautiful out of all the games set in Runeterra and truly encapsulates the cozy winter game vibe it was aiming for, taking place in the frozen depths of Freljord.

 <p>
  The game's charming music score has been heavily praised, and players also enjoyed the story, which while short, hits the balance perfectly in terms of depth for a brief, light-hearted adventure. The combat and general gameplay in
  <em>
   Song of Nunu
  </em>
  , however, can get a little boring, although anyone who enjoys a good old snowball fight likely won't run into this problem. The game's final boss fight was another shining light.

  </em>
  has a solid story and gameplay, with stealing enemies' spells being the most fun element. However, the game doesn't really do anything new and can get repetitive after a while.

  Out of all the
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  champions to appear in
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  , Ekko is certainly one of the most popular, and it is no surprise that the boy who shattered time has gotten his own game.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Convergence
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a 2D platformer with a twist, as Ekko can travel through both time and space, allowing players to turn back the clocks and learn from their mistakes.

 <p>
  While the main emphasis is certainly on the fun and engaging gameplay, the story set in Zaun is nonetheless captivating. One of the few downsides to
  <em>
   Convergence
  </em>
  is that it is rather short and leaves players hoping for expansions or even a sequel.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Teamfight Tactics
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the second game to be released in the
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  universe and is the premiere auto battler on the market. Players amass an army of
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  champions and deploy them on a chess-like board to face off against other players.

 <p>
  Managing an economy and finding the best links between champions to build the best comps is absolutely key to finding success in
  <em>
   Teamfight Tactics
  </em>
  . One of the best things about
  <em>
   TFT
  </em>
  is that it operates on a Set system, meaning that every so often the game completely changes, gaining a new roster of champions based on a particular theme.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Ruined King
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first
  <em>
   A League of Legends Story
  </em>
  to drop and arguably remains the best. It is a turn-based RPG game that allows players to explore Bilgewater and the Shadow Isles with a ragtag team of characters who will be familiar to anybody who plays
  <em>

 <p>
  The game has been praised across the board for its story, aesthetic, and soundtrack, but most importantly the gameplay hits all the right notes, with a lane system that mirrors
  <em>
   LoL
  </em>
  and encourages finding the right combinations between champions. The boss fights are also great, but if players simply want to experience the story, any fights can be skipped.

   <em>
    Legends of Runeterra
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a digital collectible card game that features many champions from
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  as well as many other characters both old and new from the world of Runeterra. Unlike other popular card games,
  <em>
   Legends of Runeterra
  </em>
  is extremely favorable to players who don't want to spend any money on cards and has been heavily praised for its gameplay balance.

  <strong>
   <em>
    League of Legends: Wild Rift
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the mobile version of the popular MOBA and while it shares many similarities,
  <em>
   Wild Rift
  </em>
  is very much its own game with plenty of differences from the PC version. In many ways, it is a streamlined version of
  <em>
   League
  </em>
  that still manages to capture the essence and depth of the original.

 <p>
  Not all champions are currently available and many of them work in slightly different ways to accommodate the change in controls. As the game was made from the ground up more recently, some aspects of the game look even better than they do on the PC version.

  At the end of the day, and despite the lower Metascore compared to other entries,
  <em>
   League of Legends

  itself is still the best game set in Runeterra, and its position as one of the biggest games in the world isn't going anywhere soon. The free-to-play MOBA's immense popularity as both a game and an esport is in large part thanks to the depth of the game and its incredible roster of champions.

  <em>
   Contact

  , which introduces PvE encounters to the game, and some great new loot to this space survival game.

  With its great base building mechanics, combined with complex spaceship and vehicle design features, this is a game that is challenging and rewarding. It is fun to play, and the new PvE content has been long awaited by the loyal community. Overall, a fantastic free update to a great game.

  Players who have spent any time designing spaceships or rovers in

  update adds Prototech loot to the game, and this includes Prototech gyroscopes. These are available in both large grid and small grid form factors. They are much more powerful than standard gyros, with one of them being equivalent to two or three of the normal ones.

  Batteries are incredibly important for all types of construction in
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  . Bases need to be powered, and vehicles need electricity to be able to move in many cases. Renewable energy sources such as solar or wind turbines don’t always fulfill power requirements, so having some charged batteries as well, helps to provide extra power when needs spike.

  Ion thrusters are sometimes rather annoying in
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  . Yes, they work well in space and only require electricity to operate. However, their performance within a gravity well is pretty dire. The player either has to add additional thrusters such as hydrogen or atmospheric, or add a large amount of Ion thrusters to work near a planet with gravity.

  The new Prototech thrusters are much more powerful than the normal Ion thrusters, and could help to bridge this gap. However, they are only available in a large grid version, and they are physically much bigger than the normal large grid Ion thrusters.

  The new flush cockpit is much more modern and streamlined than the original cockpit and suits compact designs where the player intends to use the space around the cockpit as part of their build. For example, placing mining drills on the grid. The flush cockpit makes this much simpler. Players who don’t seem to have the flush cockpit just need to exit to the main menu and sign up for the Keen newsletter.

 <p>
  Jumpdrives in
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  can be problematic at times. They do not jump a specific distance. Instead, how far a jumpdrive can jump is based on the weight of the ship. The heavier the ship, the less distance a jumpdrive can jump it.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The general way to deal with this problem up until the
  <em>
   Contact
  </em>
  update, has been to build large ships with multiple jumpdrives, which chain together to improve the jump range. However, the new Prototech jumpdrive has a much further range, although it takes up more space. Furthermore, there is a small grid version as well, something the game has been missing until now, improving exploration gameplay for small grid pilots.

  The Prototech assembler is a new type of block, that has one special function. It is used to turn Prototech scrap (gained by grinding down Prototech modules) and turning into different types of Prototech parts that can be used to create new Prototech items. However, the Prototech assembler can’t make standard components, so it is not a straight replacement for the normal assembler.

  Planetary encounters are a new type of PvE gameplay that have been introduced in the
  <em>

  update for
  <em>

  By tackling these new installations, the player has a chance to loot Prototech components, including Prototech frames. These components are needed to construct new Prototech blocks if the player is not able to loot them whole from global encounters.

  The new global encounters are a tough PvE space combat challenge that were added in the
  <em>
   Contact
  </em>
  update for
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  . These are a tough challenge, but the best source of the new Porotech blocks, as each encounter has two types of blocks available for loot. They need to be cut out and taken away.

 <p>
  There are several new encounters, ranging from quite simple, through to the epic Prototech Warship encounter, which sees the player facing off against a full-blown battleship with an escort. Overall, a fantastic new challenge for veteran players, and something for new players to aspire to.

   <em>
    One Piece
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been a manga since 1997, and it is still going strong. Additionally, the anime series, which started in 1999, has skipped a thousand episodes and, again, is still going strong. Even if it took longer to cross over to Western countries than the other "big" battle shonen properties,
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  is arguably untouchable when it comes to worldwide appeal, with only
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  exceeding it.

  Due to its delayed push, many games based on
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  were never localized in North America. Furthermore, the franchise has not always had the greatest track record when it comes to these sorts of adaptations, with most projects being very mediocre. Still, there are some gems that fans should check out. Let's take a look at the

    Updated December 7, 2024 by Mark Sammut:
   </strong>
   A new One Piece game does not seem to be on the horizon, at least not at the moment. Considering the manga and anime's popularity, the lack of video games compared to Dragon Ball or even Naruto will always be surprising. Two more
   <strong>
    One Piece games

  OK,
  <em>
   One Piece: World Seeker
  </em>
  is not particularly good; in fact, it might be the franchise's most disappointing game since, on paper, it sounds great. For years, people had been craving an open-world project that essentially delivers a traditional
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  arc in game form.
  <em>
   World Seeker
  </em>
  does just that, telling a unique story set on a prison island. While nothing too amazing, the writing is decent, the characters are mostly true to themselves, and the setting is genuinely impressive. Even the main villain, Isaac, has his charm, and he would not look out of place in a filler arc in the anime.

 <p>
  Sadly,
  <em>
   World Seeker
  </em>
  falls somewhat apart in the gameplay department. Luffy is the only playable character, which makes sense since traversal is directly tied to his Devil Fruit ability. Unfortunately, his combat options are way too shallow to remain interesting for 15+ hours, and this lack of depth is heightened by underwhelming enemy AI that does not provide much of a challenge. Prison Island is a bit too big for its own good, especially since most of it is just hills and fairly empty fields.

 <p>
  For all its flaws,
  <em>
   World Seeker
  </em>
  can still be entertaining, especially for die-hard fans. The story is worth consuming, and Luffy is fun to control when he is not fighting marines.

  While producing a few entertaining platform-style fighters,
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  has yet to get a great traditional 2D or 3D fighter.
  <em>
   Fighting for One Piece
  </em>
  is a Japan PS2 exclusive with OK visuals for its era, but slow combat and a lack of modes reduce its value. Still, it is not a terrible way to waste a few hours for anyone craving a more obscure
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  game.

 <p>
  Compared to that release,
  <em>
   Burning Blood
  </em>
  was set up to be a far bigger deal, and it is a more polished and exciting overall package. However, it does not come together to create a definitive
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  experience, except for the fact that it has a pretty large roster of fighters. While flashy and impactful,
  <em>
   Burning Blood
  </em>
  's gameplay is pretty shallow, which might indicate why its online PvP did not have much of a long-lasting life.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1207} -->

 <p>
  That said, the story mode is largely fine and packed with fanservice; more importantly, the characters have unique movesets that set them apart from each other, even if they might not individually be that complicated. Honestly, if picked up on a discount,
  <em>
   Burning Blood
  </em>
  is worth a playthrough. Just keep expectations low.

  Originally a mobile exclusive,
  <em>
   Bounty Rush
  </em>
  is nowadays available on Steam, although most of its community is likely on Android and iOS devices. Revolving around 4v4 fighters, the game drops the teams onto a battlefield and challenges them to collect the most Belly. Despite being relatively straightforward,
  <em>
   Bounty Rush
  </em>
  's core gameplay loop is quite good, especially since the emphasis is on forming a well-rounded team rather than just picking the strongest unit. While not extremely fast-paced, the combat is stylish and has just enough depth to keep things interesting for a few hours.

  Now,
  <em>
   Bounty Rush
  </em>
  is a free-to-play gacha game, and it comes with most of the usual trappings associated with both of those concepts. The title is a massive grind, and players will either need to drop a lot of hours or quite a lot of cash to pick up decent units. That said, the roster is impressive for the most part, and the characters are divided into different roles.

 <p>
  Gacha mobile games are a dime-a-dozen, especially ones based on anime licenses. Most major shonen series have at least a single adaptation that fits the bill, and they tend to be fine ways to waste a few minutes per day. That said,
  <em>
   One Piece Treasure Cruise
  </em>
  is arguably better than average, delivering a surprisingly fun turn-based combat system that can be reasonably challenging and requires frequent interaction by players due to its input-based bonuses. The story mode runs through the manga's main arcs and is updated fairly regularly, ensuring there is always new content on the horizon.

 <p>
  Still,
  <em>
   Treasure Cruise
  </em>
  's appeal is its HUGE roster of characters, with pretty much every
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  figure having different tiers/forms that cover their changes throughout the story. Players will gradually build a six-member crew featuring some of the most powerful names in this universe; however, the process is slow. Like most gacha games,
  <em>
   Treasure Cruise
  </em>
  starts fairly forgiving but gradually slows down to a crawl, requiring players to grind for pretty much any progress.

  Due to mostly skipping Western nations,
  <em>
   Grand Battle
  </em>
  had very limited reach during its rather lengthy run. The subseries was active for more than a decade, releasing seven games between 2001 and 2014; unfortunately, only three of those left Japan, and only two of them debuted in North America. Still, GameCube and PS2 owners at least got to experience
  <em>
   Grand Battle!
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Grand Adventure
  </em>
  , both of which are enjoyable arena fighters that take some ideas from classics like
  <em>
   Power Stone
  </em>
  . While the former is decent, it is rendered utterly obsolete by its successor, which has way more content and characters.

 <p>
  <em>
   Grand Adventure
  </em>
  's combat is just the right type of chaotic, dropping players into arenas filled with (strong or weak) enemies and weapons. Even if not extremely deep, the gameplay is fast, flashy, and stylish, complementing the source material. This type of game lends itself well to multiplayer, but
  <em>
   Grand Adventure
  </em>
  does not fall short in the single-player department either. The main mode allows players to build a crew and go on a mini-adventure, fighting battles and recruiting new pirates along the way. Like, it does not have a particularly grand story, but it is fun for a few hours.

  One of the more readily available
  <strong>
   <em>
    One Piece
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Unlimited World Red
  </em>
  is on the cusp of greatness, but mostly settles for being just pretty good. Telling an original story that is not far removed from the quality of the
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  movies, the campaign finds the Straw Hats helping out a unique town while also engaging with a powerful pirate from yesteryear. Also, the crew has to go up against some of their strongest past foes, although they are not quite themselves.

 <p>
  <em>
   Unlimited World Red
  </em>
  knocks its presentation out of the park, looking great on most systems. While very linear, the stages are generally impressive and varied, with their backgrounds being consistently gorgeous; conversely, Transtown, the main hub, is quite open and allows for a fair amount of exploration. The combat feels like a mash of beat 'em up and Musou mechanics, albeit arguably slower than both. Although far from terrible, the battle system gets repetitive rather quickly, especially since encounters with fodder enemies tend to overstay their welcome. That said, the boss fights are consistently great and superior to the ones found in most of the
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors
  </em>
  games.

  Simply called
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  , this beat 'em up is a perfectly good option on Nintendo's handheld GBA system. Dimps is a reliable developer, and this somewhat forgotten project represents the developer's talent for crafting solid licensed games that capture the charm of the source material while providing accessible gameplay. Just to be clear,
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  does not excel in any one area, and its combat will probably not keep non-fans engaged for too long due to its low difficulty and style-over-substance approach.

 <p>
  However, the 2005 title is decent across the board. A vibrant color palette and little animation touches (like Luffy holding his straw hat when he runs) add personality to the otherwise simple visuals, and the game nails its character designs and Luffy's special attacks. The campaign is also reasonably robust for a GBA release.

  The latest installment in the Musou
  <em>
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors 4
  </em>
  is basically a love letter to the franchise, offering die-hard fans a massive roster of characters along with telling a unique version of Wano Arc, which was ongoing at the time of the game's development. While nothing too amazing, the story is at least a fun departure from the status quo, making this entry a better overall pick than, for example,
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors 3
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Ultimately, this game (and series) is not for everyone. The Musou formula tends to be very divisive, either granting players a cathartic power fantasy with accessible hack and slash combat or a repetitive slog with shallow gameplay. Still,
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors 4
  </em>
  is a fantastic example of this formula that is packed with content, even going beyond the massive roster of characters that are just waiting to be unlocked. For what it is trying to be, this title is great.

  The most recent
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  is a turn-based JRPG that frames some of the manga's most prominent arcs through a new storyline. The Straw Hats wind up on a mystery island that strips them of most of their abilities, forcing the crew to revisit their most challenging memories to regain their skills. While largely retreading familiar ground,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  does change a few things about the sagas, so they should present a handful of surprises for long-time fans.

  <em>
   One Piece Odyssey
  </em>
  is arguably the franchise's most ambitious game to date, and it comes the closest to capturing the source material's sense of adventure. The turn-based combat works fairly well since it emphasizes the crew's positioning on the battlefield, encouraging players to move them around to ensure they are targeting the right enemies for them. That said, outside of boss encounters, the campaign is a bit too easy for its own good, which winds up taking away from what is fundamentally a solid battle system.

  On paper,
  <em>
   One Piece Odyssey
  </em>
  is the most accessible game in the franchise, but it is still ultimately difficult to recommend to JRPG fans who are not interested in the manga or anime. The story is not only long but moves at a fairly slow pace, which can cause boredom to set in after a while.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Split Fiction
   </em>
  </strong>
  isn't just any ordinary co-op action-adventure game; it's a strategic thriller that pits players against the elements and prioritizes the importance of teamwork. Either completing individual halves of the same goal or working on the same target together,
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  's achievements offer a refreshing take on teamwork and action. One wrong move from either side could end a mission in failure.

  The "
  <strong>
   You Are Not A Robot
  </strong>
  " achievement can be obtained during the Neon Revenge stage, where Zoe and Mio play the role of a cyber ninja trying to take down a tyrannical government handing out parking tickets like candy. The Gravity Bike becomes a big component in getting through certain parts of the stage, but navigating which direction to go while the other sorts out another problem may be harder than it seems.

  In the "You Are Not A Robot" mission, Mio will take control the motorcycle and guide the duo through obstacles, while Zoe will be in charge of disarming a bomb from her phone. The only problem is that the bomb disarming protocol comes with a pesky captcha system that players will need to get through. To make matters worse,
  <strong>
   the mission comes with a 64-second timer
  </strong>
  before the bomb automatically detonates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below is a rundown of each step, how to get past any obstacles, and what to look out for to avoid losing valuable seconds. It's very easy to make a mistake or even miss a step that could cost valuable time. So long as you follow the steps provided to make sure that Zoe and Mio have just enough time to get through every captcha level, you will be able to disarm the self-destruct protocol before it blows up in their faces.

  The first step is always the easiest, and players should not have any issue getting the ball rolling. Zoe begins by swiping up on the cell phone to unlock the screen, but the device will require a face scan to get to the next stage. In order to preserve time, make sure to tilt the phone immediately after unlocking the screen. The face scan takes a few seconds before unlocking.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Swipe up on the first unlock screen.

  <li>
   Turn the phone towards Zoe.

  Something players will be very familiar in the real world is getting through verification processes involving checking off boxes in an image. In this portion of the mini-game,
  <strong>
   Zoe will need to carefully select the boxes
  </strong>
  that contain the keyword provided. It's important to get at least one right, as getting all three wrong will not only waste precious seconds, but doing so will also result in failure of the mission. Here are the key patterns to use.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Puzzle 1: Boxes
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>

  The next step is to confirm that Zoe is at least 18 years old and has a valid driver's license, agrees to the terms and conditions, and is interested in signing up for the newsletter. Unfortunately, someone had to call at the most inopportune time, so deny the call, repeat the process, and then proceed to read through the terms and conditions before continuing. Nobody will judge you for skipping through all the text.

  <li>

  The final step in this fast-paced mission is to type in the six-character code using the keypad. As easy as this may sound, that darn autocorrect is waiting right around the corner to mess things up. The first three characters will be "BKE," but hitting space will change it to the word "bake." The same thing happens for the final three characters of "QXJ," correcting it to the word "can." Once completed, wait for the authentication to complete, which should take 8–9 seconds.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-warning">
  <div class="emaki-custom warning" id="custom_block_24">
   <div class="custom_block-content warning">

     Don't use the space bar when typing out each set of three characters. Instead, use the autotype choice, which will keep the same characters and add a space.
    </p>

 </section>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Type "BKE" into the phone and select auto-choice

  <li>
   Type "XQJ" into the phone and select auto-choice
  </li>
  <li>
   Tap the phone to complete and wait out the authentication loading page
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  And with that, Zoe and Mio will ride the motorcycle off a ledge before jumping off just in time as it explodes in the air. The "You Are Not a Robot" achievement will trigger during the cutscene, confirming that the mission has been successfully completed.

  Sparky came out pretty early after
  <strong>
   <em>
    Clash Royale’s
   </em>
  </strong>
  launch in 2016. It got popular fast, and fast forward to today, it can still wreck your opponent’s towers if you use it right.

  Sparky isn’t as popular in the current meta, but people still use it quite a bit. It’s a bit tricky to play, so we’ve put together some solid Sparky decks you can try, along with tips on how to counter it.

  Sparky is a legendary card that costs
  <strong>
   six elixir
  </strong>
  to play. It might seem a bit pricey at first, but it’s definitely worth it because it can deal massive damage. Sure, it’s easier to counter than some other cards, but if Sparky lands just a few hits, it can easily destroy a tower.

  Here are some of the best decks that use Sparky in
  <em>
   Clash Royale

  :

 <h3 id="goblin-giant-sparky-deck">
  Goblin Giant Sparky Deck
 </h3>
 <p>
  This is one of the most iconic decks in
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  . Goblin Giant and Sparky make a deadly combo that can deal a ton of damage. Dark Prince and Electro Wizard can handle swarms, but the deck is a bit weak against air attacks. If the player wants better air defense, they can include Firecracker or Archers.

  This deck has great defense with cards like Barbarians and Zappies. Zap and Arrows will take care of swarms, which will allow your Giant and Sparky to hit your enemy’s towers. And if needed, you can even use your Giant on defense to soak up damage.

  This deck is similar to the Goblin Giant Sparky deck, but instead of Lumberjack, you’ve got Mini P.E.K.K.A to do the same job. Some players use Elite Barbarians, but Mini P.E.K.K.A is usually a better pick because it’s cheaper.

  Sparky takes some time to charge up before firing. However, fans can stop it by using cards that have a stunning effect. Zap, Electro Spirit, Electro Wizard, and Electro Dragon are all great options to reset its charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can use Guards to counter Sparky. For that, surround Sparky with Guards as soon as she crosses the bridge. Goblins and Skeleton Army can also do the job if placed correctly. And since Sparky can’t hit air troops, you can also use them.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared their idea of what a Dragon-type Eeveelution could look like. The interesting
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  concept maintains elements of Eevee's basic design and that of its evolutions, while still transforming the Pokemon into something unique.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's been years since a new Eeveelution has been added to the games, and fans are growing impatient. Many gamers are still hoping to see a new Eeveelution soon, like in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , but there's no guarantee that one will appear anytime soon, or even ever again. As a result, fans keep generating new concepts for what it could be like if Eevee got evolutions for the types it's missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Reddit,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan Patient-Ambition9826 shared their idea for a Dragon-type Eeveelution. The Eeveelution is lacking a name, and Patient-Ambition9826 has asked fans to share their ideas on what they think would be appropriate for it. The concept includes both the standard and Shiny variants of the Pokemon, with the standard version being primarily pink and blueish-green, while the Shiny is orangey-red with stronger blue highlights. The fan-made Eeveelution maintains the head shape, ears, legs and tail, and the general shape of the eyes of Eevee, allowing it to fit in well with the rest of the established Eevee family. However, the Pokemon's body has also been transformed to look like a dragon serpent, with wispy whiskers, and spikes running down its back and tail. It also looks like this Eeveelution would float through the air, rather than walk on all fours.

 </h2>
 <p>
  Fans in the comments really like Patient-Ambition9826's fan Eeveelution, calling it cute and saying it looks like a kind-hearted Pokemon. A few name suggestions have been offered, like Drakeon, Wyrmeon, and even Longeon. So far, the artist hasn't responded to the comments, so it's not known if they like and will adopt any of these names for the Pokemon.

 <p>
  Works like these prove that fans still want Eevee to get more attention, despite the fact that multiple game generations have passed with no new Eeveelutions. Eevee remains a cute and popular Pokemon, and every time new typings are added to the series, chances are fans find themselves wondering what it would be like if Eevee had gotten a new evolution to match it. Unfortunately, a leak indicates that a flying-type Eeveelution was canceled because it turned out to be too similar to a fan work. With any luck, the constant outpouring of new ideas for Eeveelutions don't turn out to be what's keeping players from seeing a new official one.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan artist has incorporated a space theme into some of their recent artwork, creating incredible extraterrestrial designs for Bulbasaur. While Bulbasaur often gets fan makeovers, going with a space theme puts a unique twist on the classic creature’s appearance, and some in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community have taken notice.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise recently celebrated its 29th anniversary on February 27, known as Pokemon Day. As part of the festivities, The Pokemon Company hosted a Pokemon Presents event, revealing tons of new content for the franchise in 2025. With the fandom receiving details about
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , the new game
  <em>
   Pokemon Champions
  </em>
  , and much more, many fan artists have been further inspired to create artwork based on their favorite Pokemon.
 </p>
 <p>
  While each generation adds new pocket monsters, some of the originals from
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  continue to receive love from fans. Specifically, a Reddit user known as MunchyKu has shared their outer space takes on Bulbasaur, one of the Gen 1 starters from the Kanto region. Impressively, the artist gave the Pokemon four makeovers based on space-related things, including designs inspired by a quasar, supernova, black hole, and the Andromeda Galaxy. Each design kept the recognizable features of the original Gen 1 design but had space-inspired twists. While MunchyKu changed the coloring of Bulbasaur to match the look they were going for with each design, the reworks primarily focused on the pocket monster’s iconic bulb. For each variant, the bulb on the back reflected the specific space phenomenon.

 <p>
  So far, the response to these Bulbasaur variants has been positive, with many Reddit users upvoting the post. Several fans complimented the designs, with the quasar earning particular praise. It is worth pointing out that MunchyKu has created many other Pokemon redesigns in the past. The artist has shared variants for Eevee and its evolutions, Togepi, Rowlet, and many more. They have also created other versions of Bulbsaur, including winter and floral themes.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans gear up for what The Pokemon Company has in store for the rest of 2025, it will be interesting to see what type of fan projects are shared online. In addition to MunchyKu’s redesigns, other
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan artists are very active on platforms like Reddit. For example, some gamers have been sharing wood carvings based on popular Pokemon, providing real-world representations of the creatures. Hopefully, whatever comes next will have the same level of creativity as some of these recent designs.

  A lot of the mechanics in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Freedom Wars Remastered
   </strong>
  </em>
  revolve around the general atmosphere of the world you're in, really making you feel like you're in prison working against impossible odds to earn your freedom. One way to knock years off your sentence is by donating items picked up from Operations.

 <p>
  The game heavily pushes for you to donate as much as possible, and doing so does offer a bit of in-game rewards along with dialogue to make you feel like you;re doing the right thing. That all being said, keeping resources means you can use them for yourself to make your character stronger; so should you donate items or keep them for yourself?

  Whenever you donate something to the, "Greater Good", it will give you:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Reduced Sentence
  </li>
  <li>
   GPP / Entitlement Points
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Your sentence seems like an important part of the game, since it's always going up and down based on your personal actions and events in the story. That being said,
  <strong>
   your overall sentence won't play a part in finishing the game
  </strong>
  , and it shouldn't be something you invest to much time or effort into prioritizing. As you progress the game, your sentence will go down naturally, and if you choose to engage in the post-game content, it will eventually reach 1 as it will also be lowered with every completed Operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Entitlement Points are used to unlock different entitlements
  </strong>
  , and these can range from necessary combat-upgrades to just cosmetic options for your character. Total GPP is also added to the Panopticon you're a part of to rank it against the other 46 in the world.

 <p>
  The short answer is
  <strong>
   no, at least during the base game
  </strong>
  . The crafting system will slowly pan out, and you'll learn there's a lot more to use your resources for than just donating them. Early on you'll also find new weapons and have a steady stream of GPP to spend, so it won't be something you're in dire need of for any reason. If you are in need of GPP, try donating only weapons you've tried out and are sure you don't have any use of.

  The
  <em>
   Metro
  </em>
  series of games features some of the best experiences players can subject themselves to, especially if they love nail-biting gameplay with a focus on surviving in a hostile environment. These games were inspired by a Russian novel that explores the life of a group of survivors in the wake of a nuclear holocaust.
 </p>
 <p>
  Exploring the claustrophobic underground metro and dealing with the many mutants that can damage a player's gear is a harrowing experience every single time. Most players who love the Metro series will be thankful for the novel that started it all.

  A novel ahead of its time,
  <em>
   Heart of Darkness
  </em>
  is a tale that explores twisted power dynamics and the lack of morality that can be witnessed in the elite class. Its social commentary makes it a powerful piece of fiction that has inspired several other creations, including one of the best story-driven third-person shooters of all time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Spec Ops: The Line
  </em>
  is a game that masks itself as a run-of-the-mill generic military shooter, only to throw a curveball later on and let players experience one of the greatest narratives they can enjoy in a video game. This harrowing tale is a critique of military violence and how this act is turned into a source of entertainment in games, which is way deeper than anyone could've assumed the plot would go when they booted up

  <em>

  started as a collection of short stories before eventually becoming a long-running series and one of Sapkowski's most notable works. However, there's no denying that these books became popular courtesy of a video game trilogy inspired by this dark fantasy series that became one of the biggest names in the video game industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both

  and its sequel enjoyed modest critical and commercial success, but all of this was just a stepping stone for
  <em>
   The Witcher 3

  to worm its way into the hearts of many as one of the greatest open-world action RPGs ever made. Players love Geralt of Rivia and his friends, turning them into some of the most beloved fictional characters of all time who were brought to life by Sapkowski's literary flair.

  <em>
   Parasite Eve

  is the rare example of a SquareSoft JRPG that tackled mature themes, didn't overstay its welcome, and essentially served as a sequel to the novel that inspired this game. Hideaki Sena's book documents the story of a perfect being who seeks out an appropriate human host to help humanity evolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, her methods are too drastic and horrifying to be justified, and her plan eventually fails after things don't align with her grand vision. The seeds sown by this plot made
  <em>

  a tantalizing video game adaptation that serves as a decent standalone entry and doesn't force players into having in-depth knowledge of the novel that is responsible for the game's existence.

  J.K. Rowling may be one of the most controversial celebrities in modern times, but there's no denying that this literary genius molded an entire generation of readers with her work on the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  series. The magical setting of Hogwarts has inspired several popular video games that fans can't get enough of.
 </p>
 <p>
  From some underrated direct adaptations of the story to one of the biggest open-world RPGs of 2023, it's easy to see why
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  's influence on the world of video games is profound.
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  may be the best game set in this universe, but there's still a long way to go before it truly elicits the charm of this series that turned
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  into a household name.

  One of the most disturbing stories readers can check out,
  <em>
   I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream
  </em>
  is a harrowing tale where a supercomputer eradicates the entirety of humanity, leaving just five survivors alive whom he can torment for the end of his days. Their tales deal with some harsh themes that some readers may not be able to stomach.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, it's easy to see why the video game adaptation of this novel would be quite harrowing to play through. However, the expanded story of
  <em>
   I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream
  </em>
  makes it a great game to check out for players who can deal with their fair share of disturbing content, especially if they're fans of classic point-and-click games.

  The Soulslike genre has gained steam following the release of
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , and one of the best titles from a developer other than FromSoftware that players can check out is
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  . Aside from a focus on too many multi-phase boss fights, the Victorian world of
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  is dripping with atmosphere and a blast to check out.
 </p>
 <p>
  The fact that this game's world is inspired by Pinocchio's story gives this game more staying power than most people would assume. The story is tantalizing enough to do justice to Carlo Collodi's tale and adds another captivating layer to the game's tantalizing action combat.

  Panopticons are a collection of players that choose that Panopticon that will all work towards the overall score of that Panopticon. In different places in the game, you'll be able to check Panopticon rankings, which
  <strong>
   combines the total GPP all all players in that Panopticon to see which Panopticon is best
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Simply put, your Panopticon is a combined ranking for other players who happen to choose the same one as you, and it won't have much of a gameplay effect beyond that. At the time of writing, there is no bonus for being th
  <strong>
   e top Panopticon or the lowest, so it really won't matter which one you join. The League Of Panopticons compares all 47 Panopticons and ranks them
  </strong>
  based on overall GPP, and this ranking will be seen all throughout the game on screens in your Panopticon. Interacting with the League of Panopticons menu will let you see:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Total GPP of that Panopticon.
  </li>
  <li>
   League Of Panopticon Ranking.
  </li>
  <li>
   Total Sinners (players) in that Panopticon.
  </li>
  <li>
   Individual GPP Contribution (this is rounded by dividing the total number of GPP by sinners in that Panopticon.)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The League of Panopticons is
  <strong>
   updated every few real-world minutes
  </strong>
  , and you aren't able to check the rankings of each Panopticon until you're in the game. Unless you're dead-set on joining the top Panopticon, join whichever one you want and work to make it the best. If you do want to join the best, you'll have to start a character and restart after checking the rankings, though they can always change very easily.

  While never directly stated,
  <strong>
   the Panopticon you choose is the one where the events of the game take place
  </strong>
  and will appear in a few places to add flavor and no real change to the game, unlike your Thorn. A Panopticon is simply a city-like structure that now populates the earth to try and pool resources together. In operations, you'll fight Sinners from other Panopticons, as it's implied these are representations of the other players in other Panopticons fighting over resources.

  The Darkness type has been a fascinating archetype in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with its presence in the metagame fluctuating wildly—rising to the top briefly before falling back down. Despite this inconsistency, many
  <em>
   Pokemon Pocket
  </em>
  players remain optimistic, convinced that Darkness decks hold untapped potential. To support these fans in crafting a
  <strong>
   genuinely competitive Darkness deck
  </strong>
  , we've compiled what we believe to be the only META-relevant Darkness deck in
  <em>
   Pocket
  </em>
  . Here's everything you need to know.

  Unlike Arbok-Weezing decks, the Scolipede and Weezing team offers greater consistency. Scolipede, the new star of the Darkness archetype, stands out for two key reasons: its evolution aligns perfectly with the curve, and it remains unaffected by Sabrina.
 </p>
 <h3 id="scolipede-has-a-curve-friendly-evolution">
  Scolipede Has a Curve-Friendly Evolution
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although Scolipede is a Stage Two Pokemon, it can attack early with its primary move, which requires only two Energies. Additionally, its pre-evolutions, Venipede and Whirlipede, can both attack using just one Energy, making them excellent for playing on curve.
 </p>
 <h3 id="sabrina-cannot-hurt-scolipede">
  Sabrina Cannot Hurt Scolipede
 </h3>
 <p>
  Scolipede relies on frequent retreats to unleash its ultimate 120-damage attack. To do so, you need to Bench it, poison the enemy with another Pokemon, and bring Scolipede back into play. Consequently, when an opponent uses Sabrina on Scolipede, it often works in your favor by aligning perfectly with its strategy.

  I analyzed ten recent
  <em>
   Pokemon Pocket
  </em>
  tournaments, each with over 100 players and at least one using a Darkness-type deck. The results don't favor the archetype:
  <strong>
   Darkness decks averaged a position of 61.3, failing to crack the top 50
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The archetype’s META standing has been inconsistent. Before Mythical Island’s release, Arbok-Weezing lineups briefly peaked in the metagame before quickly fading. Scolipede’s fleeting fame marks the second time this archetype has attempted—and failed—to make a significant impact.

  Darkness cards are weak to Fighting-type Pokemon, which wasn’t a significant issue during the Genetic Apex era. However, the launch of the Mythical Island mini-set shifted the balance by introducing a Darkness-countering card:
  <strong>
   the new Golem
  </strong>
  . Without Golem’s release, Scolipede and other Darkness cards had the potential to shine in the META, but that’s no longer the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, Golem lineups dominate PvP matches and tournaments, making it nearly impossible for the Darkness archetype to thrive. The unfortunate reality is that this situation is unlikely to change until the next expansion, and even then, the Darkness-type Pokemon may struggle to regain popularity, as Golem is expected to remain a key player.

  The Reclaimer 18, a popular
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Warzone
   </em>
  </strong>
  shotgun, has been temporarily disabled by the game's developers until further notice. The announcement came down through official
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  social media channels, sparking speculation in the player community as to the reason why.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  might have the biggest arsenal in the series' history. With hundreds of playable weapons in the
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  armory thanks to the continuous addition of picks from new entries like
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , players have a huge amount of variety on offer when selecting their loadout. However, that variety can give rise to balance and technical issues, as weapons and parts that were designed for one game, like
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  , can end up overpowered or ineffective when
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  incorporates a new game from the series. Developers have their work cut out for them as they attempt to introduce new content while keeping older content relevant or stable at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The latest issue appears to be affecting the popular Reclaimer 18 shotgun. According to the official
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Updates social media accounts, the Reclaimer 18 has been disabled in
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  "until further notice." The announcement did not detail why the shotgun was disabled or when players can expect to regain access to it. Introduced in
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  , the Reclaimer 18 is a semi-automatic shotgun inspired byt the real-life SPAS-12 shotgun.

 <p>
  Without much detail to go on in the announcement, players immediately began speculating as to the fate of one of the best
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  shotguns, and why it would be so abruptly, albeit temporarily, removed. Some players speculated it could be due to a "glitched" blueprint version of the weapon, Inside Voices, posting clips and screenshots seeming to demonstrate its unusual lethality.

 <p>
  Reaction to the announcement was generally positive, expressing support for developers temporarily removing access to an overpowered weapon. Some players also encouraged developers to rethink the introduction of the Reclaimer 18 JAK Devastators aftermarket parts. The JAK Devastators allow players to dual-wield Reclaimer 18 shotguns, making them incredibly powerful at the right range and with the right attachments. Though nostalgic for some players that remembered the dominance of "akimbo shotgun" builds in previous games, others found the builds irritating to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other players expressed frustration with the action, saying it came too late. Since the Inside Voices blueprint is exclusive to a paid Tracer Pack, they said that the glitched weapon amounted to
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  having unintentional "pay-to-win" transactions, and that more testing should've been done before the Tracer Pack itself went live in the game.

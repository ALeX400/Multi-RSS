   <em>
    Elden Ring

  features a huge variety of armor for Tarnished heroes and potential Elden Lords to collect and wear. While all the armor in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has some utility, there is no doubt that some look better than the rest. It is a sad fact of all FromSoftware games that you cannot always wear armor that functions well
  <em>
   and

  looks good. However, every so often, you encounter an armor like

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Banished Knight Armor Set
  </strong>
  , as its name implies, is worn by
  <strong>
   Banished Knights.
  </strong>
  These foes can prove to be a tremendous challenge, especially in the early sections of the game
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  However, as it's placement on Game Rant's list of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Best Armor for Melee Builds suggests, it is well worth acquiring. This guide will show players where to find the Banished Knight armor set, and what they'll need to get it.

  Unlike many of
  <em>
   Elden Rings
  </em>
  armor sets, the
  <strong>
   Banished Knight
  </strong>
  set is not acquired as a set. Unfortunately, players must kill Banished Knights, and collect each individual as item drops. So, the first goal should be to increase Item Discovery as much as possible. Use the following items:

  While there are areas that have more Banished Knights, the Rampart Tower is the best location for the method outlined above. From the site of grace, turn around and head right out the door. Walk down the wooden staircase to find a Banished Knight at the bottom. With an Item Discovery level of 258, collecting the entire set was incredibly fast. If you are looking for other types of Banished Knights, head down to the chapel where Rogier was first encountered. From there, there are three Banished Knights in quick succession. However, the time it takes to kill them, then return to a site of grace, is not feasible when using time-sensitive items like the Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot.

  NetEase Games has released the details on the upcoming Closed Alpha Test for
  <strong>
   <em>
    FragPunk
   </em>
  </strong>
  , its newly announced multiplayer shooter. Revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 10, 2024,
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  promises to put its own spin on the team-based hero shooter scene with a unique "rule-changing" gameplay mechanic.

  The Xbox Games Showcase, as well as other game-centered events in and around the Summer Games Fest, brought with it a slew of new game announcements, including a wave of new multiplayer shooter titles, including
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  . The hero shooter scene is dominated by major titles that include games like
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  , so
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  will have some very stiff competition. That said, developer Bad Guitar Studio appears confident in
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  's ability to stand out, thanks to a unique mechanic based on actively changing the rules of the match as it's played.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  Closed Alpha Test will start on June 27, 2024, and run through July 1 for selected applicants. Players in North America can register to participate in the test on the official
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  website. Alternatively, players can request access via the game's Steam store page. The schedule makes
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  the second of the new wave of hero shooters to enter a public testing phase, as the superhero-themed hero shooter
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  entered Alpha Testing in early May 2024.

 <p>
  According to an FAQ on the official site, players will be able to play an early build of
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  , and have access to the launch roster of 10 characters. They'll also be able to choose from 15 weapons, 4 maps, and 70 different Shard Cards, allowing for a good number of combinations between weapon, character, and card deck. It'll be during this test period that players will see just how impactful the
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  Shard Card abilities can be.

 <p>
  Based on the trailer, which was entirely cinematic, Shard Cards are the central mechanic that helps
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  stand out in a crowded genre. Shard Card abilities can be relatively mundane, like Dragon's Breath, which adds fire damage to a player's attacks. But others can be far more dramatic, like World Flip, which indirectly takes a page from
  <em>
   Lawbreakers
  </em>
  and
  <em>
  </em>
  flips the map upside-down, to "reverse" enemies' gravity temporarily.

 <p>
  What wasn't clear from the trailer alone is how the "hero" part of
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  's hero shooter concept will come into play. The official site promotes a cast of ten playable heroes with a variety of abilities and weapon combinations, but says little about what those abilities are and how they'll play alongside Shard Cards. That might come into clearer light once more details emerge from the
  <em>
   FragPunk
  </em>
  Closed Alpha.

  The infamous
  <em>
   EVE Online
  </em>
  is a mechanically complex space-based MMORPG set in a vast and persistent universe. The game is known for its intricate and detailed economy, as well as the massive player factions that dominate its sprawling map. The infamous Battle of B-R5RB, for instance, was a collision of four major factions consisting of thousands of ships. It's been recognized as one of the largest and most expensive virtual battles ever.

 <p>
  The scale and mechanical complexity of
  <em>
   EVE Online
  </em>
  is certainly not for everyone. It takes a considerable effort to learn the ropes and establish a place in the game's complicated world. But for fans who want to feel like part of something truly grand in a vast universe,
  <em>
   EVE Online
  </em>
  is an excellent choice.

  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto V
  </em>
  was an absolute sensation for Rockstar and the gaming industry as a whole. Despite releasing over a decade ago,
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  is still going strong, thanks in large part to the large community of fans playing its online component,
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . This special mode lets players freely roam San Andreas, using a custom character to complete missions, manage a criminal enterprise, and accumulate powerful weapons and luxurious vehicles.

 <p>
  Of course,
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  is perhaps best known for its extensive community. One of the most infamous expressions of this social element is
  <em>
   GTA V RP
  </em>
  , a massive community that uses mods to build their own immersive storylines in the game. These can change how NPCs react to the player's character and allow for more in-depth interactions between players. Mods or no mods, though,
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  is an excellent way to form a band of criminals on the mean streets of one of the most successful games of all time.

  The tumultuous history of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is the stuff of legend. Its notoriously buggy state at launch earned it a lot of derision from the gaming community and resulted in a stain on the game's reputation that still isn't fully cleared off. But to its credit, Bethesda has been improving and expanding the game ever since, resulting in an experience that's worth playing for community-minded survivors.

 <p>
  One of the biggest selling points of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is its community. The game's player base prides itself on its unusually welcoming atmosphere. With
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  's intricate base-building mechanics, making new friends and showing off elaborate and impressive builds to each other is a major pastime. And with the recent news that playable ghouls are being added, it's a good time to get into
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  in spite of its turbulent past.

  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  is an engaging take on the world of the iconic barbarian, arguably one of the most influential works of fantasy fiction of all time. The game is known primarily for its survival gameplay and for its in-depth character customization options. Once the player has established themselves in this unforgiving world, though, they can start making friends.

  <em>

  boasts robust mechanics for city-building and forming alliances. With a persistent open world, a dedicated group of players can build a metropolis and fortify it against the desert's many dangers.

  The long and storied history of
  <em>
   No Man's Sky

  brought this expansive intergalactic sandbox from a notorious letdown to a beloved multiplayer gem. The massive list of new features that have been added since launch is staggering, from exosuits to land vehicles to dungeon runs. But one of the most significant ways
  <em>
   No Man's Sky

  has improved is through its multiplayer offerings.

  now boasts a full multiplayer hub that players can summon, no matter where they are. From there, players can sign up for missions together, party up to explore the galaxy, or simply hang out and make friends. There are also various guilds that players can interact with, which come with their own perks. The game's robust community features have even led to some players forming their own in-game factions to build and share impressive player builds. Compared to its desolate state at launch,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  is now a delightfully social experience.

  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  is a recent breakout hit that sees teams of players working together to survive the zombie apocalypse. This grim sandbox offers numerous points of interest to explore and endless hordes of undead monsters to struggle against. The game's persistent servers mean survivors can build and maintain impressive and substantial bases as they work together to hold back the tide.

  While
  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  is still in early access, it already hosts a lot of features for bringing a community of survivors together. The game paints death as an inevitability, and falling to the horde comes with severe consequences. Luckily, the game's extensive sandbox controls and in-depth modding support means that players always have something new to try for future attempts at survival with their friends.

  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  is a game that needs no introduction. It's one of the most iconic MMORPGs on the market, if not one of the most well-known video games of all time, and its content updates and expansions bring a steady tide of new gameplay for fans to experience together. Like all MMOs,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  has a robust community element. Players can join guilds and party up to take on the many threats Azeroth has to offer.

  For as long as
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  has been around, players have been sinking countless hours into their in-game communities. Iconic in-game moments like Leeroy Jenkins' fateful battle cry and the Corrupted Blood plague prove how seriously players take the game.
  <em>
  </em>
  If players truly want to live in a fantasy world with their friends,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  is one of their best options.

  The story of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy XIV
  </em>
  is a truly fascinating one. The original version of this now-iconic
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  MMORPG was a massive failure when it launched, prompting Square Enix to literally destroy the entire world of the game and start fresh. The reboot,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn
  </em>
  , is now a massive success, and the most profitable
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game to date.

  This game is a boon for
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  fans with a social bent. Like any good MMORPG,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy XIV
  </em>
  has a host of guilds for players to join and numerous social hubs for players looking to make friends or join groups. The game even has a marriage mechanic for players who want to take their roleplay to the next level. The traditionally party-based dynamic of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  translates well to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy XIV
  </em>
  , as players must form groups to take on some of the major challenges in the game's sprawling world. Clever teamwork and balanced party compositions are essential to success, making
  <em>
   Final Fantasy XIV
  </em>
  a very social game indeed.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  developer addressed the backlash that the Faker Ahri skin received, and defended their decision to put an expensive price tag on it. This special Ahri skin was created as part of
  <em>

  </em>
  ' Hall of Legends 2024 event, where it inducted the multi-awarded Korean pro player Faker.

 <p>
  When
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  first announced the Faker Ahri skin, it was met with a lot of disappointment because of its steep price point. The limited-edition skins come in two variants, Risen Legend Ahri and Immortalized Legend Ahri, which players can only purchase if they spend on one of three bundles that also offer cosmetic upgrades. The cheapest bundle is priced at 5,430RP ($40), while the most expensive, featuring Immortalized Legend Ahri, is a whopping 59,260RP ($450), which fans criticized for being an alleged cash grab capitalizing on Faker's success.

  In a Reddit comment under a post about
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  ' most recent Dev Update video, Riot Games dev RiotMeddler defended the Hall of Legends collection, saying that it's a good opportunity to celebrate iconic pro players and help cover the cost of esports with really expensive offerings akin to collector's editions. He also noted that Hall of Legends offers content at different price points, like the 1950RP battle pass featuring Risen Legend LeBlanc and other
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  skins, which he said is still "a really strong core offering" for players who want to participate in the Hall of Legends event.

 <p>
  However, many
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  fans weren't sold on the dev's explanation because they still feel like the Hall of Legends Ahri collection is too expensive. One fan pointed out that if Riot Games wanted to celebrate both the players and the pros, it shouldn't have excluded the majority of its player base, especially those who want to get the Immortalized Legend Ahri skin. Some also disagreed with the sentiment that the Hall of Legends skins can be considered collectibles because they are not physical items, and that players could lose them if
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  suddenly shut down its servers.

 <p>
  While it's understandable that Riot Games wants to give back to its pro players, especially those that helped put the game on the map, many fans also make a valid point that the Ahri skin collection could be too pricey for the majority of players. The backlash has gotten so bad that some
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  fans are rallying to ban Ahri in all of their games in protest.

  If fans are still looking for ways to get other skins in the game,
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  also offers options to claim free Champion Skins. With 160 playable Champions in the pool, the Riot Games has created a plethora of skin for each of them, so players can enjoy dressing up their mains in other ways.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark and Darker Mobile
   </em>
  </strong>
  has set a window for the release of its next beta test: August. Gamers are anticipating the release of the mobile version of the dark fantasy mobile game
  <em>
   Dark and Darker
  </em>
  , which itself does not have a full release, but had an early access launch in 2023.
  <em>
   Dark and Darker Mobile
  </em>
  appears to be adapting the game in a similar vein to releases like
  <em>
   PUBG
  </em>
  <em>
   Mobile
  </em>
  , which Krafton published in Korea and Japan.

 <p>
  Some gamers have gotten the chance to share impressions of
  <em>
   Dark and Darker Mobile
  </em>
  already, and while the overall reception appears to be quite positive, it will be important for developer Bluehole Studio to walk the line of monetization carefully. Free-to-play games offer plenty of fun for gamers. However, many have noted losing interest in games depending on how aggressive the monetization becomes. It may not be long before a larger audience can form their own opinion, though.

  A global beta test has been announced for
  <em>
   Dark and Darker Mobile.
  </em>
  Bluehole Studio and its parent company Krafton are targeting August for the test in major global markets, which will include the United States, Japan, and Turkey. Some gamers have expressed their excitement about getting the chance to try out the game, which promises players the thrill of fighting off various monsters and creatures while journeying for loot.
  <em>
   Dark and Darker Mobile
  </em>
  appears to be rising in popularity, with the initial beta test receiving over 50,000 applicants.

  Although some gamers are concerned about the way aspects like monetization will work in
  <em>
   Dark and Darker Mobile
  </em>
  , Krafton has confirmed that the game won't operate in a pay-to-win format, so players can rest assured that their hard work looting dungeons and escaping portals at the right time won't go without a reward. Krafton has stated that its priority is keeping players excited about the game itself and the fun that experience can provide.

 <p>
  Krafton maintains that 2024 is the target for
  <em>
   Dark and Darker Mobile
  </em>
  's global launch, so it seems that players who do not get the chance to try out the new beta test won't have to wait too much longer to play the official release. Krafton and Bluehole conducted a survey to collect feedback based on the beta test, where over 97% of players stated that they are willing to play the game when it releases. This could lead to a great launch for the game when it is ready.

      <title>8 Absolutely Stunning Games Nobody Talks About</title>

  We're often warned about judging a book by its cover, and it's absolutely true. Those superficial enough to do so often miss out on a lot of inner beauty and substance. Having said that, there are some games that are just so stunning-looking that a single screenshot or a few seconds' worth of a trailer is enough to keep you invested.
 </p>

 <p>
  Tragically, though, some stunning games don't get that love-at-first-sight adoration that they deserve. There are always great games that fly under the radar, and we're going to highlight some that, through no fault of their own, did just that.

  Nomada Studios'
  <em>
   Gris
  </em>
  was
  <em>
  </em>
  first released in 2018, a celebrated platform title with beautiful hand-drawn visuals and an equally stunning soundtrack. The game ties both these elements together in the central mechanic of singing, and how it can restore life and lush color to a world from which it has faded. Six years later, the studio returned with
  <em>
   Neva,
  </em>
  a game that just doesn't seem to have attracted the same level of fanfare.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story revolves around a young woman, Alba, and her wolf companion (the titular Neva). This title embraces a similar dreamlike, flowing aesthetic, in which a lush and colorful world is corrupted by a force that manifests as dark, shadowy enemies the duo must defeat. Combat isn't the most involved, but it has its own style, and the passage of time is reflected in the changing of seasons, which seamlessly alters the color palette of the world as the game progresses. It may be somewhat short-lived, but the wonderful animation and art make
  <em>
   Neva
  </em>
  a thrill to watch in motion.

  PlayStation Vita was quite a formidable system when it arrived (first in Japan in 2011), with its primary weakness being that it lacked big exclusives. One superb Vita-only title, until its remaster a few years later, was
  <em>
   Gravity Rush
  </em>
  . The unique concept took full advantage of the system's capabilities to lead Kat through the city of Hekseville and the surrounding regions of the World Pillar through her command of gravity. Touchscreen controls are particularly prominent in the Vita version, with maneuvers including twisting and shaking the system to change the direction of gravity and direct evasive moves in combat through touch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kat feels wonderful and slightly chaotic to control, and this, along with the game's heavy action focus, is complemented by the art style. There's an immediately identifiable look to
  <em>
   Gravity Rush,
  </em>
  and it works so well. It's a perfect fit for the stylized approach, and it's a shame that the franchise's future hangs in the balance. 2017's PS4 sequel
  <em>
   Gravity Rush 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  may have been the end of the line.

 </div>
 <p>
  Hack and slash titles and brawlers lend themselves so well to a stylized, exaggerated look. It really makes the action pop, and each strike feels that much more visceral.
  <em>
   BloodRayne: Betrayal
  </em>
  is acutely aware of this, and uses its glorious 2D art to great effect. The
  <em>
   BloodRayne
  </em>
  games are well known for their gore and high-octane action (as well as for beloved vampire Rayne), and though
  <em>
   Betrayal
  </em>
  was a very different direction for the franchise, it did a fantastic job of maintaining that.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game originally launched in 2011 for the Xbox 360 and PS3, before being reborn a full decade later as
  <em>
   BloodRayne: Betrayal - Fresh Bites.
  </em>
  It's the story of the conflict between Rayne and Kagan, her formidable father, whose castle the Dhampir battles to infiltrate and bring down in a
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  -esque fashion. The remade version sought to address some criticisms of the original game, primarily the frustrating difficulty, but it didn't set the gaming world alight in either iteration. Nonetheless, the health-draining mechanic and swift, responsive action keep it engaging throughout for genre fans. Needless to say, it looks grotesquely beautiful, too.

 <p>
  Indie developers have certainly had a penchant for pixel art in recent years. This isn't to say, though, that the style doesn't still look incredible when used effectively.
  <em>
   Eastward
  </em>
  presents the tale of John and his adoptive daughter Sam, who become entangled in the mystery of a certain Miasma that threatens the world. It's quite a traditional RPG in some regards, with an engaging battle system and classic town exploration focus. Whether you're battling in real time (wielding a frying pan) or talking with the locals, though, the great thing about
  <em>
   Eastward
  </em>
  is how alive its world is.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's rich detail in the visuals, with effects layered on the 2D pixel art to really emphasize every animation from characters and enemies, each of which has its own unique personality and bizarre details. It's a world that you'll want to pause to take in every inch of as you travel east on your remarkable train.

 <p>
  In an FPS, there doesn't tend to be much time to focus on the smaller details. A developer can lovingly craft the little details on an office desk, for instance, but as you blast your way through the building, you'd probably never even notice them. In
  <em>
   Severed Steel
  </em>
  , then, the most impressive details and effects are made part of the action itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  The indoor environments have something of a futuristic, metallic vibe that could have potentially made them feel a little samey and uninspiring. This is intentional, though, ensuring that every stylish smash of windows, glow from bright neon lights, and colorful explosion draws the eye as much as possible. The game has relentless energy, and all of that is reflected in the stunning effects on the screen throughout.

  At first glance, 2021's
  <em>
   The Pedestrian
  </em>
  looks... well, pedestrian in its visuals. The environments look realistic and ordinary, with street scenes, office spaces, and other everyday places. What you'll quickly realize, though, is that the action in the game is what happens against these backdrops. You'll want to look closer as some of the minutiae of life play out in stunning detail against these dioramas, but if you do so, you'll lose focus on what really matters here: The puzzles within the panels in the foreground.
 </p>
 <p>
  The contrast of the simplistic lead-the-stickperson visuals in these panels, against the world in the background, is incredible. Snookum Arts really created something special here, and the transition between those panels as you lead the characters between them is a work of art in itself.
  <em>
   The Pedestrian
  </em>
  quickly ramps up the difficulty, and beginners could use some guidance at times, but it's never anything less than transfixing.

  <em>
   The Pathless
  </em>
  shares a lot in common with
  <em>
   Ori and the Blind Forest.
  </em>
  While it's an open-world adventure rather than a Metroidvania like Ori's journey, it also explores the tragedy of a very unnatural calamity befalling the natural world, and the quest to restore some light and hope to a seemingly doomed forest.
 </p>
 <p>
  The goal of
  <em>
   The Pathless
  </em>
  is for the splendid visuals to tell and guide the story, and they do this very well. The bond between the protagonist and their winged companion is generally an unspoken one; taking control of the duo means embracing a freedom and agility that's lacking from many open-world titles. The best visual and audio design can touch the player's heart without the need for lengthy dialogue and exposition, and the fierce, bright colors of fire and calamity here, contrasted against the peaceful, earthy tones of the surrounding forest, really emphasize that.

  Some gamers absolutely revel in an experience like
  <em>
   Journey.
  </em>
  If you're looking to be blown away by non-stop action, you're in the wrong place, but for a slow, thoughtful, philosophical slow-burner, there's little better.
  <em>
   Sable
  </em>
  is cut from a similar cloth, a game that perhaps didn't get a fair shake on its September 2021 launch because it was blighted with a lot of technical issues. The concept, though, remains an intriguing one, and it really is a wonder to behold.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sable, the young protagonist, is embarking on The Gliding, a journey that members of the Ibexii clan partake in at a certain age. It's their elaborate means of choosing a career, essentially, and it sparks an open-world journey in the purest sense. Simply getting out there and traveling the world is your objective, and Sable has a nifty little ride with which to do so. Journeying across a rather barren planet in your vehicle, with everything so very stylized, is reminiscent of traveling the planet in the original
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  . The gameplay, comprised of light platforming and traveling, makes it a real slow-burner that may frustrate. For those players who appreciate this sort of title, though, it may prove as captivating as it looks. Open-world games are all about immersion, and this one does a great job of that, too.

   <strong>
    Shoot and Catch a Brainrot
   </strong>
   has a couple of active codes that grant free Attack Speed Potions to give your gameplay a little boost. The newest addition provides another chance to stack these potions and enhance your attacks. Using these codes can make progressing through challenges faster and more efficient. Keep an eye out for updates, as new codes are often added.

  In
  <em>
   Shoot and Catch a Brainrot
  </em>
  , you will have to use your guns to capture different creatures, and some of them can be really tough. This
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  game has special potions that will help you deal more damage, and some codes can provide you with drinks that buff your attack speed. With these consumables, you will be able to capture rarer brainrot characters and increase your income.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, promo codes in
  <em>
   Shoot and Catch a Brainrot
  </em>
  can expire, and we don’t recommend waiting too long before using them. If you don’t redeem them while they are active, you will lose all freebies.

  One way to play
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is as Harry Potter, a century before he would arrive at the school. While there are some technically stronger builds, Harry Potter still packs a punch and makes use of some of the strongest spells. Expelliarmus will naturally be the main spell, and as this disarms, it is incredibly strong against Dark witches and wizards. Stupefy and Accio are other iconic spells used by the Boy Who Lived, but there's also a stealth element to this build with the Disillusionment charm used in place of Harry's cloak of invisibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it's easy to think of Harry as entirely good, don't forget that he used Imperio and Crucio in times of need, so players could utilize these in tough fights. When playing as Harry Potter, try not to use Ancient Magic if you care more about roleplaying than min-maxing, as this type of magic was unknown to him.

  Players will likely be familiar with Dark Arts builds and Herbology builds, but few have ever paired them together. However, by using the strongest spells in the game, the Unforgivable Curses, while plants freely attack, players will deal an incredible amount of damage. Such a build is also perfect for taking on multiple enemies at once, as Imperio secures an extra ally, while plants such as the Chinese Chomping Cabbage and Venomous Tentacula keep other foes busy.
 </p>
 <p>
  As fire kills most plants, try to avoid spells such as Incendio and Bombarda. Unfortunately, this is a fairly late-game build, as the Unforgivable Curses are only learned later on during the story, and players don't have immediate access to all the plants and the Talents and Traits that make them so powerful.

  While many other builds on this list are focused on an offensive approach that deals a lot of damage to enemies, this one prioritizes defense and crowd control, which are extremely important to survival. By using the Transformation spell, players can turn their enemies into objects, including explosive barrels that they can later throw at other foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of this, Arresto Momentum is great for incapacitating other enemies simultaneously, making it easier to deal with smaller crowds. The Control 3 Trait is ideal for boosting the damage of the Ancient Magic Throw, and the Transformation Mastery Talent allows for turning enemies into explosive objects.

  If players feel like they have a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics like a certain future Hogwarts student, Seamus Finnigan, they can try an explosive fire build in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  . First of all, players will need to learn the spells, Incendio, Confringo, and Bombarda, and also unlock the corresponding Spell Talents which will make all of these spells even more explosive. The upgraded Transfiguration spell is another great option for this build, as the transformed barrel-enemy explodes on impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can then use the Enchanted Loom in the Room of Requirement to upgrade their gear with Traits such as Scorching III, Explosive III, and Destruction III, which will make their fire-based spells pack even more of a punch. Players can find most Traits in Collection Chests after taking out Bandit Camps, although some are obtained by completing Combat Challenges.

  Ancient Magic is at the center of the
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  story as it is a rare form of magic that few wield, with the main character being the only exception in living memory. By performing spell combos, players will fill up their Ancient Magic Meter which in turn allows them to unleash deadly and epic-looking Ancient Magic Finishers. These finishers will one-shot most enemies in the game, and thus making a build that enhances them is one of the easiest ways to become overpowered in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Firstly, players will want to unlock more bars on their Ancient Magic Meter, by completing one of the game's exploration challenges of collecting Ancient Magic Traces from ruins around the map. Next, they will want to unlock any Talents that involve Ancient Magic, such as Basic Cast Airborne Absorption which allows Basic Casts on airborne enemies to fill up the meter. Finally, players can upgrade their gear with certain Traits such as Ancient Magic Focus III and Ancient Magic III which will help the meter fill up faster and then deal more damage respectively.

  As players progress through the game, they will come upon the Disillusionment spell, which allows them to begin attempting to hide from their enemies. While hiding, players can cast Petrificus Totalus to permanently bind weaker enemies. That spell will also work on stronger enemies for a short period of time, giving the player a huge surprise attack advantage start to most duels.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least, this is true if the player can stay hidden long enough to get close to their enemies. The most important aspect of this stealthy build is to gain mastery in spells like Revelio and Petrificus Totalus. It’s also hugely important to learn the Sense of Secrecy I &amp; II talents. These make it much more difficult for enemies to spot the player as they sneak up on them. Finally, learning the recipe for and brewing invisibility potions will help players stay hidden as they sneak around areas with many opponents. This is a great example of a build that does not prioritize offense, but rather opts for making players invisible to their enemies, allowing them to sneak past them without having to engage in combat. There are many situations throughout the story that are best handled with secrecy, as facing multiple foes head-on can be very difficult, especially in the early stages of the game.

  Many players know how to make a dangerous, dark wizard build already in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  . This style of play is generally considered overpowered. Thus, many players haven’t bothered trying to think which combinations of spells, excluding the darker ones, can make a player character hugely dangerous. There are a lot of options though, and focusing on spells like Glacius, Depulso, Incendio, and Expelliarmus can still make a player powerful. This also allows players to role-play their favorite good characters in
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  With a good force spell, a good control spell, and two damage spells, it's easy to quickly navigate most enemies in the game. It may not be as overpowered as the darker spells allow a player to be, but this combination of spells is still great, especially alongside talents like Glacius Mastery, Descendo Mastery, Protego Mastery, and Basic Cast Airborne Absorption. These allow the player to focus on their unique talent, the ancient magic, building the meter again and again to demolish enemies with unbelievable force. Role-playing as mostly a good wizard has other perks too, like being a friend to the many magical creatures in the game.

  One of the easiest ways to beat
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is to focus on defense and ensure that the main character never dies. This can be achieved in numerous ways, and the first thing players need is some good defensive spells. Depulso, for example, can repel attackers and create space, while Arresto Momentum will stop enemies in their tracks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Getting good at timing the Protego spell is also crucial for this build, and with complimentary Talents, any would-be attackers will end up stunned for longer with Stupefy. By taking defensive Traits such as Protego Sheilding III and Goblin-Silver Resistance, players will also take less damage from two of the most common enemies in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  ; Dark Wizards and Goblins. Finally, the Edurus Potion will make players even more unkillable for 20 seconds.

  It is surprising to see the Chinese Chomping Cabbages make an appearance on a list of overpowered builds. However, the use of magical plants such as cabbages in major fights, particularly some late-game boss fights, is not to be underestimated. If players buy seeds and grow them in the Room of Requirement, they will be able to do shocking things in a battle with them. But it isn't the strangest thing in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  From using Mandrakes to incapacitate several enemies at once to the damaging properties of the Venomous Tentacula, plants and herbology are a worthy pursuit. But the cabbages, alongside talents like Fertilizer and traits for gear like Herbology III, can make for a truly destructive build. These traits and talents increase the number of cabbages thrown and massively boost the damage done by plants in combat. It's perfect for players who enjoy the Room of Requirement and growing things. Other traits for a herbology build include Fangs III, Venom III, and Deafening III. This build is incredibly unusual but is an amazingly effective way to take down foes in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>

  Few things are as entertaining in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  as being able to lift enemies in the air and slamming them against the nearest wall, or towards the ground beneath them. Combining Levioso and Depulso does not only provide a strong combo that can melt enemies' Health bars quickly, but also offers a few seconds to take a breather and gain control of the situation in combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pairing these spells with the Protego Absorption Talent, as well as with Swift and Depulso/Levioso Masteries will turn players into a powerful force with strong evasion and protection skills, as well as a wide arsenal to attack—all while filling the Ancient Magic Meter. For maximum damage output, players can also equip the Concentration 3 Trait, which boosts spell damage significantly. Talk about the perfect combination between offense and defense.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, though, all the Talents and Traits required for this build are level 3, so it's likely that players won't be able to access them until late in the game..

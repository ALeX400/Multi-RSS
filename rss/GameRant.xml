 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Thunder Burst SMG
  </strong>
  performs decently overall, but in a tactical shooter like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Ballistic, where precision is critical, its burst-fire mode can be a drawback. Missing shots during an engagement can put you at a serious disadvantage. Even though enemies often remain stationary while shooting, any slight movement can leave you vulnerable when using this weapon.

  While this SMG might have some utility in close-range situations, these scenarios are generally best avoided. Additionally, there are far better alternatives available for covering short distances effectively.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Hand Cannon
  </strong>
  stands out for its excellent damage, especially when paired with perfect accuracy. However, this weapon shines primarily during pistol rounds, such as at the start of a match or when switching sides. With its slow rate of fire and limited magazine size, the Hand Cannon is most effective for saving Credits for later rounds, thanks to its affordability.

 <p>
  To maximize its potential, precision is crucial – missing shots can leave the player exposed, especially against enemies equipped with Shields and superior gear. While it can be effective when used strategically from cover, its limitations make it challenging to compete with higher-tier weapons as the match progresses.

 <p>
  Although the
  <strong>
   Hammer Pump Shotgun
  </strong>
  boasts impressive damage output, its effectiveness is significantly limited by its reliance on close-range engagements. Using the shotgun demands precise aim in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  since each shot gives gamers only one opportunity to hit their target. Missing will leave them highly vulnerable during the weapon’s lengthy reload process, which is one of the slowest among all available options.

  In a mode like Ballistic, where eliminating enemies from a distance while staying out of harm’s way provides a significant advantage, the
  <strong>
   Reaper Sniper Rifle
  </strong>
  stands out as one of the top choices – particularly for players confident in their precision.

 <p>
  With a 150-damage output, this Sniper can take down an enemy in a single shot, even if they are fully shielded. However, its main drawback is its high cost, which may require sacrificing other essential and versatile equipment, including alternative weapon options that could better suit different scenarios.

  Close-range combat can be challenging, especially with weapons that have a low hit probability, but the
  <strong>
   Frenzy Auto Shotgun
  </strong>
  stands out as a reliable exception. If you’re a player who thrives in close quarters and knows how to maneuver effectively, this weapon could be a game-changer for you.

 <p>
  Its automatic firing mode allows for continuous shooting when engaging enemies up close, and with its relatively high damage output, landing three well-placed shots is often enough to eliminate your opponent swiftly.

  The
  <strong>
   Ranger Pistol
  </strong>
  stands out as a unique weapon, deserving its own category, as it’s the only one that remains available at all times, regardless of the player's primary weapon choice. This pistol becomes a loyal companion during side switches and throughout matches.

 <p>
  Its ranking lies in its consistent availability at no cost, combined with respectable stats. While it requires a bit of precision to land shots effectively, its competitive damage output makes it a solid fallback option. Since it’s a weapon gamers will frequently rely on, regular use and the best settings will help them master its handling, allowing them to maximize its potential during crucial rounds.

  Close behind the top contenders is the
  <strong>
   Striker AR
  </strong>
  , a weapon known for its consistent performance, high fire rate, and great ammunition capacity. While it’s a solid choice, other options in the game tend to outshine it, particularly at longer ranges.

 <p>
  In a mode where precision and quick reactions are essential, the Striker AR’s slower reload speed places it as the third-best option among Assault Rifles. However, those slower playstyle players who feel more comfortable with it, either due to the optic or other stats, can rest assured that this AR is still a reliable weapon to pick.

  It deals 65 damage per shot, meaning you can eliminate enemies with just three bullets, even if they have full shield protection. While its magazine size is small, the low bullet requirement per kill allows you to take down several enemies before needing to reload. Additionally, its affordable price compared to other options makes it a popular and viable choice.

      <title>Marvel Rivals Could Do Wonders With a PvE Mode</title>

  With the launch of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Marvel fans are getting to step into the shoes of their favorite heroes in a brand-new iteration of the Marvel universe. However, unlike the likes of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  , this version of the characters has them doing battle against each other in classic 6v6 hero shooter matches. That makes for a whole new type of Marvel game that fans seem to be flocking to. And while that approach is working well so far,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  may want to consider taking on PvE as well.

  As of now, NetEase Games seemingly has no plans to bring PvE to
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . The studio's primary focus seems to be on delivering a strong PvP experience that players will want to keep coming back to for years. But, if it wants to take the concept to new heights, then it really should consider throwing a PvE mode into the mix. Not only could
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' gameplay work extremely well in a mode such as that, but the Marvel universe has 85 years of storytelling just waiting to be explored in the video game space.

  The Marvel Universe is Filled to the Brim With Stories to Be Told
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Marvel universe is built around the concept of heroes taking on villains across Earth, the galaxy, time, and even the multiverse. It has made for some fantastic adventures over the years, the likes of which the Marvel Cinematic Universe has done a great job of showcasing. Fans have fallen in love with the battles of the Avengers, the trials and tribulations of the X-Men, and the roguish exploits of the Guardians of the Galaxy. With each passing year, those adventures have only grown.

 <p>
  Through
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , players get to step into the shoes of many of those heroes, with some making their first major video game debut, like Jeff the Land Shark. However, unlike those stories, this iteration of the universe is vastly different from what has come before. While that has made for an exciting and satisfying gameplay loop, there is something special about seeing these heroes actually be heroes. The best way to display that type of story would likely be through a PvE mode.

 <h3 id="marvel-rivals-has-the-perfect-opportunity-to-craft-a-fantastic-pve-mode">
  Marvel Rivals Has the Perfect Opportunity to Craft a Fantastic PvE Mode
 </h3>
 <p>
  As of now,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is building out a seasonal story that involves the vile Doctor Doom. It remains to be seen just where that story goes, but there is a strong chance it will culminate in some massive final confrontation. Because the game is strictly PvP, that confrontation may only be seen in the game's comic strips, as dialogue between the characters, or in special maps. But, with a PvE mode, NetEase Games could have players actually witness and fight through that finale, making for something truly special.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1259} -->

 <p>
  Along with that, NetEase could also introduce a plethora of special PvE events themed after various events across Marvel's history. It would hardly be the first hero shooter to do such a thing, and with the vast library of characters and stories to pull from, the potential is seemingly limitless. Maybe they need to combat hordes of Ultron drones, maybe the Chitauri are invading some of the maps, or maybe Sentinels have set their sights on the players. Whatever story the studio wanted to tell,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' gameplay could lead to a fantastic experience.

 <p>
  Not only could it give
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  some fun side content and also help serve the story, but it could also help set the game apart from games such as
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  considerably. That game has garnered much criticism for not delivering the PvE story that was initially promised. If
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  was able to offer one in its place, then it may even be able to cement itself as the new genre kingpin, as long as said PvE story is actually well done.

  A creative

  </em>
  fan online has shared their epic desert temple build, which they have brought to life in their in-game world. This unique

 <p>
  Over the years,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  fans have become accustomed to sharing their incredible creations with other players online. There are so many out there at this point, that it can prove very difficult to stand out from the crowd - only the best of the best gain traction in online communities like Reddit. Not all builds have to be enormous in scale in order to be impressive, though. Just recently, another
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  player built an incredible replica of
  <em>
   SpongeBob
  </em>
  's Krusty Krab, showing how sometimes, the influence of other franchises can often bleed into these kinds of fan creations.

 <p>
  Redditor MooshroomShark shared their incredible
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  build, a massive temple built in the desert. The temple is extremely grand, with screenshots showing what it looks like in both day and nighttime. The illuminated nighttime version really shows how impressive this creation is. According to MooshroomShark, they spent about 10 hours on the build, not including breaks. Their full process involved building a skeleton version of the temple out of wool first, which really helped to cut down the process of getting the details right.

 <p>
  Perhaps the most impressive thing about MooshroomShark's
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  temple build is their use of color, which several players in the thread pointed out. It manages to use several bright and bold colors, without ever looking too busy. MooshroomShark claims that they were "trying to use mangrove, sandstone, and red sandstone but then realized that there was space for some terracotta and prismarine patches," while learning that "red sandstone looks really good with resin, mangrove red looks nice with sandstone, and green blocks in general look nice in a desert." It's always interesting to see a player take some of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's best building blocks and use them to such great effect with this kind of consideration.

  fans have been spoiled by Mojang of late. Earlier this month,

  released the Garden Awakens update, which brought the Pale Garden biome into the game, as well as a new hostile mob: the Creaking. This has been released under Mojang's new approach to
  <em>

  </em>
  updates, with a focus on more regular content drops rather than just one or two per year. This approach gives players more fresh content to enjoy throughout the year, which is why it is proving popular with players at the moment.

  With the offline version being released and receiving over 90 points on the Metacritic score, it felt like quite a feat that we haven't achieved in a while. In terms of when we first released
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  , we were very confident in the quality of the game.

 <p>
  It's been about eight months since the release, and we are entering this awards season. We've been seeing a lot of nominations and wins even, and it feels like we've been sort of appreciated or given this sort of acclaim for what we have done throughout this year. It makes us very proud, and it's a very happy feeling.

  I think the most recognizable would be Cissnei from the
  <em>
   Compilation of Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  appearing in the game. Those who are familiar with the universe might be very excited to see her showing up. When the game was released and I saw the players' reactions, I was really glad to see that people were actually excited to see her.

  And one more thing about player reaction is the ending and Aerith’s fate. Of course, we've been kind of hinting at it, and we've been mentioning it throughout our messaging leading up to the release. Our intent behind that sort of depiction of those final scenes was to connect it because we have a third installment waiting for us in our trilogy, so the way we depicted that series of scenes differs from the original
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  .

  I think, for those who have played the original, we have gotten their interest going, speculating and whatnot. But at the same time, we have seen mixed reactions. Some people reacted differently to how it may be interpreted, so it's very interesting to see people having their own interpretation with
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  and having that sort of struggle to try to speculate what's going on. It's very interesting to see these different reactions, and realizing that people do have different ways that they look at it and think about what has happened.

  : We have this sort of understanding that some people already know what happens in the original story, so with that understanding, we had to approach the way we depicted this loss of Aerith in a different way in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  . With the original
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  , Aerith was sort of suddenly taken away from us, and we kind of leaned into that sort of sudden feeling of loss. Whereas in this iteration, we tried to approach it with the mindset of “we can't really grasp that this is actually happening,” like the reality hasn't hit yet. I think that's how Cloud probably felt and probably how the players felt, so that was the kind of thinking that went into that sort of depiction of Aerith’s fate.

  First and foremost with the whole

  in general. It's good.

 <p>
  Of course, with the
  <em>
   Remake
  </em>
  project being a trilogy, we are expecting a time span of perhaps around 10 years. We want to make sure that we are also continuing to engage with our players, making sure that we are incorporating elements that are familiar, and introducing elements that are something that the players would look forward to that's within the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  universe. We mentioned Cissnei earlier, and then Zack was another one. We looked for characters or settings that are familiar to those who know the series and are something that can reach them easily throughout our
  <em>
   Remake
  </em>
  titles.

 <p>
  With that in mind, our overall vision across
  <em>

  If I were to list what I’m proudest of, one area would be the Gold Saucer and the theme song that we had Loren [Allred] sing,
  <em>
   No Promises to Keep
  </em>
  . Aerith and the Gold Saucer location, I believe, is a scene the fans of the original would be really looking forward to seeing in the
  <em>
   Remake
  </em>
  project. The date event and that whole sequence, as well as the stage play, was not as elaborately done in the original, so we tried to make it more of a spectacle, especially with acting out on the stage and that kind of theater experience. Having our setting and our stage, having Aerith there, and then having that theme song play as the characters take the stage really matched her emotions. And I think we were very successful in bringing that to life.

  For me, I would mention the world map and that sort of overworld that the characters can traverse through. I'm sure players were looking forward to seeing how we would reimagine that overworld of the original into a more modern sort of setup, and we worked really hard in terms of trying to get it to a very high quality and allowing players to explore the field with excitement. I think that could have only been achieved because our development team has been working on not just
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  , but they have on since
  <em>
   Remake
  </em>
  , so they have the skills and knowledge to develop something like that. With the third installment coming up within our trilogy, I think they can continue to strive and endeavor and take on more challenges, so that's why I feel that it's a very exciting area that I wanted to bring up.

  With

  and then

  , we're hoping that the players have seen the evolution of
  <em>

  <em>
   Remake
  </em>
  being more story-driven and then
  <em>
   Rebirth

  having that sort of open field where you can traverse freely. Then, we are interested in producing the Highwind, so in the third title, we're hoping that it will allow for an even more expansive map and players will be able to experience that.

  In terms of the graphic fidelity and the quality that we're offering, the PC version is definitely improved compared to the PlayStation version. Specifically, the lighting processes have been reassessed overall, so we are confident that the way the characters are set in the different scenes, as well as the modeling of the textures, have been improved since the PlayStation version. We are hopeful that the PC version of
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  will be of a graphical quality you can only experience on a PC.

   Hamaguchi:
  </strong>
  If we’re looking at a high-end PC, I think it's higher quality in terms of graphical fidelity. Of course, with the higher end, we had these different offerings. We also have graphical settings where people can configure the options, but at the same time, we do want to reach as many PC players as possible. We're, of course, accommodating and optimizing for people who may not have as high-end of a PC, and we're also striving to be fully functional on the Steam Deck as well.

   Hamaguchi:
  </strong>
  In terms of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth

  , we first released it on the PlayStation 5. When we first released it, many players and fans out there were clamoring for the PC version as soon as possible. We're very excited that we're finally able to have players experience
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  , not just on the PlayStation, so I'm very happy and excited to deliver this to our waiting fans.

  Touching on what Hamaguchi-san said, we do want to have as many people as possible play

  . We're hoping that, with this PC version release, we can gain momentum, and we can continue that momentum until the conclusion of the trilogy. We're hoping to carry those feelings that the players would have throughout, through until the conclusion.

   <em>
    Mech Arena
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a dynamic multiplayer shooter for mobile devices in which you can experience an unforgettable experience of controlling a mech. Having chosen a large robot and equipped it with parts and weapons, you can go to one of the game modes to test your skills and earn currency to buy something more powerful. Victories bring tons of valuable currency rewards and even cases, but if you want to get something for free, use
  <em>
   Mech Arena
  </em>
  promo codes.

 <p>
  While you can get all the best parts and weapons for your mechs by just playing the game, sometimes there's nothing better than a little freebie. Of course, you will not get super powerful items using the codes, but you can get a decent weapon or some money to buy new items quite early on. After all, replenishing your hangar with new components is one of every player's main goals, allowing you to diversify the gameplay significantly. However, reward codes have a limited expiration date, so hurry up and get all of them.

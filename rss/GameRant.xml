  In June 2022, Sony unleashed its new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  . Split into three tiers, the service offers subscribers access to hundreds of games from across PlayStation's history, including PS1 and PSP projects. Along with showing love for the brand's history, PS Plus also covers most genres, be it horror, platformers, RPGs, or strategy. Unsurprisingly, PS Plus does not skimp out on open-world games either.

  Whether searching for a PlayStation exclusive or a third-party juggernaut, PS Plus Extra and Premium should have most players covered. With so many titles to pick from, knowing where to start can be challenging, and that extends to open-world projects. PS Plus covers this genre quite extensively, including everything from first-person shooters to survival and role-playing games. Therefore, let's take a look at the
  <strong>
   best open-world PS Plus games

  Who does not love a good old fashioned zombie apocalypse? PS Plus has a few games built on that concept, including some that are set in open-world environments.
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  might not be the scariest zombie game ever, but it is arguably among the most entertaining on a gameplay level. As Villedor is overrun with infected corpses and humans who want to add to the undead body count, players need to move quickly and wisely; fortunately, they happen to be pretty good at parkour, allowing them to traverse buildings like an action star in a very good 2004 French movie.

 <p>
  Although not necessarily the most lived-in or realistic map,
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  's world is beautifully crafted to encourage free running, ensuring players are nearly always in the midst of doing something slightly awesome and incredibly physical. The game also makes good use of a day and night cycle to shake things up, with the latter coinciding with the introduction of zombie hordes that can quickly overwhelm unprepared players.

  Rockstar has established something of a pattern when it comes to PS Plus releases. The developer's games seem to mostly stick around for a few months, and the selection is typically limited to one or two titles. For example,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's November 2024 PS Plus exit paved the way for
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  's arrival, a switch that might have been more exciting if the latter was not a re-release that left the service in June 2024.

 <p>
  Even if this cycle might start to grow a bit tiresome, ultimately, that is not a reflection on the quality of the projects, which are comfortably among the
  <strong>
   best open-world games on PS Plus
  </strong>
  .
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  has been around for more than a decade, receiving multiple newer versions designed to take advantage of modern tech. At this point, most people have probably experienced the single-player campaign, which is good but maybe not the most replayable story ever. However, simply existing within Los Santos is a delight, be it solo or as part of a crew in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Looking over its history, the open-world genre has had a few landmark releases that marked the start of new eras. In 2015,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  debuted and seemed like an evolution of nearly everything that came before, delivering an expansive dark fantasy world ripe with immersive storytelling that goes beyond just the main quest. Suddenly, optional quests like "kill 10 goblins" became outdated and undesired, being replaced by thoughtful character-driven stories that enhance the project's overall world-building.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  is one of those games that anyone remotely interested in open-worlds or RPGs has likely already experienced, so its arrival on PS Plus might not be that exciting for them. However, Sony's service has the PS5 version, which comes with a few tweaks and QOL adjustments to provide the best console experience. Consequently, if someone's exposure to
  <em>
   Wild Hunt
  </em>
  is limited to the PS4 iteration, they might wish to give the updated version a try. For those who have yet to play this game, nothing is stopping them now.

  The PS4's swan song as Sony's main console,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  transports players back in time to the 13th century as the Mongols invade Japan's Tsushima Island. After failing to stop the invasion and almost meeting his end, Jin Sakai goes on a quest to recruit fighters that could help turn the tide of battle.

  <em>

  's open-world is gorgeous, be it on the PS4 or the PS5. Tsushima Island is lavish, varied, and breathtaking. The same can also be said about Iki Island, the location of the expansion that is included in the Director's Cut. Within this map, players can look forward to engaging in intense samurai-themed battles and decent side quests with memorable NPCs.

  Debuting in 2011,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  was a massive hit right out of the gate, and its popularity has not waned over the last decade. The
  <em>
   Special Edition
  </em>
  is the definitive way to experience Bethesda's masterpiece on consoles, as it improves the visuals and provides support for mods (which have played a huge part in extending the RPG's lifespan).

 <p>
  <em>
   Skyrim

  's open-world approaches perfection as it encourages exploration and discovery. The main storyline is fine, but the game's success lies in its immersive locations, customization options, and character writing. Even as the years continue to pass,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  still comes across as a big deal, and its addition to PS Plus Extra makes the service seem far more complete.

  PS Plus Extra has a plethora of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games, including fairly recent releases such as
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  . Subscribers can readily spend half a year playing through the franchise's PS Plus projects, allowing them to explore a wide range of historical worlds. Picking a favorite will likely come down to a person's preferred setting; someone might gravitate toward
  <em>
   Syndicate
  </em>
  's UK aesthetic or feel more at home in
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  ' Ancient Egypt. The latter is a good entry point since the game acts as something of a soft reboot, along with having one of the franchise's
  <strong>
   best open-worlds
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  However,
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  should not be ignored either, especially since the game stands on its own quite well. Set during the height of piracy,
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  takes place in the West Indies, a map filled with diverse locations, three central cities, and lots to discover. The campaign quickly puts the player behind the wheel of a ship and gets them out on the water, encouraging them to explore to their heart's content.
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  is, first and foremost, a pirate game rather than an
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  sequel, and this helps differentiate it from everything that came before and after.

  PS Plus has Batman fans well-fed. Rocksteady's full
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  trilogy,
  <em>
   Arkham Origins
  </em>
  , and the maligned
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  are available on the Premium tier; meanwhile, Extra-level subscribers can play
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Gotham Knights
  </em>
  . While the latter has some positives that make it not a complete write-off, the former is undoubtedly the superior package, and it is not particularly close. In 2015,
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  garnered some controversy due to its terrible PC launch and the heavy inclusion of the Batmobile, resulting in a positive reception that did not quite live up to
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  's best-of-all-time standards.

 <p>
  Nevertheless,
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  is an impressive achievement, and it features arguably gaming's best rendition of Gotham to date. Even nearly a decade later, the game's open-world remains a sight to behold – it is visually striking, dense with architecture, and dripping in style and personality. Putting aside the polarizing Batmobile sections,
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  is generally fantastic and features the deepest combat system in the franchise.

  PS Plus has three
  <em>
   Saints Row
  </em>
  games:
  <em>
   Saints Row 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Saints Row 4
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Gat Out of Hell
  </em>
  . Despite falling within the same franchise, all three games are fairly different from each other.
  <em>
   Saints Row 4
  </em>
  and its spin-off,
  <em>
   Gat Out of Hell
  </em>
  , are unapologetically over-the-top to the point that they bear almost no resemblance to reality. They play somewhat similar to
  <em>
   Crackdown
  </em>
  , and they cast players as superhero-style characters who have abilities that make most of the conventional components of an open-world game like vehicles and weapons obsolete.
  <em>
   Saints Row 4
  </em>
  is fun, provided players know what they are getting into.

 <p>
  On the other hand,
  <em>
   Saints Row 2
  </em>
  is more down to earth, while nevertheless leaning into parody and comedic territory. Set in Stillwater, the story tasks the protagonist with reforming the Saints, which naturally means they will need to take on other gangs that have gotten a foothold in the city. Even if it is not as absurd as later entries in the franchise, the sandbox game still gives players all the tools they need to spread mayhem on the street. It just happens to be accompanied by a pretty good story and some great characters.

  Insomniac's
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  is arguably the Wall-Crawler's greatest game, although it does have stiff competition from a few older titles. Unfortunately, the 2018 release is not available on PS Plus Extra, having been removed in May 2023; that said, superhero fans yearning to swing through New York City can jump into
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  , a spin-off that maintains the main entry's high standard of quality.

 <p>
  Even though it ties into
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  in a few ways,
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  can be treated as a standalone experience since it has a fairly self-contained story. As its subtitle suggests, the game swaps Peter Parker for Miles, who is still in his infancy as a hero. Both games do splendid jobs of recreating New York City, and while it is not overly packed with memorable side content, the open-world is nevertheless fun to explore due to
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  ' satisfying movement. Compared to other games of this ilk, Insomniac's spin-off is on the short side as it can be readily completed in under 10 hours, which is a decent enough length for a PS Plus game.

  By the time 2004 rolled around, Naughty Dog's
  <em>
   Jak &amp; Daxter
  </em>
  franchise has morphed into a very different beast. While still utilizing platforming as a core mechanic,
  <em>
   Jak 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  greatly ramped up the action and replaced
  <em>
   The Precursor Legacy
  </em>
  's (fairly) linear levels with larger and more open-ended areas.
  <em>
   Jak 3
  </em>
  really emphasizes its free-roaming element, encouraging players to explore its two cities and wasteland as much as possible.

 <p>
  Compared to its predecessors,
  <em>
   Jak 3
  </em>
  can come across as unfocused and disjointed; however, it is still one of the better action-adventure games on the PS2. As far as its open-world is considered,
  <em>
   Jak 3
  </em>
  's map is not nearly as expansive or diverse as some of its high-profile contemporaries like
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3

  . That said, the core gameplay is strong enough to keep things interesting for the relatively short campaign.

  A Hideo Kojima project is always going to be something special, and
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  's bizarre reveal and early trailers instantly made that apparent. Set in a post-apocalyptic version of the United States, players portray Sam, a person charged with traveling across the country delivering packages and establishing communication points.

   Death Stranding

  Set in Washington D.C., Ubisoft's title envisions a post-apocalyptic alternate reality filled with warring factions and nature-covered landmarks. The series has quite a realistic presentation, although the sequel is slightly more colorful than its predecessor.
  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  has plenty of multiplayer-focused content, including PvP and an extensive endgame, but the story can be played solo and experienced as a single-player game.

  All the

  games on PS Plus Premium are worth playing. While Cole's entries are highly rated,
  <em>
   Second Son

  tends to get overlooked due to its (relatively) early release in the PS4's lifecycle. Despite coming out within a year of the console's launch,
  <em>
   Infamous: Second Son

  is still one of the best-looking games on the PS4, and its iteration of Seattle is incredible.

  Although hardly hated,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  launched to a fairly meek response compared to other PS4 exclusives, which caused the game to slip by the wayside after a while. Nowadays, Bend Studio's release is relatively forgotten, and while garnering some online support, it hardly seems destined to become a modern cult classic. By 2019, open-world games had grown so commonplace that they were threatening to become tried; meanwhile, zombie stories had already faced some backlash due to overexposure. Basically,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  was fighting an uphill battle from the start, and debuting with a myriad of technical issues certainly did not help. The story can also be difficult to get into since the protagonist, Deacon St. John, starts out as rather unlikable, and he does not really improve until a good few hours into the campaign.

  If someone looks past
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  's uneven reputation and pushes through the narrative's slow early moments, they will eventually find themselves playing a refreshingly intense open-world experience. The game's main selling point is its zombie hordes, and a run-in with these armies of Freakers never fails to be exciting and terrifying. Although it might not seem that original,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  's world is fairly impressive, and it is filled with minor details that provide context for society's current situation. The project does a good job of populating its map with small events that add an element of spontaneity, and this goes beyond just zombies as there are plenty of humans running about as well.

  An expansive game cut from the same cloth as
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  is all about freedom. Players are dropped into a vast sci-fi sandbox and mostly allowed to do what they want and create whatever they desire, as long as they have the right resources and the will to stitch them all together. Yes, they can bring to life starships, space stations, and satellites, all the while exploring procedurally generated planets. While ambitious and unique,
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  is peculiar and might not be exactly what most people crave from an open-world release. The game is a traditional sandbox, in the sense that players will need to use the available tools to create their own fun.

  Honestly,
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  can be frustrating, particularly in the opening few hours. The game has a lot of mechanics and does not always do a fantastic job of teaching them, and the initial experience can be overwhelming. That said, players can play through a few tutorials (called scenarios) that teach some of the basics, and newcomers will want to work their way through these options before jumping into a custom game. Also,
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  can be played both offline or online, and multiplayer certainly enhances the overall package; that said, a solo run can be more carefree, at least initially.

  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  is a borderline open-world project since players won't have access to the full map at once, although they are free to rampage through a specific area while they are in it. Consequently, the campaign is a bit more restrictive than most releases in the genre, all the while still offering thrills associated with it. More importantly,
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  is simply a fun time. Cast as a normal goose, players are unleashed on an ill-prepared English village, with their goal being to annoy people and ruin a few days. That's largely it. The goose has a few objectives they need to accomplish in each area, which provides players with some direction on how to proceed. Otherwise, they can do whatever they want, and they are encouraged to explore the sandbox and cause as much havoc as a goose can cause.

  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  does not take itself very seriously and has a strong sense of humor. Silly as the concept sounds, the game works because it is fairly grounded, at least in the sense that this scenario could realistically play out in quaint villages. The setting is quite idyllic, making it prime for an influx of mayhem caused by a mischievous animal. Unlike many traditional open-world projects,
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  can be completed in a few hours and has very little "fluff" content. This makes it an ideal candidate to slot in between lengthier games that take weeks or months to complete.

  <em>
   City Undercover
  </em>
  tends to be cited as
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  's take on
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  , and while its world is nowhere near as stuffed with content as most of Rockstar's later releases, this comparison is not unfounded either. Lego City's design emphasizes variety, offering a wide selection of districts that each have their own flavor. The side quests and optional activities are relatively rudimentary and traditional for a
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  game, but the city itself is fun and relaxing to explore. The main story is also a blast, playing out like an action blockbuster ripped right out of the '80s.
  <em>
   Lego City Undercover
  </em>
  might be the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus Extra open-world game
  </strong>
  for kids, and older players could get a kick out of it too.

  PS Plus Extra has a couple of
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  games, including the most recent entry. Although not especially well-received,
  <em>
   Far Cry 6
  </em>
  has the best gunplay in the franchise so far, and its open-world is impressively big. If someone has never played a
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  project, they will likely have a blast with the sixth entry since one of its main criticisms is its map's visual similarities to its numbered predecessor.
  <em>
   Far Cry 3 Classic Edition
  </em>
  is also a decent option, but the beloved game shows its age by this point.

 <p>
  <em>
   Far Cry Primal
  </em>
  takes place during an era when (gaming) conflicts were solved with bows and clubs rather than machine guns. The prehistoric setting was a refreshing change of pace in 2016, and that is still the case all these years later. While not a full-blown survival experience,
  <em>
   Primal
  </em>
  incorporates more elements from the genre than the license's modern main entries, and it strikes a nice balance between a traditional
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  experience and a more experimental adventure.

  PS Plus Extra has
  <em>
   Just Cause 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  , two games that launched to fairly mixed receptions. The latter is largely regarded as the most disappointing entry in the series due to offering more limited destruction, while the former's negativity stems from its underbaked launch state. However, technical issues aside,
  <em>

  </em>
  serves as a prime example of just how fun a sandbox experience can be.

  A dedicated
  <em>
   <strong>
    Starfield
   </strong>
  </em>
  player online has managed to reach Level 1000 in Bethesda's RPG, showing incredible dedication to grinding out their character. They completed this incredible feat in 1100 hours, which is a lot of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  played since its release last year.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's release, gamers have been experiencing the title in their own way. In typical Bethesda fashion, the game gives players the reins to play however they want. If players want to grind all the way to Level 1000, they can do that. It has been cool to see how players have been using this freedom in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  in the period since its launch. There was even one
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  player who developed a ridiculously efficient intro strategy, with their gaming centered on making certain parts of the sci-fi RPG easier. Bethesda games typically keep players entertained for years after their release, and there's no reason to suggest
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  will be any different in this regard.

  Redditor Putrid_Level_621 shared their epic achievement, after reaching Level 1000 in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  after 1100 hours of playtime. Hilariously, the character has amassed a spare 677
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  skill points, and there's a reason for that. According to Putrid_Level_621, Level 326 is the point where all skills are maxed out, and skill points serve no extra purpose beyond this. When asked how they managed to grind to Level 1000, Putrid_Level_621 explained, "I played normally up to around level 450, building lots of outposts. Then I decided to try and reach level 500, then 600, and eventually level 1000. After a certain point, the only way to gain levels was by crafting vytininium fuel rods."

  While sharing their achievement, Putrid_Level_621 also revealed some fascinating stats about their playthrough of the game. 44203 in-game days have passed (keeping count, that's over 121 years), and they've explored 3515 locations in total. They've also found 43,571,440
  <em>
   Starfield

  credits, surely making them one of the richest Spacefarers around. Their playthrough saw 5856 people and 6636 creatures killed, which somehow seems low given the absurd length of the playthrough.

 <p>
  With the release of
  <em>
   Starfield: Shattered Space
  </em>
  getting a mixed reception from players, much like the base game, it remains to be seen what Bethesda's plan is for the IP moving forward. The studio currently has a stacked slate with
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  and a potential
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  sequel, so more
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  could be a long time away. It would certainly be interesting to see Bethesda take another crack at the franchise, but there are many players who understandably would prefer more of the developer's previous offerings.

  . But by far Lara Croft's most memorable cameo this year came in July, with the hero appearing as a new playable Survivor in the asymmetrical horror game
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  alongside some unique Perks that reference her distinct tomb-raiding abilties.

  Alongside all of her cameos, Lara Croft has also starred in a few of her own franchise projects. The Aspyr-developed
  <em>
   Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered
  </em>
  launched back in February of this year, taking the beloved original
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  trilogy and giving it a fresh coat of paint, some revamped controls, some quality-of-life improvements, and a handful of new gameplay mechanics and features.

  Just last month, Lara Croft received an animated adaptation, with
  <em>
   Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft
  </em>
  hitting Netflix in October. This 8-episode series takes place in the same continuity as Crystal Dynamics'
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  Survivor Trilogy, taking place shortly after the events of 2018's
  <em>
   Shadow of the Tomb Raider
  </em>
  . Hayley Atwell – of MCU fame – voices Lara in this adaptation.

  While
  <em>

  </em>
  received a solid 75 on Metacritic,
  <em>
   Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft
  </em>
  didn't fare quite as well, with the animated Netflix series sitting at a 65 on the same site. That said, both
  <em>
   Tomb Raider

  projects seem to have been successful enough, as Aspyr is getting ready to release a
  <em>

  trilogy for next year and
  <em>
   The Legend of Lara Croft

  has been renewed for a second season.

  After all of Lara Croft's cameos over the last few years, and after the recent Netflix show and remastered trilogy, it feels like
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  is slowly creeping its way back into the spotlight. But it isn't there yet, and while
  <em>
   Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered
  </em>
  will likely do a good job of keeping the franchise in the public consciousness, it's going to take something a bit bigger to give
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  the push it needs to enter a new golden age.

 <p>
  Back in 2022, Crystal Dynamics announced that a new
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  was in development and that it would attempt to unify all of the franchise's timelines. Earlier this year, the studio revealed its new design for Lara Croft. But there's still no official reveal on the horizon for the next
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  entry, and this recent resurgence is the perfect opportunity to finally deliver one.

  Sometimes, the dungeons in
  <em>

  can be massive, to the point where players need multiple parties or a guide to go through these experiences. For the most part, these huge dungeons justify their presence in the story and usually lead to a pivotal story moment that is amazing for fans to behold.

  Ultimecia's reveal as the true main villain of the game may be rather hurried, but that does give players an excuse to explore one of the best final dungeons in the series' history.

  A player's commands are locked until they defeat Ultimecia's eight minions, giving them the strength they need to take on the final boss. The party is split into two and must explore in tandem to make progress and reach the end of this surreal dungeon, where they encounter Ultimecia in one of
  <em>

  's best boss rushes.

  A challenging dungeon that players must get through to reach the Crystal World, Memoria can be a daunting place to explore if players aren't strong enough to beat the many bosses standing in their way. Zidane and Co. should have a ton of abilities and great equipment that let them blast through this area in style.

  It takes a while, but beating down the six bosses present in Memoria allows players to beat Kuja for good. It's a lengthy trek but a satisfying one for players who have fallen in love with this game and can't wait to save the world with their lovable party of adventurers.

  's unique non-linear approach in the second half of the game means that players can technically head to Kefka's Tower from the very moment they regain their airship. However, given that the tower requires three parties to traverse, it's recommended that players have at least twelve characters to choose from before they head to this final area.

  Kefka's Tower is massive and features some of the game's strongest enemies, with each party member having to deal with a deity in the Warring Triad before they can take on Kefka. It's a long and rewarding trek that makes for a great way to end a player's adventure through what is arguably the best
  <em>
   Final Fantasy

  game of all time.

  The

  In an early example of roguelike design, each floor in this dungeon is randomly chosen from six layouts, with each floor featuring a puzzle and a time limit. Completing the puzzle lets players earn a Blue Seal while failing causes them to get the red one instead. The final boss' strength depends on the kind of seals players have, and players may potentially have to go through ten floors before reaching the deepest part of the labyrinth and facing off against Chronodia, the game's hardest superboss.

 <p>
  The Omega Ruins is an optional dungeon in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  that features some unique mechanics and some of the game's hardest enemies. Not only is this a great place to grind if players want to take on the Dark Aeons and Penance, but it also harbors two bosses of its own that are a ton of fun to tackle.

 <p>
  It's also a lengthy dungeon where a single misstep can be costly for the players. As long as they keep their wits about them, the party should be able to get through this optional area before eventually taking on Ultima and Omega Weapon.

  Gralea may not be a dungeon per se, but it sure feels like one when Noctis is separated from his allies and must go through this area with nothing but the Ring of the Luciii, which took ages to kill enemies before a patch that rectified this problem.

  Back when the game had launched, players hated Chapter 13 for its boring combat and a lengthy trek across uninteresting environments that was a nightmare to deal with at times. Thankfully, players who want to skip this section altogether can control Gladio and Ignis instead to enjoy a shorter and more satisfying route through the Imperial Capital.

      <title>Astroneer: Glitchwalkers - How to Start DLC</title>

 <p>
  The new DLC for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Astroneer
   </strong>
  </em>
  has had a mixed reception so far, though there's no denying that there is plenty of content for players to wade through. Exploring a new system, a unique questline, the return of storms, and a mysterious rival, there's a lot to unpack in
  <em>
   Astroneer: Glitchwalkers
  </em>
  . Whether you like what you find is another matter all together.

 <p>
  The question, however, is when can you start the Glitchwalkers DLC? The new system isn't a part of the space that players normally traverse, it's actually something of an alternate dimension that players can visit.

  The earliest point that players can start the Glitchwalkers DLC is
  <strong>
   after activating the core of any planet
  </strong>
  , thus completing the mission
  <strong>
   "A Core Concept."
  </strong>
  If players start a new game, a new quest, called "Is This Thing On?" will appear, neatly leading into the DLC questline.

 <p>
  However, players can access the DLC on an old save as well. The same
  <strong>
   quest will appear in their mission log
  </strong>
  if they've completed "A Core Concept." There are no compatibility issues that players need to worry about, at least not unless they have an ancient save file that they haven't opened for years.

  The first thing to do in order to reach the new system is to complete "A Core Concept," which involves unlocking the core of any of the seven planets. The easiest to unlock is the starting planet, Sylva. Once this quest is completed, a new quest will appear in the player's mission log, called "Is This Thing On?"

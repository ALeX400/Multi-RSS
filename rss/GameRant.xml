  Each of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Luma Island
   </strong>
  </em>
  's biomes has a special area which you need to reach in order to explore the entire biome. The Forest has the secret Beach, the Mountain has its peak, and the Jungle has the Volcano, which you can climb to the top of. Since the Jungle is the last biome you need to unlock though, it can be challenging to know how to get to the top of this intimidating peak.

  Finding where to start is a bit of a challenge in and of itself, but you also need to navigate around swirling pools and rivers of lava in order to reach the top. The rocks which act as stepping stones periodically move as you get higher, and if you aren't sure how to get around, it's very easy to fall into the lava on the way up. This guide is here to help. Here's
  <strong>
   how you can get to the top of the Volcano in

  Looking at the Volcano on the map, you can start the trek up on the Western side of it. You need to pass a river of mud and go underneath a stone arch to reach the beginning of the path, so it may take some Jungle exploring before you find it. You'll know you're there when you reach a large waterfall of lava and see some broken-up stone pieces you can use to navigate across the lava river. You need to be quick when crossing, though, because the stones will disappear into the lava soon after you step over them.
 </p>
 <p>
  From here, you just need to follow a fairly linear pathway in order to reach the top. The challenge is that you'll need to continuously cross over lava rivers, and the pathways of stones between them get more complicated the higher you get.

  After you cross the first lava river, you'll come across another. This time, though, you'll need to hop around stones that are moving around:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Step on the first moving stone and wait until it touches the second, which you can easily step on.
  </li>
  <li>
   The second stone will touch three others. You need to cross to the left stone closest to the flowers.
  </li>
  <li>
   Wait until the left stone moves to the small piece of ground with the fire-breathing statue and move toward it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Walk onto the stone on the other side of this statue to move forward.
  </li>
  <li>
   This stone will touch two others, and you need to get onto the one closest to the rock wall to move forward.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you reach the broken stone pieces, quickly walk right away from the offering statue and continue up the path.
  </li>
 </ol>

  When you've crossed this river, you can follow the path right to find a chest. However, to continue up the Volcano, you need to go in the opposite direction and find the lava river that has two dead trees next to it. Here's how to cross:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Cross the broken stones quickly to reach the first moving stone.
  </li>
  <li>
   Wait until the moving stone reaches the ground on the other side and hop off.
  </li>
  <li>
   Look for the second moving stone and get onto it from the ground.
  </li>
  <li>
   Follow the moving stones until you reach the other side of the hill, and get off to step on the ground again.
  </li>
  <li>
   Step over the broken stones, but you need to time it correctly so you don't miss the moving stone at the end.
  </li>
  <li>
   Continue climbing onto the moving stones until you reach the third set of broken stones.
  </li>
  <li>
   Time it correctly so you can climb over the broken stones to reach the last moving stone at the end of the river.
  </li>
 </ol>

  Once you've passed this river, the next one is just over the hill and is much smaller than what you've encountered so far. These are the steps you need to take to cross it:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Quickly cross the broken stone to reach the first moving stone.
  </li>
  <li>
   From here, you need to use the next two moving stones to reach the broken stones on the other end.
  </li>
  <li>
   Time is very important here, as you need to quickly reach the next moving stone that appears at the end of the broken stone pathway.
  </li>
  <li>
   Be patient. You can stand on the moving stones as long as you need to.
  </li>
 </ol>

 <p>
  That's all it takes to cross the next river, so now you just need to follow the pathway up again until you reach the next one. This is also a smaller-sized river with a large boulder in the middle, and here's how to cross:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Take the first moving stone, which will pass the large boulder in the middle.
  </li>
  <li>
   You can reach the second moving stone from the first, but if you want to be safe, you can mine the boulder in the middle of the river to create new ground for you to stand on.
  </li>
  <li>
   Take the second moving stone, but you need to quickly move to the third as it passes you because it won't stop.
  </li>
  <li>
   Timing is also important for the next moving stone, as you need to quickly cross broken stones to get to it.
  </li>
  <li>
   The last moving stone will only pass by for a second, and you need to hop onto it as soon as you get the chance.
  </li>
  <li>
   Quickly move across the last few broken stone pieces to reach the ground on the other side.
  </li>
 </ol>

  The next two lava rivers are fairly simple to cross, as they all have a fairly linear path to follow across some broken stone pieces and moving stones. The third river after the last, and seventh lava river overall, is where there's a bit of a puzzle to solve again:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Look for the first moving stone, which will stop at the end of the long pathway of broken stones. You need to time it correctly so you can jump on this moving stone without falling into the lava.
  </li>
  <li>
   Hop onto the second moving stone when the first stops next to it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now it's all about timing again, because you need to go across some broken stones to reach the next moving stone. Make sure you only get off the moving stone when you are sure you can reach the next one.
  </li>
  <li>
   From here, it's a fairly linear path to the other side of the lava river.
  </li>
 </ol>

  The next lava river you find also has stationary stones which you need to manipulate in order to cross to the other side. Here's the pattern you need to follow:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   When you step on the stationary stone in front of you, it will start to shake and go into the lava. Step on it once and quickly move back to the ground where you came from.
  </li>
  <li>
   The stone is now on the opposite side of the ground. Step on it again, but this time, time it so you can move forward onto the first moving stone.
  </li>
  <li>
   When the moving stone touches the ground on the other side of where you started, hop off.
  </li>
  <li>
   Before you move on to the second moving stone, backtrack slightly and quickly hop onto the second stationary stone which was across from the first one.
  </li>
  <li>
   Head back to the ground, where you can now move to the next moving stone using the stationary stone that changed positions.
  </li>
  <li>
   Follow the moving stone to the ground on the other side.
  </li>
 </ol>

  The next puzzle is a bit of a mix of everything you've had to navigate so far:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Step on the first stationary stone and quickly hop off again so it changes position.
  </li>
  <li>
   It should now be in front of the short broken stone pathway. Time it correctly so you can step from this pathway onto the first moving stone.
  </li>
  <li>
   Wait a bit on this moving stone, and quickly step onto the second stationary stone to change its position. Get back on the moving stone that you just stepped off of.
  </li>
  <li>
   Hop off the moving stone onto the small piece of ground in the middle of the pool.
  </li>
  <li>
   You'll find yourself in front of a pathway made of stones that periodically sink into the lava. Wait for them to come up, then head toward the next stationary stone near the lava waterfall. Step on it quickly and come back to the ground next to it.
  </li>
  <li>
   You should now be able to follow that same pathway to the other side of the pool.
  </li>
 </ol>

  Once you've reached the next lava river, you'll see another stationary stone as a starting point. And, as you'd expect, you'll need to once again manipulate them in order to move forward:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Quickly step on and off the first stationary stone to change its position.
  </li>
  <li>
   It should now be closer to the lava waterfall running into this pool. Use it to cross the sinking stones to the small rocks on which you can safely stand on the other side.
  </li>
  <li>
   Cross the rocks and quickly step on and off the stationary stone at the very end of this pathway.
  </li>
  <li>
   Use the newly positioned stationary stone to quickly cross onto the first moving stone.
  </li>
  <li>
   Before you go to the second moving stone, wait for the stone you're currently on to make its way to another stationary stone in the middle of the pool. Quickly step on and off this stationary stone.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now you can simply follow the rest of the pathway to the other side of the lava pool.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Once you've crossed this river and a last bridge of broken stones, you'll have successfully reached the top of the Volcano in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Luma Island
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Here, you should find a chest containing a Luma Egg and the schematic to build the Castle. Like the schematics you find in the other biomes, you can build the Castle on your Farm and use it to fast travel to the Jungle. Climbing down is also a lot easier, because you can find several ladders which lead you back down—just keep an eye out for them as you follow the path.

      Super Mario 64 paintings by a gamer's mother showcase iconic in-game locations with stunning detail.

 <p>
  A gamer has shared an image of four incredible
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario 64
   </em>
  </strong>
  paintings that their mother gifted them for Christmas.
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  remains one of the most recognized titles in the series, and these paintings effectively represent their in-game counterparts.
 </p>
 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  has been a fan-favorite since it was released, it has maintained a level of success with Nintendo and in its speed-running community. The game was added to Nintendo Switch Online in 2021 alongside other popular N64 games like
  <em>
   Star Fox 64
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Yoshi's Story
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  . While the N64 was a success for its time, the Nintendo Switch has surpassed its sales numbers by a large margin. This addition to the online service offered
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  a new audience of gamers who may not have even been born when the game was originally released back in 1996. One gamer recently shared some canvas paintings inspired by the game created by their mom that turned out beautifully.
 </p>
 <p>
  One gamer on Reddit recently shared five images of
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  canvas paintings their mother made before Christmas. The paintings represent different worlds from the game, including
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  's Bob-Omb Battlefield, Cool, Cool Mountain, Whomp's Fortress, and Tiny-Huge Island. One image shows the four paintings together as they may be displayed on a wall, while the subsequent photos focus on each individual painting. The details of each canvas painting are highlighted in each image that features one, with the depth of Cool, Cool Mountain's snowmen accentuated by shading, the mystical nature of Whomp's Fortress emphasized by the vibrant colors, and Bob-Omb Battlefield's sky contrasted by the row of Bob-Ombs at the bottom.

  These Super Mario 64 Paintings Have Been Realized on Canvases
 </h2>
 <p>
  Bob-Omb Battlefield will be the first of these paintings that players can enter in the game, while Cool, Cool Mountain, and Whomp's Fortress require one star to access, and Tiny-Huge Island isn't unlocked until players complete Bowser in the Fire Sea. As
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  requires more stars to be collected to enter the higher-difficulty levels, players often jump through these paintings repeatedly. The most widely recognized of these paintings is Bob-Omb Battlefield, which is the first painting that players will jump into after launching the game. Before gaining access to this painting in the game, players can explore Peach's Castle and the surrounding area, but their access is limited. Though many gamers responded to the Reddit post to celebrate the paintings, others flocked to the post to compliment the artist.

  As the Nintendo Switch 2 has been heavily rumored, it may not be long before another

  games,
  <em>
   Super Mario 64

  may not be surpassed in fanfare for many years.

  Surviving in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Green Hell
   </em>
  </strong>
  isn't easy. The jungle is not a friendly place. From jaguars that will tear players apart in seconds to a hostile tribe that will attack on sight, this game isn't for the faint-hearted. As players try to survive, they'll need a few things like water, food, tools, weapons, and a place to call home.
 </p>
 <p>
  Building a shelter in
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  is important. There are plenty of places that the player can build a base in; however, some locations are better than others. The perfect location needs to have a good balance to provide players with natural resources, plenty of space to build, and very little enemy interference. There are lots of places to set up shop, but the ones featured below are among the
  <strong>
   best base locations
  </strong>
  in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Updated January 3, 2025 by Benjamin Joe:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   The original article covered the majority of the best locations to set up camp in Green Hell. However, it didn't mention the features that make an area a viable place to call home. Also, some of the entries could do with a little more detail to help newer players understand some of the basics of survival.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The game itself has a lot of mechanics that work away in the background. New players loading up for the first time might be a little overwhelmed as they'll need to learn a lot of things fast to survive.
 </p>
 <h3 id="what-makes-an-area-good-for-building">
  What Makes An Area Good For Building?
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are a few things that players should keep an eye out for when it comes to seeking out a place to set up a camp. The main ones are food and water. A place that has nearby resources is great as it means that players won't have to stray too far from their camp to find something to eat and drink. After that, flat land is useful. While it is possible to set up a base on rugged terrain, building is much easier if there's a relatively flat open clearing for players to build off.
 </p>
 <p>
  The final important thing that players should keep in mind when looking for a base location is hostile enemies. In
  <em>
   Green Hell
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  almost everything and everyone is trying to kill the player. From hostile and poisonous animals to local tribesmen who don't take too kindly to strangers, surviving isn't easy. Before selecting a location, it's worth doing some scouting to check for signs of nearby enemy activity.

 <p>
  This is the camp featured in the story mode. While the camp itself won't be there if the player is on survival mode, the flat land and clean drinking source will still be present.
  <strong>
   The river that runs alongside this location is a source of fresh water
  </strong>
  , and it is safe to drink from. The area is pretty large, with plenty of flat land to build on.
 </p>
 <p>
  This base location makes for the perfect early-game home. It can even be expanded to become a more elaborate home fit with all of the amenities that the jungle has to offer. Since this is the starting area for the story mode, there aren't a lot of enemies that tend to wander through this location, which means that the player can live out their days in relative peace.

   : Good Visibility Over The Surrounding Areas, Nearby Animals That Can Be Hunted For Food
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  At first glance, this area doesn't seem that interesting. However, if the player wanders towards the top of the large hill, next to a pathway, there's a nice open area that's great for building a small base. While there isn't a lot of room in this location, the fact that it gives the player a decent amount of visibility over the surrounding area makes it a great place to call home.
 </p>
 <p>
  With some clever placement, it is possible to build quite an elaborate base in this area. There are normally a few animals that roam around this location, which makes hunting for food a little bit easier.

 <p>
  Toward the western side of the map sits a nice open clearing on the top of a hill. This area offers the player great all-around views of the terrain below. Not only that but slightly northeast of this area is a large body of water. This is ideal for both hydration and food. This water source is often visited by jungle creatures, hence it being a great place to hunt for food. Also,
  <strong>
   there are coconut trees here, which are great for collecting water
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  As for the build area, similar to the previous entry, it's not particularly big. However, the area is flat, making it a fairly easy place to build. While it may not be the largest location available, it is just big enough to fit all of the essential items that a player will need to survive jungle life.

   : Most Of The Core Structures Are Already Built, Nearby Water Source And Food Sources
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  North of the previous entry lies an abandoned fishing station. This is a pre-built structure that has some good things sitting around for the player to use. There are a couple of beds, including a hammock, there's a place to set up a campfire, and there's even a functional water filter that players can use.
 </p>
 <p>
  This location is perfect for those who prefer moving into a pre-made structure over making their base from scratch. Since the fishing station is right on the edge of a river, players will have no issues keeping stocked up with water and food. The existing shack provides the player with some cover from any possible attackers that come from the south. Also, since it's right by a river, it gives the player a quick escape route should they need to leave in a hurry.

 <p>
  This small abandoned village is very close to the abandoned fishing station. While it doesn't have as much going for it, the place is perfect as a backup base. It is located halfway up a hill, which gives players a good view of any possible attacks coming from below. In the small village, there is a campfire and a bamboo smoker that the player can use, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is plenty of bamboo in this area, which is great for crafting. Also, since it is just a stone's throw away from the abandoned fishing station, the player won't need to worry about water, as they will have an infinite source nearby.

 <p>
  This location is tucked up at the base of some cliffs. The whole area is covered on three sides by these cliffs, meaning that players will only need to worry about enemies coming from one direction. There's a small water source right in the middle of this location, and while there aren't any on-site food sources, there are plenty of animals that roam the nearby areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  This area is both stunning and easy to build in. Since there are large cliffs surrounding the area, players won't have to build a lot in order to turn this place into a livable location.

   : A Water Source Within The Base Area, A Cave That's Fun To Build In
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This area looks like paradise. Unfortunately, while it looks incredible, it does have one drawback: venomous enemies. The cave is a spawn point for scorpions and spiders. These nasty creatures can be deadly, and keeping on top of pest control can be a little bit tedious. However, if the player is willing to put up with the pesky pests, then this location is truly breathtaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a cliff right above the cave, which not only offers the player some protection but it can also be built on to expand the base. As for water, just in front of the cave is a small body that can be boiled and consumed. The land around the cave is also somewhat clear from obstructions, which will allow the player to extend their build further into the jungle.

 <p>
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  originally launched way back in 2013, and over the years, the game has seen many additions, changes, and tweaks to keep gameplay interesting and as fair as possible. However, that doesn't mean
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  isn't without room for improvement.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  , like many games, has a radio that players can listen to whenever they're driving a car or are near a radio in a building. However, players can't listen to it while walking around. Reddit user GovernmentOfficiaI pointed out how odd it is that their player character can wear earbuds but can't actually use them to listen to the radio. Adding this ability seems as though it would be simple enough, and it could help to make doing missions and heists more exciting, as players could select their soundtrack for themselves. This could be especially enjoyable for fans who have loaded the game with their own music and listen to it via Self Radio.

  Many players have pointed out that other games, such as
  <em>
   Watch Dogs 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Saints Row
  </em>
  series entries, and even
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  allow players to listen to the in-game radio stations wherever they like, making
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  something of an outlier. Since players always carry a phone with them, it would make sense to be able to listen to a radio stream, or at least play one's personal tracks. It seems that many fans would enjoy seeing this change, with some saying that they're bored of the soundtrack played during missions, and have resorted to turning off the sound and relying on their own external audio.

  Since the in-game radio can be temporarily listened to via the in-game settings menu as well as mission setup menus, it doesn't seem like it would be tremendously difficult for the team to implement this feature. However, many fans shared doubts that it will ever come to this iteration of
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  recently got a content update that added a new missions, vehicles, and a business to purchase, many feel that the majority of the development team is too busy with getting
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  launched to focus on
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . At the very least, players are expecting to see this as an option in

      <title>7 Best Creepy Good Heroes In Games, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-creepy-good-heroes-games/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Not every hero is valiant, attractive or unproblematic, some are flawed, inconsistent and downright creepy. Categorizing creepy good heroes presents a few issues because, by their very nature, they are contradictory and subvert expectations. Some games position the player as the wonderful heroic weirdo, others have them as an ancillary character who defies initial assumptions. Their general weirdness or creepiness might be off-putting, but they are the characters who come in clutch when the player is at their most desperate.
 </p>

 <p>
  Some of these creepy good heroes might not even seem that creepy at first, but as the player finds out more about them, creepy and disturbing details emerge. They have often made the transition from evil to good or are resisting some intense inner evil. And some just give players the heebie-jeebies. Here’s a ranked list of the best creepy good heroes in video games.

  While it might seem like a stretch to call the Merchant a hero, there are multiple contextual definitions of the word hero. According to Merriam-Webster, a hero can be defined as ‘a mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability’. The Merchant certainly fits that definition.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Merchant turns up in the strangest and most dangerous places in the plagas-infested ruins of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  . Who is he? How did he get here? Are Leon and Ada his only customers? And what on Earth is going on underneath that hood? He often shows up when the player is in desperate need of supplies. But is it heroic if it comes at a price?

  The often blood-drenched Hunter from
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is definitely creepy. Would someone who isn’t creepy go around collecting and consuming umbilical cords? Would they conduct rituals with blood and tomb mold? The means by which they sustain themselves is upsetting at best. The blood ministration treatments that occur in Yharnam and the collection of blood echoes are pretty grim regardless of motive.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Hunter’s status as a hero is what is up for debate. They are certainly the protagonist, but they are arguably more horrific than the creatures they kill. The actions and choices of the player have more say in the good intentions of the character of the Hunter than the embedded narrative. Choosing to help the innocent and to make self-sacrifices for the greater good is certainly heroic. Killing a benign NPC and taking their possessions is less heroic.

  As much as players may adore GLaDOS, there is no denying she is creepy. It doesn’t get much creepier than being a lab rat for a murderous artificial consciousness that can descend from the ceiling in a mess of cables. At the end of
  <em>
   Portal
  </em>
  , the player character is able to ‘kill’ GLaDOS, and she is still very angry about it when she is brought back in
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  GLaDOS has a redemption arc and becomes a hero in
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  , helping the player character to defeat the actual main antagonist of the game. She saves Chell on multiple occasions and directs her through the labyrinthine maze of Aperture Science. Caroline, the woman whose essence was embedded in GLaDOS’s AI, is able to be reasoned with and has a level of compassion for others (which GLaDOS supposedly deletes at the end of the game).

  This delightfully rotund adventurer is one of the shining lights of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . He can be summoned to help with the Starscourge Radahn and Fire Giant fights and is a wonderfully wholesome character in a world that can be extremely brutal. He left his home to become a champion, seeking to learn to be a warrior and undertake gentlemanly combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Alexander attempts to improve himself in one of the creepiest ways on this list. He compacts the dead body parts of brave warriors into his jar. Thus, making him a walking jar of rotting flesh. It’s a bittersweet moment when he challenges the player character to a fight to the death.

  Nick is an invaluable companion and ally to the player character known as the Sole Survivor in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . He’s kind, brave and resilient. Nick Valentine is a prototype Synth created by the institute and has the personality and memories of a ‘pre-war cop’ imprinted on him. His body is in an extreme state of disrepair and his eyes are unnervingly luminous and bright.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a lot of prejudice against synths in the Fallout universe and Nick must manage that prejudice with the complication of having a human consciousness. Tellingly, in a moment of amnesia, he calls his brother and the only other synth of his kind, ‘a plastic-skinned freak’, reflecting the way humans in general see him.

  Rose looks like an angry teenager with a complicated past. That relatively normal exterior belies the strangeness of Rose as a character and the creepy truth of what she really is. Like her mother and father, her body is riddled with the mold (mutamycete) that caused the events of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  . This makes her incredibly powerful but connects her to all manner of grim monsters and bloody spectacles.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a baby, she was separated into pieces and distributed around the village and, as a teenager, she encounters what seem to be clones of herself made by the mold.
  <em>
   The Shadows of Rose DLC
  </em>
  emphasizes the effects of the mutamycete on her body and how it has affected her as a person. The DLC also shows the implications of the collective consciousness of the mold and the way in which it connects everyone exposed to it.

  The psychos in
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  are creepy through no fault of their own. They are victims of horrific experimentation at the hands of Hyperion scientist Dr Benedict. Psychos are an iconic part of the Borderlands series and can make a player's life extremely difficult. Throughout
  <em>
   Borderlands 2,
  </em>
  these crazed, berserker-like bandits throw themselves violently at vault hunters, making Krieg's strange brand of wholesomeness seem all the more out of place in the hostile wastelands of Pandora.
 </p>
 <p>
  Krieg was a victim of the same experiments, but things didn’t quite go according to plan. Rather than succumbing to the gas and Dr Benedict’s disturbing experiments, Krieg’s personality splits in two; the psycho Krieg and the Krieg, who maintains his sanity and is capable of rational thought. Rational Krieg is able to negotiate a moral code with his Psycho self and becomes a valued ally to the core vault hunter group. Unfortunately, Psycho Krieg is in charge of speech, which leads to quotes such as “I powdered my cockatiel for the rib cage slaughter!”. Krieg was made available as a playable character in the
  <em>
   Psycho Pack DLC.
  </em>

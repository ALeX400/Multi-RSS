  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  whisks players away to Feudal Japan, specifically the late Sengoku period. As well as a substantial main story, the game will offer a wealth of side activities for those who wish to engage with them, a staple of the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series.

 <p>
  Game Rant recently spoke with
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' game director Charles Benoit about these side activities and how varied they are. With the activities on offer ranging from relaxing to action-packed, there should be something to cater to all preferences.

  How Assassin's Creed Shadows Approaches Side Activities
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  players can swap between Naoe and Yasuke at practically any time, making it fitting that most side activities can be completed by either. However, some activities are specific to each character or they share a set of side activities that are spread among them. For example, as Benoit detailed, the Kuji-Kiri and The Hidden Trails are specific to Naoe. The Kata and Horse Archery are unique to Yasuke. Benoit described what each of these activities is during our interview:
 </p>
 <h3 id="activities-specifically-for-naoe-or-yasuke">
  Activities Specifically for Naoe or Yasuke
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   "
   <strong>
    The Kuji-kiri
   </strong>
   is a timing and memory challenge that puts you in a meditating environment."
  </li>
  <li>
   "
   <strong>
    The Hidden Trails
   </strong>
   present some parkour and grappling hooks in a natural environment."
  </li>
  <li>
   "
   <strong>
    The Kata
   </strong>
   is where you need to follow a series of fight moves in a certain amount of time"
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    "Horse Archery
   </strong>
   is where you need to aim and shoot at targets on a path with your Bow."
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These are specific to the perspective
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  protagonist, but the others can be done by either Naoe or Yasuke. Sometimes, however, these activities will only be available to one of them or will be easier completed by a specific character. For example, Benoit explained that Shrines are simple, peaceful places for players to pray. That's easiest done by anyone. However, players can find lost pages of scrolls at Temples, which can be done by either character, but when those pages are on a rooftop, Naoe's parkour is necessary. Benoit described each of these more open and available side activities:

 <h3 id="activities-for-either-naoe-or-yasuke">
  Activities for Either Naoe or Yasuke
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   "
   <strong>
    The Shrines
   </strong>
   are a peaceful place where you can pray at different places."
  </li>
  <li>
   "
   <strong>
    The Temples
   </strong>
   are ancient places where some Lost pages of Scrolls are scattered around and you need to collect them. When the Lost pages are on a rooftop, for example, sometimes only Naoe (with her Grappling hook) will be able to get them."
  </li>
  <li>
   "There is also
   <strong>
    the Sumi-e
   </strong>
   where you need to approach some animals silently (in the wild) to paint them and their behavior. You will even be able to hang those paintings in your Hideout."
  </li>
  <li>
   "We have
   <strong>
    the Castles
   </strong>
   , where you need to find the Samurai Daisho, kill them, and loot the Castle legendary chest."
  </li>
  <li>
   "We have
   <strong>
    the Kofun
   </strong>
   , which are either for Naoe or Yasuke; some are caves where you need the Grappling hook, some are old passages that you need to move heavy things around."
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Of these, Benoit personally enjoys the Castles the most, especially when he wants the action inherent to their design. However, when just exploring
  <em>
   AC Shadows
  </em>
  ' open world, Benoit also personally enjoys the Sumi-e the most.
 </p>
 <p>
  While side activities can go a long way in fleshing out
  <em>
   AC Shadows
  </em>
  ' Feudal Japan setting, they must factor into progression and gameplay as well. As Benoit explained, all activities in
  <em>
   AC Shadows
  </em>
  are developed with this in mind, with them not just being fun little check list items for players but ways to develop their character (while also taking in the world). Specifically, Benoit said,
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "All activities in AC Shadows are important for the growth of our two heroes. Each of them builds 'Knowledge,' which unlocks new skills."
  </p>

      It's uncertain whether this will come to fruition, but fans are hopeful.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Avengers: Doomsday
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Secret Wars
   </em>
  </strong>
  directors Joe and Anthony Russo are reportedly open to the concept of adapting the upcoming films into the video game medium, along with potential future entries. There are still no actual plans to create games based on the massively popular Marvel Cinematic Universe films, however, as the Russo brothers continue working on a mobile tie-in for their upcoming film
  <em>
   The Electric State.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Marvel Cinematic Universe is constantly changing and adapting as new entries continue to be released, expanding the multi-billion dollar franchise into a Hollywood powerhouse. While fans await more news about the highly-anticipated upcoming films
  <em>
   Avengers: Doomsday
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Secret Wars
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  many have been left to speculate where else the franchise could go following the films' release.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to
  <em>
   Avengers: Doomsday
  </em>
  directors Joe and Anthony Russo, video games could be a possibility for the future of the MCU, as the brothers recently told Variety that they would be open to adapting the films for PC and console. Of course, they made no mention of any actual plans to do so, and if they did, it would likely be years before fans would see anything concrete, seeing as modern-day game development tends to be a lengthy process.

  This would hardly be the first time the Avengers have shown up in video games, either, as the superhero team already has a storied history within the medium, even as recently as 2020 with
  <em>
   Marvel's Avengers
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  However, that game largely failed to impress critics and eventually had many of its live-service elements stripped down a few years later, leading to a major financial loss for publisher Square Enix.
 </p>
 <p>
  Were video games based on
  <em>
   Avengers: Doomsday
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Secret Wars
  </em>
  to actually happen, it would not be the first time an MCU project saw a direct tie-in, as the studio has attempted to adapt the films in the past as well. In the early days of the franchise, Sega consistently put out video game adaptations of MCU films with titles like
  <em>
   Iron Man
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Captain America: Super Soldier
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  among others.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, these games were generally considered not canon to the MCU films, featuring characters and plot elements not present in the movies on which they are based. Whether or not the same would be true for possible adaptations of
  <em>
   Doomsday
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Secret Wars
  </em>
  remains to be seen, but in any case, there are plenty of other Marvel games like the critically-acclamed
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  to tide over Marvel fans for now.

  As Leon makes his way through the village, castle, and island to rescue Ashley in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 4 Remake
   </em>
  </strong>
  , he encounters a fair share of dangerous enemies, alongside the regular bloodthirsty Ganado. These are the bosses of the game who act as roadblocks in Leon's journey, but before players even get to experience how powerful they are, the first thing that pops out to them is the design.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a boss to come across as truly intimidating and frightening, they need to have an appearance that goes above and beyond in terms of the scare factor, and thankfully, more than a few enemies in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4 Remake
  </em>
  fit this description. From oversized trolls to knife-wielding army mutants, the diversity of these enemies allows for there to be a ton of striking and memorable designs, so with that in mind, here is how they compare in terms of overall quality and attention to detail. Before jumping in, this list will only consider the major bosses in the game, so enemies who are more-so mini bosses, like Salvador and the Bella Twins, will not be counted.

  Admittedly, Krauser's design isn't all that interesting at the beginning of his confrontation with Leon, though his army outfit and red marks covering his face do imply that he's someone who takes great pride in being a warrior. It's really when Krauser sprouts his mutated arm that his design is kicked up a notch. This kind of half-man half-mutant appearance was once seen with William Birkin back in the second game, but because Krauser has more control over his mutation, it makes him an extremely dangerous combatant, and one who certainly looks the part.
 </p>
 <p>
  What also amplifies the design is the many weird and whacky shapes that his mutated arm can take on, turning from a giant spike one moment to a defensive shield the next. Krauser may not have the flashiest look in the game, but his mutated form is still pretty memorable.

 <p>
  The most noticeable aspect of the dreaded El Gigante's appearance is his size. This troll easily towers over Leon when standing upright, and it means that, though the boss itself isn't full of detail from a design perspective, it still manages to feel genuinely terrifying from its impressive stature alone. With that being said, though, there are still a few small features added to his design that highlight what this mutant even is, and how it's treated.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ropes that are firmly strung around its neck, for example, show how this mutant is treated like some kind of animal, being pushed and pulled by the Ganado to any area where an enemy needs to be dealt with. These guys would also show up later in the story donning iron armor to protect themselves, but this design for the El Gigante is by far the most recognizable.

  Though it can be difficult to get a full view of Del Lago, since the monster tends to prefer remaining underwater, this simply means that its appearance is all the more unnerving once players finally get to see it for themselves after it leaps out to bite Leon. Del Lago is a salamander who has been infected by the Las Plaga, meaning they have grown to massive proportions, and also possess a massive jaw packed full of spiky teeth that look more like piledrivers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tail of this boss is so huge that it could have easily knocked Leon off his small boat if Del Lago decided to use it, along with the tentacles sprouting from its back, showing just how far the mutation has spread. To put it simply, this is a great design that will stick with players long after they finish the game, and though it's not the best of Capcom's creativity capabilities, it's nonetheless a haunting monster to look at, which is a testament to its effective design.

  Salazar doesn't exactly come across as very scary or intimidating in his regular form, especially when also considering he tends to prefer letting his loyal servants do all the dirty work for him. However, when he does decide to take matters into his own hands after Leon is about to escape the castle, Salazar fuses with the Plaga to become a giant grotesque monstrosity which is pure nightmare fuel, in a good kind of way.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the front of the design is a large three-way mouth where Salazar can be seen right at the center; his body now being completely disfigured to reflect the ongoing mutation. Additionally, he also grows huge tentacles that shoot out to each side of the room, almost resembling a spider wrapping itself in a web. As far as mutation forms go, this is one of the most creative in the entire game and one that is packed full of intriguing details for players to look out for.

  Despite being the supreme leader of the Ganado army who tries to stop Leon in his tracks throughout the game, Saddler, aside from his mind control, doesn't demonstrate all that much power or strength any time he shows up. In fact, it's not until the very end of the game that he finally decides to unleash his spider-like final form, where he grows four large legs with tough scales covering his entire body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only part of Saddler which is still recognizable is the menacing face seen as the front of the monster, which is a subtle way to indicate just how much the influence of the plaga has overtaken Saddler's mind and soul. It's also just a stunning design because of how wildly creative it is, though there are still a few elements here borrowed from previous villains too, such as the glowing eyes which act as weak points.

  Right off the bat, Mendez's freakish boss design is a real beauty to behold for any fans of body horror out there. While the extension of his ribcage, which now contains small spiky claws, is already eerie enough, the long dangly limbs reaching out from Mendez's back result in a very unique and disturbing look that alters much of the chief's traditional appearance to create something much more horrifying.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, by looking closely at the design of Mendez's appearance, fans may notice it also closely resembles the Los Illumindos symbol, highlighting the chief's unwavering loyalty to the group after he became corrupted by Saddler. At the same time, it also showcases the terrifying ways that the plaga can mutate the human body, with this being one of the most extreme, but memorable examples in the game of a person's body becoming entirely different after succumbing to their underlying power.

  Verdugo, the right-hand man of Salazar, already had a pretty chilling appearance in the original
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  , but Capcom took this to a whole new level with the remake. The glowing red eyes, paired with his giant claws and tail, present Verdugo as a monster who is pretty well-equipped for tearing his enemies to shreds. At the same time, Verdugo's design is a lot more practical than many of the other bosses, with his slimmer appearance allowing him to run, jump, and flip his way around the area even more than Leon can.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are not many scarier sights in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  series than seeing this large menacing creature barging down a hallway to get his hands on Leon, with a lot of the scare factor owing to his absurdly creative and devilish design. It also creates an aura of mystery for Verdugo, since he manages to still look vaguely human in his appearance, which adds even more intrigue to his character and backstory.

  Matthew is a former member of the Devil's Pack whom Henry
  <strong>
   may stumble across naturally
  </strong>
  . This is because he is often waiting on the
  <strong>
   road between Suchdol and Miskowitz
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For an
  <strong>
   exact location
  </strong>
  in their specific playthrough, players can first talk with the
  <strong>
   Bailiff of Miskowitz
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Players should be careful when approaching Matthew and his gang, as they are brigands posing as tax collectors. Despite many dialogue options,
  <strong>
   Matthew cannot be convinced to return
  </strong>
  , and Henry may be in a spot of danger.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-warning">
  <div class="emaki-custom warning" id="custom_block_9">
   <div class="custom_block-content warning">
    <p>
     In some situations, Matthew's gang will attack without an opportunity to talk. So be ready for a fight.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Eventually, Matthew will ask Henry to cough up. If players have gotten exceedingly rich during the first part of
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  , they could choose to simply
  <strong>
   pay him 1000 Groschen
  </strong>
  and be on their way.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Alternatively, the
   <strong>
    best dialogue choice/skill check
   </strong>
   is "The Devil will have his revenge!" but this will only work with a
   <strong>
    high Speech skill
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   intimidation attempt is naturally very hard
  </strong>
  , seeing as Matthew has around 7 armed men.
  <strong>
   If players fail here
  </strong>
  and can't pay, they will have to fight against multiple opponents or attempt to flee.

  Janosh Uher can be
  <strong>
   found in the Miskowitz pillory
  </strong>
  for attacking a local. There are a few ways to set him free, such as
  <strong>
   picking the lock at night
  </strong>
  , but there is a more honorable option that will leave Henry with a good reputation.

     Another way would be to steal the keys from the Bailiff.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Speak with the Bailiff
  </strong>
  and offer to
  <strong>
   heal the wounded villager, Loyza
  </strong>
  in exchange for Janosh's freedom. To succeed, players will need:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Craftsmanship skill of at least 17.
  </li>
  <li>
   Alchemy skill of at least 12.
  </li>

   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Henry can complete the following steps:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Examine the injuries.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select "Maybe a potion will do."
  </li>
  <li>
   Clean and dress the wound.
  </li>
  <li>
   Give the Marigold Decoction.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pray if Henry has a high Speech stat.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finish the treatment.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Upon talking to the Bailiff again after Loyza has been successfully healed, Henry will still have to pay compensation for Janosh, which can be
  <strong>
   up to 450 Groschen
  </strong>
  . Always remember to haggle and lower prices in
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  where possible, though.

     If players don't have the money, they can come back later, as there is no rush for Janosh. Healing Loyza is time-based, however, so do this ASAP.
    </p>

  </div>

 <p>
  Henry can then head over to Janosh
  <strong>
   with the keys and free him

  Adder can be found in
  <strong>
   Pschitoky by talking to the butcher's wife
  </strong>
  , Eva. Henry should try to find out as much about the truth from her as possible, as this can help in the subsequent negotiations. Eventually, she will tell Henry that her husband and a group of armed men have
  <strong>
   taken Adder to a big tree to hang him
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Ride to the new map marker
  <strong>
   immediately without delay!
  </strong>
  There are a few ways to free Adder, but the
  <strong>
   following two options are the easiest
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Try the Impression check if Henry has a stat of at least 20. "
   <strong>
    He belongs to the Lord of Suchdol.
   </strong>
   " Fancy clothes and other Charisma boosting buffs help with Impression.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Fight
   </strong>
   the men via the "
   <strong>
    I don't have to explain anything to you
   </strong>
   " option. The men aren't armored, but the
   <strong>
    people of Pschitoky won't be happy
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once the butcher and local villagers have been mollified or dealt with, make sure to
  <strong>
   cut Adder down before he suffocates
  </strong>
  . If players haven't found Janosh already, Adder will let Henry know that he was in Miskowitz.

 <h3 id="here-39-s-what-you-get">
  Here's What You Get
 </h3>
 <p>
  Well, this is going to be a rather short guide because there's
  <strong>
   only one step for the Timed Research and four tasks to complete
  </strong>
  . Here are the rewards for each one and the rewards for the entire Step:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Hatch 5 Eggs (x10 Kubfu Candy)
  </li>
  <li>
   Win 3 Raids (3000 XP)
  </li>
  <li>
   Complete 5 Field Research Tasks (3000 XP)
  </li>
  <li>
   Power Up Pokemon 5 Times (x10 Pinap Berries)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once the four steps are done, you'll earn an encounter with
  <strong>
   Charcadet
  </strong>
  , 1500
  <strong>
   Stardust
  </strong>
  , and an
  <strong>
   Egg Incubator
  </strong>
  .

       Being the default weapon players will start with in
       <em>
        Dynasty Warriors: Origins
       </em>
       , there is nothing you need to do to unlock the Sword. As a starter weapon, the Sword is still more than capable of wiping out armies and is handy in a duel. Players should just make sure that they have the right Battle Arts equipped for maximum impact.

      <p>
       The Spear is the second weapon that players will unlock as part of the story. It becomes available once you compete the Battle of Guangyang in Chapter 1. Upon doing so, the game will instruct you to head to the store and pick up this weapon. The Spear is great for clearing crowds and dishing out focused damage on a single foe. It's a great all-round weapon.

      <p>
       If you currently do not possess the Gauntlet, it is likely that you did not manage to eliminate Zhou Cang in the Battle of Guangzong during Chapter 1. Pick it up by going after the officer, and you will unlock a new way of causing pain to your enemies. Different stances branch out into different attacks. As such, it will take some time to master this weapon, especially as you can fight and activate stances even quicker as you chain attacks.

       Found in the Suppression of You Province battle during Chapter 2, defeating either Zhang Ju or Qiliuju will see this weapon drop on the battlefield. The Wheels are an interesting weapon, requiring good timing and leaving you without a way to fight back after throwing them out. As such, it is more advisable to use this weapon at range and carve through the enemy that way.

      <p>
       Defeat all the officers that come your way in Subjugation of the White Wave Bandits in Chapter 2, and the Podao will be added to your arsenal. A heavy sword that requires two hands to wield, it hits hard but is slower in comparison to the other weapons. Players should prepare to take some hits when attacking, but the trade-off is more than worth it in the end.

      <p>
       Progress in the Assassination of Dong Zhuo battle, and eventually, you will find yourself in the castle. Locate the southwest chamber, and you can take down the officers who are there in order to obtain the Staff. The caveat here is that Lu Bu will be hot on your tails, so you need to be quick about the elimination in order to live to fight another day. The Staff is swift and fun to use in battle, allowing for quick combos that keep you moving. It doesn't hit as hard, but the sheer speed makes up for it.

      <p>
       Head to the Battle of Hulao Gate in Chapter 2, and take down the imposing Zhang Liao in order to get the Twin Pikes. Best described as two heavy spears, it is predictably slower to wield, but it's excellent for cutting down multiple enemies and even officers at once. Players should use its skills to control the crowd and go in for the kill after.

      <p>
       The Lance can be yours in the Battle of Xu Province during Chapter 3. Depending on your choice of allegiance, the way to get the weapon can vary in terms of the officer that needs to be defeated. Nevertheless, hunting down all the enemy officers will ensure that you get the Lance. As a more defensive weapon, players can use its range to attack with relative ease, and they can also use its skills to keep them in the pink of health during a battle.

       Your best chance of emulating Guan Yu comes by obtaining the Crescent Blade in the Rescue of Emperor Xian. Players can wait for Jia Xu to arrive on the scene and then beat him in order to grab the weapon. The more enemies you attack with the weapon, the stronger it becomes, making it a great option for those who love charging in.

       <em>
        Dynasty Warriors: Origins
       </em>
       at least once. Following that, head to the Battle of Hulao Gate again, but this time, do so on Ultimate Warrior difficulty. Beat Lu Bu, and the most powerful weapon in

       will be yours to use.

  <em>
   Space Invaders
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Galaga
  </em>
  to modern FPS titans like

   Call of Duty
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   ranged projectile combat
  </strong>
  has proven an extremely popular way for video game fans to approach a fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the gaming industry continues to evolve, fans see gameplay mechanics meld and combine in fascinating new ways. Projectile-based combat goes well with just about any sort of game with an action-oriented playstyle, including many
  <strong>
   open-world games
  </strong>
  . Here are some of
  <strong>
   the best open-world games that prioritize a ranged approach to combat.

  Ubisoft has a lot of open-world games in its catalog, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is easily one of the best. This iconic island adventure sets players loose on a fictional tropical archipelago, where they must battle the ruthless pirate lord Vaas Montenegro.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along the way, protagonist Jason Brody will upgrade his arsenal with an expanding catalog of powerful firearms, from silenced pistols and sniper rifles to bombastic shotguns and rocket launchers, not to mention this game's iconic bow and arrow.
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  stresses freedom in how players can approach each challenge, and the wide variety of weapons in the game is a testament to this.

  gameplay and graphics might be showing their age a bit, but the title is still a must-play for open-world fans and RPG players alike. The game adapts and enhances the gunplay introduced in
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  with several upgrades, such as a mod system to customize weapons and even different ammo types to shake up how players approach gunfights.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  does have a robust catalog of melee weapons for fans who'd prefer that option, the gunplay is where the game really shines, especially thanks to the franchise's time-honored VATS system.
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  offers a refined, tactical, and thoughtful gunfight experience.

  As the first properly open-world game in
  <em>
  </em>
  the illustrious
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Halo Infinite
   </em>
  </strong>
  stands out. The game's free multiplayer offering has been criticized for a lack of ongoing content, but the campaign still allows the iconic Master Chief to freely wander for the first time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gunplay that made the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise such a legend of the industry is still present, and the addition of a grappling hook opens up countless new options for exploration and strategy in combat. The series' iconic firearms return here and are just as satisfying in combat as ever.

  Rockstar's iconic
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is famous for a lot of things, from its epic tale of tragedy and betrayal to the grand, sweeping portrayal of the American Southwest during the decline of the Frontier age. But the game is also known for its intense attention to detail and realism, and this extends to its firearms as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  has an appropriately large catalog of guns, and shootouts in the game are intense and exciting, with the series' trademark Dead Eye mechanic giving players a deadly advantage. However, gun-based gameplay in
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  extends well outside combat. Fans must constantly take care of their firearms and give them regular cleanings to maintain their performance, just like in real life.

  Despite a turbulent launch,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  has developed into a remarkable open-world game that brings the iconic setting of Night City to lurid, neon-drenched life. Protagonist V's increasingly desperate attempts to save themselves from the malfunctioning chip in their head takes them to all corners of this flashy dystopia and brings them face-to-face with plenty of unsavory characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gunplay in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  is enhanced by a wide range of various damage types, some of which will be more or less effective against different enemies. In true cyberpunk fashion, players can also enhance their character's cybernetics, which in turn makes them more effective against various enemies. Players can even install "smart" cybernetics that will cause even rapid-fire machine guns to lock onto various enemies.

   <em>
    Fallout 4

  </strong>
  has an arguably weaker storyline than
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  , but the gunplay has come a long way.
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  massively expands on the mods introduced in
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  , allowing fans to virtually build their own firearm however they'd like. There are countless potential combinations and modifications for every weapon in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Firefights in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  are fast and exciting. The ever-present VATS system gives players the chance to turn the tide, and the fact that the game lets them equip explosives as a secondary weapon means they are never more than a button press away from escalating things to the point where bullets start flying.

   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a game that needs no introduction. As one of the best-selling video games of all time, this open-world crime drama is nothing short of a paragon of the video game industry, thanks largely to its immersive open-world design and its intense story of crime and despair.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gunplay in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  is heightened by the three player characters' special abilities, each of which enhances their skills in a tight spot. In true
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  fashion, gunfights are often frantic and intense, and the stakes for all three characters remain direly high throughout the main campaign.

  <strong>
   Horror games
  </strong>
  rely on disempowering their players, and vulnerability and helplessness are key to building fear. Consequently, a lot of these games have intentionally terrible movement systems. Player characters may be painfully slow, easily disorientated, or suffer from extreme head bobbing or camera shaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result of these conventions, many of the
  <strong>
   horror games that allow for fluid movement
  </strong>
  have a distinct action-adventure element. Additionally, sequels and remakes often improve upon the movement systems of their predecessors. This list includes horror games with the most fluid and satisfying movement and those that have less intuitive movement that adds something special to the game.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_4">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Not all of these games are horror-first, but that's in large part because of the power granted to the player by their movement systems. However, each game still leans heavily on the horror genre.

  Coming off the back of the beloved first game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Last of Us Part 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  needed to improve some of the movement issues of the series' previous entry, where Joel essentially controlled like an old boat. When traveling through a post-apocalyptic landscape littered with enemies, the ability to move between stealth and confrontational scenes continues to be vital. The player plays as two distinct protagonists, and their movement is distinctive and further develops the personality of each character.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  has intuitive third-person action that affords improvisation and adaptable approaches. And it has a
  <em>
   jump button
  </em>
  , something missing from the first game. While there is still a distinct vulnerability to the characters, their skill and determination shine through in the combat.

   <em>
    Dying Light 2 Stay Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a post-apocalyptic first-person action horror game that follows the protagonist, Aiden, through a decaying urban environment. The sweeping parkour and almost slapstick approach to combat makes for a game that has heightened movement, sometimes to the point of ridiculousness. Combat is diverse, with most situations being able to be confronted through stealth or action approaches.
 </p>
 <p>
  While many things about
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  didn't capture the feel of the original, the parkour is considerably better. The player can traverse the city by a variety of means, sticking to rooftops to stay away from the enemies below. The movement when it was first released was extremely glitchy and stilted due to several bugs, but it has improved dramatically since then.

   <strong>
    Left 4 Dead 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  has stood the test of time like no other horror-themed multiplayer game of its kind. It is a cooperative team-based game that sees players dropped into zombie-infested areas to complete pre-determined goals. There are different types of enemies with different characteristics, and the "director," which determines the game space, adds an element of unpredictability.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike some of the games on this list,
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead 2
  </em>
  ’s movement is simple – there is no rolling, flying, or complex parkouring through the game space. In a lot of ways, it is a simple run and gun game. This is perhaps why the movement has aged so well. The diversity of the environments is what adds complexity and variability to the movement.

   <strong>
    Bloodborne
   </strong>
  </em>
  has what may be one of the most satisfying movement systems in video games. Many who have given up before leaving Central Yharnam may find this baffling, because it can be a steep learning curve if players aren’t used to this style of game.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, by the time the player gets to Rom the Vacuous Spider at the game's midway point, they should be deft enough at avoiding attacks to survive her AoE attacks and get back in close to deal damage. Unfortunately, the camera struggles to keep up with the Hunter’s leaps and charges at crucial moments in boss fights, but even that is a minor frustration when all of
  <em>
   Bloodborne's
  </em>
  mechanics come together in perfect harmony.

  Sprinting actually feels fast in this game, and flinging objects at enemies with telekinesis is a lot of fun. One of the most wonderful moments of movement is when Jesse unlocks the abil;it to levitate. She then flies through the Oldest House listening to the Old Gods of Asgard. The stopping abruptly may look a little strange, but is essential in a game in which objects begin to move on their own. The environment moves around Jessie and its malleability is part of what makes navigating through the space so satisfying.

  is a sci-fi horror roguelike that rewards player dedication to long, difficult runs to uncover the narrative. The third-person combat is fast-paced, and the dash function is fantastic. Dodging is essential, as is using the grappling hook, so rapid and fluid movement is a key element of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The evasive play is incredibly satisfying, but there is a steep learning curve further compounded by the extended duration of each run. Once players get the hang of it, traversing the environment becomes a joy. Players who find haptic cues helpful will also appreciate the way that it informs movement and combat.

  Tarot Cards are consumable cards that can be purchased or acquired throughout a run in
  <em>
   Balatro.
  </em>
  <strong>
   There are 22 Tarot cards.
  </strong>
  They are all numbered with their corresponding arcana. Purchase one, and it will go into one of your two consumable slots. Most of the Tarot Cards will enhance the cards in your deck by changing their suits or applying effects that can net you more chips/multipliers. Some can even give you new Jokers, consumables, or cash. Discover all 22 Tarot Cards to receive the Cartomancy achievement and the Cartomancer Joker.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can get Tarot Cards by purchasing Arcana Packs from the shop in between rounds. Opening these booster packs will allow you to choose one out of several Tarot Cards. The Vagabond Joker will create a new Tarot Card whenever a hand is played while you have $4 or less.

      <title>6 NPC Anti-Heroes Who Should Get their Own Game</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  We all love when a supporting character gets their own spin-off. Many fans dream of their favorite NPCs in a particular game becoming the star of a future title. It is a great opportunity to spend more time with them and dive into their heads.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  It also gives an opportunity for players to see the main character of the game in a different perspective, like Solid Snake playing a supporting role in
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 2
  </em>
  after starring in three games. While the likelihood of these NPC anti-heroes receiving their own game is low, one can always dream and imagine how cool it would be.

  Few games are big enough to give all of their supporting characters such defined arcs. Some end up tragic, while others do the best with what they get. Sadie Adler transforms through the course of the game from a grieving widow into a bounty hunter who can handle any trouble that comes her way.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2,
  </em>
  she recovers from a stab wound and rides off into the sunset, wishing John and Abigail Marston all the best in their future life. One would like to think she kept up her bounty hunting until she got too old and settled down into a peaceful life.
 </p>
 <p>
  How can players know if she never gets to star in her own game? It is easy to see how the last days of bounty hunting would thematically connect to the series' themes of running away and clashing with modernity.

  Fans who started with
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  are introduced to Frank Jaeger as the cyborg ninja who battles with Solid Snake and later saves his life. There is no world where playing as a cyborg ninja in a character action game is not cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance
  </em>
  earning cult-classic status, what is stopping a spiritual successor from happening in the form of a game starring Frank Jaeger. The game would be a prequel to
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  It would begin with his defeat at the hands of Solid Snake and then going through the transformation into the Ninja, ending right where the 1998 video game begins.

  DC villains are rarely sympathetic or understandable. Poison Ivy is an exception. She is compelled to protect nature, something which obviously means harming humans. Even though she is a part of Batman's rogue gallery, she ends up saving the day in
  <em>
   Arkham Knight.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  She sacrifices herself to save Gotham from the Crow's trademark fear toxin. Such a noble act earns her a video game. It would be a great juxtaposition to the
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of ruthlessly beating down criminals, a Poison Ivy game would see her attacking the city in the name of saving the planet. The possibilities for game mechanics utilizing her powers also make this an appealing idea.

  Betrayal is an integral part of many
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  stories. It literally happens in almost every game in the series. Players expect Lama to turn his back on Franklin sometime during the story, especially since greed and dishonesty are at the heart of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto's
  </em>
  plot.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two have honest conversations that showcase friction in the relationship. Fortunately, Lamar stays by his friend's side and never betrays him even at the darker points in their friendship. His loyalty should be rewarded with a spin-off game taking place in Los Santos.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would also kill two birds with one stone since many were disappointed that
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  never received any additional single-player content after release.

  Luis Serra is an anti-hero for two reasons. One, he is partly responsible for the Plagas that destroy the village in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  . Secondly, he is a creep. He presents as a lady's man but something tells us he does not actually have that much success, if his one-liners towards Ashley are any indication.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the same, a game starring Luis either during or before the events of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  would be just as good an excuse as any to revisit the setting. Ada Wong already got her turn with
  <em>
   Separate Ways
  </em>
  , so it only feels right for Luis to get his day in the sun.

  Jecht comes off as a jerk and a terrible father for most of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  . By the end, players learn of his grand sacrifice and plan to save Spira from Sin. Like a lot of complicated father-son relationships, Jecht loved his son but had a hard time showing it and rarely treated him right.
 </p>
 <p>
  A game starring Jecht, Auron, and Lord Braska during their pilgrimage to defeat Sin ten years before Yuna's journey would be a great reason to revisit the world of Spira. It might not add a lot to the overall
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  lore, but it would be fascinating to see what Spira was like in the past and spend time with characters like Jecht and Lord Braska who are only seen in flashbacks.

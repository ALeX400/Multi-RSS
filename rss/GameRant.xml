  <em>
   Fish Training
  </em>
  is a racing simulator, but instead of cars, you have fish to ride, and the tracks are laid underwater, which makes this game significantly different from similar
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  experiences. In addition to an interesting and non-standard concept, you will find a bunch of mechanics like training to increase speed, and of course, the races themselves.

  To make the game easier and more interesting, you can redeem
  <em>

  codes. Each of them will bring you a bunch of cool rewards, mostly Golden Potions, which will temporarily significantly increase your income.

  As in other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, to redeem
  <em>
   Fish Training
  </em>
  codes, you just need to follow a few steps and the whole process will take less than a minute. Here's a separate guide with a detailed explanation of the process if you don't know how it works:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    Fish Training
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Pay attention to the left side of the screen. There will be several buttons and options. Among them, interact with the multi-colored Shop button.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you open Shop, scroll to the very bottom of the menu to find the redemption section.
  </li>
  <li>
   The redemption section will contain an input field and a yellow Redeem button next to it. Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above-mentioned active codes into the input field.
  </li>
  <li>
   Lastly, click on the yellow Redeem button to request your rewards.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If everything is done correctly, you will see a notification below the redemption menu with a list of rewards received.

  One of the great things about
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is that, after a few hours, players can explore Trosky, a region filled with side quests and encounters. Forests are common and often house Bandit camps, where enemies prey on travelers. Despite the danger, exploring is rewarding, as players can find maps leading to treasure, with said treasure usually taking the form of money or gear.

  To acquire the map, first fast-travel to Apollonia and ride south past the sheep farm. After a short ride, you'll come across an unfinished cottage. Inside, there’s a storage box requiring hard lockpicking, but there’s an easier way to open it. Turn around from the box and head to the other side of the cottage, where you'll see a large pile of rocks next to a log. Here, you’ll find a clay vase containing:

  As expected, both the Human Torch and the Thing received comic book-based costumes alongside their debut. All members of the Fantastic Four share a comic book-based skin. The costume references the first cohesive supersuit all four heroes wore in
  <em>
   Fantastic Four Vol. 1
  </em>
  #3 (1961). However, each member of the Fantastic Four also has an individual comic-based skin that is unique to the character.

  Johnny Storm is no exception, as the hot-headed superhero has a blazing skin of his own. The “Negative Zone Gladiator” skin shows the Human Torch’s hair cropped, and covered in some form of metallic root covering the large majority of his body and half of his face. Unlike the Thing’s comic book-based skin, the Negative Zone Gladiator costume references a Human Torch design from later in the bibliography of the Fantastic Four.

 <p>
  All costumes in
  <em>

  </em>
  are accompanied by a quote, either attributed to the costume wearer or a character with significant importance to the costume, and information on where the costume first appeared. While both the quote and first appearance are mentioned even for
  <em>

  </em>
  ’ original designs, this information is very important for comic book-based skins. This is how non-comic readers know that the Negative Zone Gladiator skin first appeared in
  <em>
   Fantastic Four Vol. 3
  </em>
  #600.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  attributes the costume’s first appearance to
  <em>
   Fantastic Four
  </em>
  (1998) #600, which could confuse non-comic readers hoping to see this first appearance as issue #600 was released in 2011.

  The Fantastic Four have dealt with the Negative Zone plenty of times before, with Reed first discovering a gateway to the antimatter universe in
  <em>
   Fantastic Four Annual Vol. 1
  </em>
  #6 (1963). But almost fifty years after Reed’s discovery, the superfamily once again face enemies in the mysterious parallel universe, this time against the Cult of the Negative Zone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, Johnny receives the short end of the stick for a large portion of this arc. The Cult of the Negative Zone unleashes an army of Annihilus Insectoid Soldiers onto the Human Torch, a powerless Thing, and the rest of their allies. In an act of sacrifice, Johnny uses his nova flame in an attempt to destroy the army. Unable to cut through the army, Johnny Storm is captured and killed. He is then resurrected three times by worm healers, but each attempt sees him burning the worms before his body is fully recovered, leaving him to die again.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, all hope is not lost. When the mighty Human Torch finally manages to be reborn, he is sent to prison where he meets the Light Brigade. Together, they escape and attack Annihilus. After taking his Cosmic Control Rod, Johnny opens a portal to Earth and sends his allies and the missing Baxter Building back to Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Human Torch’s resurrected body looks twisted and gnarled from his resurrection and fight against Annihilus. This new design is the same one that inspired the Negative Zone Gladiator costume in

  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  could launch as early as this summer, according to a former member of Nintendo's U.S. sales and retail department. Despite finally revealing its next console after months of speculation, the company has not offered many specific details about the successor to the Switch, including when people can expect it and how much it will cost. One former employee doesn't think the wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 will last much longer, though.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans will get a closer look at the console during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2, potentially including a release date announcement and official price. Naturally, the community is still rushing to find out all it can before then. Some rumored release timelines are starting to look increasingly likely, with some of the latest insights lining up with previous estimates.
 </p>
 <p>
  A former Nintendo employee referred to only by his first name, Sean, appeared on the Kit and Krysta Nintendo podcast to give his two cents on when to expect the console. According to Sean, who worked on Nintendo's U.S. retail marketing and strategy teams, the Switch 2 will likely launch at the start of the summer, more specifically, in June. This is close to earlier rumors that suggested the Switch 2 will drop on May 22, a date fans have noticed aligns with the gap between the first Switch's Direct and its launch date. Sean also offered a practical explanation for his more general estimate, saying an early summer release would help Nintendo capitalize on the excitement from students looking forward to the end of the school year.

 <p>
  As for the console's price, Sean did not have a number in mind and said that retailers wouldn't know that information at this point, either. One analyst believes the Switch 2 will cost $399 based on the current market, which is in line with fan theories that placed it within the $300 to $400 range. While these rumors come from a look at the larger industry and how things have gone in the past, Sean warns fans against trusting supposed insider information from retailers. As part of Nintendo's retail strategy team, Sean had firsthand experience in how the company negotiates and communicates with retailers, and he said stores typically don't learn of launch dates and prices until maybe a week or two ahead of a public announcement.

 <p>
  Whenever the Switch 2 releases, it will be a big moment for Nintendo. It's looking like the console will break new ground for the company, with Microsoft reportedly bringing more games to the Switch 2 alongside many other third-party developers. If current rumors are true, the console could get considerably more ports of popular big titles than its predecessor saw, which is a significant shift for Nintendo as a whole, as the company's systems have historically not seen the same kind of support as Xbox or PlayStation in that regard. Of course, many details about the Switch 2 are still unconfirmed for now, so fans will need to wait for the Direct to know for sure.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel
   </em>
  </strong>
  has officially announced the newest update to the game's Forbidden and Limited List, set to be released in early March. Throughout the more than three years since Konami first launched its massively popular digital trading card game, the developer has regularly looked to make adjustments to the game's meta through banlist updates. Konami's now-monthly banlist updates have seen everything from minor tweaks of specific cards to sweeping changes affecting many of
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  's most powerful decks. Now, Konami is making a few more changes to the game for its March format.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recent months have seen a plethora of powerful new decks and archetypes join
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel
  </em>
  through its newest Selection Packs. February introduced the "Fiendsmith" cards to the digital TCG, a powerful archetype that was considered a "Tier 0" strategy following its release in the physical game. The "Mulcharmy" cards introduced in January also took the card game by storm, providing powerful draw effects from the hand that any deck in the game could utilize. March's new update to
  <em>
   Master Duel
  </em>
  's banlist, however, looks to be more focused on minor adjustments.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel
  </em>
  officially revealed the next update to the online game's banlist on Friday, showcasing a pair of minor changes. The banlist update notably does not feature any cards moving into the Forbidden or Limited sections, only featuring two cards being freed from restrictions. Both "Cynet Mining" and "Swap Frog" will be returned to three copies per deck, with Cynet Mining previously Semi-Limited and Swap Frog at Limited status. The minor shifts to
  <em>
   Master Duel
  </em>
  's banlist are set to be officially implemented on March 6.

  <em>

  's small changes to the game's banlist largely fall in line with Konami's past trends for its digital TCG's updates. The developer typically waits for a couple of months before making any sweeping changes to powerful new strategies, allowing the dust to settle to see where the new cards land.
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel
  </em>
  has also often used minor changes to give cards back to decks that had previously been hit, with "Cynet Mining" as an effective searcher for Cyberse decks and "Swap Frog" being useful in the "Spright" strategy.

  comes as the game continues the celebration of its third anniversary. Konami has rolled out multiple login rewards campaigns throughout recent months, both celebrating the game's anniversary and
  <em>
   Master Duel
  </em>
  surpassing 250 million downloads in December. The digital TCG's anniversary celebration even featured a plethora of exclusive cosmetics, including several designed around the "Sky Striker" archetype and a new Solo Mode for the theme featuring special animations.
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel
  </em>
  's new changes will look to give a little help to some of the game's older decks.

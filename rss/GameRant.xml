      September 3 marks the launch of Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, promising stylish animations and intuitive game mechanics for fans.
     </li>
     <li>
      The game could benefit from diving deeper into Wizarding World lore, including historical Quidditch figures like the Kneen family.
     </li>
     <li>
      In addition to classic characters like Harry and Draco, Quidditch Champions could explore 'What if?' scenarios with unconventional match-ups.

 <p>
  Though last year's
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  was met with some really positive reviews from both fans and critics alike, one sizable criticism was the game's lack of a Quidditch mode. A staple of most
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  movie tie-in games, Quidditch has appeared in various video game forms over the last few decades, and fans were hoping it would appear bigger and better than ever in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  . But while fans were left a bit disappointed last year,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
   </strong>
  </em>
  could be about to fill that void.

 <p>
  Set for a September 3 launch,
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  looks like it's shaping up nicely, with its last few gameplay trailers showing off some stylish animations and some seemingly intuitive game mechanics. A recent trailer also confirmed that players will be able to make their own custom character, or choose from a variety of familiar faces, with Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Cho Chang, and a slew of Weasleys already confirmed to appear. While this is already a decent roster for
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , the game could dig even deeper into its source material.

  Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions Should Dig Out Some Historical Players
 </h3>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is already set to include some iconic series characters, it would be great to see the game dive deeper into Wizarding World lore to deliver some lesser-known Quidditch figures. According to the current
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  canon, Quidditch in its most recognizable form was first invented all the way back in the early 11th century near the marshes of Queerditch. One of the earliest named Quidditch players was the witch Gwenog, whose friend Gertie Keddle was responsible for noting the existence of the first-ever Quidditch matches in her diary.

 <p>
  A century later, Quidditch had become a popular sport for witches and wizards across Britain, with the Yorkshire-based Kneen family being some of the most prominent historical figures related to the sport. Goodwin Kneen and his wife Gunhilda Kneen were both avid Quidditch players, and were partly responsible for spreading the sport to the rest of the world, as they detailed the game's rules in a letter to their Norwegian cousin Olaf. It would be great to see these historical characters appear in
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , maybe alongside an old-timey pitch that uses mounted barrels as goalposts as opposed to the usual golden hoops.

 <p>
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  could also find some inspiration in the Wizarding World's more recent history, delivering a handful of characters who were known to play the game just before this latest generation of competitors. James Potter – Harry's father – would be a great pick for
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , with him having canonically played for Gryffindor back during his Hogwarts days.

  Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions Could Deliver a Few 'What If?' Players
 </h3>
 <p>
  On top of players from Quidditch's long history,
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  could include a wealth of iconic franchise characters who may not have canonically played the sport in either the books or movies, but are ones fans would probably like to see in the game regardless. Classic
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  characters like Hermione, Neville, and Luna would all be great to see in the game.
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  could get even wilder with its 'What if?' picks by allowing less conventional matches such as ones between iconic Hogwarts teachers like Snape, Dumbledore, and even Hagrid, or ones between Hogwarts' ghost inhabitants like Peeves and Nearly Headless Nick, though that might be pushing the franchise's canon a bit too far.

  <strong>
   Ann Takamaki
  </strong>
  is a potential love interest in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Persona 5 Royal
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but aside from that, she's also a great friend to Joker if the player doesn't decide to pursue a romantic relationship with her. Either way, players will love spending time with her while progressing her Confidant.

 <p>
  She's the Confidant of The Lovers Arcana and can strengthen any Persona that's attached to this category. She's an incredibly kind person, and as such, should be given plenty of gifts! Since she's obsessed with shopping and that's the best way to further Joker's relationship with her, it only makes sense that players can find most of the things she likes best at various malls.

   Persona 5 is one of the greatest JRPGs ever, and introduced many people to a series that started out as a Shin Megami Tensei spin-off before becoming one of Atlus' biggest golden geese. The wait for Persona 6 is agonizing and fans can't wait to see what the next game in the series has in store for them. A huge part of what made the fifth mainline Persona game such a joy to play through is the many Confidants that players can interact with, including their party members. Ann Takamaki is one such party member whom players will love to hang out with, and people who don't want the downtime with this character to be wasted should check out the best gifts for Ann in Persona 5, which will be a source of great delight for her.

  <strong>
   KGB49
  </strong>
  is presumably a popular band in the universe of
  <em>
   Persona 5 Royal
  </em>
  , although there's not much mention of them anywhere else in the game. It's a kind gesture for Ann as a Confidant, since she must like their music, but it would be great to know a bit more about them.
 </p>

 <p>
  Still, despite fans not having an inkling about this band, that doesn't change the fact that Best of KGB49 is one of the
  <strong>
   best gifts for Ann in
   <em>
    Persona 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It goes a long way in improving her relationship with Joker and ensures that players can enjoy steady progress with her Confidant relationship without wasting too much time. However, this gift is only an honorable mention, as it is only available in
  <em>
   Persona 5,
  </em>
  and was removed in
  <em>
   Persona 5 Royal.

  Ann lives a hectic life. Juggling her life as a student, model, and member of the Phantom Thieves is easier said than done. She must stay in shape to ensure that her modeling work isn't impeded, which is why she'll love a gift that lets her stay in shape on the go.

  Sometimes, the simplest and most obvious gifts are the ones that people will appreciate the most. Such is the case with the
  <strong>
   Bath of Roses,
  </strong>
  which is a simple way to earn Ann's affection and help Joker progress her Confidant level.

  The Bath of Roses is one of the

  It's clear that a beautiful face is a desirable trait in the universe of

  This one might come off as a bit of a surprise, especially because Ann Takamaki doesn't come off as a spiritual person so much as somewhat vain, even if her heart's in the right place. Either way, the mirror fulfills a purpose and she likes it to the highest degree possible in the game.

  For those who aren't aware of where matcha comes from, it's mostly derived from traditional ceremonial tea ceremonies where the popular Sencha green tea was ground up. While traditionally Matcha was bitter, its use in various pastries and lattes has made for a bit of an updated sweet taste.

  It seems a little odd that the description mentions that there's a famous model who frequently wears makeup, it makes sense that Ann if anyone would be into the
  <strong>
   Crimson Lipstick

  Perfume is an easy gift to give people as long as they don't get offended by the insinuations that they don't smell good. Thankfully, Ann is smart enough to not be offended by such a gesture, and it's easy to see why fans might miss one of the
  <strong>
   best gifts for Ann in
   <em>
    Persona 5 Royal
   </em>
  </strong>
  because of how effective it is, despite this potential misconception.

 <p>
  It's been a long and tough road for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Halo Infinite
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Upon its initial launch back in 2021,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  was met with a great deal of praise from both critics and fans, with many citing the game's multiplayer as a great return to the series' arena shooter roots, and many enjoying the campaign's attempt to push the franchise in a new direction. But as a live-service game,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's cracks soon started to show.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Too few multiplayer maps, a disappointing lack of staple modes like Forge and campaign co-op, and an inconsistent post-launch roadmap combined to slowly kill interest in
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  . While developer 343 Industries has spent the last few years bringing those requested features to the game, it's a far cry from what
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  was originally supposed to be, and if things had worked out differently, Xbox could have had its own version of
  <em>
   Fortnite.

  Halo Infinite Once Had a 10-Year Plan
 </h3>
 <p>
  Back in July 2020 – immediately following
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's eagerly-awaited first gameplay reveal – IGN interviewed former
  <em>
   Infinite
  </em>
  studio head Chris Lee. During the interview, Lee referred to
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  as "the start of [343's] platform for the future," and that the game would mark the "start of the next ten years for Halo." Lee doubled down on this plan, stating that "numbered"
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  titles wouldn't be happening again for a while. Despite repeatedly affirming that
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  was not a live-service game, 343 Industries' comments at the time suggested the exact opposite, and if all went to plan, then
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  could have been in the same boat as
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  by now.

 <p>
  Though 343 Industries never gave any concrete details related to its 10-year plan for
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  , it seems safe to assume that it would have involved an even greater amount of post-launch support than the game ended up receiving. On top of additions like campaign co-op, new maps, new weapons, and new cosmetics,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's 10-year plan probably would have included more story content for the game and more drastic changes for its multiplayer mode, evolving the title's gameplay and visuals over time.

 <p>
  But
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  's 10-year plan could have really set the world on fire if it took a page out of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's playbook. In the last few years,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  has become an entire gaming platform in its own right. What began as just a simple PvE horde game quickly turned into the biggest battle royale on the planet, and with the addition of Creative mode,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  became an exponentially bigger title, giving players the tools to create their own smaller-scale games inside
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  itself. And that was only the beginning.

  Last year,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  added the kart racer Rocket Racing, the
  <em>
   Rock Band
  </em>
  -like Fortnite Festival, and the survival mode LEGO Fortnite to its ever-growing platform. Each mode is essentially its own standalone game, offering tens of hours of content completely for free. In an alternate universe,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  could have been a platform like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , with its own Flood-based horde mode, its own Creative mode with Forge, and even its own LEGO Fortnite mode with a
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  Mega Bloks tie-in.

      <title>5 Open-World Games With High Difficulty Curves</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-open-world-games-high-difficulty-curves/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Difficulty in games is a wholly subjective topic, as every player is different; what some may find tremendously easy, others may struggle with. While many games offer multiple difficulty options, some (such as
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ) omit them entirely. Overly difficult games can turn some players away, but some offer truly rewarding experiences for those that stick it out.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":366} -->

 <p>
  Even with multiple difficulty options, some games continuously challenge players from the outset. This can make them inaccessible, unforgiving, and at-times frustrating. However, open-world games often allow players to approach challenges in a non-linear fashion, and exploration can provide a welcome respite from constant challenges. Even with this approach, some of the best open-world games deliver a sharp challenge due to their high difficulty curve.

  <strong>
   <em>

  <em>
   STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl

  is a first-person open-world RPG with elements of survival horror, with a heavy dose of resource management and a variety of nasty creatures tossed in for good measure. However, these creatures aren't the only thing trying to kill the player, and they'll often be caught in visceral, dangerous gunfights with opposing factions. Learning how to prepare for a journey and how to maneuver during combat can take some getting used to, but this is only part of what makes
  <em>
   STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl

  , and its sequels, so unique.

  It's an acquired taste, but

This unforgiving combat provides a challenge that can be inconsistent, but it delivers a rewarding system for players to learn over the course of the game.

  Quiet, contemplative, and deeply unforgiving,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Long Dark
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a hardcore survival game that puts players in a frozen wilderness and tasks them with nothing but staying alive. While players will have to deal with wild wolves and the occasional bear, wildlife is often the least of their concerns. There are a variety of ways to perish in
  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  , and being injured or even killed by wildlife is just one of many ways to go.

 <p>
  Freezing to death, or starving, is more likely. Players may begin the game in good condition — perhaps they'll find a stash of goods — but eventually, those goods will run out, and their condition will begin to wane. This prompts the player to go out and explore, inevitably bombarding them with more problems to solve. Learning
  <em>
   The Long Dark's
  </em>
  many intricacies takes hours of play, but its remarkably quiet world can offer a tranquil experience when everything's going right.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Kenshi
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a party-based RPG that may not look like much on the surface, but it offers a tremendous amount of player agency and an expansive open world to explore. This world, however, is extremely hostile, and surviving in it is no small feat. It's fairly easy to die in
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  , with plenty of potential threats roaming the world at all times. Furthermore, the game's busy user interface is somewhat unfriendly to newcomers.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  , players begin with control over just one character but can soon gather an entire company of characters (should they wish). Learning how to make money, do battle, build a base, and simply survive in its world takes potentially hours of gameplay. What's more,
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  doesn't hold the player's hand, instead letting them loose in the world. While this can be frustrating at first, it's part of what makes
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  so rewarding — and so replayable.

  FromSoftware are notorious for developing games with high difficulty curves, as seen in the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  series and perhaps more notably in
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  . Although
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  is far from linear, much of its world is gated off, and players are carefully steered down a select few paths. In a way,
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  shares more in common with Metroidvanias than full open-world games.

  One of FromSoftware's latest video games,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  , is different; in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , players are free to explore the world in whatever order they see fit. This world is much more expansive, providing players with stretches of land to explore, dotted with landmarks and memorable locations. The world also features a variety of dungeons that vary in both difficulty and engagement. Despite this change to the formula,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  maintains the high difficulty curve that the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  games are known for, offering a truly challenging open-world experience.

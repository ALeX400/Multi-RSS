      <title>Adin Ross Reveals How Much He Makes from Kick Streams</title>

    <ul>

      Kick streamers earn by the hour: $10 with 50 viewers, $100 with 1,000 viewers. Adin Ross made $27k in 5 hours.

 <p>
  Popular streamer Adin Ross just shared the details on how much money he’s making streaming on Kick,
  <strong>
   Twitch
  </strong>
  ’s big rival, showing off the huge numbers he earns from just one session. Kick entered the livestreaming world in late 2022 and quickly grew, signing top talent, including some of Twitch’s biggest names, and establishing itself as a serious contender.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch has stayed the leader in livestreaming for years, while other challengers like Mixer and Facebook Gaming couldn’t last. Kick, though, went against what many expected after early predictions said it’d fail fast. The platform built its plan around two key things: less strict content moderation than Twitch and better payouts for streamers. Kick also signed several high-profile content creators with lucrative contracts to pull in viewers and grow quickly. Adin Ross was one of the first big names to switch, joining Kick in February 2023.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adin Ross, who’s been with Kick for over two years, just broke down how much he’s earning on the platform during a recent stream. He explained that even without subscriptions, the Kick Partner Program keeps the cash coming, and any streamer can make solid earnings. Adin laid it out: 1,000 viewers means about $100 an hour, while 50 viewers nets around $10 an hour. To show what that looks like, he pointed to his April 1 stream, where he teamed up with xQc and Sneako for just under five hours and earned $27,169. Talking to new streamers, Adin said Kick makes growing fast and easy, adding, “I streamed for five hours and made 30 grand.”

 <p>
  Another Kick streamer, Sam Frank, recently shared her own numbers, saying she made $80,000 in her best month. She averaged 3,500 viewers, streaming nearly 15 hours a day for almost a month, and said, “Kick literally changed my life.” These figures show how much Kick is paying its creators, and not needing subscribers to earn stands out as a big advantage. That setup’s likely driving Kick’s rise, maybe even pushing Twitch to improve its own partner program.

 <p>
  Adin Ross also shared that Kick’s planning new features to let viewers earn money by watching streams. This isn’t the first time he’s mentioned these plans - back in October, he said Kick was developing a new currency to reward viewers for tuning in. The details are still unclear, like how much the currency’s worth, how often viewers can earn it, or what the cash-out limit will be, and there’s no word on when this program will launch either.

  <strong>
   Open-world
  </strong>
  games are simply fantastic due to all the wonderful options they offer players. Since they're typically so vast, developers have to pack into them as much as possible, including side missions, companions, and even large dialog trees. While many AAA titles have multi-million-dollar budgets, there are also some immersive indie open-world games that are great fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  In most cases, open/world games have tons of secrets hidden away in their world, which can be discovered through the use of readable in-game books and other elements. Here are some of the

   <em>
    Fallout: New Vegas
   </em>
  </strong>
  is considered by many players to be one of the best installments in its series. While it doesn't have the graphics or game mechanics that
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  does, it still manages to deliver a very enjoyable experience to players.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the
  <em>
   Dead Money
  </em>
  DLC, players can choose to team up with Father Elijah, use the cloud and holograms, and wipe out everyone in Mojave. This provides a very interesting conclusion to the game, quite different to any other ending present in the game. Players looking to improve their experience might want to try some of the best mods for immersion in

  The
  <em>
   Far Cry

  franchise has been around for years at the time of writing this article, and throughout the years, several great titles have been released in it.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not the exception, thanks to its interesting game mechanics and the beautiful Himalayan environment it’s set in.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the early stages of the game, players will be left in a room to eat at after they meet Pagan Min. If they can wait for 15 minutes, Min will return to the room and tell Ajay about his mother. This ending implies that Ajay teams up with Pagan Min against those who would alternatively be his allies.
  <em>
   Far Cry 4
  </em>
  also offers tons of Easter eggs that are easy to miss.

   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077

  is one of the best games set in a futuristic dystopian society that's ever been released. Not only does the game look amazing, but there are tons of main and side quests that players can get from the various NPCs spread across Night City.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a secret variation of the Sun ending, where V and Johnny Silverhand storm Arasaka Tower together. To get this ending, players will have to follow a specific line of dialogue in the Chippin’ In quest, so it can be easily missed if the wrong words are chosen.

  Although it was released way back in 2015,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
   </em>
  </strong>
  remains, to this day, a masterpiece that both fans of the franchise and lovers of RPGs set in fantasy worlds still return to frequently.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many interesting things to do in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  , including monster Contracts and side missions. The game has a total of 36 different endings, so even the most dedicated of players will likely have missed one or two. Some of them are quite tragic, whereas in others, everything turns out well. Playing Gwent in The Continent is also quite fun, so those interested might want to learn about all the Gwent decks available in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  to increase their chances of success.

 <p>
  This title features various game mechanics, including the Dead Eye shooting mode and hunting, for which there are many great weapons. There are four different endings in

  and some of them are greatly determined by Arthur’s Honor level.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Warzone
   </em>
  </strong>
  has announced upcoming changes to the armor plate system. This update comes alongside the highly anticipated return of Verdansk, the original and iconic
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  map, to the battle royale experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a long wait, Verdansk has finally returned to
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  with the Season 3 update, bringing a wave of updates along with reintroduced content and features aimed at recapturing the feel of the original 2020 version of Activision’s free-to-play title. The goal was to deliver an experience as close as possible to what players remember from the game’s early days. However, the return also revived some of the issues present in the original release – such as the shortage of armor plates. Just like before, though, these problems are expected to be addressed through upcoming fixes.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a recent tweet,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  developer Raven Software announced that the team is working on adjusting armor plate distribution in the game. The developer also confirmed that it has “collected a massive amount of launch feedback” on various aspects of the game, which it is using to improve both the Verdansk experience and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  overall.

  Call of Duty: Warzone Devs Set to Apply Player Feedback to Improve Verdansk Experience
 </h2>
 <p>
  To bring
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  closer to the original, more streamlined experience, the developers implemented several changes, such as limiting the number of armor plates, currency, and other useful items available on the map. These restrictions marked a significant shift from previous versions of the game. However, after testing these adjustments and gathering feedback from the community, it became clear that in-game performance and player satisfaction didn’t meet expectations. In response, Raven Software has expressed a willingness to tweak the availability and distribution of equipment – especially armor plates – to ensure players have the resources they need to fully enjoy the battle royale experience.

 <p>
  It’s encouraging to see the game's development team open to adjusting their decisions based on how changes play out in-game, giving players a chance to test them and providing feedback that helps refine the
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  experience – especially with Verdansk now back online. This isn’t the first time Raven Software has fine-tuned gameplay mechanics to ensure a fun, competitive, and balanced experience. While this often involves a period of live testing with active player participation, the team has consistently shown it is responsive and willing to adapt. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that Verdansk’s return is meaningful and sustainable, backed by a solid foundation and continued support through fresh content and thoughtful updates.

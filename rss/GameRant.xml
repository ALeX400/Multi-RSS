  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  's DLC
  <em>
   <strong>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
  </em>
  is full of potent weapons, expanding the ever-growing list of the strongest and most overpowered builds in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . With eight new weapon categories to experiment with, players are already creating undefeatable Tarnished builds capable of one-shotting the expansion's final boss or tanking every boss available without being hit once. However, it's not all about finding the most broken build to feel satisfied when defeating enemies. Winning in style and having fun are important too.

  This list doesn't rank the strongest new weapons available to players in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree.
  </em>
  Instead, it prioritizes the most fun-to-use new armaments added in the expansion, based on their unique movesets and special skills. These are not necessarily the best or most effective weapons players can get, but they provide an exciting gameplay experience that wasn't possible in the original game.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  fans shouldn't overlook these weapons.

  Milady is a Light Greatsword introduced in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  that quickly became a fan favorite. The sword itself isn't particularly impressive in design, featuring a simplistic and classic look. However, its fast, smooth, and sleek moveset captures players' attention. Players will find the Wing Stance Skill nearby, which is meant to be coupled with Milady. With this infusion, players can enter a calm stance, triggering a lightning-quick flurry of attacks or deploying a leaping thrust that covers a moderate distance with substantial damage. This simple combo can carry players through the game when mastered, proving invaluable against many challenging enemies and bosses.

 <p>
  The best part is that players can acquire Milady relatively early in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , making this Greatsword a potential primary weapon for the rest of the journey. Milady is found i
  <strong>
   nside a chest
  </strong>
  <strong>
   at the top of the main watchtower in Castle Ensis.
  </strong>
  Meanwhile, the Wing Stance Skill can be acquired from a chest in another Castle Ensis tower below the Castle Lord's Chamber Site of Grace.

  The Smithscript weapon category is one of several new additions in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . Among its offerings, the Smithscript Greathammer might not be the strongest, but it is probably the most fun to use. It turns the player into the mighty Thor, throwing his Mjölnir at the heads of unsuspecting enemies. With decent melee and ranged damage with no FP cost, this weapon has a fun animation and satisfying sound effects. It also has a unique mechanic where the Smithscript Greathammer drags its targets with it, knocking them down upon a fully charged throw. These features make this weapon a fan favorite that has already appeared in countless videos, including various boss fights.

 <p>
  To get the Smithscript Greathammer, players need to clear
  <strong>
   Taylew's Ruined Forge
  </strong>
  <strong>
   ,
  </strong>
  located northwest of Shadow Keep. The weapon is not found at the very end of the dungeon, but rather on a corpse along the way, guarded by a fire blob enemy. Players have to clear the Forge carefully to avoid missing this fun weapon.

  When fighting Messmer the Impaler at the top of one of the best new areas in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , Shadow Keep, players may notice his long, devastating fire-thrusting spear combos and want to learn them for themselves. And they're in luck. After defeating him, the Tarnished can obtain the Spear of the Impaler, one of the best Great Spears in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . This legendary spear allows players to unleash the same deadly combo upon their foes. It can also be thrown as a ranged projectile at zero FP cost, dealing significant damage and exploding with fire on impact when fully charged.

 <p>
  Acquiring the Spear of the Impaler is very straightforward:
  <strong>
   defeat Messmer
  </strong>
  and trade his Remembrance of the Impaler with Enia at Roundtable Hold. Players can also duplicate Messmer's Remembrance at the new Remembrance Duplication Coffins found in the Realm of Shadow to receive the Messmer's Orb incantation.

  The Thrusting Shields weapon category is another addition in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , with two shields that are arguably some of the most powerful new weapons in the expansion. The Carian Thrusting Shield might be the better option of the two, strong enough to carry players through the final boss fight with little to no effort. It combines high guard boost with good stamina management while blocking, solid physical and magical resistances, as well as some serious damage. The Carian Thrusting Shield is a versatile choice for survivability and retaliation against even the most challenging new enemies in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree.
  </em>

  To obtain the Carian Thrusting Shield, players need to reach
  <strong>
   Shadow Keep
  </strong>
  and search for a corpse in a room with a Fire Knight not far from the Storehouse, Back Section Site of Grace. Be cautious of Fire Knights, as these enemies can easily take down the Tarnished with their combination of devastating ranged fire and melee attacks.

  This colossal weapon looks weird, but hey, who wants to use ordinary weapons in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  anyway? It is much more fun to swing a giant, charred sunflower. This weapon can deliver a bonking on its own, but is even better when mastering its Skill. The Shadow Sunflower Headbutt is exactly what it sounds like, delivering a hard-hitting slam down, with a Holy shockwave that flattens foes. It even allows for up to two powerful follow-up attacks to ensure no one survives the area of impact.

  To get the Shadow Sunflower Blossom, players have to work hard and defeat the optional Scadutree Avatar boss located in the
  <strong>
   Scadutree Base area.
  </strong>
  The most important thing about this boss is that it has three phases, fully restoring its HP each time. Upon defeating it, players will get the Remembrance of the Shadow Sunflower, which can be traded with Enia in exchange for the Shadow Sunflower Blossom.

  The new Perfume Bottle is one of the most interesting additions in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , and powerful enough to match any elemental weapon previously available in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . While some players might prefer the Deadly Poison Perfume Bottle or Chilling Perfume Bottle, the Lightning Perfume Bottle is one of the most visually spectacular. It's also capable of dealing incredible damage if players know how to stack multipliers and use its hitboxes correctly. It releases a barrage of lightning over a wide area, which can chain either single foes or hit several targets at once. This weapon benefits greatly from several talismans, like the new Perfumer's Talisman or Lightning Scorpion Charm.

 <p>
  Another advantage of this weapon is how easy and straightforward it is to acquire, without any hard fighting involved. The Lightning Perfume Bottle is found in the Cerulean Coast area, on a corpse in a small pool of water not far from the
  <strong>
   Cerulean Coast Site of Grace.

  In the latest Majesty and Magnolias Star Path, you get to solve tons of fun riddles in Disney Dreamlight Valley. These riddles test your knowledge of the valley and its residents and many villagers are often hidden behind riddles. One of the tasks is to ‘Talk with a Transformed Prince.’
 </p>

 <p>
  With nearly 30 cute villagers in the game, it can be hard for you to figure out who the transformed prince is. The riddle only tells you that the character is a prince who has transformed. Follow along as we explain how to talk to the Transformed Prince in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  in this quick guide.

  So in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  , the transformed prince is
  <strong>
   The Beast
  </strong>
  . He’s the prince from the Beauty and the Beast movie who was turned into an animal by a witch. He’s the second character from the movie in the game, with Belle being the other. To complete this Star Path task, all you need to do is have
  <strong>
   two daily discussions with The Beast.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":900} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  To start, find The Beast on the map and fast-travel to his location. Once you’re there, interact with him and have a conversation. Unlike other Star Path tasks that can take 15 to 60 minutes, talking to The Beast will only take a few seconds. But since you can only have one conversation per day, it will take two days to complete this task.

 <p>
  After your first conversation with The Beast, repeat the same steps the next day. You will then receive 15 Magnolia tokens as a reward.

  If you haven’t unlocked The Beast yet, you will have to unlock him first. To do that, first enter the Beauty and the Beast Realm from the Dream Castle, which costs 12,500 Dreamlight. Next, complete his A Prince in Disguise quest, which starts right after you complete Belle’s story quest Into The West Wing. If you haven’t done this quest, this guide can help you.

 <p>
  The Beast has a fixed schedule in the game. You can find him anywhere in the valley from 11 AM to 6 AM, including places like Chez Remy, Scrooge McDuck’s Store, the Valley, or his home. However, he sleeps at 7 AM, so you can’t talk to him then.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the biggest games of this decade. It largely succeeds in its effort to craft a worthwhile experience in the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  universe, with fun combat, engaging side activities, and memorable characters. It's a title that sold in astronomical numbers, so more is surely to come, meaning the pressure is high on Avalane Software to match, and even improve on, what it accomplished in 2023.

 <p>
  There are elements of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  that are obvious candidates for improvement, namely the diversity of the open world and the storytelling in the main campaign. However, in order for those changes to be worthwhile, the strengths of last year's offering have to be ever-present, and though it may be tempting to conjure a host of new professors, the best route for effective storytelling is to keep the existing ones, and add to their personalities.

  When
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  was announced, and it was made clear that the titular castle would play a prominent role in the story, there were naturally high expectations among fans. Thankfully, it was a joy to explore, and was a visual marvel. That can only go so far, though, as the people that roam its historic halls have to be compelling and worthy of having fleeting conversations with in order to make the space feel alive. Perhaps unlike the rest of the open world, Hogwarts School rewards those who engage with the people that litter it.

  The students were well-crafted, especially Slytherin's Sebastian Sallow, but the best part of the
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  cast is the plethora of professors that can be found in all corners of the castle. Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black is a buffoon who adds to the game's limited comedic tone, Professor Abraham Ronen's enthusiasm and positivity is infectious, and Professor Matilda Weasley's motherly nature makes the protagonist's transition to Hogwarts feel seamless. Adding to the cast would be wise, and starting fresh with completely different personalities would be a shame, as the aforementioned characters have so much potential for more future stories.

  Professors Play a Vital Role in Hogwarts Legacy
 </h3>
 <p>
  Students are subject to a lot of change at Hogwarts, but the professors serve as pillars of the school, and offer a sense of structure in the environment. Their different classrooms are indicative of who they are and what they teach, and in doing so, they give Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry a sense of identity, which is essential to
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  's tone, world-building, and replay value.

  While
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is the best of them, there have been plenty of
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  games in the past. Avalanche Software's offering takes cues from what has come before and makes the most memorable experience to date, but in doing so, it sets the bar high for a follow-up. The sequel has to maintain some level of continuity in order to build on what the first game did, and must avoid simply replacing its core features, or it runs the risk of feeling like just another
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  game, instead of capitalizing on what the first game started.

 <p>
  That continuity can come in many different forms. Using existing locations would be viable, but could hinder the exploration of the sequel to
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  . The natural way to do this, then, is to bring back familiar faces from the first story, and the best among them are the professors of Hogwarts. Having Matilda Weasley or Aesop Sharp feature once again, but in a different context could bolster their character development while also feeling like a true sequel to the highest selling game of 2023.

  NWC: Nes Edition Player Uses Glitch To Top Donkey Kong Leaderboard
 </h2>
 <p>
  In practice, at least one player has already managed to glitch their way to the top of one
  <em>
   Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition
  </em>
  weekly leaderboard. Specifically, the best run for the Barrel Roll
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  challenge in the July 22–29 period relied on a glitch that allowed the player to climb multiple invisible ladders while sticking to the right side of the screen. This allowed them to complete the level while only performing a single jump, with the entire run taking just 15.68 seconds. Twitter user MetroidMike64 was the first to report that the player used a glitch to achieve this impressive time.

  The run later appeared on Nintendo Japan's official
  <em>
   NWC: NES Edition
  </em>
  website. This prompted some complaints among the fandom, with a number of vocal players stating they were discouraged from competing after realizing that they were going against people abusing glitches. That notwithstanding, the weekly ranking videos are possibly automated, so the run's appearance on Nintendo's website does not necessarily mean that the company is now allowing glitches for beating
  <em>
   NWC: NES Edition
  </em>
  challenges.

  On the contrary, attempting to use glitches while hunting
  <em>
   NWC: NES Edition
  </em>
  S Ranks will usually result in the game suspending the run while informing the player that they had just attempted a prohibited action with an error message. That's what happens when trying to utilize the much better-known
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  glitch that allows the player to go around the screen by climbing down rather than up at a very specific spot on the bottom ladder. Ditto for any attempts at glitching out of bounds in the
  <em>

  </em>
  version of
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  It's hence possible that allowing this
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  invisible long ladder glitch was merely an oversight on Nintendo's part. But the company has yet to officially say anything one way or the other. In the meantime, some fans have started questioning
  <em>

  </em>
  's lack of live leaderboards, stating that they thought Nintendo was using the delay in publishing rankings to filter out glitch runs. But this newly emerged leaderboard suggests that may not be the case.

      <title>The 18 Best PS5 Horror Games, Ranked (August 2024)</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/ps5-playstation-5-best-horror-games/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There have been plenty of great horror games over the years, some of which have gone on to spawn multi-million dollar franchises with movies, television shows, and comic book releases. More than most though, the horror genre is one that has benefited greatly from the rise of more powerful home consoles, which has in turn provided developers with new ways to interact with and terrify their audiences.

  With its impressive processing power and state-of-the-art controller, the PS5 is a great example of this, allowing developers to create stunning environments and hit players with a heavy dose of haptic feedback whenever they see fit. The best horror games on the PlayStation 5 don't just rely on the power of the console though, instead drawing players in with their engrossing narratives, compelling characters, and unique gameplay mechanics.

  There have been some truly exceptional indie horror games over the past decade or so, from
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Yumme Nikki

  . A more recent example of this is the award-winning

  <em>
   Martha is Dead

  takes place in the fictional town of Romalia during the Second World War and sees players controlling Giulia, the twin sister of the titular character, Martha. There are no enemies for players to overcome, but they will be faced with plenty of jump scares and a healthy spattering of gore. All in all, it's a solid supernatural adventure that's well worth a look.

  Although it may not stack up to the same lofty standards set by the remakes of the series' second and fourth installments,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  is still a fantastic horror game. The ever-present set of Nemesis helps to keep players on their toes at all times, while the improved visuals and tighter controls make for a much more accessible experience than the one provided by the original game.

 <p>
  Some will perhaps argue that more could have been done to improve the user experience, with aiming and inventory management being two of the main complaints that a lot of people have. Not all of the changes to the narrative are for the better either, although most franchise fans would probably agree that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  remains faithful to the original where it matters most.

 <p>
  Initially released for PC via Steam's Early Access program in May of 2023,
  <em>
   The Outlast Trials
  </em>
  got off to a bit of a rocky start. By the time its full release rolled around in March of the following year though, most of the wrinkles had been ironed out, leaving behind a silky smooth survival horror game that once again places a heavy emphasis on stealth.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":980} -->

 <p>
  The introduction of co-operative multiplayer to the franchise further adds to the overall experience, forcing players to work in harmony if they're to have any hopes of surviving. Although jumpscares still do a lot of the heavy lifting, the sound design and environments are among the genre's finest, making this a must-play for any true horror game fan.

 <p>
  Given that
  <em>
   Alan Wake
  </em>
  was one of the best psychological horror games of the seventh console generation, the decision to greenlight a sequel was likely a fairly easy one, as too was remastering the original title for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Unfortunately, the 2021 release is nowhere near as groundbreaking as its 2010 predecessor was, but it's able to offer up a solid enough experience nonetheless.

  Though the developers made a big deal about the game's cinematic qualities, it's the storytelling that really makes it stand out. Of course, taking down Taken can still be pretty enjoyable, but it serves more as the appetizer than it does the entree. In addition to its excellent narrative, the game's use of light is particularly notable and serves as a nice contrast to some of the darker themes that are explored.

  Supermassive Games is a studio that has fully mastered the art of interactive storytelling and thus has carved out a special place for itself in the modern gaming landscape. Its games are about as close as one could ever get to playing a horror movie, with
  <em>
   The Quarry
  </em>
  arguably being the best example of what exactly the British developer is truly capable of.

 <p>
  Some may not appreciate the game's hands-off approach to action, but fans of branching narratives and player agency should love what's on offer here. The game can at times be genuinely scary too, with its summer camp setting being eerily reminiscent of the one found in
  <em>
   Friday The 13th
  </em>
  . With almost 200 different endings, the game is infinitely replayable too, and also boasts support for up to eight players.

 <p>
  After many years trapped in development hell,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  was finally released in April of 2023. Much like its predecessor, the game focuses more on providing its players with a fun experience rather than trying to spook them, but this arguably works in its favor and helps to set it apart from other open-world Zombie games like
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The story is pretty basic and certain mechanics can start to get a little repetitive after a while, but other than that, it's difficult to find too many faults with what's on offer here. The game runs well, it looks great, and, perhaps most importantly, messing up zombies feels highly enjoyable, particularly as players start to expand their arsenal of weapons a little.

  Immersion plays an important role in most of the best PS5 horror games, and
  <em>
   The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners
  </em>
  is no exception in this regard. In fact, the Tourist Edition is one of the most immersive games on the console thanks both to its PSVR 2 support and the noticeably improved visuals that it brings with it.

  Fighting off a horde of zombies in virtual reality can be absolutely terrifying, particularly once it starts to get dark outside. It's quite an exhilarating experience too though, with players needing to use a combination of melee weapons and firearms to keep themselves alive. For those who just can't get enough, the game's 2022 sequel provides more of the same, while also continuing the Tourist's story.

  Strictly speaking,
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  is more of a grimdark story, but the horror themes that it incorporates should be more than enough to satiate the desires of most horror game fans. It's also one of the hardest horror games on the PlayStation 5, making it the perfect title for both masochists and thrill-seekers alike.

  The game provides players with a unique take on the classic tale of
  <em>
   Pinocchio
  </em>
  , throwing them head-first into the dystopian city of Krat. The Soulslike mechanics should feel familiar to fans of games like
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Steelrising
  </em>
  , but that's not to say that the 2023 title doesn't still bring plenty of new ideas to the table as well.

  At a glance,
  <em>
   Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!
  </em>
  may seem like little more than your average visual novel. As is so often the case, though, you should never judge a book by its cover. This is a game that takes just about every opportunity available to subvert the player's expectations; ultimately providing them with one of the best psychological horror experiences in recent memory.

  The plus version of the game introduces additional side stories and a bunch of unlockable concept art, providing plenty of reasons for those who have already played the original to check it out. In fact, some would perhaps argue that it's better to have played the original first, as although the story remains largely unchanged, there are a few subtle differences that may not be to everybody's taste.

  When most people think of
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  , Lady Dimitrescu is usually the first thing that springs to mind. However, there's much more to the series' eighth mainline installment than just a freakishly large vampire lady with extendible fingers. In fact, some of the game's other boss fights end up being a lot more memorable and infinitely scarier too.

  Whether or not
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  can still be classed as a series about zombies is perhaps a matter for debate, but few would dare dispute its position at the forefront of the survival horror game space. Having played such a huge role in both defining and popularizing the genre back in the late nineties, it continues to push boundaries even today, replacing the mindless zombies of yesteryear with far more terrifying foes as it does so.

  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  is one of those psychological horror games in which the atmosphere does a lot of the heavy lifting. With this in mind, it certainly helps that the game's stunning sci-fi world is beautifully rendered, with everything on planet Atropos looking incredibly impressive and helping to add to the sense of impending doom that follows Selene throughout her journey like a bad odor.

  Those who are unfamiliar with the roguelike game formula may struggle with
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  at first, as playing the game can feel like an incredibly unrewarding endeavor while players are still learning the ropes. However, after a few hours once they've started to really get the hang of things, they'll discover a one-of-a-kind experience that cements
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  's place as one of the best horror games on the PS5.

  <em>
   Dredge
  </em>
  is far from a traditional horror game, with the title instead taking the form of an open-world fishing game. Rather than mackerels and herrings though, the player will instead find all kinds of ungodly sea creatures at the end of their line and even more terrifying things lurking down in the depths beneath their boat.

  It's one of a growing number of games that draw much of their inspiration from H. P. Lovecraft, with the cosmic horror author's work having had a noticeable impact on various aspects of
  <em>
   Dredge
  </em>
  's world. Players will not only be surprised by how terrifying this indie title can be at times, but also by how satisfying and addictive its fishing sim elements can be.

  Despite more than a quarter of a century having now passed since the release of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  , it still remains a certified classic. However, the 2019 remake did an excellent job of reimagining the title for modern-day audiences, with the many technological advancements allowing the team to do things that the original devs could only have dreamed of.

 <p>
  Released in mid-2022, the PS5 version of the remake runs at a higher resolution, with better textures and filtering also leading to a much crisper image. The game now boasts support for ray tracing too, which can make a huge difference in some of the areas that rely heavily on their lighting to create a sense of suspense or dramatic tension. As a result, this now serves as the definitive way to experience
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  and is a must-play for any horror game fan who has yet to do so.

  Released more than a decade on from the first game,
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  improves upon its predecessor in almost every measurable way. It's visually stunning, which really helps with immersion and makes the many jump scares that it throws at players a lot more terrifying than they might otherwise be.

 <p>
  The introduction of Agent Saga as the game's secondary protagonist breathes new life into the gameplay loop and really helps to set the game apart, as does the Mind Place mechanic. Some may not enjoy this particular brand of horror while others may find themselves wishing for more combat encounters, but most horror fans will likely love what
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  has to offer.

  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  isn't the only classic horror game series that's worthy of the remake treatment, as evidenced by EA's decision to revive the
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  franchise after a decade-long hiatus. Given the impact that the series once had on the genre, to say that expectations were high for the remake would perhaps be a bit of an understatement, and, for the first time in a long time, EA did not disappoint.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  remake is everything that a modern-day horror game should be, with dark and foreboding environments, phenomenal sound design, and some truly terrifying monsters helping to create one of the horror genre's all-time greats. The majority of Motive's changes were undoubtedly for the better, but even those that weren't were nowhere near enough to detract from the game's overall brilliance.

  Given the heavy emphasis that the game places on narrative, it can be very easy to forget that The Last of Us Part 1 is very much a survival horror game at heart. In certain places, it's able to evoke genuine feelings of terror in players and does a wonderful job of building tension and suspense and then using it to hammer home the significance of a particularly poignant plot point or encounter.

 <p>
  Although a lot of the hostile humans that players run into throughout the game are fairly generic, the Cordyceps-infected creatures that stalk them through the desolate streets and suburbs are anything but. Bloaters, Clickers, and Stalkers can really mess up a player's day and the knowledge that one or many of these foes could be lurking just around the nearest corner can help to keep players glued firmly to the edges of their seats.

  Whether or not
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  really needed a remastered version is debatable. In fact, most will probably argue that it didn't. However, that doesn't change the fact that the game remains every bit as incredible as it was when it was first released back in June of 2020, nor that the PlayStation 5 remaster is now the definitive way to experience it.

 <p>
  The game builds upon the strong foundations laid out by its predecessor in just about every possible way, while also bringing its fair share of bold and controversial narrative choices to the table. Its survival horror elements arguably take more of a back seat this time around, but they still play an important role when all's said and done.

  Given the fantastic job that Capcom did when remaking the first three
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games, it always felt as though the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  remake was going to be one of the best horror games on the PS5. That said, with the original game having differed quite a bit from those that came before it, there were quite a few question marks over how exactly the studio was going to approach the task of bringing the influential horror game up to modern-day standards.

 <p>
  What Capcom ultimately delivered was a game that felt almost like a cross between the original title and the previous two remakes. The story remains largely unchanged, though characters like Leon, Luis, and Ashley received much better characterization, with the latter's AI also being massively improved. Granted, there were a few questionable changes in the
  <em>
   RE4
  </em>
  remake like the attempt to shoehorn in side quests, though most seem to have been centered more around improving the user experience and do so to great effect.

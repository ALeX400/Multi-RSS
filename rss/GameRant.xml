  <strong>
   <em>
    World of Warcraft Classic
   </em>
  </strong>
  has changed yet again, and the
  <em>
   Cataclysm
  </em>
  of Deathwing has arrived for a second time. One of the biggest changes, and also among the most controversial, is the ability to use a flying mount anywhere in Azeroth.

  Previously, players of level 60 and up could only fly in the regions of Northrend and Outland, the high-level areas from the previous expansions. Now that Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms are also different, the skies have opened up to any player with a flying mount provided they have a Flight Masters Licence.

   An odd name for the special ability to fly in the freezing temperatures of Northrend or get a driving permit for the two continents of Old Azeroth, but both of them are listed here. The ability to summon and use a flying mount with the Flight Master's License also applies to the subterranean realm of Deepholm.

 <p>
  A character must be at least level 60 and have Artisan Riding, which is level 225, to buy a license. The Flight Master's License only costs 200 gold, which is cheap compared to the cost of other skills like Master Riding.

     This doesn't include the underwater zone of Vash'jr, but the Subdued Abyssal Seahorse is a much more efficient way to travel. It's a reward that every player gets after finishing the first few quests in the zone. Cold Weather Flying is specifically for Northrend, costs 400g, and requires level 67.

 <p>
  An open-world game allows players to freely explore their environment, without being hindered by a linear set of quests or a fixed pathway through a pre-determined storyline. Most MMORPGs are open-world, but some single-player and stand-alone games can also be designed with an open-world environment.

 <p>
  Immersion is a big factor in open-world games, and developers and writers often keep the lore and history of their creations mysterious. Part of the gameplay lies in how the complex backstory and characters are revealed as the story progresses and the players explore their world.

  These dark realms that form the setting of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  are referred to only as the Lands Between. When the game begins, this is a place of violence and turmoil, fought over by several demigods and the mortals caught in their wake. The player discovers more of the lore as the game progresses.

 <p>
  Legends speak of the power of the Elden Ring that once kept order, but Queen Marika destroyed the ring and vanished, leaving the remaining gods and humans to fight over the world she left behind. The main character, a mysterious drifter only known as The Tarnished, has to find and repair the Elden Ring. Along the way, they discover the secrets of the demigods and Marika's disappearance.

  This could also apply to the more recent, updated version of
  <em>
   Runescape,
  </em>
  since it's mostly about the lore of Gielinor, the land where the games take place. When it comes to lore, not a lot has changed in
  <em>
   Runescape
  </em>
  , although each version of the game looks different. It gives the player a vast and impressive space to roam, with plenty of mysteries to uncover, which is part of why this game is still recruiting new players more than two decades after its initial release.

 <p>
  Plenty of history and detailed quests in this game are based on the various factions, NPCs, quests, towns, and dungeons. These all include volumes of lore, and players can only find a lot of it by exploring the world and doing the quests.
  <em>
   Old School Runescape
  </em>
  isn't going to condense any of this into a cinematic cut scene either, so pay attention to that NPC's wall of text.

  Other volumes in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  franchise didn't lean into the open-world format as much as this installment, but the lore of the whole franchise is shrouded in mystery. On one hand, Gerard's mission and how he achieves it is clear, keeping with the rules of the world and the tradition of Witchers. On the other, he lives in a dark, medieval world filled with ignorance, danger, and chaotic magic.

  Gerard himself, and the Witchers as a whole, are a mysterious group that uses magic to fight monsters. However, the nature of their power, and the origin and purpose of the creatures that they hunt and destroy, aren't always as clear. Those who are more familiar with Slavic mythology have a better chance to decipher a game's secrets before they're revealed as part of the storyline.

 <p>
  A concept that's equally impressive, confusing, and perhaps even chilling considering the dystopian vision presented,
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  has been critically acclaimed for its lore and story. The game is named after the cataclysmic event that made the United States a dystopian hellscape. The main character, Sam Bridges, has to travel through this harsh environment to deliver his caches of supplies.

 <p>
  It doesn't sound like a game that would include a variety of references to existentialism, specifically death and the afterlife. However, the Death Stranding event and the malevolent Beached Things (BTs) that follow it, are supposed to come from a realm beyond death. There's also the idea of a "Bridge Baby" or a child still in utero that can help a courier like Sam detect a nearby BT. It's not only mysterious, it's also heart-rending, beautiful, and bizarre.

  Like other classic games that have been around for decades,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  has had years to enrich the story of Azeroth. However,
  <em>
   Classic
  </em>
  takes place at a time before the expansions, when the world was still a mystery. The old game retains the stories of an Old God sleeping beneath Tirisfal Glades, which turned out to be partly true, and rumors that one of the King's closest advisors in Stormwind is a black dragon in disguise.

 <p>
  Other tales that had started in the RTS games of the franchise had yet to unfold, such as the ultimate fate of the High Elves and whether the new Tree of the Night Elves, Teldrassil, would survive and thrive despite not being consecrated. Some of this lore would form the basis of the later expansions and raids, and players could experience it for themselves.

  Another MMORPG,
  <em>
   New World
  </em>
  streamlines things somewhat by starting players in a few certain areas and encouraging them towards a settlement. However, it's still very much an open-world game, with a heavy emphasis on survivalist themes. The title of the game isn't as generic as it looks; this is a reference to the Age of Exploration in real-world history, and the lost continent of Aeternum is intended to be part of the "New World" of the 16th century.

 <p>
  Unlike other games that base their lore on fantasy or sci-fi concepts with no basis in real-world history,
  <em>
   New World
  </em>
  takes ideas out of ancient history and even the Bible when it comes to the lore of the lost continent. That only deepens the mystery of the game as opposed to making it more familiar.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </em>
  </strong>
  has many references to other games in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series. While some collaborations allow players to acquire mounts or iconic outfits inspired by the other games, some of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's amazing locations are based on places that appear throughout Square Enix's franchise.

  This is the case with the Gold Saucer, inspired by
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  's amusement park. Much like in its original version, in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  it includes mini-games through which players can get Manderville Gold Saucer Points (MGP) that can be exchanged for rewards. But before players can venture into this area and use its features, it's necessary to unlock it - here is how!

  The first thing players will need to unlock the Gold Saucer is to reach level 15 and complete the quest "The Gridanian Envoy", "The Lominsan Envoy", or "The Ul'dahn Envoy", according to their starting city. This will unlock airship travel, as well as make the level 15 quest

  Players will need to head to Ul'dah - Steps of Nald to interact with the Well-heeled Youth (X: 9.6, Y: 9.0) to initiate the quest. He will share tales of his good fortune and explain that his prizes are a result of his exploits in the Gold Saucer, a new entertainment venue popular with Ul'dahns. The character will then give the adventurer a golden airship ticket that must be presented to Elyenora (X: 10.7, Y: 11.1) at the Airship Landing (talk to Willahelm (X: 10.7, Y: 10.3) in Ul'dah - Steps of Nald to get there). After making sure the ticket is valid, she will send the player to the Gold Saucer, and following a cutscene, the quest will be complete.

     It's possible to travel to the Gold Saucer by airship, but it's easier to attune to the aetheryte there to return by teleporting any time you want, so don't forget to do that! The place also has aethernet shards that make it easier to move around after attuning to each of them.

  When the player first arrives at the venue, they should speak to the Airship Ticketer (X: 5.3, Y: 8.0) and complete the quest
  <strong>
   "World of Wonders"
  </strong>
  to receive five Gold Saucer tickets that can be redeemed for one free play at any of the park's mini attractions. Throughout the quest, the player will learn more about the location and all it has to offer, and they will come across the Gold Saucer Attendant (X: 4.8, Y: 6.7) in Entrance Square. Speaking to this NPC allows players to exchange gil for MGP, which is necessary to participate in the various mini-games available. Do note that this is restricted to players who have less than 500 MGP, and that MGP cannot be exchanged for gil.

  Xbox chief marketing officer Jerret West is leaving the company for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Prior to his time at Xbox, West worked as the vice president of marketing at Netflix. With this track record,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  may be getting ready for a big push in a new direction. There could be plenty of changes headed to
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  , but there are no certainties, and it's possible that the priority is simply expanding the player base of an already massive game.

  Xbox has recently won trust after a standout Xbox Games Showcase, but the past year has been somewhat tumultuous for the brand. Many gamers have complained about a lack of sufficient exclusives for the Xbox platform, which eventually led to executives admitting on the company's behalf that, for the time being, Xbox has lost the console wars. Many believe this was posturing to make Xbox appear sympathetic during its trial with the Federal Trade Commission. However, the Xbox did appear to be losing sales in comparison to the Switch and PS5.

  The Verge reports that the end of June, Xbox CMO Jerret West will be ending his time at Xbox and joining the team at Roblox Corporation. For the time being at Xbox, Chris Lee is responsible for Xbox Marketing, and the games marketing department will be absorbed by the game content and studios division that Matt Booty is in charge of. Jerret West's role for
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  will be similar to his last, as he will maintain the CMO title along with becoming the head of market expansion for the company. Although it is currently unclear what this immediately means for
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  's future, it appears those managing the property trust in its ability to grow further. Although the game does have competition,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  is a hit with young gamers.

  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  has seen massive growth over the past few years. Many have been aware of the potential behind
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  for some time now. The title exists as a platform to host other games, allowing it to exist in the same space as other hits like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . There appear to be limitless possibilities for what the future of
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  might be as a game or platform, and that potential could extend to what its upcoming marketing focus might be.

 <p>
  There is a chance that
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  could follow in the steps of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , which maintains its success in part from the dedicated support for game modes by Developers at Epic, including new additions such as
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  appears to be entertaining the idea in some capacity, recently featuring a
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  and Chucky crossover. Going forward, Roblox Corporation could ramp up the scale and scope of collabs and pull in an even wider audience.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Soulmask
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players will need to adapt to the wilderness and use the resources around them to survive, grow stronger, and progress through their journey. There will be many different items that can be obtained along the way, both through harvesting natural resources or hunting game in the wild, as well as crafting new creations or discovering loot.

  One of the many items that players can obtain in
  <em>
   Soulmask
  </em>
  is Sunstones. However, it's not always super obvious just what Sunstones are supposed to do, or what the players should do with them. Luckily, if you find yourself confused regarding this matter, then
  <strong>
   everything you'll need to know about Sunstones and their use has been explained in the guide below
  </strong>

  In
  <em>
   Soulmask
  </em>
  , your Mask grants you unique abilities that enable you to take charge of your survival, recruit new Tribe members, and more. However, the power of your Mask is not infinite, and it will run out over time. Luckily, you can recharge your Mask with the use of Sunstones, but these items can be quite tricky to locate.

 <p>
  Sunstones are acquired by completing dungeon runs within Ruins, with several different Ruins available to visit and explore during your playthrough of the game. After clearing the Ruins of any enemies or creatures, you will be able to progress to the end, where you will now be able to unlock a relic or chest to gain some very beneficial rewards. One of these rewards is a Sunstone, which will be guaranteed upon completing each Ruins dungeon run.

 <p>
  After acquiring a Sunstone, you can open your inventory, select it, and press the E key on your keyboard to activate this item. Upon doing so, you will restore charge to your Mask, and be able to continue using this powerful ability to your advantage. However, it is important to note that your Sunstone may have a
  <strong>
   'Not Enough Charge' error message
  </strong>
  present on it.

 <p>
  In this case, you don't need to worry - there is no need to charge your Sunstones, this is simply a misunderstanding. As long as you have not used that particular Sunstone to charge your Mask, you will be able to do so. Once this has been done, you will need to locate another Sunstone for the next time you need to charge your Mask, as they can not be restored in power, but can be stacked for restoration.

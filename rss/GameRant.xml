   <em>
    Sons of the Forest
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a survival horror game in which players must craft to survive — creating weapons, armor, and complex structures — in order to fend off the other cannibalistic inhabitants of a deeply mysterious island. Throughout the game, there are a series of hidden blueprints that enable players to construct advanced equipment and structures for their bases, as well as providing unique functions such as teleportation and resource extraction.

  The blueprints are scattered around the map, though the majority can be found within various caves and abandoned buildings on the western side of the map. An array of new traps and lighting devices have also been added, so players can truly elevate their bases to another level with these upgrades. This guide will detail where to find each blueprint in
  <em>
   Sons of the Forest

  The Powered Cross blueprint will enable players to construct light bulb-studded crosses as a base defense, which will pacify enemies when encountered. The blueprint can be found in "Cave A," also known as the "Rebreather Cave" on the
  <strong>
   north coast of the island
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Once inside, players should keep to the right and follow the cave on the right-hand side, then turn left once the pathway goes upward. Here, several mutants and upside-down crosses will be visible, along with some kind of
  <strong>
   fungal birthing sack
  </strong>
  . Pass by this to the entrance blocked by wooden planks. Smash through the plants and
  <strong>
   head down the rope
  </strong>
  into the hole in the ground. Here, the blueprint can be found along with several skeletons and more upside-down crosses.

  The Glider Launch is used to construct a launchpad for the Glider, enabling players to fly off cliffs and traverse the island in an entirely new way. To the northwest of the island's main mountain, players will see a number of
  <strong>
   intersecting rivers
  </strong>
  . Where the rivers join, a cave can be found with several dead workers outside its entrance. It will be necessary to break through some wooden planks in order to gain access.

 <p>
  Once inside, head down past the skeletons and bodies inside and stick to going straight on. While there are pathways leading to the left and upward, the blueprint is to be found
  <strong>
   deep in the back of the cave
  </strong>
  near some skeletons.

  The blueprint for the gore chair can be found in the set of

  on the southwestern point of the main island. Simply break down one of the stick entrances to the central building. There, the blueprint can be found on the floor next to an impaled skeleton.

  To find the Gore Couch blueprints, players will need to head to the frozen lake on the central mountain, next to which there stands an
  <strong>
   abandoned wooden shelter

  . Inside, players can find various useful items, such as batteries and the blueprints themselves.

  This will enable players to construct the Gore Couch, a furniture item crafted out of a disgusting amalgamation of body parts. It can add a very menacing look to any base or room in which it is placed, and it can provide a convenient resting point wherever it is built.

  The Clock in
  <em>
   Sons of the Forest

  is, as one might expect, not an ordinary clock. Instead, it is
  <strong>
   constructed from several body parts
  </strong>
  and miscellaneous items found throughout the game world. However, it can be very useful when planning excursions or tracking the habits of scouting enemies.

  To find the blueprint, players need to head up to the

   Ice Cave

  near the frozen lake on the central mountain. The entrance can be found near the river flowing westward.

Here, several more coffins and skeletons will be strewn around, with the Clock blueprints next to one of them.

  The Spotlight is a
  <strong>
   lighting accessory
  </strong>
  for players to use around their bases and can greatly help with defense, particularly at nighttime. To find the blueprints, head to the cliffs near the eastern bay and look for the
  <strong>
   red flare,
  </strong>
  which is also marked by a blue question mark on the GPS map.

 <p>
  Upon finding the flare, head into the nearby cave and down the ropes inside. At the bottom, there will be a room with two blocked entrances. One leads to a smaller room with several small items, while the other leads to a larger room. From the larger room, break through the second doorway into the
  <strong>
   room filled with upside-down skeletons
  </strong>
  , then descend behind them and take the next rope down. The Spotlight blueprints can be found on top of a small wooden crate in this deep section of the cave.

  The Spin Trap is a useful base defense that triggers automatically when cannibals pass nearby and proceeds to whirl two twin-raked spike traps at head height. This can be an excellent trap to place near entryways and chokepoints where enemies are likely to pass.

  The Bone Tower Repeller is a powerful base defense that repels enemies — rather than damaging them in the way ordinary traps do. This intimidating structure should be enough to keep most enemies away, in the same way that normal effigies might.

  To find the blueprints, head to the small cave in the center of the bending roads near the lake on the southeast side of the island. The entrance can be spotted as it is covered with planks of wood and has
  <strong>
   two dead workers either side of it,

  which look abnormal against the rocks. Break through the wooden entrance and head inside to the deeper part of the cave. Inside, the blueprint can be found

  The Grind Trap is an absolutely brutal device that catches enemies by the leg and pulls them into a
  <strong>
   motor-powered meat-grinder
  </strong>
  made of sticks. While quite costly in terms of materials, it is well worth seeking out this blueprint as it is one of the best defenses in
  <em>
   Sons of the Forest
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  To find the blueprint, head to "
  <strong>
   Cave G
  </strong>
  " on the northwest side of the island, near the abandoned village by the coast. Break through the entrance of the long building and then down through the blocked passage in the floor. This will lead to a cave with two doorways, break through the barred doorway and head down the rope into the caverns below. At the bottom, head through the thinner of the two exits on the left-hand side, and follow the passage upward to the next blocked doorway.

   behind the waterfall

  The Multi Trap is a useful defense that utilizes shock, burn, and kinetic damage to obliterate any enemies that come near it. While it can offer enemies the chance to get an extra hit off, it will stick them to the ground before it closes, which can be especially devastating if multiple enemies are caught inside it at the same time.

  The Leg Lamp is a base lighting device that allows players to create lamps out of the severed legs of their enemies. These can be used either indoors or out, but they work particularly well as an interior lighting device for larger rooms.

  The blueprints for the Leg Lamp are relatively easy to find. Simply head to the big river flowing from the central mountain on the southeastern side of the map, then look for the blue map marker or
  <strong>
   red flare nearby
  </strong>
  . This will lead to a partially constructed wooden building with a basement that can be broken into. Inside the basement/cave, the blueprint can be found on a table with several skeletons laid across it.

  The Item Plating structure will enable players to upgrade their weapons and armor with Solafite, leading to an average
  <strong>
   performance increase of around 30%
  </strong>
  for each item it is applied to. This can be very useful and even considered essential for facing off against some late-game enemies.

  The Armor Upgrade is a necessary blueprint to obtain in order to complete the game's main story. It will help
  <strong>
   craft Golden Armor
  </strong>
  , which is necessary for getting through the Gold Door leading to the
  <strong>
   Hell Cave
  </strong>
  in the Luxury Bunker. The bunker can be infiltrated through several entrances, but the easiest one to enter through is on the east coast of the island near the river that leads to the sea.

 <p>
  Inside the bunker, head downstairs to the lowest possible floor, then pass through the surgical-style corridors and the museum area with framed paintings. From here, head through to the private rooms and eventually to the one with a
  <strong>
   purple curtain at the far end
  </strong>
  of it. Before reaching the curtain, turn right and pass through the destroyed bathroom. On the other side of the broken steam pipe, the Gold door will be accessible via an adjoining cave.

  Solafite is a powerful but rare resource in
  <em>

  , so it can help to have the equipment to generate Solafite from anywhere on the map. This device will enable players to do so, thereby improving their weapons, armor, and base in numerous ways at once.

  The blueprint can be found by heading to the

   beach on the western side of the island

  . Here, a cave can be found with a small fence around it. Head inside until you find the cave with several upside-down skeletons. Past these, there will be a lot of skulls on the floor, and the blueprint can be found there among them.

  The Teleporter is a useful time-saving device, enabling players to fast travel between different points on the map. It can only be used in conjunction with a
  <em>

  Artifact, enabling players to travel to the active teleporter from anywhere on the map — provided they have the Artifact equipped.

  To find the Teleporter blueprints, head to the

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Cyberpunk 2077 has 7 important variants of motorcycles that can be found within Night City and Dogtown. Whilst there are plenty of motorcycles accessible in the game, they are all under 3 categories of speed, and the only differences that they have are purely cosmetic, and how to obtain them. Luckily, Cyberpunk 2077's best motorcycles all provide intense speeds, allowing players to utilize their weaponry as they reach over 100 MPH.

  Music and audio are such a massive part of video games these days. They provide an extra ambiance to really give the players a sense of immersion. Oftentimes, they just really make the games themselves so much more fun to play. Some games take their auditory capabilities to the next level, and others go for realism and fan service by adding selectable radio stations in their games. Cyberpunk 2077 is one such game.

  Swords in your arms. It’s really that simple. The Mantis Blade are among the coolest and least practical updates you can get. What’s the issue? Well, there are many times in Cyberpunk when you resort to your fists to resolve a situation without getting too messy, and even if you can sheath your blades, it’s the muscle memory and quick impulses that accidentally escalate a quick jab into a vivisection.

      <title>Best Multiplayer Games On PlayStation Plus Extra &amp; Premium (July 2024)</title>

  In 2022, Sony decided to revamp
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  , combining the original service with PS Now. The result was a three-tiered system that permits PS5 and PS4 owners to pick their investment. If someone simply wants to play online, they can get the Essential tier, which also comes with a few games per month. The next level, Extra, grants access to hundreds of PS5 and PS4 games, a selection that is topped up every month. Finally, the Premium tier throws in a vast collection of classic titles from the PS3, PS2, PS1, and PSP eras.

 <p>
  While there are exceptions, anyone looking to play an online PvP game will likely need to subscribe to PS Plus Essential. The Extra and Premium tiers provide all the benefits found in the lowest tier, but they also include quite a few competitive titles that make use of that online accessibility. The available selection also covers a reasonably wide range of genres, so most people should be able to find something that interests them. Here are the
  <strong>

  PS Plus Essential's July 2024 lineup is stacked with multiplayer goodness. Co-op fans can pick up
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  , a reliable first-person shooter with great loot, build options, and solid gunplay. Sure, the story is polarizing, but that is a minor criticism when played with a few friends. Sports fans can pick up
  <em>
   NHL 24
  </em>
  , EA's hockey game that is winding down as it prepares to be replaced by the newest model. These types of seasonal releases attract plenty of understandable criticism, but they can be fun with a few friends or even against strangers.

 <p>
  While both of those are great freebies in their own right, the month's biggest multiplayer game is undoubtedly
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  . Now, admittedly, InnerSloth's social deduction project arguably peaked in popularity a few years ago, and it feels somewhat like old news in this day and age. That said,
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  is still fairly active, even if it is no longer that hot of a product. And, the gameplay loop is simple but effective, delivering a surprisingly intense experience for such a silly-looking game.

 <p>
  For the uninitiated, matches drop a group of players on a sci-fi-themed map and challenge them to complete tasks. However, a few of the Crewmates are Impostors who want to sabotage and kill everyone else. Basically, it is
  <em>
   Werewolf
  </em>
  but in space.
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  is just a fun option to throw on when somebody has 30 minutes to waste.

  <em>
   NBA 2K24
  </em>
  is polarizing, to say the least. Each new entry in 2K's franchise seems to garner a more divisive reaction than the last, and the 2023 release did not buck this trend. Focusing solely on the gameplay,
  <em>
   NBA 2K24
  </em>
  offers a challenging sim that pays close attention to detail. On the court, the action is as impressive as any other basketball project on the market, although someone's mileage may vary depending on whether they prefer realism or an arcade-style experience.

 <p>
  Away from the gameplay,
  <em>
   NBA 2K24
  </em>
  throws a lot at the player, including a wide range of modes that cater to both single-player and multiplayer. Although not ignoring the former, the game's priority is the latter, as it has been for years by this point. MyTeam serves as the game's multiplayer hub, and it comes with a few modes like Salary Cap and Triple Threat. Unlocking new cards is a grind, and beginners will feel like they are playing catch-up since the game is now flooded with players who have accumulated well-rounded teams. However,
  <em>
   NBA 2K24
  </em>
  is still attracting new players, especially since its PS Plus Extra debut.

  <em>
   Deceive Inc.
  </em>
  has a great concept for a competitive multiplayer game, and it is executed well enough to warrant a recommendation despite not having the biggest playerbase. That said, on the PS5, populated matches are still relatively viable, even if someone's success rate may depend on what time they are logged in. So, what do matches consist of? Well, players take on the role of spies who are infiltrating fairly expansive maps so they can try to steal an item from a vault. If they are successful, they must then escape via flying car extraction.
  <em>
   Deceive Inc.
  </em>
  has a '70s aesthetic and vibe, both in its character designs and general tone, which leans into spy thrillers from that decade. While derivative to an extent, the game has a unique look that sets it apart from other multiplayer shooters.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1051} -->

 <p>
  Now, obviously, players will not be the only ones trying to break into the vault, as every spy will be working towards that goal. Whether playing solo or as part of a team,
  <em>
   Deceive Inc.
  </em>
  emphasizes stealth and keeping a low profile, with disguises being arguably each player's best weapon (except for, you know, guns). Especially during the insertion phase (which involves acquiring intel, swapping disguises, accessing restricted areas, and disabling terminals), players will want to blend in with the many, many NPCs and avoid being signaled out as a spy by AI guards or other players. When the latter happens, gun fights quickly break out, transforming
  <em>
   Deceive Inc.
  </em>
  into a more conventional PvP shooter. It is even possible to win matches by just eliminating all the other spies too.

  Despite a somewhat rough launch,
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  has managed to establish itself as a prominent figure in the online scene, and part of the game's appeal is its flexibility. At its core, Funcom's project adheres to the survival genre's fundamentals, which means a heavy focus on base building and resource management. However, the title also takes ideas from action RPGs for its combat system, along with providing a narrative framework to cater to people who might prefer a more focused experience.

  FromSoftware's Souls-like projects generally feature multiplayer, even if it is typically optional. Bluepoint Games'
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  remake retains this element, allowing players to take part in either PvP or online co-op sessions. Focusing on the former, players who are in soul form can invade someone else's game by using a Black Eye Stone. At this point, they will appear as a phantom in the other user's world, resulting in a fight for survival. The winner is rewarded with souls, and if the invader succeeds, they regain their human form. Only players who are in human form can be invaded, so the PvP aspect can be ignored by just remaining in soul form.

  Alternatively, players can use a Red Eye Stone to send a signal to other worlds declaring that they wish to engage in a PvP duel. Once accepted, the player will be summoned to that world as a phantom. A Blue Eye Stone does essentially the same thing, although it is for co-op play rather than PvP action.

  Debuting more than half a decade ago,
  <em>
   For Honor
  </em>
  has more than proven its staying power, and the game's appeal is not difficult to comprehend. Ubisoft's title brings together some of the most iconic warrior archetypes from across history – Knights Samurai, Vikings, Wu Lin, and the Outlanders – and pits them in gory battles to determine who reigns supreme. This golden concept is backed by a deep melee combat system that blends immediacy with strategic complexity, permitting fights to feel both spontaneous and fair.

 <p>
  Although there is a single-player campaign that covers the basics of combat, multiplayer is undoubtedly
  <em>
   For Honor
  </em>
  's reason for being. The game offers a solid selection of modes that permit players to decide whether they would rather work in a team or engage in solo battles. There are more than two dozen heroes available, all of which come with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses; it might take a few hours, but every player should be able to find a warrior that suits them. Intimidating as this title can be at times, as one of the
  <strong>
   best multiplayer games on PS Plus Premium and Extra
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   For Honor

  is worth the investment.

  is an exciting prospect on paper and in execution. A Kaiju-themed arena brawler, the game brings together a respectable selection of fighters inspired by heavyweights in the massive monster and sentai sphere. The story campaign highlights four monsters, granting players an opportunity to rampage through a few locations while taking on a few other members of the roster. While it has a short shelf life, this mode works well enough as an introductory option, and if someone plans to stick to solo play, they should be able to get a few hours of fun. However,
  <em>
   Gigabash
  </em>
  is undoubtedly designed to be enjoyed in multiplayer, be it co-op or competitive. The former allows players to team up to engage in glorious monster mashes; meanwhile, the competitive portion supports up to four participants. The PvP mode supports team-based matches or just a standard survival of the fittest.

  There are quite a few racing games on PS Plus Premium, and they cover a wide spectrum of styles. There are arcade racers like
  <em>
   Split/Second: Velocity
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   WipEout: Omega Collection
  </em>
  , kart classics such as
  <em>
   Jak X: Combat Racing
  </em>
  , and a number of sims that strive for realism above anything else.
  <em>
   Assetto Corsa Competizione
  </em>
  falls within the latter category; in fact, even among racing sims, this game stands out for its unforgiving and grounded nature.

  A driver will need to dedicate dozens of hours toward mastering a specific vehicle and track before they should even consider heading online to face off against other players. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Competizione
  </em>
  comes with quite a long single-player campaign, so newcomers have something to do while they come to grips with the gameplay. Once they feel comfortable enough to jump online, players can look forward to competitive and clean races.

  NetherRealm Studios'
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  debuted on a polarizing note. On the one hand, the game presents a convincing case for having the deepest combat system in the franchise, one that slows things down to encourage strategic and smart play rather than combo spamming. The single-player story mode is also a ton of gory fun, delivering over-the-top mayhem in a way that only
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  can. Honestly, the title is worth downloading just for the campaign, especially as
  <em>
   MK11
  </em>
  approaches the end of its lifespan with the impending launch of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Fun as the story is,
  <em>
   MK11
  </em>
  has lasted for as long as it has due to its multiplayer. Any modern fighting game worth its salt will deliver a robust selection of online modes, and NetherRealm Studios did not hold back in this area. While the selection is not necessarily unique,
  <em>
   MK11
  </em>
  provides all the multiplayer staples someone might expect. Now, after all these years on the scene, the online sphere is dominated by veterans, which can be off-putting for newcomers. Still,
  <em>
   MK11
  </em>
  is one of the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus multiplayer games

  PS Plus Extra has both
  <em>
   The Division
  </em>
  games, and while the first title is worth playing due to its unique setting and solid narrative, the sequel is the better pick for multiplayer.
  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  takes place in Washington D.C. and largely revolves around gang warfare. The central storyline will keep players busy for quite a while as they take on missions either solo or in co-op. Although not a requirement to finish the campaign, the latter is nonetheless one of the RPG's selling points, especially since co-op highlights
  <em>
   The Division 2
  </em>
  's versatile character-build options.

  Debuting in 1995,
  <em>
   Worms
  </em>
  is a staple of the multiplayer scene, particularly on PlayStation consoles. While not quite as popular as some other heavyweights, the franchise is generally quite consistent, with most of its entries offering accessible strategy fun that contains more depth than might initially seem to be the case.
  <em>
   Worms Rumble
  </em>
  was a departure from the status quo, but its predecessor,
  <em>
   Worms W.M.D.
  </em>
  was a relatively conventional expansion of the license's traditional gameplay loop. Players who grew up on
  <em>
   Worms Armageddon
  </em>
  will likely get a kick out of the 2016 release, especially if they manage to find a few friends who are willing to jump on board for a match.

  As always, battles consist of armies of slang-spewing worms who seem to have a death wish and are always one wrong crawl from meeting an explosive end. With a focus on short turnarounds,
  <em>
   Worms W.M.D.
  </em>
  moves at a fast pace for a strategy title, and its challenge comes from players having to make quick AND smart decisions. Single-player options are available, and newcomers will want to start offline so they can get used to the game's various weapons and mechanics. Nowadays, online matches against strangers can be difficult to come by, although it is not impossible; however,
  <em>
   Worms W.M.D.
  </em>
  is a blast when played with friends. The PvP supports up to 6 players, so battles can get chaotic very quickly.

  At one point or another, most people have probably played
  <em>
   Monopoly
  </em>
  . One of the most inescapable board games of all time, the original title's popularity is only matched by its infamous reputation for sparking arguments and frustration. It is safe to say that
  <em>
   Monopoly
  </em>
  is polarizing, and quite a few people might physically shiver at the thought of playing a digital version. However,
  <em>
   Monopoly Madness
  </em>
  does a great job of translating the core ideas behind the source material into a party game that is frantic, fun, and – most importantly – brief. Thankfully, these matches come with a strict time limit that ensures players won't be stuck in an endless battle for hours on end.

  has single-player content courtesy of a story mode that lasts for a few hours. This type of project could have easily skipped over this option, but it is nice to have it. That said, the game's appeal is its online PvP, which allows up to 6 players to compete in a chaotic but satisfying rush to acquire the most property and, ultimately, cash.

 <p>
  Usually, fighters that have been out for a few years can be inaccessible to newcomers since their bases would largely consist of veterans and experts, but Arc's
  <em>
   Dragon Ball FighterZ
  </em>
  has a relatively low entry barrier for beginners. Compared to the developer's other anime fighters, this release streamlines its controls and mechanics. More importantly, the single-player campaign teaches the basics quite well; in fact, players who plan to play through the story should skip the practice mode as they will be taught the same stuff.

 <p>
  That is all well and good, but none of it would matter if
  <em>
   Dragon Ball FighterZ
  </em>
  was not great. Even though PS Plus Extra is hardly lacking in fighters, Arc's project stands out from the crowd through its visuals and addictive gameplay loop. The title looks just as good, if not better, than its animated source material, particularly when a character executes a superattack. The combat is fast-paced but manageable, all the while offering more than enough depth for people who want to master the game's nuances.

 <p>
  Like the single-player experience,
  <em>
   Need for Speed Unbound
  </em>
  's multiplayer portion is the definition of a mixed bag. While the two modes are linked in a few ways (for instance, certain cars unlocked in single-player can be used in multiplayer), they are largely separate; consequently, someone can just decide to focus on what side of the equation they prefer. At launch,
  <em>
   Unbound
  </em>
  's multiplayer garnered criticism for incorporating an extensive grind to unlock new cars, along with just being quite empty. Nowadays, things have improved, even if it can still take quite a while to pick up a car a player might want.
  <em>
   Unbound
  </em>
  also has a roadmap for 2024, so it should be supported by Criterion for the foreseeable future.

 <p>
  Along with PvP races,
  <em>
   Unbound
  </em>
  also includes a pretty fun co-op option that allows up to 16 players to work together to complete objectives. These events are a great way to gain XP and tend to hog most of the attention. Since lobbies are quite small, it can be difficult to find people to race against, which is a shame as the gameplay is rock solid.
  <em>
   Unbound
  </em>
  plays well and shines when going up against other people rather than the AI. Ultimately, this racing game's multiplayer can produce moments of brilliance, but it is hard to fully recommend if someone is not interested in playing the solo option for a while.

  Although it launched to a somewhat mediocre reception,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  is staring down a decade of success. Since 2014, the MMORPG has produced seven expansions, most of which were positively received by the community. Now, anyone looking to get the full experience will need to purchase the additional content individually or pick up the
  <em>
   Necrom Collection
  </em>
  , which contains the base game and all the currently released chapters (but not any future expansions). Due to the necessary investment, it does not make too much sense to not own the base game, especially since a copy can typically be found for a fairly low price.

 <p>
  So, what is the value of having
  <em>
   ESO
  </em>
  on PS Plus Extra? Primarily, its inclusion allows people who are on the fence to try out the game without having to drop any extra cash. They can sample the four base classes and experience the early quests and exploration. Although most of the expansions eclipse the vanilla content, the latter is still of high quality and serves as a more than adequate sample of the game's fundamental mechanics. The project requires a PS Plus subscription regardless of whether someone owns a physical copy or not, so newcomers might as well give it a try before committing to the life-consuming MMO.

  seemingly came and went without making too much noise, which is typically a death sentence for an online-driven package like this. Fortunately, Ubisoft's open-world game allows most of its content to be experienced with either other players or AI, so
  <em>
   Riders Republic

  can still be enjoyed even during spells when there are not too many people online. Ubisoft has also supported the game well since its debut; for example, a 2023 update added hoverboards.

  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  had a notoriously terrible launch, to the point of becoming something of a laughingstock. More than five years later, the MMO has evolved into something worth a recommendation, and it works quite well as both a single-player and multiplayer option. Now, PvP is a very small part of the overall package and is not considered to be among the game's main selling points; however, players can engage in some competitive play if they feel so inclined. Still, this title should not be anyone's first pick if they are specifically craving PvP.

  Due to its genre,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  arguably does not get going until its endgame, an area that the project excels in. Once people have played through most of the main campaign, they can focus on things like raid bosses and events, while looking forward to a constant stream of updates.

  <em>
   Blood Bowl 3
  </em>
  does not warrant an enthusiastic recommendation as Cynaide's turn-based sports game is, unfortunately, not great. While its predecessors are outdated nowadays, they were solid adaptations of the tabletop source material, presenting coaches with another avenue to build their dream monster teams.
  <em>
   Blood Bowl 3
  </em>
  launched in a terrible state that left a stench that has yet to dissipate; however, the core experience has improved since early 2023. Just to be clear, the current version is still far from brilliant and has little to offer as a single-player option, with "vs AI" matches only really acting as a way to accumulate hours in pursuit of accumulating currency to unlock teams. The offline seasons are too simplistic to amount to much.

  Obviously,
  <em>
   Blood Bowl 3
  </em>
  is all about online PvP, with players working their way through leagues. Focusing solely on multiplayer, this project can be quite fun, especially when played with a few friends. Due to being based on the latest ruleset, the game does a decent job of replicating the tabletop's current gameplay, although it is let down somewhat by technical issues and a poor User Interface. For all its flaws,
  <em>
   Blood Bowl 3
  </em>
  is still quite a unique PvP option that has no real peers of PS Plus Extra or Premium. While not perfect, it can be entertaining.

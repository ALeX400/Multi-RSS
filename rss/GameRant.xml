  <strong>
   Bandai Namco Entertainment
  </strong>
  has recently filed for a new trademark on EUIPO, the European Union Intellectual Property Office, and the gaming community has wasted no time in trying to figure out the publisher’s supposed new game. A recent trailer for Bandai Namco’s upcoming dark fantasy RPG
  <em>
   The Blood of Dawnwalker
  </em>
  has accumulated a lot of hype, but the company’s new trademark could hint at the revival of a timeless classic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bandai Namco has covered several video game genres during its longevity as a publisher, including the
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  series and the
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  franchise. Additionally, Bandai Namco is preparing to host the anticipated
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  closed beta test, which will take place in February. The FromSoftware spin-off was a notable reveal from last year’s The Game Awards, and Soulslike fans can’t wait to dive into the next punishing chapter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Appearing on EUIPO's official website, which is a company dedicated to protecting businesses’ intellectual properties within the European Union, a trademark appeared from Bandai Namco titled "Time Stranger," which was filed on January 10, 2025. Bandai Namco previously filed a
  <em>
   Tales of Arise
  </em>
  trademark in 2022, preceding the release of
  <em>
   Tales of Symphonia Remastered
  </em>
  in 2023 and the upcoming
  <em>
   Tales of Graces f Remastered
  </em>
  , and fans have an inkling of what the new trademark could be for. Most agreed that it was sadly unlikely to be a
  <em>
   Doctor Wh
  </em>
  o game.

 <p>
  Gamers are convinced Bandai Namco is working on a new
  <em>
   Time Crisis
  </em>
  game, as the company previously registered trademark applications for
  <em>
   Time Crisis
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Steel Gunner
  </em>
  to cover goods including “arcade video game machines” in 2022.
  <em>
   Time Crisis
  </em>
  is one of the most iconic and best arcade games from the 90s. It is a first-person light gun shooter that follows a fictional intelligence agency that assigns special agents to deal with serious threats made by criminals, terrorists, and hostile organizations. Redditors added the trademark could cover a new IP from the
  <em>
   Code Vein
  </em>
  /
  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus
  </em>
  devs, or possibly a
  <em>
   Tales of Phantasia
  </em>
  remake with “Time Stranger” in the title, since time travel plays a part in the premise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bandai Namco has a fruitful working relationship with developer FromSoftware, having produced the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , and the
  <em>
   Armored Core
  </em>
  series together. Looking ahead, gamers have much to expect from FromSoftware in 2025, including the full release of
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  and "multiple projects in the works across a variety of genres,” previously stated by company president Hidetaka Miyazaki.

      <title>Honkai: Star Rail's Fate/Stay Night Crossover Characters Should Only Be the Tip of the Iceberg</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/honkai-star-rails-fate-stay-night-more-crossover-characters/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Today's gamers are fortunate that there is an abundance of gaming crossovers across different genres. There’s the long-running
  <em>
   Marvel VS. Capcom
  </em>
  series for fighting games as well as
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ’s many skin and event collaborations with everything from the Gundam franchise to the iconic Jordan brand. Gachas like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  have also been joining in on the fun, with the game releasing its crossover with the visual novel game
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night
  </em>
  this year. This is
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  ’s very first crossover, and it shouldn’t be the last for this game and its siblings.

  The collaboration between
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night
  </em>
  was first announced during the game’s Version 2.4 livestream. Players got a hint of one of the
  <em>
   Fate
  </em>
  characters joining the crossover during
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  ’s trailer during Gamescom 2024. It seems that the voice that called Pom-Pom his new master is Archer, a popular hero/villain/antagonist of the
  <em>
   Fate
  </em>
  franchise.

  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night
  </em>
  seem like a great match, as both have anime art styles. Even though
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  focuses more on science fiction, it still employs a lot of fantasy elements, as evident in its latest Amphoreus storyline. Therefore,
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night
  </em>
  ’s mages and warriors will likely feel right at home in
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  ’s universe. Whether this crossover will be a success or not, the collaborations shouldn’t stop there. These events have various benefits which can affect not just
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  , but other titles in the HoYoVerse.
 </p>
 <h3 id="hoyoverse-rsquo-s-games-are-perfect-platforms-for-collaboration">
  HoYoverse’s Games are Perfect Platforms for Collaboration
 </h3>
 <p>
  The most popular HoYoverse games,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  are perfect platforms for crossovers with other games. This is because the lore behind the games already suggests that an infinite number of worlds and universes exist. The existence of characters from other games can be chalked up to that explanation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The challenge is finding intriguing collaborations, like the upcoming
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night
  </em>
  crossover. However, HoYoverse can play it safe by choosing games and media that fit each title’s genre or do the opposite by creating some zany collaborations. It would be interesting to see a
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  x
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  collab, with Zagreus slicing through Hollows in New Eridu, or a
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  crossover with Arsene being Joker’s Memosprite.

 <p>
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  ’s older sibling,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , had a big crossover way back in 2021. This collaboration let players unlock a
  <em>
   Genshin
  </em>
  version of
  <em>
   Horizon: Zero Dawn
  </em>
  ’s Aloy for free from Version 2.1 to 2.2. While her overall design is great, her gameplay is less optimal compared to other Cryo units. It seems like
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has stopped doing collaborations with other games altogether since then, too. It’s been almost four years and nothing at that scale has been done in the game again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   HSR
  </em>
  can learn from
  <em>
   Genshin
  </em>
  ’s mistakes by making its
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night
  </em>
  collab characters borderline overpowered, like most of its new releases. This way, players have a good incentive to unlock and use them in the game. The units’ releases should also be supported by a good story arc, as some players were disappointed at the fact that Aloy didn’t have a proper reason as to why she suddenly appeared in Teyvat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fate/Stay Night
  </em>
  collab is one of the most ambitious events in the HoYoverse games so far. One can only hope that the game continues to drum up ideas for future crossovers. There is a world of possibilities for similar events for these games, and they can propel each title’s popularity to new heights if done correctly.

  To get promoted in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  , you'll need to head to the main house in
  <strong>
   Zen Forest
  </strong>
  . You’ll easily spot it, as the Storyline NPC and Heavenly Restriction NPC will be standing outside. Once inside the house, you’ll find the Clan Head NPC resting in a giant empty room, surrounded by a glowing purple light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just
  <strong>
   interact with the Clan Head
  </strong>
  by pressing the 'E' button, then
  <strong>
   click the 'Promote' option
  </strong>
  . Keep in mind that you
  <strong>
   need to be at least level 60
  </strong>
  to get your first promotion. If you’re not there yet, the Clan Head will dismiss you.

 <p>
  Here are some ways to promote fast in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   First, you'll want to level up your character. The quickest way to do this in
   <em>
    Jujutsu Infinite
   </em>
   is by completing investigations, storyline quests, or taking down curses and bosses during missions.
  </li>
  <li>
   Next, you'll need a lot of cash to unlock promotion ranks. You can earn money by selling items in your inventory, finishing one-time quests, and doing missions.
  </li>
  <li>
   Lastly, collect plenty of Mission Essence, which you can easily get by doing missions in different towns.

  Treyarch Studios has teased the return of an iconic SMG for Season 2 of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which is set to be released on January 28. While the developer has yet to confirm exactly which iconic SMG will be returning, plenty of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  fans have begun speculating on what the weapon could be, with the majority of players agreeing that it will likely be the MP40.
 </p>
 <p>
  Season 2 of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  will once again be bringing a plethora of new content to both titles. The major update has been confirmed for January 28, but details surrounding the new season are currently sparse. However, to celebrate 115 Day on January 15, Treyarch Studios pulled back the curtain on the next Zombies map coming to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  with Season 2. The highly-anticipated map will be titled The Tomb and comes just weeks after the release of Citadelle des Morts in Season 1 Reloaded. The Tomb is set in an excavation site with Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya on the hunt for the Sentinel Artifact.

  Treyarch Studios Teases Iconic SMG for Black Ops 6 Season 2
 </h2>
 <p>
  During the reveal of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's new Zombies map, Treyarch Studios also teased the return of an iconic weapon. In the developer's recent blog post, Treyarch said that one of the most "iconic" SMGs in Zombies history would be "coming along for the ride." Although this reference was specific to Zombies, any weapon added to the game will also be available to use in Multiplayer and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  . As for what the exact weapon could be remains a topic of debate, many are dead set on it being the MP40, a beloved SMG that has been seen in various
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles over the years, including
  <em>
   World at War
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   WW2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Vanguard
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  There are plenty of iconic SMGs that could be added to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  with Season 2. Alongside the MP40, some fans are speculating that it could also be either the Tommy Gun (also known as the M1927) or the PPSH. All three of these weapons have featured in plenty of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles over the years and have become synonymous with Zombies. Whatever weapon Treyarch is teasing, a full reveal is expected to take place prior to the launch of Season 2. And with less than two weeks to go until the update is released, fans likely won't have long to wait to find out what new weapons will be added to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  with Season 2.

  While there's plenty in store for Zombies fans,
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  players are eager to see a ton of fixes come their way with the launch of Season 2. Since the release of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  in October 2024,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's player count has continued to decline on Steam. There are sure to be a variety of reasons as to why players are abandoning the game just a few months into
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's life cycle, but many believe it is due to the ongoing hacking issues in both
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Ranked Play mode. Both titles are also riddled with server issues, bugs, and glitches, which means Season 2 has a lot to rectify if Activision wants to bring back those lost players.

  Players can discover plenty of side missions in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </strong>
  </em>
  by simply interacting with NPCs in the open world. One of these NPCs is a stalker named Mytryk, who asks Skif to retrieve his gun from the underground tunnels infested with Rodent mutants. Although the quest seems straightforward initially, it quickly becomes a tale of deception once Skif unearths new evidence while on his quest to recover the weapon.

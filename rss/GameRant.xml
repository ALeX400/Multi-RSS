   <em>
    Fallout 76

  </strong>
  continues to be updated after it's fanbase surged post
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  TV show. The
  <em>
   Skyline Valley
  </em>
  update added a new area to explore in the Appalachian Wasteland along with the ability to play as a ghoul, and the most recent
  <em>
   Milepost Zero
  </em>
  update has changed some aspects to make the game easier for newcomers.

  The Tinker's Workbench is a workshop used for crafting. It is separate from the weapon/armor benches and is used primarily for making ammo, grenades, and bulk junk items. There are many placed around the map for you to use when you find them, and it's always a good idea to turn your gunpowder and other junk items into ammo while on long scavenging runs.

  just teased a potential collaboration with the massive competitive racing conglomerate NASCAR in a recent social media post, setting fans ablaze with speculation about what it could entail. There is no official information about what the game's partnership with NASCAR will look like as of yet aside from a cryptic teaser of more content to come in two days, but it would mark the first time the organization has appeared in
  <em>
   Fortnite

  Despite getting its start as a tower-defense game,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  has grown a lot since making the shift to focus on its live-service elements, especially the battle royale mode that continues to be its most popular one. However, the game has also branched out in recent years to expand its game modes, releasing several new modes like Rocket Racing and the survival game mode LEGO
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  each of which has received new content from collaborations in the past.

  <em>

  seems to be gearing up for yet another major collaboration, as a recent tweet from the official
  <em>

  </em>
  Competitive account confirmed a team-up between NASCAR and the Fortnite Championship Series. While the tweet did little to say what might come from the collaboration, it confirmed that NASCAR will be involved in some way in the upcoming Fortnite
  <em>

  Global Championship, with more information to come in just two days.

  streamer CaseOh received a massive donation allegedly from the same user who previously gifted Kai Cenat a substantial amount of subs. CaseOh was live on Twitch when the supposedly very young user surprised him and his audience with yet another large sum of subscriptions.

 <p>
  On August 21, popular content creator Kai Cenat got a huge Twitch donation while streaming his
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  marathon. He was gifted 2,350 subscriptions, which represents over $11,500. The Twitch star made the headlines not only because of the shocking proportion of subs but also because the donor was possibly a child. The anonymous user goes by Takky2Flashy online, and since their massive gift to Kai Cenat, internet users have speculated that it could either be a case of fraud or a possibly unsupervised minor with access to large sums of money. Now, Takky has potentially shocked another Twitch creator with a jaw-dropping donation.

 <p>
  CaseOh was streaming on Twitch when he was suddenly given 1,000 subs all at once. When he checked who the donor was, CaseOh realized it was "takky2flashyalt92," which may be Takky2Flashy's alternate account. Moreover, Takky had started following ChaseOh only five minutes before the donation. Considering that Twitch made Tier 1 subs more expensive in July, each web subscription currently costs $5.99, so the gift could be worth around $5,990.

 <p>
  Takky's original account was taken down shortly after their viral moment with Kai Cenat. Although it's uncertain if the donation for CaseOh came from the same user, his audience suspects that they're the same child. This is not the first time that fans have gifted large amounts of subs or money to their favorite streamers. As she revealed in 2023, Amouranth's followers would donate $90,000 per year, apparently to get her attention. Sometimes, Twitch viewers end up in debt from spending so much on subs.

  Starting October 1, Twitch mobile subs are becoming more expensive, with Tier 1 costing $7.99 in the US. Given that younger viewers often use Twitch through mobile devices, it could be concerning if they started gifting subs without supervision after the price increase. On the other hand, in an effort to make creators' lives easier, Twitch has added improvements to its clip function, allowing streamers to generate vertically-oriented clips from their livestreams. The feature lets streamers spend less time manually editing content for other social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts. Twitch has confirmed that it will eventually implement a feature to post a clip directly on other platforms as well.

  player MaleficTekX shared their frustration at discovering that there are limits on how many Max Particles they can earn per day. The standard limit for earning is 800, though there are ways to go slightly above that via redeeming walking Max Particles, but even that method still maxes out at just over a thousand earned per day. To make matters worse, Max Out season players are ordinarily limited to carrying 1000 particles per day.

  Pokemon GO Max Battle Monetization Concerns Fans
 </h2>
 <p>
  Plenty of players have voiced their complaints following MaleficTekX's post, with many sharing the sentiment. Others have pointed out that they worry that this system is set up the way it is purely to monetize
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's Max Battles. Niantic announced that a paid
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Max Particles bundle will arrive shortly, which will give players 4800 Max Particles for $8 USD. This obviously overwrites the standard limit on how many one can earn and keep per day, which leaves F2P players at a disadvantage. Others have speculated that the game may also add microtransactions to increase the Max Particle storage limit in the future.

 <p>
  While there aren't many Pokemon to invest these particles into yet, the limit versus the amount required doesn't match up. Unlocking a Dynamax move costs 100 Max Particles, while leveling it up to Level 2 and 3 requires 600 and 800 Max Particles, respectively. In other words, maxing out a single Dynamax move on just one Pokemon exceeds the daily earning and carry limits. Players will also need to use Max Particles to fight in Max Battles once they're introduced, which will limit how many times players can participate per day.

  For now, it remains to be seen if Niantic will make any adjustments to the Max system in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Fans would likely appreciate it if they were able to increase their limits by completing tasks or through other non-monetary methods, but at the moment, the upcoming purchase option is the only known way to do so.

  The entire Tyranid swarm is connected and controlled through the Hive Mind using Synapse. Synapse is a major piece of lore for the Tyranids and is adapted to their tabletop rules, along with the mechanics of

  Not every unit in the Tyranid army connects to the Hive Mind directly, with certain units acting as a beacon that connects the smallest of creatures to the overall Hive Mind. Should a Tyranid lose connection to the Hive Mind, they will become nearly useless if not just dying on the spot. Here's how to use Synapse to your advantage in

  In
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   smaller gaunts that lose connection to the Hive Mind and lose Synapse usually die on the spot
  </strong>
  with their heads exploding. This also results in the green particle effect that you'll see as these gaunts die. Not every gaunt is connected to Synapse, and only those who fight in large swarms use the rules for Synapse. Gaunts found in very small groups running through hallways are connected to Synapse and are aggressive, but don't follow the connection rules as usual. Some other large Tyranids can operate without a close connection to Synapse, meaning breaking it will usually only damage the nearby gaunts.

 <p>
  In large groups, the Tyrnaid Warriors usually act as the Synaptic link to the Hive Mind for the gaunts surrounding them. If multiple Tyranid Warriors are close together,
  <strong>
   those left alive will pick up the slack
  </strong>
  and keep the remaining Tyranids alive as long as they are close enough. The key to defeating large swarms of enemies is by focusing on the Synaptic units and taking them down.

  Only a few Tyranids in Space Marine 2 have Synapse and should be targeted any time you see them:

 <p>
  The most common enemy with Synapse to target are Tyranid Warriors, the larger ones standing on two feet roughly the same size as a Space Marine. To break Synapse for nearby gaunts, simply
  <strong>
   target and take out all the nearby Tyranids that have Synapse
  </strong>
  . This can be done at a range or in melee, with ranged kills offering the most noticeable benefits. Get in close and duel a Tyranid Warrior, as your chainsword swings will also help keep the smaller gaunts off of you.

 <p>
  Any gaunts that survive the fight will die around their synaptic link, and any left alive will be left crawling around and able to be executed for an easy kill. While it is not a necessity to focus on breaking Synapse, it will make any fight easier, especially on harder difficulties.

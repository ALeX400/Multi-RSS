  For years,
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  fans have been treated to a wide variety of experiences both in film and through video games. They got to watch Rey as she fought back against the First Order, witnessed the rise of iconic heroes in projects such as
  <em>
   Solo: A Star Wars Story
  </em>
  , got to experience what it was like living as a soldier within this world through
  <em>
   Star Wars Battlefront
  </em>
  , and even witnessed the adventures of a brand-new Jedi in
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
  </em>
  . And now, they have been whisked away on an adventure through the criminal underworld with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Outlaws
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  is unlike any modern
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  game so far, as it ditches the Force in favor of a smuggler adventure. That being said, it does seem to share some similarities with the classic
  <em>
   Star Wars: Bounty Hunter
  </em>
  . Even if it is not exploring the life of a fan-favorite film character, it does let players see into the world of the syndicates through a different lens. Because of its success, it might be time for
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  to take the
  <em>
   Bounty Hunter
  </em>
  brand for a spin again.

  Star Wars Outlaws Showed Players a Different Side of the Galaxy
 </h3>
 <p>
  Up until now, modern
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  games seemed to want to either explore the Jedi versus Sith conflict or let players experience war across the galaxy. Both
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi
  </em>
  games explored Jedi Cal Kestis as he fought back against the Empire, the
  <em>
   Star Wars Battlefront
  </em>
  games let players experience the massive wars that have defined the franchise, and
  <em>
   Star Wars Squadrons
  </em>
  put them in the pilot's seat. All of those adventures proved to be a lot of fun, but it was time for a change, which is exactly what
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  has provided.

 <p>
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  has not only delivered the first true open-world adventure, but it has also plunged players into the world of criminal syndicates. Instead of fighting to rid the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  galaxy of the Empire, Kay Vess is simply trying to make ends meet in a galaxy out to get her. To do this, she must work alongside the biggest syndicates around, which makes for a very different type of story. The type of story that many fans have been longing for, so hopefully, this is not the last time they see it.

  It is Time for a Studio To Give Fans the Star Wars Bounty Hunter Experience
 </h3>
 <p>
  Now that players have gotten to see the Jedi, the soldier, and the smuggler lifestyle, it is time for them to experience a modern take on being a bounty hunter. Specifically, it feels like the perfect time for
  <em>
   Star Wars: Bounty Hunter
  </em>
  to make its grand return. That game captured the earliest days of Jango Fett as he rose to infamy, and through that, fans also got to see the underbelly of the galaxy, which made for a different type of adventure. Now that
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  has set a precedent for a modern version of those types of stories, it is time for a studio to capitalize on the concept again.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  While it would be interesting to explore Jango Fett or Boba Fett further, this next
  <em>
   Bounty Hunter
  </em>
  game should follow in the footsteps of
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  instead. It could give players control over a brand-new bounty hunter trying to make their mark on the galaxy and let them explore the massive galaxy seeking out their targets. Ideally, it would also feature a bunch of exciting gadgets, a jetpack, a unique ship, and even a droid companion to make it a true bounty hunter simulator. As long as it hits all the right
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  notes, fans would be in for a treat.

 <p>
  Now that players have gotten a criminal-based game, it will be interesting to see just where
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  goes from here. It certainly seems feasible that
  <em>
   Outlaws
  </em>
  will open the door to games about seedy characters like bounty hunters. If LucasArts can make a fun one back in 2002, there is no telling what a studio could do with the concept now.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Fields of Mistria
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an up-and-coming farming simulator and RPG that plays like a spiritual successor to those titles that were popular during the late 90s. Although
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  is still only in early access, many players have already had great praise for the title due to how much content is already available to those who are enjoying the title on PC or their Steam Deck.

  While the predominant activity in
  <em>

  </em>
  may be farming, there are plenty of other activities for players to spend their time completing when they can no longer be interested in tending to their crops or collating the products from their animals. These are the other great activities for players to do.

 <p>
  Like any good farming simulator in recent years, those who no longer wish to be on the farm can instead spend their days looking for the shadows of underwater creatures to fish in the various bodies of water that surround
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  .

  The bigger the shadow, the bigger the fish, though it's also important to explore the different waters of
  <em>
   Mistria
  </em>
  from the river that runs through the town to the open sea at the bottom left of the map. Each season also has its own unique fish that may either need to be donated to the museum or used in a cooking recipe. However, players can even sell these fish for a quick profit too.

  Players will require better tools if they hope to water more plots of land at once or till a larger area of the ground. To build these tools, players must first gain access to the mines and therefore also mine deeper if they hope to unlock ores such as silver.

  Although players are currently unable to explore the entirety of the mines in the early access of

  there are still plenty of monsters to fight and ores to mine to make a decent set of tools or armor. Not to forget to mention that the mines also have their own fish, insects, and artifacts to discover.

  On top of catching various fish each season, players also have access to a bug net which allows them to also spend their days in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  catching various insects. These insects can be found almost anywhere, as pond skaters litter the waters, butterflies fly in the wild, and various other insects can be found from shaking trees or breaking rocks.

  Some of these decorations will be unlocked through completing certain tasks, while the recipes for crafting others may need to be purchased. Many more decorations are expected to be added to

  Players don't always need to make a profit when playing
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria.
  </em>
  Sometimes it's nice to take a step back and pay attention to the various townsfolk that live within
  <em>
   Mistria
  </em>
  . While in the current early access version of the title, players can only get the townsfolk to a maximum heart of four, this still allows players to give them gifts and watch some of the heart events for the bachelors and bachelorettes of
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria.
  </em>

 <p>
  This simulator also encourages players to form friendships, as all the townsfolk can be easily found within the Inn on a Friday afternoon, where they can all be given a simple gift to show them that the player cares.

  Digging and mining are two separate activities in
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  . When exploring the area around the main town, players may find mounds of dirt that look as if they have recently been disturbed. Hitting these mounds of dirt has the chance of giving the player regular resources such as peat, but also a chance of giving the player an artifact.

 <p>
  On the left side of the map, players can even find an archaeological dig site that has a guaranteed dig spot for players to use. Players can then upgrade this with their skills, so there are two guaranteed spots here. These treasures are then donated to the museum, though it is possible to find duplicates that can be sold for a profit.

  Sometimes the best activity to take part in when a player doesn't want to farm anymore is to simply explore the wilderness of
  <em>
   Fields of Mistria
  </em>
  and pick up the various herbs and flowers that grow in the different areas.

  Each season has its own assortment of foragable things that are better off kept than sold. This is because many of the foraged items can be used in various cooking recipes, crafting, or even kept as gifts. Additionally, there are also some rarer items to find around the map each season which will be needed to complete the set at the museum.

  Players who struggle to choose something to do when they aren't farming can find purpose by visiting the quest board in town daily. Every day in
  <em>

  there should be a new quest for a player to focus on which may encourage the player to complete one of the various tasks mentioned.

  What makes this RPG title so much better than others like it is that players aren't on a timer to complete these daily quests. Therefore, a player can collect multiple over a few days and then choose to focus on only completing these quests and increasing their town rank.

  Several
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  players have recently taken to social media to express their frustration at Dreepy's low spawn rate.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  kicked off the Max Out Season in September, adding exciting new features and events. Another highlight is the addition of new Pokemon, continuing to expand Niantic's augmented reality game Dex.

 <p>
  One big point of the Max Out Season is the long-awaited debut of Pokemon from the Galar region, bringing the starters Scorbunny, Sobble, and Grookey, along with Dreepy's full evolutionary line. While the appearance of this little Dragon/Ghost-Pokemon reminds trainers of a reptile, the truth is that Dreepy are ghosts reborn from prehistoric species that once inhabited the oceans. Dreepy and its evolutions arrived to expand the list of Dragon-type critters available in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , but its debut has turned into a headache for players.

 <p>
  Reddit user Quiet_impressionist is one of the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  trainers unhappy with Dreepy's low spawn rate. They posted a meme to express their frustration at not seeing the monster and asked if other players “are only spawning Wooloo and Skwovet,” because according to them, “60% of their spawns” are of these two critters. In the comments section, some Redditors said they had “seen Dreepy once,” though most of the commenters said they were having the same difficulty as the OP in finding Gen 8 Pokemon.

  Dreepy is one of the Pokemon featured in the GO All Out event which ends on September 10 at 10 am local time. During the event, players can find the critter in the wild, use 25 Dreepy Candy to evolve it into Drakloak, and 100 Candy to evolve Drakloak into Dragapult. Lucky
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  trainers can also hatch Dreepy from 10 km eggs. Other bonuses from the event include Stardust from Collection Challenges, and double XP for capturing and evolving Pokemon, making it a good time for players who want to level up their accounts.

 <p>
  This isn't the first time the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  community has faced problems finding a specific critter. A famous case among players is Larvesta, which, shortly after being introduced to the game, became one of the rarest monsters. In 2020, another episode led to frustration among players, who were disappointed in their efforts to get a shiny Carvanha. Not long ago,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players got stuck in research due to Emolga's broken spawn rate, making it highly difficult to find the Pokemon, which Niantic fixed later after many complaints from the community.

  Making meaningful progression in

  There are multiple strategies for buying items in
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  and every player can lay out their progression plan by playing a certain hero enough to get the hang of it. However, if you are after those maximizing strategies where all the items are focused on increasing a certain parameter, then why not
  <strong>
   maximize the weapon damage
  </strong>
  , the most accessible source of damage for every single hero?

 <p>
  Including Active items does grant the player a higher cap for the weapon damage bonus, but in order to hit that maximum amount, players must enable all 4 Active items at the same time, and it will only last for a brief duration. So, it might not be as efficient as passive-only items, but it still sets a new all-time high.

  This build costs
  <strong>
   78,000 Souls
  </strong>
  and will grant a
  <strong>
   +513%
  </strong>
  weapon damage bonus, which makes your bullets more than five times stronger against both heroes and NPCs.

 <p>
  Keep in mind that both these builds will require a lot of Souls that might not even be achievable in a short match below 20 minutes. So, if you want to lay your hands on any of these builds, you must focus on farming NPCs to obtain extra Souls. Also, it is recommended that you keep upgrading your character with the initial items and when you are rich enough, they can be sold to be replaced with the options mentioned above.

 <p>
  Using conditional items could help you get a weapon damage bonus even
  <strong>
   higher than 700%
  </strong>
  , but after all, they are conditional, and the hero can only benefit from them in certain situations. Items like Lucky Shot, Sharpshooter, and Point Blank can give you a massive boost in weapon damage under certain conditions.

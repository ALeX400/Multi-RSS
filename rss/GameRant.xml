      <title>Elden Ring: Queen Marika's 10 Most Evil Acts, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-queen-marika-most-evil-acts-ranked/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  At first glance, Marika appears to be a loved and benevolent queen, protecting the people of The Lands Between before losing herself to grief from Godwyn's death. This perspective slowly changes as players progress through
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  , uncovering atrocities beyond reason and mountains of corpses that she left in her wake. She did it all in the name of her Golden Order.

  Several acts are also revealed in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shadow of the Erdree
   </em>
  </strong>
  DLC, showcasing the extent of Marika's hatred for her enemies and how far she goes to suppress her misdeeds. It also hints at why she turned out the way she did. By the time the Tarnished reaches her, she is a prisoner in the Erdtree, broken by the events that led to that point. This leads players to wonder: was it all worth it in the end?

 <p>
  The truth about Marika's rise to power remains shrouded in mystery. It is said that the Gloam-Eyed Queen was a fellow Empyrean guided by her own Two Fingers. As leader of the Godskins, she channeled the power of the Rune of Death through Black Flame incantations. Marika sent her shadow, Maliketh, to defeat her, an event which allowed her to form the Golden Order.

 <p>
  The death rune was plucked from the Elden Ring and sealed away, allowing Marika's children and those blessed with the Grace of Gold to live eternally. This Order was meant to be perfect. It replaced the previous age's rules and excluded everything and everyone that didn't fit Marika's vision.

 <p>
  Messmer was cursed by the Abyssal Serpent, which some believe is connected to an outer god. Marika replaced his eye with a magical Soreseal to quell the Serpent's influence, but she couldn't stop it, as seen by the snakes emerging from his body. His iconic flame may also be a part of this curse, or a separate curse entirely.

 <p>
  Marika saw her son as a fierce combatant, making him a symbol of terror to the Hornsent and likely the Giants as well. She used him to wage war, but when she cast a shroud over the Shadow Lands, she cast it over her firstborn son. He had no way of coming home, and his curse festered behind his golden eye. When fighting the Tarnished, Messmer shattered the Soreseal and gave in to the serpent's power. Upon death, he cursed his mother's name.

  Marika routinely exploited the people closest to her, only to cast them aside later. This is no different for Godfrey, her first husband, and father to three of her children. Born Hoarah Loux, he was a warrior renowned for his strength. This is likely why Marika selected him as Lord of her new Golden Order. He led many conquests for her, accompanied by his warriors and an order of elite Crucible Knights.

  It is said that when his last foe was defeated, the golden hue faded from Godfrey's eyes. Players learn that Marika stripped the Grace of Gold from Godfrey and his warriors, before exiling them to distant lands to wage war, live, and die as Tarnished. During this time, he returned to his former name, Hoarah Loux, Warrior.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the player is a Tarnished, one of Godfrey's soldiers who was exiled with him. This cruel exile took place to make them deadlier warriors. Marika beckoned her first lord and the Tarnished back to the Lands Between to gather the scattered shards of the Elden Ring held by her many children and descendants.

  By unleashing the Tarnished upon the Lands Between, Marika essentially signed the death sentence for every one of her children, both of her husbands, her faithful shadow Maliketh, and many others who would dare stand in the player's way. She provides Grace as guidance, but this may not be enough. The Three Fingers, Ranni, Fia, and others have separate goals that the player can pursue.

  Mohg and Morgott were born Omens, people with horns, tails, and other aspects of the Crucible. Marika's Golden Order considered these characteristics unholy and cursed. Most Omens are hunted and killed by Omenkillers, but those born of nobles and royalty are sent to the Subterranean Shunning Grounds below the capital.

  For many, this may be a better fate than a life on the run, but living in this sewer system is filled with misery. Fans theorize that Godfrey may have established these Shunning Grounds to prevent Marika from executing or mutilating of his sons.

  While some were permitted to live in hiding, most Omens would be hunted and killed at the hands of Marika's Omenkillers. These twisted warriors wear masks designed to resemble the Omens' nightmares and wield dual cleavers adorned with the horns of killed Omens. They are infamous for their cruelty.

 <p>
  The overall treatment of Omens in the Golden Order is tragic. Many die young when their horns and tails are cut. Those on the run throughout the Lands Between are sometimes seen trying to sleep through their nightmares. Their mistreatment is likely due to their similarities with the Hornsent, an old enemy of Marika.

  Wandering nomadic merchants are found dotted around The Lands Between. Players can sometimes hear them playing a sad melody on their violin-like instruments. They were once a unified people known as the Great Caravan, before they were rounded up and left to rot in the Cathedral of the Forsaken, buried even deeper than the Subterranean Shunning Grounds.

 <p>
  With the majority left underground to decay, and the rest cursed to wander forever, these nomads are unfortunate victims of Marika's intolerant Order. Their crime was worshiping the Three Fingers. While it's unconfirmed if they were guilty of this beforehand, the imprisoned merchants would eventually call upon the Flame of Frenzied for salvation.

 <p>
  It is believed that Marika shattered the Elden Ring out of grief for her slain son Godwyn, the first of the Demigods to fall. Radagon attempted to repair the fractured Elden Ring and save the Golden Order, but it was too late. With the great runes of the Ring scattered between the Demigods, war for control was inevitable.

 <p>
  Despite sharing one body, Radagon couldn't prevent Marika from doing what she did. The assassination of her favorite son is the primary cause for this event, but that may be the last in a long line of tragedies in her life, alongside her growing doubts about the Golden Order, the Fingers, and the Greater Will. The Shattering would subject the Lands Between to corruption and endless war.

  In her early years as queen, Marika faced many who threatened her rule, including the Giants, whose Flame of Ruin endangered the Erdtree. Traveling to the Mountaintops of the Giants, the player will see the aftermath of a dreadful war, with endless frozen Giant corpses impaled on the trees. Cruelly, Marika left one Giant alive to watch over the Flame of Ruin for eternity.

  Little is known about the one-eyed Fell God that the Giants followed. They are said to reside within each Giant, and the player can see this in the last remaining one, who has a great face with one eye on his torso. Marika's forces marched into the mountains and destroyed a culture whose only real crime was proximity to the Golden Order.

  Of all her wrongdoings, this is the closest to being justified. Marika waged war on the Hornsent for terrible crimes against her people. The brutal eradication of Shaman Village likely left her as the sole survivor, setting her journey to godhood in motion. She would unleash Messmer on the Hornsent, who would have Marika's revenge ten times over.

  The war would be a purge without honor, with Messmer's Flame leveling most of the Hornsent's population. Marika would then use her new strength as a god to place a veil of shadow over the entire region, shrouding it in obscurity, alongside her own son. This purge is the first and undoubtedly the ugliest of all known wars in the name of the Golden Order.

  When it comes to video game genres, few are more ubiquitous and perpetually popular than titles that feature zombies. This isn't really all that surprising though, as zombies have been part of the cultural zeitgeist for generations and will almost certainly continue to persist in some fashion. From the medium's earliest days, pitting players against hordes of the undead or variations thereof was a staple of design, and remains true up to the present day.

 <p>
  While fans have received a staggering number of zombie games throughout the years, two more modern examples in the form of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dead Island 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
  </strong>
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  provide an excellent case study in showcasing just how resilient and accommodating the genre is.
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  's heavily humorous bent and presentation contrasts well against
  <em>
   TLOU
  </em>
  's more grounded takes and vision, and between them lies an incredible range of possibilities that, even after all this time, continues to be ripe in potential for creating interesting stories and engaging gameplay.

  Though Dambuster's
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  had a famously troubled development cycle, its eventual release saw it become an instant hit, selling 1 million copies in mere days. While nowhere near the first to do so,
  <em>
   DI2
  </em>
  is a recent instance of a title taking a more whimsical and arcadey approach to the genre with its setting, characters, and mechanics. Many of the protagonists and NPCs seem to take a sort of gleeful anarchic joy in the state of affairs.

  With the sheer amount of zombie-centric games on the market, one might be forgiven for thinking that every possible angle under the sun has been seen and done. However, since the essence of the genre serves as a backdrop to explore the depths of humanity's psyche when pushed into extreme life-of-death situations and moral quandaries, this lends them an intrinsic timelessness. Zombies make for the perfect template for relentless and dangerous enemies, and the subsection of types seen in games has also evolved enormously.

  Both extremes of the scale portrayed by
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Last of Us

  are equally valid and offer entertaining and enjoyable experiences, serving as microcosms for how the genre can encompass a huge array of tones, designs, and styles. While their moods, mechanics, and intentions may be polar opposites—frantic fun versus broodingly tense—that difference is a testament to the well of possibility offered by great zombie games and is why fans will surely continue to see them rise up time and again.

  On July 21, 2024,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pikmin 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  celebrates its first birthday. What was considered a pipe dream for almost a decade finally launched in July 2023, and fortunately proved worth the wait. Fans rallied around the returning dungeons, the debut of Oatchi, and the general emphasis on efficiency in and out of the fittingly-named Dandori trials.
  <em>
   Pikmin 3 Deluxe
  </em>
  ’s surprise Nintendo Switch launch in 2020 was a welcome sign of life, and
  <em>

  </em>
  raised some eyebrows, but
  <em>
   Pikmin 4

  felt like the proper return to glory that
  <em>

  enjoyed three small waves of Challenge Mode DLC within six months of its release, and
  <em>
   Pikmin 3 Deluxe
  </em>
  came with all of that on top of new side-story missions and several other playthrough-altering features, but there's no sign of anything for
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  . A growing contingent of fans have begun discussing possible
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  post-launch support, and the game's second year is the right time to get it.

  Even more so than
  <em>
   Pikmin 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  is well-suited to add-ons. Although almost all of its content is integrated into the single-player campaign,
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  still has several alternative game types built into its base package that typically involve the more constrained activities one would expect to see in DLC. Dandori Challenge mirrors
  <em>
   Pikmin 2
  </em>
  ’s Challenge Mode and
  <em>
   Pikmin 3
  </em>
  ’s Mission Mode, which the latter’s DLC is part of, so more missions in its style could be attached to its corresponding NPC in
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  's Rescue Command Post hub. The same could be done with the Dandori Battle and night expedition maps, different as they all are.

  Trial of the Sage Leaf Provides A Great Pikmin DLC Format
 </h3>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Pikmin 3
  </em>
  ’s DLC was as straightforward as adding new and remixed maps to the existing Mission Mode,
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  has another option to make things feel more special. The Trial of the Sage Leaf is a special Dandori Challenge cave found directly inside the Rescue Command Post, and it consists of ten successive challenge maps instead of the usual one. It's one of
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  's greatest postgame challenges, and the only way to unlock White and Purple Pikmin. Not only that, it also introduces extra objectives, bringing back
  <em>
   Pikmin 3
  </em>
  ’s “defeat all enemies” permutation alongside missions like racing to a goal or securing one particular treasure. This could be the optimal format to dole out
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  ’s DLC maps en masse.

  Speaking of formats that lend themselves to DLC, the same can be said for
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  's current campaign.
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  not going full open world actually better equips it to receive new regions as DLC, within which it could have more caverns, castaways, and potentially even items and upgrades. Unlike past
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  games, there is no time limit or sense of urgency in
  <em>
   Pikmin 4

  beyond the daily timer, so traveling to more areas would be easy to justify.

 <p>
  Justifications may be what
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  fans want the most, as
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  represents a reboot to the series timeline. How this relates to the original games, if at all, hasn't been detailed yet, and they still offer a number of mysteries, like
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  ’s various Umebozu-like Wraiths and what happened to the planet's original civilization. Just focusing on
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  's narrative alone, there's an implication that something about the Pikmin planet is forcing passing ships to crash on it, which feels like an obvious plot thread to pull on in either a new
  <em>
   Pikmin
  </em>
  game or a new
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  scenario.

  A New Campaign Could Be In Pikmin 4’s Future
 </h3>
 <p>
  Tying gameplay and narrative together,
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  ’s DLC could take the form of a distinct, shorter story mode akin to Olimar's Shipwreck Tale. Multiple scenarios for this mode readily present themselves, including what Louie was doing on the Pikmin planet before players found him, or what Moss was doing before she partnered with Olimar. There could even be a sequel story involving Moss cooperating with both Pikmin and the pacified Ancient Sirehound for some personal goal. Complete with narration describing the protagonist’s thoughts and potentially other members of Moss’ species replicating her role as
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  ’s most devious roaming enemy, this would make a great cap to the
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  experience.

  One more motive presents itself for why
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  has been denied further support on the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo may intend to update the game exactly like its immediate predecessor,
  <em>
   Pikmin 3
  </em>
  . Just as
  <em>
   Pikmin 3 Deluxe
  </em>
  was an upgraded re-release on the Wii U’s replacement, the rumored Nintendo Switch successor could harbor a parallel title in
  <em>
   Pikmin 4 Deluxe
  </em>
  . This wouldn't achieve the same record-setting performance as
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  , but it should still get a significant sales boost from landing in the Switch 2’s launch window.

Permitting full campaign co-op should be possible on the newer console’s hardware, whether that involves Player 2 controlling Oatchi or a separate Rescue Corps member that potentially has their own Rescue Pup. Multiple difficulties would be appreciated, and the much-requested toggle to disable the automatic cursor lock-on could finally be implemented. There are lots of ways

  Former
  <strong>
   Nintendo of America
  </strong>
  President Reggie Fils-Aimé believes that the video game industry is on the verge of bouncing back from its post-pandemic slump. The long-time Nintendo executive highlighted some promising signs of recovery that point to that being the case, and shared a fairly optimistic near-term outlook for the sector.

 <p>
  Fils-Aimé served as the chief operating officer and president of the Japanese gaming giant's U.S. division for 13 years. He retired in April 2019, with Doug Bowser subsequently taking over the reins of Nintendo of America. Fils-Aimé has been keeping busy ever since, having authored a book and started a podcast, on top of making quite a few public appearances and frequently chatting with the press.

  Reggie Fils-Aimé Predicts a Games Industry 'Upswing'
 </h2>
 <p>
  Yahoo Finance recently got a hold of Fils-Aimé to pick his brain about the current state of the video game industry. The ensuing interview saw the former Nintendo official offer an optimistic perspective about the sector's immediate future. "I would say that the games industry overall is poised for an upswing," Fils-Aimé opined.

 <p>
  Elaborating on that prediction, the ex-Nintendo executive pointed to an evidently high level of consumer excitement over some June 2024 game announcements as evidence that upcoming releases are showing a lot of promise. While he didn't name any particular titles, he was possibly referring to Nintendo's announcement of
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  <em>
   : Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  and the long-awaited gameplay reveal of
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4

  , both of which generated quite a bit of positive buzz.

  Fils-Aimé Says 'Free Money' Is Partly to Blame for 2023 Games Industry Slump
 </h3>
 <p>
  The former Nintendo president also suggested that "free money" was partly to blame for some of the industry's post-pandemic troubles, such as declining growth. That remark was a reference to the low interest rates that drove a lot of game investments in the run-up to the launches of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and during the pandemic. "Game developers were creating a plethora of content and, candidly, some content that probably shouldn't have been created," Fils-Aimé opined, citing that as the reason why the global market contracted in 2023.

   Grand Theft Auto 6

Aside from the Nintendo Switch successor, which is expected to hit the market circa March 2025, Fils-Aimé also pointed to the rumored PS5 Pro as another device that could potentially help the industry return to growth in the near future.

  First, you’ll need to be born as a female in China. For that, players have to start a new life, choose female as their gender, and select China as their country. Unlike previous challenges, there’s no birthplace requirement, so you can choose whichever city you want.

 <p>
  From there, you can either apply as an officer or simply enlist in the army. And just to quickly mention, having a training background can really help you get a military job, so participate in extracurricular activities like Archery, Tennis, or Hockey in secondary school whenever possible. Furthermore, avoid fights or any criminal activities to improve your chances of joining the army quickly.

  After enlisting, age up and keep working hard until you see the ‘Deployment’ option. Once deployed, you will need to play the Minesweeper game where you will have to avoid mines to stay alive. Once you complete the game and your deployment is over, they will offer you a medal. Just choose to refuse it to complete this part of the challenge.

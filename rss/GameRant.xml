 <p>
  Inspired by the pen-and-paper games of the 1980s, such as
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  , many games in the turn-based roleplaying genre made huge splashes in the 90s and early 2000s. However, the turn-based format was declared too slow, outdated, and irrelevant in the modern gaming scene by the gaming zeitgeist of the 2010s. However, the desire for complex, tactical battles ran deep, and as the 2010s came to a close, the genre saw its glorious return.

 <p>
  The chaos of real-time combat clearly has an appeal, and after several years of meeting resistance on the issue, several studios pushed back against the idea that gamers saw it as "old hat" and turned their desire to return to making games with precise, thoughtful battles into reality. With the benefit of hindsight, it is now obvious that the turn-based format has a special place in gamers' hearts and, at least for now, is here to stay.

  If three things make any late 80s / early 90s kid's nostalgia list, it's collecting fighting monsters (
  <em>
   ala Pokemon
  </em>
  ), cassette tapes, and turn-based games.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Cassette Beasts
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a fusion of all three, and being able to fuse the titular beasts and use them to fight in a turn-based battle is also the game's main gameplay loop.
  <em>
   Cassette Beasts
  </em>
  has a slightly more ethical take on the 'mon collect-a-thon model, as the player doesn't actually snatch the beasts from the wild but instead copies their forms and powers.

 <p>
  When entering battle, the player and their companion shapeshift (or fuse) into the beasts they have recorded. Similar to Pokemon, each "beast" has a limited number of movesets (represented by stickers), and each side takes turns making their moves, using debuffs and elemental combos to try to gain the upper hand. If Pokemon feels a little too childish or repetitive,
  <em>
   Cassette Beasts
  </em>
  puts an interesting, more mature spin on the concept and, appropriately for a game with "cassette" in the title, comes with a killer soundtrack.

  Although
  <strong>
   <em>
    South Park: The Fractured But Whole
   </em>
  </strong>
  serves as a sequel to Obsidian's equally excellent
  <em>
   Stick of Truth
  </em>
  , it can be played completely independently.
  <em>
   But Whole
  </em>
  is an irreverent parody of RPGs and superheroes and manages to perfectly translate the satirical and crude comedy of the show to the interactive medium.

 <p>
  Despite the classically
  <em>
   South Park
  </em>
  visuals and story,
  <em>
   But Whole
  </em>
  has a decent amount of combat depth and exploration potential, but not so much that it slows the overall flow. Fans of the show (or those who enjoy visceral cartoon violence and irreverent, spicily offensive humor) will find a home in

   South Park

  <em>
   Fractured But Whole

  Unlike many computer-driven roleplaying games, even some of the best tabletop RPGs are known for their complexity. While some titles handle the crunch and sand down build intricacy for the sake of smoother play,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of the truest-to-form adaptations of a pen-and-paper system and, as such, can require a lot of reading and new-player-guide parsing to enjoy.

  However, those already familiar with tabletop conventions or those who enjoy deep, complex systems will get a lot out of

  This game is the story of eight travelers, each with their own path. Not only does

    Octopath Traveler 2

  </strong>
  continue to bring back the turn-based games now abandoned by many RPG series, such as Final Fantasy, but it also brings back the simpler, 2D style, albeit with a modern airbrush of depth of field effects GC-infused high-definition pixels. There are several new features and upgrades this time, from character-specific latent powers to delightful new methods of transportation across the lush landscapes.

  Like some of the games of its inspiration,
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  is the second in an anthology series, meaning players unfamiliar with the series can jump right into a new world with a new cast of characters (although the original
  <em>
   Octopath
  </em>
  is just as worthy of playing). However, the original game's highly-celebrated Boost and Break mechanics return, as do the intimate storytelling and the wonderful retro vistas.

  This bright-eyed, beautiful RPG pays homage to classics and, like one of its main inspirations,
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  has turn-based combat taking place in the overworld.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Sea of Stars
   </strong>
  </em>
  ' battle system involves learning how to use timed power attacks and blocks at the appropriate moment, which sprinkles in an element of interactivity that keeps battles dynamic and engaging without being overly taxing on the player's brain power after too many hours of play and monster-bashing.

  ' vibrant pixel art style and fluid integration of exploration and combat create an experience that feels fresh yet faithful to the classics (but without feeling overly derivative). While there are secrets to discover and a world to roam (with a spectacular, old-school overworld made with an exuberant love for the pixelated overworlds of yore), the journey is somewhat linear in the classic JRPG fashion, and while the characters feel perfectly tuned with their relatively limited movesets, they may feel confining in combat to some players.

  After six games in the series, the creators behind
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  decided to mix up the formula by introducing a new set of characters and a new scenario. While they were at it, they experimented with turning the brawler into a semi-turn-based combat system, similar to the games of their youths, such as
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  . The idea caught on like fire, and
  <em>
   Like A Dragon
  </em>
  took on those RPG elements.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth
   </em>
  </strong>
  carried on this new venture into the half menu, half movement-oriented action, further proving to the world the viability of the turn-based format.

 <p>
  Of course,
  <em>
   Like A Dragon
  </em>
  and its sequel,
  <em>
   Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth,
  </em>
  are still games derived from the beat-em-up brawler genre, so there are still plenty of action sequences in real-time, and they may be off-putting for purists. However, those interested in how an RPG set in a contemporary urban setting could play out should check out either from the soft reboot onward.

  Players who both appreciate turn-based RPGs for their chill and cozy atmosphere and have never before played a
  <em>
   Dragon Ques
  </em>
  t game are in for a serious treat. Besides a few themes and familiar monster designs, the long-running
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  series is an anthology (apart from the first three games, which were connected)
  <em>
   .
   <strong>
    Dragon Quest 11
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a standalone
  <em>
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  story that is perfect for the uninitiated.

 <p>
  While the mainline, numbered series remained true to turn-based fans for all this time,
  <em>
   DQ11
  </em>
  S also caters to players of different types. For example, there is an option for speeding up play for players with less patience for the attack-and-wait format. For returning players of the series, there are a plethora of references, including an entire recreation of the game in pixel form, which can be switched to and from by speaking to the priest in each town.

  Going from the strictest definition of "turn-based,"
  <strong>
   <em>
    Divinity: Original Sin 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  bends the rules (for example, the player uses action points instead of getting a single turn and may split their actions between these points in their current turn or save them for their next). However,
  <em>
   Original Sin 2
  </em>
  is such a stellar game with such a tight combat system that everything cohesively flows together perfectly, in contrast to the dragging negative stereotype often associated with turn-based fights. Unlike other games that offer the option, the turn-based mode is not merely a secondary feature.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":11,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":11,"nbrPlacementsScanned":11,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":945} -->

 <p>
  Everything from controlling the position of the party to executing complex plays (including stealth attacks, which turn-based games have often struggled with) is on point and satisfying. As well as the combat system, there is an (almost) unparalleled depth to the world. That includes contextual environmental conditions that come into play during fights, such as fire, frost, blood, and a good number of other lingering spell effects. With such rich lore and characters, Larian proved themselves (not for the last time) to be masters of the once-dormant genre.

  Playing smart is almost always preferable to spamming the attack button, as the former is incentivized over using grinding to overcome foes. The rich tactical play is accompanied by stylish UI designs, attack animations and directions, and tight sound design that helps punctuate every menu selection, hit, and takedown.

  Thanks to a mixture of minimal publisher interference, decades of experience in cRPG design, long-term development in step with community feedback, and a studio-wide love for the tabletop game source material,
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  emerged in 2023 as a triumph in the genre and in video games. With its incredible freedom of player choice, reactivity, and consequences, it wowed the roleplaying game scene and shocked the industry with its high sales, high-quality design, and absence of microtransactions or battle passes.

  Perhaps most shocking of all was seeing gamers clamor to jump into the turn-based format. Larian clearly took the rules of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  and adapted them as faithfully as they could but always placed fun and engagement with the turn-based system as their highest priority. One of the biggest departures is that turns are taken between parties, both enemy and player. Most of the math is wrapped up behind the scenes, but
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  isn't shy about showing its roots by regularly displaying dice rolls before the player.

  It’s nice to see the Anomaly playstyle getting characters that can fully take advantage of the mechanics in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Jane Doe is a Physical Anomaly unit who can trigger Assault easily because of her kit that continuously buffs her ability to do so. She makes for a perfect on-field DPS or a Sub-DPS who can quickly swap with other characters.

 <p>
  Jane Doe works best with other Anomaly units, like Grace in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  . Their ability to go back and forth with their Shock and Assault Anomalies creates a synergy for this team to trigger
  <strong>
   Disorder
  </strong>
  . Qingyi can quickly Stun enemies and massively increase the Stun DMG Multiplier for Jane Doe and Grace to enjoy an amplified Shock and Assault run while enemies are Stunned. This team heavily relies on triggering Disorder between Jane Doe and Grace as you quick-swap them to quickly install their Anomalies.

 <p>
  Initiate with Grace’s Shock Anomaly and follow it up as quickly as possible with Jane Doe’s Assault Anomaly. This will trigger the Disorder reaction and will end the Shock Anomaly by calculating all the Shock DMG at once instead of continuously dealing DMG over time. Keep switching back and forth between the two units to end their Anomalies with Disorder, and every time you end Grace’s Shock with an Assault, you’ll see some of the highest DMG numbers in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Adding
  <strong>
   Seth
  </strong>
  to a Jane Doe and Grace team in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  gives the team a different approach during combat. Seth is not a Stun character like Qingyi, he’s a Defense unit who works perfectly with Anomaly characters because of his buff and debuff. Seth grants the active character a shield that grants them a good amount of Anomaly Proficiency on top of absorbing DMG. He also reduces enemies' Anomaly Buildup resistance, which is perfect for Grace and Jane Doe in this team.

 <p>
  Seth’s Supportive abilities ensure Jane Doe will keep triggering Assaults over and over again, which makes it less forgiving for them to stay on the field triggering their Anomalies instead of heavily relying on Disorder. Alternatively, players can also use
  <strong>
   Rina
  </strong>
  for her PEN buff. Rina's Additional Ability also increases the duration of Shock, which means players can trigger higher Shock Disorder DMG.

  The Xenomorph and Yautja Hunter are two of Hollywood's most iconic monsters, with two massive franchises that have crossed over in both movies and comic book media based on the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alien
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Predator
   </em>
  </strong>
  movies. This made it only inevitable that the two series would get video game tie-ins, sometimes with both appearing in the same game.

 <p>
  Throughout the years, these games have ranged from first-person shooters to arcade games and even to even horror titles, with some even being labeled as official canon. However, the games in both the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Predator
  </em>
  series also range from beloved hits to cash grabs that most gamers rightfully forgot about.

   <strong>
    Updated on September 4, 2024, by Melody MacReady:
   </strong>
   Many fans and players of the Alien and Predator franchises are flocking to the games once again after the major success of Fede Alvarez's Alien: Romulus and the anticipation that many are feeling for the next Predator movie by Dan Trachtenberg, who directed Prey. Thankfully, there have not only many games about Xenomorphs and Yautja Hunters in the past, but new games are being made, including Aliens: Dark Descent and the upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion. It shows how adaptive Alien and Predator can be when they can translate into nearly every genre of game, since almost every new entry tries something different.

  This forgotten GameBoy Color game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Aliens: Thanatos Encounter
   </strong>
  </em>
  , by THQ is fairly simple. It allows gamers to play as one of five colonial marines, each with their own unique skills and weapons across twelve levels, slaughtering aliens and rescuing survivors along the way.

 <p>
  The game received mixed reactions due to some complaints about the perspective and the less-than-appealing color scheme. However, many reviews consider the game an enjoyable time-waster with plenty of tension due to the time limit.

  Movie-licensed games on the original NES are rarely ever good, and while
  <strong>
   <em>
    Predator
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not the worst, it's still lackluster at best. It's a typical action platformer that pales in comparison to similar games at the time like
  <em>
   Contra,
  </em>
  but it does have its addictiveness.

 <p>
  The biggest issues gamers had with
  <em>
   Predator
  </em>
  were the unappealing visuals that never looked or felt like anything from the famous Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The enemies also suffer from having nothing to do with the movie, and the use of multiple Predators instead of one was also a strange choice.

  The first game was a mediocre action platformer, while
  <strong>
   <em>
    Predator 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  for the Sega Genesis is only marginally better. This is due to more engaging gameplay and impressive visuals, but the isometric presentation can make traversal too confusing. The enemies are boring, but they do provide some challenges.

 <p>
  What kills
  <em>
   Predator 2

  is the sound design, featuring music that sounds like nails on a chalkboard and dated sound effects. While the titular monster has more of a presence in the game, it still feels like an afterthought in the title as a whole.

  Sporting some impressive 3D visuals for the MS-DOS,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure

  </strong>
  does provide an intriguing narrative and locale, but it is far from the best click-and-point adventure game, with the inventory system getting tedious and the title's puzzles tending to be frustrating.

  As the title suggests,
  <em>
   Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure
  </em>
  takes on the style of the Dark Horse comics of the time, and that is both a good and bad thing for it. The design for everything is considered well-made, and the comic book-like characters are fun in a cheesy, but Xenomorphs are a rare appearance, which diminishes the horror atmosphere that builds up so much.

  is an interesting piece of history that has the player taking control of several characters from the movie. They all look and play the same as gamers explore a maze and gun down
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  , using the framing device of the team cameras and vital monitors that were used in the movie.

  In a way,
  <em>
   Aliens: The Computer Game
  </em>
  might have been impressive for the time, but many would find it very dated these days; the sound effects are obnoxious, the gameplay is tedious, and it's not that challenging.

  This
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alien Versus Predator

  </strong>
  is not to be confused with the far superior game that came out a year later. This SNES title by Jorudan only allows the player to control the Predator going up against swarms of Xenomorph enemies.

 <p>
  While the sprites in
  <em>
   Alien Versus Predator
  </em>
  look pleasant and polished, the gameplay of the Predator leaves a lot to be desired. The combat of the Predator is often critiqued for being rather dull and monotonous, and the lack of any co-op functionality diminishes the arcade-like gameplay.

  With the infamously abysmal launch of

   <em>
    Aliens: Colonial Marines

  </strong>
  , it received much backlash due to mediocre visuals, promised aspects that were never delivered, and broken AI for the alien swarms that feel like mild inconveniences rather than the universe's perfect killing machine.

 <p>
  Years later,
  <em>
   Aliens: Colonial Marines
  </em>
  did find hope via a fanmade patch that fixed a single programming error that had been present since launch. As a result, the Xenomorph AI was far more intelligent, which made the game a lot better, but still messy. As a bonus, there is a terrifying new breed of Xenomorph in the game as well as fan-favorite characters that make returns.

  Since
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alien 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the farthest thing from an action movie, developers at LJN went in their own direction for an adaptation. The game features hordes of Xenomorphs instead of just one, with Ripley carrying her pulse rifle/flamethrower combo from the second movie as she treks the prison planet to save prisoners and destroy the aliens.

 <p>
  Much like the movie,
  <em>
   Alien 3
  </em>
  had fans divided, but over the years, it has gotten better reviews. That said, it is far from the best that the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  games have to offer. Having a
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  -like maze to traverse was different for the series, and it proved to be a difficult game as a result.

  Made by Rebellion,

  is an exclusive title for the PSP. It was based on the recent movie at the time of the same name, and unlike the previous

  games made by Rebellion, players can only experience things from the Wolf Predator's point of view.

  For a PSP game,
  <em>
   Alien Vs. Predator: Requiem
  </em>
  was an average action title. The third-person combat is simple, it's very repetitive, but it features some genuinely decent graphics for the PSP with some nicely lit levels. This was an improvement over the movie, which was so dark that viewers would often struggle to see what was going on.

 <p>
  The concept for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Predator: Concrete Jungle
   </em>
  </strong>
  is simple yet unique for the franchise. It follows a dishonored Predator who must correct a mistake in his past and hunt down criminals and corrupt organizations using the technology of his people in an alternate future Earth. With a plethora of callbacks, including a shocking reveal in the final levels of the game,
  <em>
   Concrete Jungle
  </em>
  feels like a game made by fans.

 <p>
  The game does suffer from cheesy and over-the-top characters, B-movie dialogue, and controls that have aged over time. However, the good outweighs the bad in a gory and brutal game that is a forgotten gem for the PlayStation 2.

  Often forgotten in the sea of first-person shooters in the franchise,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Aliens Online
   </em>
  </strong>
  pits humans and aliens against each other in class-based deathmatches with more players in matches than most games at the time. It may not seem like much now, but
  <em>
   Aliens Online
  </em>
  was ahead of its time in 1998.

 <p>
  With many classes to choose from in

  , this online multiplayer shooter remains a fun game to check out for those curious. Unfortunately, getting the online functionality to work today is a challenge in itself.

  A quality title on the Nintendo DS based on
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  sounds like an impossibility, but
  <em>
   <strong>
    Aliens: Infestation
   </strong>
  </em>
  manages to pull it off, acting as a spiritual successor to the LJN
  <em>
   Alien 3
  </em>
  game. It is a sidescrolling shooter game with puzzle elements and massive areas to explore, but it features more of a Metroidvania style to the gameplay.

 <p>
  Gamers and fans considered
  <em>
   Alien: Infestation
  </em>
  a well-made throwback to 16-bit games from the '90s and felt that it should have been the game they received back then, with the only problem being that the brighter art style diminished the darker tone that the game aims for.

  Pure insanity. That's the best way to describe the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Aliens
   </strong>
  </em>
  arcade game. It's a side-scrolling beat-em-up and shooter by Konami. However, instead of the dark and menacing atmosphere, this game just goes for bright, action-filled, and wacky in many instances.

  All the Xenomorphs in the

  is still worth checking out.

  Similar to the LJN game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Alien 3: The Gun
   </strong>
  </em>
  took the movie in a radically different direction and, as a result, became a very successful arcade light-gun shooter that sucked down entire piggy banks filled with quarters. The game is the simplest that an arcade shooter can get. Players need to point the light-gun at the screen and shoot alien swarms to survive as long as possible.

 <p>
  Combining the gameplay of
  <em>
   Alien 3: The Gun
  </em>
  with visuals that are still very impressive for 1993, this title proves to be a great co-op experience that provides chills and thrills. Sadly, finding a way to play it these days is almost impossible if someone does not have an actual arcade cabinet.

  Two different
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alien Versus Predator
   </em>
  </strong>
  games came out in 1994, and this one was the first one to take on a first-person shooter style developed by Rebellion. With the three races of Alien, Predator, and Colonial Marine being playable, this exclusive for the Atari Jaguar and Sega Lynx laid the foundation for many future games to build upon.

  While the digitized actors and models for the sprites might seem dated, they were praised in 1994.
  <em>
   Alien Versus Predator

  successfully immersed players in the dark and eerie atmosphere, something that most games struggled with up to that point, and Rebellion would only improve in the future.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Aliens: Extermination
   </strong>
  </em>
  takes the same simple setup as
  <em>
   Alien 3: The Gun
  </em>
  , but it is set in James Cameron's world instead of the third movie and features improved 3D visuals. The light-gun arcade game became a staple all over the world with many arcades still using it today. Everything is much faster, which can lead to some terrifying surprise attacks from the Xenomorphs.

 <p>
  The animations of the Xenomorphs in
  <em>
   Aliens: Extermination
  </em>
  are so much faster, adding to the horror and tension, even with two players. The sound effects are straight out of the movie, adding to both addictiveness and authenticity.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Predator: Hunting Grounds
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a 1v4 isometric multiplayer game in the same vein as the developers' previous game:
  <em>
   Friday The 13th
  </em>
  . One player, as the Yautja Hunter, must carefully and strategically take out all members of the human Fireteam before they can escape.

 <p>
  It did not have the best of launches due to having a bare minimum of content, glitches, and a lack of alternate modes. However, the game achieved a well-earned comeback due to continuous updates, content drops, and a dedicated fanbase. Unfortunately, playing as the Predator is a chore, since the Fireteam is often too powerful and can take down the hunter in seconds.

 <p>
  Instead of atmospheric horror, this
  <em>
   <strong>
    Aliens Versus Predator
   </strong>
  </em>
  game, which came out the same year as the Jaguar version, embraced action and colorful insanity, but in a good way. Capcom's take on the franchise embraces a beat-em-up gameplay style similar to
  <em>
   Streets Of Rage
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Final Fight
  </em>
  games, but some consider this game even better than those classics.

 <p>
  Multiple players can control a Predator or human moving from left to right across many levels, taking on very colorful Xenomorph types. It's not anything deep or complex, but it is a ton of fun, with characters from both franchises, including Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch Schaefer as a superhuman killer of both Xenos and Yautja.

  Even when the camera is high above the battle, Xenomorphs can still be scary, as shown with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Aliens: Dark Descent
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The idea of a real-time strategy
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  game is not new, but
  <em>
   Dark Descent
  </em>
  tries to maintain the horror by having a smaller team to command going through shadowy levels that are so dark that the player needs to rely on the motion tracker to stay alive.

 <p>
  Such as with many RTS games out there,
  <em>
   Aliens: Dark Descent
  </em>
  is difficult and requires a lot of patience to progress. However, where it shines is introducing new lore to the
  <em>
   Alien

  franchise, such as cultists that have begun worshiping Xenomorphs and introducing new disturbing Xeno breeds.

 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect: Andromeda
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a good game by all metrics. The combat is great, the build variety is there, and the storyline is decent. Unfortunately, it's a good game in a series of great games, which makes it the worst out of all of them. If Andromeda was its own IP (as it should've been) and wasn't associated with the legendary Commander Shepard, it could've maybe spawned its own sequels at this point. But it isn't, and it didn't.

 <p>
  Another sad reality for Andromeda is that it introduces players to a brand-new galaxy, completely new species of aliens, and a revamped combat system, but all of that is overshadowed by the likelihood that this story will remain unfinished, the potential will remain unrealized, and the world setting will likely be abandoned.
  <em>

 <p>
  Still, that doesn't mean that
  <em>
   MEA
  </em>
  isn't worth playing through. In terms of combat, it incorporates a lot of the same mechanics players loved from the original trilogy and iterates on it to give it a different flavor. Combat feels fluid and smooth, if somewhat lacking in impact and stakes. Builds are similar to the original series, with the same archetypes making a comeback once again. The jump pack is nice, too.

 <p>
  Where
  <em>
   MEA
  </em>
  disappoints, unfortunately, is its worldbuilding, traditionally the strongest aspect of the
  <em>
   Mass Effect

  series. The stakes feel forced, and with the inevitability of this being the last title in this setting, it's hard to get invested.

 <p>
  As the game that started it all, it's easy to see the original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect
   </em>
  </strong>
  through rose-tinted glasses, thinking that every second of it was spectacular. It was, but only at the time the game was initially made (2007). Since then, gaming has come a long way, and the industry standard has evolved drastically. Playing
  <em>
   Mass Effect 1
  </em>
  today feels just a little bit off in a way that's hard to put into words. The overheating guns feel dated, the controls are clunky, the UI is a mess, and the endless walking through levels that have nothing in them except concrete walls and loading screens is a chore at best.

 <p>
  That said,
  <em>
   ME1
  </em>
  is perhaps the strongest entry in the entire series when it comes to the story itself. After all, setting up one of the most popular gaming franchises ever requires a rock-solid foundation. The trouble is that replayability has little to do with the story but relies almost entirely on the core mechanics and the amount of replayable content.

 <p>
  Where
  <em>
   ME1
  </em>
  shines in terms of replayability is by providing players the options to go the Paragon (Good) or the Renegade (Bad) route. Companions will react to situations differently, depending on how Shepard handles situations. Though there is a definitive 'best route' in
  <em>
   ME1
  </em>
  , players who played as a Paragon during their first playthrough should try a Renegade Shepard in a new run. It offers a fresh look and a completely different feel.

  Additionally,
  <em>

 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most controversial games in existence, given its notoriously divisive ending, which, understandably, overshadows a lot of what made
  <em>
   ME3
  </em>
  the best the series has ever been in terms of gameplay. It's not that the build variety expanded in this game over the others, nor did it introduce something drastically different. No, what
  <em>
   ME3
  </em>
  did with its combat was reiterate on what
  <em>
   ME2
  </em>
  had but better, smoother, and with more polish. Gunplay, in particular, feels incredibly satisfying, combat is as smooth as butter, and even playing a high-risk, high-reward class like Vanguard feels more impactful.

 <p>
  Additionally,
  <em>
   ME3
  </em>
  also has an overall better morality system than
  <em>
   ME2
  </em>
  , mainly because of the larger variance in possible cutscenes and dialogue options. Almost all of the companions have a conclusion to their storyline, an ending which can go in dramatically different ways, depending on the choices that players make as Shepard.

 <p>
  <em>
   Leviathan
  </em>
  is perhaps the most important DLC of all
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  expansions to date in terms of lore. Yes, even more so than the
  <em>
   For Ashes DLC
  </em>
  (Javik). Only in this DLC do players find out
  <em>
   where
  </em>
  the Reapers come from, who created them, how they were born, and why they are hellbent on destroying everything in the world. For players who haven't played through this story, it's an absolute must-try.

 <p>
  <em>
   Mass Effect 3's
  </em>
  ending is famously criticized, and for good reason, which is perhaps what prompted the creation of the
  <em>
   Citadel DLC
  </em>
  , an expansion that ties loose ends, puts storylines to rest, and gives Shepard and the crew a chance to stop and admire the camaraderie they share. Like Geralt's final party in
  <em>
   Witcher 3's Blood and Wine DLC
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Citadel
  </em>
  serves as a last hurrah for the crew before they go off to face the Reaper threat for the final time.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  strikes the perfect balance between excellent combat that's replayable even after all these years and a robust storyline that grips players from start to finish. A key part of what makes
  <em>
   ME2
  </em>
  so good is its segmented approach to quests. Companion quests are split into distinct chunks of content that feel completely different from one another. No side quest feels frivolous or just there for the sake of it.

 <p>
  The looming threat of the Reapers hangs overhead, just like all the other
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  games, but the way the storyline is set up doesn't make it seem like they're about to invade right at this very moment, like
  <em>
   ME3
  </em>
  . This allows for the companion stories to take center stage, allowing the strongest aspect of the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  to shine through: the characters. Every companion quest offers multiple possible endings, making replaying through them more than worth it. Combined with a decent amount of build variety and good gunplay,
  <em>
   ME2's
  </em>
  base game offers a ton of replay value.

  Other than her appearance, which takes the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </strong>
  </em>
  fanbase by storm, Jane Doe possesses some Skills during combat. Her ability to quickly trigger Assault over and over again makes her a perfect DPS unit who can carry the team’s DMG or form a quick-swap team with other characters like Grace in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , who’s also great at triggering Shock.

 <p>
  Since Jane Doe is an Anomaly unit in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , it’s important to build her with Drive Discs that amplify that type of DPS for her. While Freedom Blues seems to be a good choice, the
  <strong>
   4pc of Fanged Metal
  </strong>
  scores a little bit higher DPS because of its passive, which increases her DMG against an enemy who’s hit by Assault. This is great for Jane Doe’s kit as she can keep triggering the Assault Anomaly and enjoy that extra DMG.

 <p>
  Build her with
  <strong>
   2pc of Freedom Blues
  </strong>
  to accompany the 4pc of Fanged Metal, which will further increase Jane Doe’s Anomaly Proficiency. This is the best way to build Jane Doe in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  after you give her
  <strong>
   Anomaly Proficiency in slot 4, Physical DMG in slot 5
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Anomaly Mastery in slot 6
  </strong>
  , and more
  <strong>
   Anomaly Proficiency in Sub-stats
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Of course, you can still build Jane Doe with
  <strong>
   4pc of Freedom Blues
  </strong>
  to reduce enemies’ buildup resistance. As for the 2pc, giving an Anomaly character ATK, PEN, or Physical DMG can always further amplify the S-Rank unit’s Assault Anomaly. So,
  <strong>
   2pc of Fanged Metal
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   2pc of Hormone Punk
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   2pc Puffer Electro
  </strong>
  are fine for Jane Doe’s build in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  .

  Sharpened Stinger is the best W-Engine for Jane Doe in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  as it increases her Physical DMG, Anomaly Buildup, and Anomaly Proficiency. Since it’s her Best-in-Slot weapon, it’s only fair to be perfectly made for her.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Fusion Compiler
  </strong>
  is a strong competitor as it continuously increases her ATK% and Anomaly Proficiency as long as Jane Doe is using her Special Attacks. Not to mention, the S-Rank W-Engine’s Sub-stat gives Jane Doe up to 24% PEN, which can be very helpful when triggering her Assault Anomalies.

 <p>
  Diving into her best A-Rank W-Engines in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , go for
  <strong>
   Weeping Gemini
  </strong>
  as it keeps increasing Jane Doe’s Anomaly Proficiency as she and her allies keep triggering Attribute Anomaly on the same enemy. She can reach up to 120 extra Anomaly Proficiency, which can be insane for her DMG.
  <strong>
   Rainforest Gourmet
  </strong>
  grants Jane Doe up to 75 Anomaly Proficiency on top of a passive that can give her up to 25% extra ATK%.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Roaring Ride
  </strong>
  has the ability to buff up to three of Jane Doe’s stats, which are her ATK%, her Anomaly Proficiency, and her Anomaly Buildup Rate on top of the ATK% she gets from the W-Engine’s Sub-stat. Finally,
  <strong>
   Electro-Lip Gloss
  </strong>
  grants Jane Doe more Anomaly Proficiency as it increases her DMG against enemies affected by any Anomaly. Keep in mind that all the 4-star W-Engines are close in performance, so, any of them is a good A-Rank W-Engine for Jane Doe in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   <em>
    LEGO Horizon Adventures
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings Guerrilla Games'
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  franchise into the wonderful world of LEGO, putting a fresh new spin on the Sony-exclusive series. A crossover with the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  games is a surprising choice, but the previews for
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  showcase a promising title with a lot of potential for fun.

 <p>
  The current trailers for
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  have shown some of the many features to be expected from LEGO games, especially when it comes to the toy company's humor. However, there appears to be one major change in this LEGO crossover compared to previous games.
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  differs from the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  franchise in many ways, but the game also seems to subvert the LEGO tradition of featuring a huge cast of playable characters.

  In the various LEGO games that have been released in the past, each game has featured a huge cast of characters for players to pick from. One of the most notable crossovers for LEGO has been the
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars
  </em>
  series, which features a wide variety of the franchise's most iconic faces, and most of them are playable. However, the nature of the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  franchise may have caused LEGO to pull back on a big cast.

  A Larger Cast Doesn't Make Sense for the Horizon Franchise
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  isn't completely saying goodbye to multiple playable characters. It's clear in the trailers that players will be able to play as Erend and Varl, but it's unknown if
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  will expand beyond that. Although it's highly possible that more playable characters have yet to be revealed, featuring a large cast doesn't exactly work for the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  series.

  Franchise protagonist Aloy has a close-knit group of friends that doesn't exactly lend itself to creating a big character roster. It makes far more sense to feature just a few of
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  's many characters as playable options in
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  . Also, Aloy is the clear focal point of the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  series, so it could potentially be jarring to not put her in the spotlight.

 <p>
  LEGO and
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  are a strange pairing, but it could prove to work really well if
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  doesn't steer too far off course.
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  is in a tricky spot in terms of balancing both worlds and adding too many playable characters to the game's lineup could be one step too far. The game already features a completely different camera angle, melee focus, and the great sense of humor that LEGO has become well-known for. As exciting as these changes are,
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  needs to remember to at least keep some of the Horizon franchise's features intact.

 <p>
  The impending release date for
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  is set to bring the game to life sometime during the holidays, and it will be intriguing to see just how well this collaboration is pulled off.
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  and LEGO coming together is a collaboration that many weren't expecting, but if the game sticks the landing, it could be a fun addition to the growing list of LEGO titles. As the game gets closer to launch, there will likely be more features and characters revealed. Whether these characters are playable or not will hopefully be answered soon, but until then,
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  remains an intriguing take on one of Sony's most successful exclusive franchises.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  chart shows five-star characters who have been waiting for their reruns for a long time. In every
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  update, at least two five-star units get their rerun banner that lasts for several weeks. These banners appear alongside new characters' debut banners, allowing players to expand their teams. They are a great way to earn duplicate units and unlock Constellations.

 <p>
  When
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players get a copy of a character they already have, they can spend it to unlock their Constellations. Many units benefit from these power-ups, earning new effects that improve their skills. For example, one of the newest five-star characters, Arlecchino, gets damage and level bonuses for his skills when his Constellations are activated.

  A new
  <em>
   Genshin
  </em>
  Impact chart, shared by RapidFresh on Reddit, shows five-star characters who have gone the longest without receiving their own rerun. It turns out Shenhe was available on a banner 12 updates ago, while Ganyu received her last rerun in version 3.6 last year. Since their last reruns, HoYoverse has released two new gacha games,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  . The chart also reveals that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's Kokomi has been absent for nine consecutive updates. One thing to note is that these five-star characters won't likely be available in version 4.8.

  When it comes to playing
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero

  </strong>
  , players must focus on unlocking and leveling up your characters. This task might sound as daunting at first, but with the assistance of a few items, you can boost your character’s stats.

  However, one item that you should be looking to get your hands on early in the game is W-Engines. These items increase the base attack of your characters, and add helpful buffs to your agent. For those who want to obtain this valuable item in the game, read this guide.

 <p>
  W-Engines are specialized equipment items that function much like weapons in other games. These items are specifically designed to enhance your Agents and work by boosting their Base Attack (ATK) when equipped. Apart from their base attack advantage, each W-Engine also offers a few other distinct benefits and buffs to your agents.

     However, it is important to note that your agents can only equip one W-Engine at a time. This limitation can be mitigated by upgrading and customizing these items. Doing so will not only help improve their attack power (ATK) but also increase their overall effectiveness in combat .

  Memory vestiges drop only from glowing enemies inside Cyst missions. Take them out, then if the vestige doesn't automatically get added to your inventory, try to see if the slain enemy dropped anything. Once you collect five Memory Vestiges, they'll automatically be converted into a purple Memory, which can either be Refractions, Blooming, or Seclusions of Light. If vestiges aren't dropping for you, try doing whichever Cyst is featured on the daily rotation.

  After getting Memory: Refractions of Light, you'll want to visit The Refraction, a sub-area in the Pale Heart connecting the Landing to the Blooming. To get here from the Landing spawn point, enter the cave network in the east leading to the area where you find the Facet of Justice in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . Drop down the hole, then cross the chasm with the Shriekers. You'll soon find a large tree near the end of the area.

 <p>
  Climb the tree, and on the top branches, you'll see a Prismatic Chest. With Memory: Refractions of Light in your inventory, you should be able to open it and collect the Facet of Awakening, which lets you spawn elemental pickups whenever you rapidly defeat enemies with Light, Dark, or Super damage. The type of elemental pickup you get depends on what type of damage deals the final blow. It also provides +10 Resilience.

  Even for those who have played similar games in the past, there are plenty of new activities and things to do on
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  that some titles have not explored. Therefore, even those who aren't beginners to farming simulators may find these beginner tips to be helpful, so they can make a great head start on creating the perfect farm and cleaning the island.

    Updated on July 9, 2024, by Megan Smith:
   </strong>
   Since Coral Island was released in November 2023, the adorable farming simulator has seen plenty of patches and a promising new update approaching this summer. The next segment of the story is expected to release with players being able to start their own farm underwater and be a part of the Merfolk community, with even the chance at a romance. This is therefore a great time for beginners to get onto Coral Island and, therefore, these are by far the best beginner tips to help players make money fast and have an easier time when starting up their very own farm.

  Players who have only just started their playthrough of
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  may feel that the time of day passes them far too quickly. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  allows players to alter how quickly the day passes by. One of
  <em>
   Coral Island's
  </em>
  beginner tips is decreasing this time from 100% to 50%.

 <p>
  This means that each day in
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  is likely to last around 40 minutes, which is plenty of time to get everything the player needs to be done. When reaching mid or late-game, the days can be shortened once more.

  One of the main features of
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  is the task of cleaning the ocean. Besides being the Good Samaritan and helping the island with cleaning the trash from the waters, exploring deeper under the waves will allow the player to encounter the Merfolk Kingdom.

 <p>
  Beginners should make progress with Merfolk, not only to start a new quest but also to collect the other kelp types that can be found far past the kingdom too. This kelp is usually used in crafting recipes or its essence, which is used to upgrade the player's seeds, saplings, and the feed they give their animals for better quality crops and resources.

  As mentioned with the flowers, players can easily make everyone on
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  their friend. While some players may question why they need to do that, it's quite simple. Getting to a certain number of hearts with each character in the game will reward the player with certain recipes or other gifts from their favorite people.

 <p>
  This doesn't just include the islanders living in Starlet Town, but also the giants players can free, or the Merfolk that live in the ocean. All of these people can be befriended and the number of hearts the player has earned with them can be found in the menu.

 <p>
  Players that have just started
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  may have been tempted to play the game due to seeing the aesthetically pleasing farming of those who have been playing the farming simulator title for much longer. Players should therefore consider how they want their farm to look when planning where to put their fields, coops, and barns.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  It is also important to plan these things for when the player unlocks various equipment like sprinkler systems and scarecrows, as fields will likely need to be created around these items to make the most of them. Not to forget to mention the various decorative items and paths players can craft too.

  In almost every season of
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  , flowers can be grown using seeds or plucked from the wild. While it may be easy to sell these plants for a simple bit of coin, almost every islander on
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  loves flowers. Collecting as many as possible and handing a flower to one of these people will garner a small amount of approval from them.

  With enough flowers given, players will then also experience their heart events. However, there are some exceptions to this. For example, many islanders don't like violets, and Charles doesn't like flowers because he's allergic.

  While it may be fun to spontaneously build a farm, players will find that although they have a lot of space, these things have not been put into smart places. By using the camera tool that allows players to look at the entirety of their farm at a distance, the player can have a rough idea of what buildings or fields they want where.

 <p>
  Players can also till soil to plan out how big their fields are going to be and how much space is going to be between them. If the ground stays watered, these fields will remain on the farm, otherwise, they will disappear. By focusing on the effective way to use the space available, the player can then be certain where their animals can go and how big to make their grass fields.

  Like many other farming simulator titles, players don't want to spend every single day only watering their crops when there are plenty of other activities to complete that also require the player to have a large amount of energy.

  Thankfully, players can unlock sprinklers which will do all the watering work for them every morning as long as it can reach every part of the field. Besides watering fruit and veg, the Sprinkler is also able to distribute various fertilizers which will allow a player to worry less about their fields while making a better profit.

  Although a player may be tempted to go for the first animal they are able to purchase due to both the coop and the chickens being the cheapest to purchase, players should practice patience and wait until they have enough for a barn and cows first.

  Naturally, cows can be milked daily and this can be left as milk or transformed into cheese or butter. Selling any three of these products that come from a cow is sure to put a nice amount of money in the player's pocket, as well as easily making back the money they spent on owning the cows in the first place.

  Besides the player focusing on their own needs, the people around the island will also require the player's aid from time to time. While some may send the player a letter requesting something specifically, at other moments, the player may notice an exclamation mark above the errand board next to Sam's General Store that requires the player to usually bring a crop from that season.

  Players who have made more progress in the mines within the Cavern will unlock the possibility of also picking up errands from the Band of Smiles. These tasks will require the player to collect monster loot or other resources that can be found during their mining adventures.

  Cleaning the ocean in
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  isn't only an important task for progressing the story of the game, but also a great way to gain access to another quick way of making money. The player will eventually have access to the various underwater caves which can be explored to clean up more trash.

  While this sounds quite boring, players have the chance to find mysterious treasures within that can be opened and then sold for a profit. The further into the game a player gets, the more likely they are to find the same things which can then easily be sold as they no longer need to be donated.

  Rainy days are the best for getting extraneous tasks done, as players won't be wasting any of their energy watering plants. As soon as the player is out of bed, and they see that there is water falling from the sky, they should quickly tend to their animals – remembering to leave them indoors as they hate the rain – and then make their way to the mines.

 <p>
  Players will want to collect all the valuable resources and get as far down as possible. Every rock the player hits will cause them to lose energy, but certain levels of the mines will unlock a milestone they can return to at a later date. Alternatively, the player may wish to go fishing instead, or clean trash underwater, which are both promising moneymakers.

  Gaining levels in these various skills will unlock various blueprints for craftables like higher-level sprinklers, bombs, and various equipment that allow the player to make artisan products. Alongside this, at certain levels, players will also unlock skill points that can be used to upgrade various parts of those skills, such as breaking additional rocks or crops being more likely to be a higher rarity.

  Like
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  , players can visit a museum with no exhibits on
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  . It is up to the player to help Scott fill this museum once more with fish, bugs, artifacts, and, eventually, fossils. The more things that are added to the museum, the higher the museum's score will be.

 <p>
  This then helps the town's rank increase, which can also unlock new seeds and shops for the player to explore. Every fish or insect will need to be added to the museum and, therefore, to make it easier for the player, it's always a great idea to donate the first one before the player forgets. Once again, players can check their inventory to see if they have donated the item if they are unsure.

  Players should be hoarding all their resources as if it were a survival game. Every material in the game has some sort of purpose. Many of the fish caught, or foraged items plucked from the bottom of the ocean will be used in an offering found by the lake. Thankfully, when hovering over items in the player's inventory, they can see if they have donated them to the museum or if they are needed for an offering.

  Besides this, the remaining resources will likely be useful in crafting or building. Wood, stone, and ore will be needed to purchase barns or coops, while other materials like scrap or glass are required for more hands-on crafting.

 <p>
  While players may be required to grow crops that can only be harvested once before needing new seeds planted for offerings or the occasional errand, the best crops to be grown in bulk are those that have multiple harvests a season. This means a player can wait five days for them to grow, harvest them, and then wait another two days to harvest them again.

 <p>
  Players are likely to have plenty of crops they can then sell or progress into other things. For example, they could be put into a mason jar to create jam, or in a keg to be turned into juice. Either way, the player has a promising profit on their hands.

  One of the most exciting aspects of many RPGs is the way battles develop, requiring players to customize strategies that fit their preferred style. That's why many games in the genre boast incredible class systems, allowing players to personalize characters in various ways, adapting each party member to fulfill a different role.

 <p>
  The best class systems in RPGs are those that offer players a wide variety of options when building their characters, ensuring flexibility and balance for the challenges ahead. This freedom is also crucial for creating unique strategies, enhancing gameplay depth and allowing each player's party to be truly one-of-a-kind.

  While maintaining the same mechanics and philosophy as Atlus'

  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  also takes the opportunity to change quite a few things. For instance, it's now possible to have more freedom in customizing the story's companions, allowing each to be assigned a new class.

 <p>
  This is achieved through the Archetypes mechanic, which partly functions like summons but grants new attributes and abilities to each of the available party characters. Players can thus create different builds and compositions throughout the dungeons of

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: Origins
   </em>
  </strong>
  is widely recognized as one of the RPGs with the best class systems, offering three main options for the protagonist, each with diverse and unique specializations that adapt to different gameplay styles. This depth allows players to meticulously customize their characters, catering to both newcomers and veterans of the genre, ensuring an engaging experience at every moment.

 <p>
  Moreover, choosing a class that matches each player's style is important because combat in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  combines real-time systems with pauses. While attacks occur, players need to understand what their character can or cannot do to determine the best moment to pause. The options are also intriguing, each offering unique mechanics that help differentiate each of the characters.

  franchise is the depth of their class systems, and

  retains the irreverent spirit of the

 <p>
  By adapting everyday jobs into an RPG context, the game transforms party customization into an experience that is, at the very least, entertaining. Each class brings abilities that borrow common skills from various different RPGs but adapts them to a modern context, making the animations and mechanics amusing. In this way, the mix of satire and mechanics gives the title incredible charm.

  A direct sequel to the first game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire

  </strong>
  takes players on a story that strays a bit from the typical high medieval fantasy setting, introducing pirates and naval battles. However, one of the game's strong points remains its robust class system.

  Here, players have access to class options that many are already familiar with, such as fighters, rogues, or wizards, but it's the subclasses within each category that make
  <em>

  so unique. Players have at least four options in each one (with some having even more), and combined with the game's progression, this always allows for creating different characters in each new run.

  Having a well-crafted class system has always been a tradition in
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  games, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Three Houses
   </em>
  </strong>
  seized the opportunity to try something new. Thus, the various characters that can be recruited for the team can be equipped with any possible class option, something that wasn't so common in the series until then.

 <p>
  However, characters still have greater affinity for certain classes, meaning the effort required for some combinations is higher, and some options are exclusive to certain genders. At the same time, the possibilities for party compositions transform the game, allowing for various ways to adapt to future combat encounters.

  </strong>
  stands out for its highly flexible class system, offering nine distinct vocations, both basic and advanced, that players can choose and switch between at any time. This diversity allows for the creation of personalized strategies, adapting to different playstyles and challenges, ensuring a unique and engaging experience in every battle.

 <p>
  Furthermore, the integration of vocations with Pawns — AI-controlled allies — expands the possibilities during battles even more. Players can combine different classes for themselves and their companions, promoting synergy that encourages experimentation to see what works and what doesn't, making this system a shining example of RPGs with excellent class systems.

 <p>
  One achievement of Owlcat Games with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pathfinder: Wrath of The Righteous
   </em>
  </strong>
  was creating one of the best character class systems among isometric RPGs, mainly by allowing level progression up to level 20. This grants players access to incredibly powerful spells and other abilities.

 <p>
  Customization is another strong point of the game, as almost every level gained requires players to choose something or learn a new skill. Thus, while characters participate in a war against hordes of demons, there's always something new to use, keeping the gameplay fresh at all times.

  Fortunately, this freedom also extends to the companions. Although they have classes already defined by lore, players can ignore this and make changes to adapt the companions to the party composition. This greatly increases the possibilities, as customization is no longer limited to just the protagonist, allowing players to use their full creativity to create their ideal

  2024 marks the 30th anniversary of the mighty PlayStation, which was first released in Japan on December 3, 1994. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Sony has been pulling out all the stops to celebrate the occasion, with limited edition console releases, a huge PS Store sale with nearly 500 discounts, and a couple of 30th Anniversary PlayStation Stars challenges all taking place.

  owners may also have noticed that for a limited period, their consoles will display the classic PS1 startup screen when they first boot it up. They'll also be able to choose between a number of dynamic themes that were inspired by the four PlayStation consoles that came before the PS5, as well as a special 30th Anniversary theme.

  The 30th Anniversary theme will be selected by default. However, if players navigate to
  <strong>
   the settings menu
  </strong>
  , they'll now see a new option at the top labeled
  <strong>
   PlayStation 30th Anniversary
  </strong>
  . From here, if they select the
  <strong>
   Appearance and Sound
  </strong>
  option, they'll be able to choose between the five available dynamic themes via a dropdown menu, or disable dynamic themes entirely by choosing Off. It's worth noting that these themes don't just alter the appearance of the PS5's dashboard, but also some of the sounds, which should serve as a huge nostalgia trip for older gamers.

  Unfortunately, as of the moment, the PS1 startup screen and 30th Anniversary themes will only be available for a limited time. Sony hasn't announced when exactly they'll be removed, but the general consensus seems to be that they'll be gone by January. However, disconnecting from the internet and changing the console's internal clock suggests that Sony plans to remove them via an update, meaning
  <strong>
   PS5 owners can keep the PS1 startup screen and 30th Anniversary themes by declining all future software updates
  </strong>
  . Of course, this is a somewhat extreme option just to keep some cosmetics and likely won't be an option for those who play online or purchase their games digitally. If that's the case, players can only hope that Sony decides to leave the themes in even after the 30th Anniversary celebrations come to an end.

  Anime tower defense games have become extremely popular on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  as of late, as evidenced by the success of
  <em>
   Anime Reborn
  </em>
  . Released in late 2024, the game quickly rose to the top of the best experiences list, with hundreds of thousands of people taking the time to check it out.

  players with numerous rewards just for playing, although those looking to get their hands on some extra Gems can do so by using
  <em>
   Anime Reborn
  </em>
  codes. This guide contains all of the latest codes for
  <em>
   Anime Reborn
  </em>
  , as well as information on how players can redeem them.

  <em>
   With the Gohun event set to end soon and the race for infinite leaderboard rewards in full swing, there are plenty of reasons to dive back into Anime Reborn. For those still on the fence though, there's also a new Anime Reborn code, which players can redeem to get 50,000 Red Tickets and 30 Capsules. After doing so, they should take a moment to bookmark this page and then check back here often, as we're constantly adding new codes for Anime Reborn to the list below.

 <p>
  Much to everybody’s surprise,
  <strong>
   Godzilla
  </strong>
  was added to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Chapter 6, Season 1 as both a skin and a boss. This means that the King of the Monsters has joined a collection of legendary movie icons that are also available as skins in Epic Games’ flagship title, alongside the likes of Darth Vader, the Terminator, John Wick, and more.

 <p>
  However, it’s important to clarify that the only
  <em>
   Godzilla
  </em>
  skin available in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  for now is based on Godzilla Evolved, a recent incarnation of the character that debuted in
  <em>
   Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire
  </em>
  . As great as it looks, this character has had multiple different designs and appearances throughout his 70-year-long history, and it would be downright criminal to relegate
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  to having just one. There is a lot to choose from, but the following versions of Godzilla would make for some fun and cool-looking skins.

  Originally released in November 2023,
  <em>
   Godzilla Minus One
  </em>
  is the most recent Japanese entry in the long-running
  <em>
   Godzilla
  </em>
  franchise, and it immediately became both a critical and commercial success around the world. Because of all this, the version of the character that stars in this film, known by fans as
  <strong>
   Minus One Godzilla
  </strong>
  , was quickly cemented as one of the best in the entire franchise.

 <p>
  Minus One Godzilla has an excellent design that references previous incarnations but also features enough new elements that make him stand out. Not to mention that he looks and acts terrifying, so he would work well as a skin. The only problem, however, is that
  <em>
   Godzilla Minus One
  </em>
  is a very dark and serious film and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  is a goofy and colorful video game with a player base of mostly kids and teens. This clash of tones may make Toho - who is infamously very controlling of their most popular character - reject the inclusion of a skin based on this particular incarnation.

 <p>
  As far as Godzilla designs go, very few of them stand out as much as
  <strong>
   Shin Godzilla
  </strong>
  , from the 2016 film of the same name. This is basically a kaiju/horror movie, and the titular monster's design perfectly reflects these elements, as he looks both terrifying and disturbing. None of this should be a surprise, however, seeing as
  <em>
   Shin Godzilla
  </em>
  was directed by the one and only Hideaki Anno of
  <em>
   Neon Genesis Evangelion
  </em>
  fame.

 <p>
  This is such a popular film with such a popular and iconic design for Godzilla that it undoubtedly deserves to be added to
  <em>
   Fortnite: Battle Royale
  </em>
  as a brand-new skin. There’s only one small issue, though: the existing Godzilla Evolved skin had its tail significantly cut down, and Shin Godzilla’s design features an exceedingly long tail that would look odd if it was shortened. Nevertheless, the talented designers at Epic Games would most likely find an effective way to make it work.

 <p>
  Godzilla Evolved from
  <em>
   Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire
  </em>
  looks great and all, but it would be very disappointing if this was the only Godzilla design from Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse added to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . After all, this heroic incarnation of the character debuted in
  <em>
   Godzilla
  </em>
  (2014) and he immediately became recognizable around the world due to his heavy features and his shiny blue atomic beam.

 <p>
  On the other hand, Godzilla Evolved is significantly slimmer and has bright pink scales on his back, characteristics that are nowhere near as iconic as those of the regular
  <strong>
   Monsterverse Godzilla
  </strong>
  . When it comes down to choosing a specific design, the ones featured in
  <em>
   Godzilla
  </em>
  (2014) and
  <em>
   Godzilla: King of the Monsters
  </em>
  have some slight differences, but either of them would work perfectly as a
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skin.

 <p>
  When most people think of Godzilla, two designs will immediately come to mind: The aforementioned regular Monsterverse Godzilla or the incarnation from the Heisei Era of the
  <em>
   Godzilla
  </em>
  movie franchise that debuted back in
  <em>
   Godzilla vs. Biollante
  </em>
  . This amazing design starred in six excellent kaiju flicks that cemented him as the #1 most iconic appearance of the King of the Monsters. Not only does
  <strong>
   Heisei Godzilla
  </strong>
  deserve to join Godzilla Evolved in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , but this version of the character comes with an interesting twist that could make him stand out even further.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Godzilla vs. Destoroyah
  </em>
  , he achieved a dangerous new form known as
  <strong>
   Burning Godzilla
  </strong>
  , which has bright orange energy brimming from different areas of his body and can fire a devastating red spiral atomic beam. This form is just as iconic as the original Heisei Godzilla, and it's different enough that it could be its separate skin in
  <em>
   Fortnite.
  </em>
  There's no denying that Burning Godzilla has the potential to look extremely cool in-game, and most players would love to play as him.

  When it comes to third-party skins, it has been proven time and time again that characters from animated productions with cartoony designs just fit in
  <em>
   Fortnite: Battle Royale
  </em>
  way better, seeing as the game has a colorful and lighthearted art style. Because of this, Epic Games may want to turn one of the many animated versions of Godzilla into a skin.

  There’s a lot to choose from, like Godzilla Earth or Hanna-Barbera Godzilla, but
  <strong>
   Godzilla Ultima
  </strong>
  from the 2021 anime series
  <em>
   Godzilla: Singular Point
  </em>
  would definitely work best because this show’s art style is the most similar to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ’s. This antagonistic version of the character features a distinctive and intimidating design that would heavily contrast with Godzilla Evolved, even if translating his big thighs into an in-game skin may present a challenge to the designers. Lastly, this hypothetical skin would work perfectly as cross-promotion if Toho decides to release Season 2 of
  <em>
   Singular Point
  </em>
  in the near future.

 <p>
  The main reason so many fans have found the Godzilla Evolved skin in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  to look so weird is that the design of the character had to be properly adjusted so it could better fit the obvious human proportions of the player character. So, a good way to fix this issue would be to use another incarnation of Godzilla that has more human-like attributes. Of course, the poorly aged suits from the Showa Era made Godzilla seem more human by accident, but if Epic Games wants something more modern and admittedly more cool-looking, they could always go for
  <strong>
   Final Wars Godzilla
  </strong>
  from
  <em>
   Godzilla Final Wars
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  This is a more agile and acrobatic incarnation of the King of the Monsters, not to mention that he is so incredibly powerful that he managed to defeat multiple monsters in the same movie. He also has an amazing design that makes him look like the culmination of every Godzilla that came before him.
  <em>
   Final Wars
  </em>
  may have come out twenty years ago, but the titular monster's suit is still in use to this day, seeing as it appeared in this year’s
  <em>
   Fest Godzilla
  </em>
  short film. This all means this version of Godzilla is still quite relevant today.

  <em>

  is no stranger to adding emotes and other cosmetics that are based on viral internet memes. So Epic Games could always lean into this aspect and add the incarnation of Godzilla from the infamous
  <em>
   Godzilla vs. Megalon
  </em>
  in a future update. After all, this is undoubtedly the most unintentionally funny version of the character.

  <strong>
   Vs. Megalon Godzilla
  </strong>
  (also known as MegaroGoji) is the protagonist of one of the most absurd and hilarious entries in the franchise, and he’s partially responsible for this movie’s reputation. His wholesome friendship with newcomer Jet Jaguar was already quite funny in and of itself, but the incredible Drop Kick scene cemented him as a viral legend, even among people who have never seen a single
  <em>
   Godzilla
  </em>
  film. Needless to say, if Epic Games makes a Vs. Megalon Godzilla skin, they 100% should add a Drop Kick emote alongside him.

  as a skin to teach the game’s younger audience where it all started for this massive movie icon (as long as Toho approves of it, of course). As a fun detail, they could even make the 1954 Godzilla skin entirely black and white, which would work as a clever reference to his classic debut film.

  Turn-based strategy games are a genre focused heavily on gameplay, be it the actual battles themselves or the micromanaging of the player's armies and equipment. The best part about this genre is that it features some incredible, and often under-appreciated, stories that drive the gameplay forward. With the recent renaissance of the genre through
  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord, Project Triangle Strategy,
  </em>
  and the recent
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  games, this is the ideal time to delve deep into the best narratives the genre has to offer.

 <p>
  While many games in the genre have very similar themes underscoring their stories, it has been fascinating to see how different developers and different franchises have tackled these themes and made them their own. A lot of turn-based strategy games have decent, serviceable stories, but the games below surely stand out, not only in the genre but in strategy games generally.

   The turn-based strategy genre is one that is fortunate to have received a constant stream of incredible games over the past few years. Be it ambitious mainstream titles such as Fire Emblem or more niche projects that consistently try to reinvent the wheel. With the recent uptick of high-quality turn-based releases, fans of the genre have been spoiled for choice. With the recent release of Metal Slug Tactics and the upcoming release of two new turn-based games; Warhammer 40K: Mechanicus 2 and MENACE, this is the perfect time to revisit the turn-based strategy games with the best stories.

  <em>
   Project Triangle Strategy
  </em>
  is one of the more underrated recent strategy games. While it doesn't quite have the glamour of a
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  game, nor was it an astonishing success like
  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord,
  </em>
  it's a great turn-based strategy game with an amazing story in its own right.
  <em>
   Triangle Strategy
  </em>
  is centered around the struggle of three nations and their ruling classes to control the region's resources. The game doesn't feature a fantastical story, it is rather realistic, which makes Serenoa's decisions even more gripping. Be it the harsh mirror to reality that can be drawn through the Rosellan's fate, the harsh realities of royal blood depicted through Roland, or decisions pitting personal vengeance in contention with the greater good, there's a lot this game offers.

 <p>
  <em>
   Triangle Strategy
  </em>
  is full of entertaining antagonists, cunning political ploys, and a riveting story told at a rapid pace. All of this is neatly tied together with some solid voice acting and wonderful art and animation. While some of the characters may be a bit generic or one-dimensional, the larger overarching narrative is strong, and the world-building is good enough to get players invested.

  The

  Trilogy is one of the best indie-developed strategy series out there. Stoic Games has crafted an astounding trilogy, solid gameplay incredible visuals and art, and a superb story.
  <em>
   Banner Saga 3
  </em>
  picks up where the previous two titles left off. A small Viking convoy is trying to survive the apocalypse. The story in
  <em>
   Banner Sage 3
  </em>
  is shaped directly by player choices in the two previous games, not only does this make every difficult decision extremely important, it makes sure players live with the consequences of their actions for hours upon hours.

  While a little short,
  <em>
   Banner Saga 3
  </em>
  is the culmination of a beautiful and melancholic story, which is aptly supported by incredible visuals and a great soundtrack. A cold, brutal, winter's tale, it's a shame the game ends so quickly because it has one of the best stories any strategy game has churned out in years.

  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  as a franchise is one with solid stories, albeit a bit formulaic and often barebones.
  <em>
   Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance
  </em>
  is very different. The story follows Ike and his inherited band of mercenaries as they navigate a complex, political world on the brink of disaster. The game features tons of loveable characters, such as Mordecai, Mist, Oscar, and Boyd to name a few. The support conversations of most of the main cast do a great job of fleshing out their personalities and filling out the gaps in the main narrative.

 <p>
  <em>
   Path of Radiance
  </em>
  is a story with tons of themes; slavery, racism, class divides, and, of course, a fantastical fantasy narrative full of political intrigue, tragedy, and tons of action. The game does well to balance out all of this and presents a solid and entertaining story, which is partly why it is one of the fan-favorite games in the franchise.

  <em>
   Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis
  </em>
  is an old-school JPRG game with a very rustic and colorful vibe. It stands out as one of the most underrated turn-based strategy games in the genre. Set as a prequel to the other
  <em>
   Tactics Ogre
  </em>
  games, it follows the story of Alphonse, a knight of Lodis sent to the land of Ovis where he learns about the brutality of those he serves. The game follows Alphonse as he slowly unravels the conspiracies set down by the powers that be, regarding the oppression of the island, continental takeover, and some mystical weapons.

 <p>
  However, as with all
  <em>
   Tactics Ogre
  </em>
  games, choices are vital. The direction Alphonse's campaign takes can vary heavily depending on player choices. The story also depends on gameplay, as the deaths of certain important characters have a direct impact on the narrative. What makes
  <em>
   Knight of Lodis, so
  </em>
  good is how it is able to balance this complex and tragic narrative in a way where players can sympathize with Alphonse's actions while also recognizing his flaws. The fact that each choosable branch of the story is even in quality is an incredible feat in the GBA era as well.

  A common theme with most turn-based strategy games is narratives centering around large-scale wars between kingdoms, clashing ideologies, and political manipulation. While some may feel these tropes are over-used, the fact is that games such as
  <em>

  </em>
  have dealt with these themes so well, that it doesn't matter.

  <em>
   War of the Lions
  </em>
  is an incredible story centered around a young sellsword named Ramza as he comes to terms with the torrid state of his world. The land of Ivalice is one marred with class elitism, manipulative nobles, and religious exploitation. Players watch the complex and thrilling story unfold through Ramza's eyes. Despite being a strategy game, the game is paced well and never drags on. The cutscenes are a delight, and every interaction between Ramza and his childhood friend Delita is a clear highlight.

  <em>
   Three Houses
  </em>
  is one of the most successful games in the genre, and for good reason. The game's overarching story is centered around three characters, Dimitri, Edelgard, and Claude, the would-be rulers of three kingdoms, attending a monastery to train for their incumbent roles. The three lords, and their fellow students each make up a respective 'house' of the monastery and players can choose who to join.
 </p>

 <p>
  The story quickly turns from a tale of ambitious students on everyday missions to an unsettling and mature narrative centered around political conflict; the ends one goes to fuel their ambition and the disconnect between fellowship and duty. Players are treated to three different stories, around each of the three lords. Dimitri's is a tale of sorrow, trauma, and vengeful spite. Players follow him coming to terms with his own shortcomings and using them to be a better ruler. A more mature tale, it is executed well and represents the epitome of what a
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  story can be. Edelgard and Claude both have fantastic campaigns as well, based around their own ambitions, personal grievances, and the needs of their lands and people. Overall, this is a fantastic turn-based strategy game and one every entrant to the genre should check out.

  This game features one of the best stories players can find in any strategy game. The game is rife with gut-wrenching decision-making, it features a dark story that doesn't shy away from thrusting players into difficult decisions and getting blood on the protagonist, Denam's hands. He can go from being an idealistic rebel to a cutthroat knight orchestrating a rebellion to something in between. Either way, Denam has to suffer through betrayal and tragedy as he navigates his way around this beautiful, yet tragic world.

  voice acting only enriches the story as it adds visceral reactions to some of the hardest parts of the story, be it the decision in Balamusa, or the encounters with Knight Lanselot. The game also features a rich world, chock-full of entertaining and complex characters, tons of lore, and hundreds of hours worth of story to get through. Not only is this one of the best turn-based tactics games out there as a package, but its story is among the best of the best.

  These recruits will become your loyal companions and assist you in your survival alongside many activities, including resource collection, base protection, and providing shelter for your farm animals. Therefore, you will need to get as many tribe members as possible to manage the workload. If you are wondering how to carry out this task, this guide can help you out.

  The process of recruiting new tribe members in
  <em>
   Soulmask
  </em>
  is rather simple, although it will take sufficient time and effort to get one. Initially, you must locate potential recruits and engage in combat to weaken them. After that, you'll need to earn their trust before inviting them to join your clan. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this.

 <h3 id="locate-the-tribesmen">
  Locate the Tribesmen
 </h3>
 <p>
  To begin with, your first task is to find tribesmen scattered across the game world. You'll be
  <strong>
   focusing on recruiting either Barbarians or Outcasts
  </strong>
  . Barbarians tend to inhabit Ruins spread throughout the map, while Outcasts can be found in Barracks.

     These tribesmen are initially hostile towards you, so it's wise to avoid direct confrontation with groups. Instead, try to isolate a single individual from their group and engage with them.

 <p>
  To recruit a character, your first step is to weaken them. Engage in combat with them, ensuring not to inflict fatal injuries. Continue fighting until their health drops below 20%. Once their health reaches this critical point, interact with them to choose the "deter" option. Press the designated key E to initiate the process and use your mask to temporarily render the enemy unconscious.

 <h3 id="gain-their-trust">
  Gain Their Trust
 </h3>
 <p>
  With the NPC now incapacitated, it's time to seize the opportunity to earn their trust. Approach them and press E to access their inventory menu. Proceed by placing liquid food items and bandages into their inventory slots for their use. While they're unconscious, get your deterred enemy back to your base and accommodate them until they regain consciousness.

 <h3 id="recruit-them">
  Recruit Them
 </h3>
 <p>
  While your deterred enemy is recovering, you will need to pay close attention to the Recognition score displayed in their stat bar. Make sure that it crosses 500 before proceeding with recruitment. Once the Recognition score meets the requirement, the option to Recruit them will become available. Now simply press E to welcome them into your clan.

  The Light and Dark saga of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  has finally come to an end, and all the events that happened ever since the game was released now culminate in Excision, one final mission where a fireteam of 12 Guardians band together to stop the Witness once and for all.

  Excision marks the end of a decade-long era in the franchise. While it's nowhere near as difficult or rewarding as
  <em>
   Destiny 2's
  </em>
  Salvation's Edge raid, it's an epic mission that all fans of the game should experience at least once. Here's a quick overview of what Excision is and what players can expect from it.

  Excision is the first-ever 12-man activity in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , and it became available right after Salvation's Edge was cleared for the first time by Team Parabellum. Unlike the raid, this mission is a lot easier and involves fewer mechanics. It's more of a narrative experience like other campaign missions, but with public matchmaking. You can start this mission by going to the Pale Heart and
  <strong>
   scrolling to the far-right side of the map
  </strong>
  .

   Capture four zones and defeat Cornerstones of the Witness near the landing zone.

  The objectives speak for themselves. Beat Cornerstone minibosses, gather Light, break statues, then initiate the damage phase. Repeat until the boss is dead. The Witness' defeat will immediately be followed by a cutscene that perfectly closes the Light and Dark saga for good while paving the way for

  While exploring the Citadel in

  In
  <em>
   Mass Effect 3
  </em>
  , the team will change considerably. While players will have some of their old squadmates back, like Garrus and Liara, they won't be able to recruit other familiar faces, such as Jack and Grunt. They can check up on these characters if they made it out of the Suicide Mission alive, but that's about it.

  In the previous game, Jack used to hang around Engineering on the lower level. Now that she's no longer in this area, the Space Hamster made it his home.
  <strong>
   To find the Space Hamster in
   <em>
    Mass Effect 3
   </em>
   , take the elevator to Deck 4: Engineering, enter the corridor that leads to Main Engineering, and go down the stairs
  </strong>
  - the hamster can be found there.

  How to Capture the Space Hamster
 </h2>
 <p>
  The Space Hamster can definitely be hard to capture in
  <em>
   Mass Effect 3
  </em>
  , as it moves quite quickly. The best way is to stand in the middle of the engineering deck, as it gives players time to spot it and analyze its movement before it hides.
 </p>

 <p>
  Gamers need to be able to get close enough to the hamster so that the red lines appear around it. They should press the interact button repeatedly so that when it happens, Shepard will automatically capture it instead of missing their chance.

  Secrets in video games are a lot of fun to uncover, and some gamers especially love the secrets that are meta and directly reference the development process in some form or another. It's easy to see why fans passionate about certain video games would love to find out everything they can about how said titles were made and the faces behind the names that appear in the credits.

 <p>
  The cheekiest and most intriguing way most games go about this is by adding a secret room full of actual developers who worked on the title, which is a fun thing to discover and even more engaging to explore. A lot of titles have experimented with the concept of
  <strong>
   a developer's room
  </strong>
  , and some of these secret rooms have become legendary for all the right reasons.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Talos Principle
   </em>
  </strong>
  came out of nowhere and wowed players with its unique worldbuilding, excellent puzzle design, and a unique philosophical story about what it means to be human. The puzzles do a great job of helping players become familiar with the core concepts of the game before later levels start throwing out tougher brain teasers that are quite satisfying to complete.

  Players who love this title and want to check out all the secrets present in this game may not be aware of the one present in the very first lobby. There's a fake wall here that players can cross to find a portal that leads them to the dev room, with the robots here having their heads replaced by the pictures of the developers. It's a neat addition to the game that many players will love to explore before going back and solving more puzzles.

  Lali-ho! is a term that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  that most fans are pretty familiar with, given that every dwarf in the game's underground section can't get enough of saying this cheerful phrase. In a way, the jovial nature of the dwarves bleeds into each and every facet of the castle they populate, so it's easy to see why one of the most cheerful locations in an otherwise dark and foreboding title houses a secret dev room.

 <p>
  This area can be accessed in a hidden passage to the right of the Lali-ho Pub, where a bunch of sprites act as stand-ins for the developers. One interesting thing to note here is that this room was cut from the original Western release of the game because of an adult magazine that could be found here, which wouldn't have passed Nintendo's strict censorship laws at the time. It was added back in later releases, with the mention of this magazine being whittled down to a naughty innuendo.

  There's no denying that players had their fair share of problems with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deus Ex: Invisible War
   </em>
  </strong>
  that prevented it from reaching the same heights as its predecessor. Despite its attempts to dumb down the wonderfully complex gameplay of the first game, there are still some highlights in
  <em>
   Invisible War
  </em>
  that make it worth checking out for fans of the debut. This includes a developer room that gamers can access by messing around with the flush in Manderley's Office.

 <p>
  Players will be teleported to a party in the game with various NPCs who are meant to serve as stand-ins for the developers, along with various data cubes and flaming penguins to add to this room's odd nature. It's a pretty neat secret to uncover, although players can only leave this room by reloading an earlier save, which can either elicit mild irritation or rampant frustration depending on how frequently players save their game.

   <strong>
    The Stanley Parable
   </strong>
  </em>
  takes on the guise of a walking simulator to let players check out an experimental title where their decisions govern the ending they get. A huge part of what makes this game special is the many endings that players can pursue, which are pretty unique and hilariously narrated to make them even more worth checking out. From fun stories to meta-narratives where the Narrator is replaced in some instances, there's no end to the sheer number of unique scenes present in the game.

 <p>
  One of these endings sends players to a museum where they can witness the development of the game and the many rooms that were added to the experience, making for a rather fascinating look at the thought process that went into creating the title. It's a fascinating ending, and it's sure to impress fans who wish to experience everything
  <em>
   The Stanley Parable
  </em>
  has to offer.

  Being one of the best JRPGs ever made, it's easy to see why so many gamers love
  <strong>
   <em>
    Chrono Trigger
   </em>
  </strong>
  to bits. This JRPG set the bar that future games in the genre strove to reach time and time again, with a time-bending narrative and a unique way to tackle the final boss helping this title stand out from most other games in the genre. Depending on the time in the game when players defeat Lavos, they can unlock a wealth of different endings that make sense with the right context.

 <p>
  One of the toughest endings to achieve in the game is the one where players either fight and beat Lavos at the start of the game (with only Crono and Marle) or try and beat the tougher version of this boss in Ocean Palace. Doing so transports players to the End of Time, with this area being populated with sprites named after the developers. Suffice it to say, players will have a great time checking out the thoughts of the people who worked on this masterpiece as a reward for completing a tough challenge and beating Lavos in the unlikeliest of instances.

  The new 5v5 hero shooter
  <strong>
   <em>
    FragPunk
   </em>
  </strong>
  was announced during Xbox Games Showcase. Gamers eagerly anticipated the June 9 Xbox Games Showcase, although many did not expect to be surprised by the sheer amount of games announced. Plenty of gamers were impressed by the amount of releases that appear to be juggling exciting gameplay, polished visuals, and quickly approaching release dates in addition to this new FPS.

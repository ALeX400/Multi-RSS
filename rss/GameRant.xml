  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset. The week many have been waiting for has arrived as the annual Solstice of Heroes event for 2024 has come to an end and Act 3 of Episode Echoes is now under way.

  While the final chapter will be rolling out over the next three weeks, Act 2 left
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players on a cliffhanger of sorts as the mysterious Conductor was finally revealed in full, leaving many with even more questions.
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Act 3 of Episode Echoes will not only conclude this first post-Final Shape story, but players will have even more content to look forward to, including a new exotic quest, 5 new Hunter's Journal perks to pick from, and new gear to obtain.

  Nintendo released an Indie World Showcase on August 27, with one title presented, a roguelike RPG called
  <em>
   <strong>
    Peglin
   </strong>
  </em>
  , getting a surprise drop the same day. The Nintendo Switch has long been a major platform for indies since the first “Nindies” Showcase back in 2017. Indie games have seen a lot of success in recent years, with games like
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  being some major examples.

 <p>
  During the Indie World Showcase, updates to existing indie titles were also presented. Including a free crossover update to
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  that was released the same day. Other indie games shown off included the reveal of
  <em>
   Coffee Talk: Tokyo
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Moth Kubit
  </em>
  . The indie showcase also showed
  <em>
   Throes of the Watchmaker
  </em>
  , a DLC for
  <em>
   Sea of Stars,
  </em>
  the popular turn-based RPG that was released in August 2023.

  <em>
   Peglin, a
  </em>
  n indie game that was shown off during the showcase, has been released as a timed Nintendo Switch console exclusive.
  <em>
   Peglin
  </em>
  has the gameplay of pachinko but with roguelike RPG elements. It was conceived from a prototype developed during a game jam in 2019, a timed event where game developers create a game from scratch.
  <em>
   Peglin
  </em>
  takes distinctive qualities of a classic physical game, similar to how
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  incorporates elements of poker. This unique blend of genres made
  <em>
   Balatro
  </em>
  one of the highest-rated games of the year.

  <em>
   Peglin
  </em>
  is Red Nexus Games' third title and has been previously available on Steam, iOS, and Android. This is the game's first console release, dropped on the same day as its presentation during the Indie World Showcase.
  <em>
   Peglin
  </em>
  has the player take the role of a goblin seeking revenge on dragons for stealing their treasure. Players will aim orbs and hit pegs to deal damage to enemies in turn-based battles. The more pegs hit, the more damage will be dealt to enemies. Players can choose from a variety of different orbs with their own abilities, some splitting into multiple copies and others piercing both pegs and enemies.

 <p>
  Indie games have seen major success over the past few years, with
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  being one major example of a hit this year. It remains to be seen if
  <em>
   Peglin
  </em>
  can become another trending game in a crowded indie market. Its unique gameplay has a lot going for it, and games that have blended genres in the past have seen success.
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb

  is another example of a hit indie game blending multiple genres, with its roguelike action and village management mechanics.

      <title>Interview: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Devs Talk Making a Game That Honors Its Roots</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  One of the most important parts of developing an adaptation is that its developers are fans of the source material. Thankfully, that is very much the case with MachineGames and its upcoming first-person action-adventure game
  <strong>
   <em>
    Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  fans can likely expect the game to be a love letter to the films.

  Game Rant had the chance to chat with
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  's design director Jens Andersson, as well as its creative director Axel Torvenius following a special presentation of the game at Gamescom 2024. During the interview, Torvenius and Andersson emphasized their appreciation for the
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  IP and how MachineGames poured that respect into the development of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   Torvenuis:
  </strong>
  Well, I was born in 1979, and I was raised in the '80s. I have childhood memories of watching the movies — specifically,
  <em>
   Raiders of the Lost Ark
  </em>
  — with my dad at home making homemade pizza, so being allowed to work on such an IP is surreal and super cool.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Andersson:
  </strong>
  I remember back in Sweden renting the
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  VHS on the weekends, watching it, and being super excited, wondering, "Why isn't every other movie like this?" Looking through all the other action-adventure movies out there, there was nothing like it.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: This is also the very first first-person
   <em>
    Indiana Jones
   </em>
   game, so I was curious if that presents any unique challenge and what advantage that perspective gives?
  </strong>
 </p>

 <p>
  Torvenius: Absolutely. I think there are several different beats to it in terms of both challenges and advantages. We do have a very long history within the walls of MachineGames of doing first-person games. That comes naturally to us, so that's, to some extent, a benefit. We know what we're doing when we do first-person.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1004} -->

 <p>
  Then the challenge here is to counter potential expectations. What would an adventure game be? What, usually, are adventure games? But we've chosen such a different path for this game compared to other things, so it has been unfolding very naturally for it to be in first-person. In this game, you get very up close and personal to a lot of things. You are exploring hidden tunnels, you are solving puzzles, inspecting scriptures, and punching bad guys in the face. It feels very good to be up close and personal. It's a mixed bag when it comes to challenges.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Andersson:
  </strong>
  It's a starting point more than anything else. It's a MachineGames game, so that means a very strong story, cinematics, strong characters, and then applying the
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  feel to it in first-person. What does that mean? How does it feel to crack the whip in first-person? It's a different kind of answer to how it would feel in third-person, and taking that path and going with it is really what the challenge and the opportunity is — it becomes something special, I think.

  <strong>
   Andersson:
  </strong>
  We chose to go with this kind of loop and skill system, if you will, by having these adventure points that we are scattering throughout the game experience to encourage exploration and to encourage you to solve these small mysteries that we are hiding throughout the whole game. Some of them contain an ability that you need to unlock by using Adventure Points, which is something you gather through solving missions and filling out your journal with stuff.

 <p>
  I think in the theater presentation, we showed the True Grit ability, which is one of the abilities we want to highlight because it's so
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  — get a second chance, grab your hat, and stand up. Generally, we have abilities that apply to every system that we have — from stealth, to hand-to-hand, to the whip, to everything. It's about allowing the player to refine their playstyle in fun and interesting ways.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Andersson:
  </strong>
  The game takes place in a lot of different locations, all across the globe. It's a global adventure. We have some areas that are bigger than the others, that are more free-roam, and those are the ones where you can find new disguises. Once you've found a disguise, you can switch freely between the Adventurer's Outfit and, for example, the Clerical Outfit, and it allows you to go out and not be attacked by the enemies that are out there or to be able to access areas that you otherwise couldn't.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1080} -->

  It becomes kind of this choice so that, instead of trying to stealth your way through, you can just walk through. You still need to be a little bit careful though because there are people who can see through your disguise, but it becomes an interesting gameplay option.

  We have two different ways to prompt the player to go on exploration. You can send them off with just the mission update, where you get the quest, and it says "Go find this." But we're also trying to craft an environment that will encourage exploration as players look around while traveling or walking. It should be encouraged, like, "What's behind the next corner? What if I climb that temple? What will I find?"

  There are different components to it, but at the very core is, of course, a narrative that encourages that. When you go off-path trying to find things, you'll earn Adventure Points, or you'll unlock secrets and mysteries along the way. Several different components go into pushing you into exploration.

  It's been a long journey. Even early on in development, we had to define what a puzzle is again. We chose a path — it's a first-person game — what does a first-person game with this kind of physical interaction mean for us? What kind of puzzles did we want to see? And there's a huge variety in there, from brainy, cerebral puzzles to very physical, moving things around, plugging cogwheels and stuff like that. This variety is something positive, it's something that we want.

 <p>
  We don't want to have a puzzle mechanic that would be too static throughout, so every new scenario is a new experience for the player, just like in the movies. Coming into a trap room, you need to look around. "Oh, there's a pressure plate there, I wonder what that does," and then you have a choice of whether to step on it.

  Just trying to come up with as many good ideas as possible and then implementing them and making puzzles is hard. It's new for us as a studio, so it's taking a lot of iterations to really find what that is, especially in the
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  universe and with our gameplay mechanics.

  Also, looking at the existing variety of traps that you would see throughout the movies and then dissecting the key components, iterating upon them, and coming up with new traps that would still have the same flavor without being a ripoff. It's been interesting, for sure.

  There are several reasons for that. One is how the narrative was written, and how it set up the original core narrative — that made it quite obvious that that's where we want to be. All of this came to us through Todd Howard. He had this amazing idea and lifelong dream of making an
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  game — he's a massive
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  fan as well. He pitched the idea to Lucasfilm Games, and they were excited about the opportunity. Then, we were approached and asked if it was something MachineGames was interested in. "Yeah, we are!"

  state. We wanted to be close to that because we feel that's the most fitting for this project in terms of time. The game is set in 1937,

  Absolutely. A lot of research started in the narrative phase — when something is written, we start to try to digest it and explore what it would be like in the 1930s. Then, when we're entering the pre-production phase and the concept art phase, when everything starts to get sketched out, even more research goes in and consulting with external partners as well to make sure it's a good representation — it's a correct representation. It's been extremely important to make sure that we hit that and that it feels respectful to each culture and region.

  It's also this weird mix because you can't make an
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  game or an epic adventure game without made-up fictional stuff as well. Finding that blend, the above version of a temple, above the surface, what does that look like? We can try to research that and find out. But if you're peeking down below, that's where we can go a little bit more crazy and start to come up with more fictional adventures with an
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  influence.

  It's a tone thing, right? That's what makes

  so very interesting. They are very light on supernatural elements, there's very little of that in the game. It alludes to it all the time, but he's a researcher and that's the approach we have to the game as well — find that balance where it feels like, maybe it actually is like that if you peek under the Sphinx, as we saw in the theater presentation.

  I think there is always this interesting synergy that happens when you start to mix things together. If you have something that is perceived as real, you can hit the target to sell that illusion, but when you start mixing that with fictional things, that's where the magic starts to happen. I think we wouldn't be able to get the believability or the contextual purpose of the fictional components perfectly right if we didn't spend a lot of time researching and making sure that the real historically accurate component also feels right — and then those two come together.

  Even when we do this, it's important to us that it makes sense in some way. There's an explanation why there are huge cogwheels in this level. There needs to be a narrative explanation to it. Even if we don't present it to the player, it needs to make sense. Why is this here?

  I think that's so true for so many different types of media rules and games. It doesn't always need to make sense, but it needs to feel like it makes sense. You need to feel that there's a thread that you can follow, even if you don't understand the thread, the process, you still need to feel it, and I think that has also been a driving principle. Does this feel good? Does this feel connected?

   Q:
   <em>
    Indiana Jones
   </em>
   is not a constant combat action game, but there's still a decent amount of combat in it. I was curious what the general philosophy behind combat in
   <em>
    Indiana Jones
   </em>
   was?

  It all comes back to the character. We want to put you in the shoes of Indiana Jones and give you the tools that he has. That means you have your revolver, sure, you can pull it out and shoot someone, but that doesn't happen in the movie. We don't want to reward you for doing that either. It's a choice that we give you. The whip that we give you, on the other hand, we want you to use it as much as possible. You use that as a traversal tool to get around, but you can also use it to disarm people or initiate combat by pulling someone into melee range so you can start punching them.
 </p>

 <p>
  We have this layered action combat sequence. You usually start in stealth, you go through it with a disguise or not, and then when that goes wrong, it escalates to hand-to-hand, melee-style fighting. And here, how does that look in an
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  game? Well, it's semi-chaotic. There are opportunities like a glass bottle you can use to hit enemies in the head, and you get this kind of comedy feel in there as well. If things go awry and people start shooting, sure, at that point you have nothing to lose, you can start shooting back—but that's high stakes and a dangerous route to go.

 <p>
  What's interesting is that we managed to preserve this kind of cycle so you don't go straight to the gun. Even if we give you that choice, it's not the most effective, and it's not the most fun way to play the game. We have this feature where you can pick up a gun and turn it into a melee weapon to smash people over the head because it's not as loud.

  I mean the whip is such an iconic asset to the character, to the IP, and the game wouldn't be what it is if we didn't have a functional, cool, fun whip. A lot of research went into how Indiana Jones uses the whip, what type of actions he performs with it, how it behaves, and what it sounds like. We had this amazing whip master in northern Sweden — an amazing guy. The team went up there and rigged up a whole array of different mics, and we captured him. We also took a lot of footage of him and how the whip behaves.
 </p>

 <p>
  In the end, a lot of effort goes into engineering and programming to make sure the simulation is working, the physics are behaving as they should, the animation components where we need to animate and control the behavior, the look of it, and the sound of it. Then, we have to make sure that we have scenarios set up for you so you feel that you have this dynamic intuitive control of the whip, and you can use it all the time. There are so many different components that go into it.

   Torvenius:

  We have this long history, and I would say it's the DNA and the backbone of the studio where we have the synergy between three very important components. We always push the narrative as hard as we can. We always try to push new unique game mechanics that constantly change throughout the game. Then, we have the visuals, and that's the third part. Binding all of that together, we work with the engineers and the programmers to make sure all of this is confined to this whole triangle.

 <p>
  That has always been true for this project, also. Nothing really differs from previous MachineGames titles when it comes to the quality of those components compared to what we see in
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  . That's what we're passionate about and that is our guiding light, so that's what we are trying to follow.

   <em>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans have been eagerly awaiting the Khaos Reigns expansion, and NetherRealm Studios recently dropped a new trailer that shows off Cyrax’s story arc and gameplay. Players will get to play as Cyrax when the Khaos Reigns expansion comes out on September 24. And it’s not just Cyrax; other popular characters like Sektor, Noob Saibot, T-1000, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian are also joining the roster.

  <em>

  <em>

  </em>
  games. Based on the footage, there are already certain things gamers can expect from Cyrax in

 <p>
  While clearly rooted in the lore that fans have long known and loved, Cyrax’s story has gone through some major changes in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  . In the new trailer, Cyrax has been reimagined as a female member of the Zaki Clan serving under Sektor in the Lin Kuei. This iteration presents a far more humanized Cyrax. Her new armor is a much more simplified design that leans toward samurai aesthetics rather than the heavy robotic look of previous installments.

 <p>
  The trailer also offers a glimpse into Cyrax’s role in the upcoming DLC. It shows that Cyrax will be sent by Sub-Zero to hunt down Scorpion. This puts her through a tough dilemma: to blindly obey her Grandmaster or show mercy. The trailer also hints that at some point in the DLC, Cyrax will clash with Sektor, who is also part of the Lin Kuei clan and helped create Cyrax’s armor. This happens when Sektor suddenly decides Cyrax isn’t worthy of wearing the armor anymore. However, fans will have to play the DLC to find out what causes this shift in their relationship.

  Cyrax’s New Fighting Style Is a Perfect Blend of Cybernetics and Martial Arts
 </h3>
 <p>
  The trailer shows Cyrax fighting Johnny Cage, Scorpion, and Sektor, and it’s evident that her fighting style has also undergone some massive changes. Her gameplay now feels less robotic than in
  <strong>
  </strong>
  previous games and is more focused on acrobatics and martial arts. Developers seem to be mixing her cybernetics with the Lin Kuei’s weaponry and fighting style so that her moves match her story. However, longtime Cyrax fans will be pleased to hear that despite these updates, her signature grenades, maglev boots, and laser nets are all making a comeback. This ensures that the character still feels familiar while simoltaneously offering something fresh.

  The Khaos Reigns trailer closes with Cyrax’s Fatality, and it’s a brutal one. She finishes off Johnny Cage by running up to him and using her Cyber Lin Kuei net to twist his head 180°. Cage’s head is decapitated in the process before Cyrax kicks it away in the air like it’s a soccer ball.

  This is not all, though, as after 29 years,

  Animalities are finally returning. For those unfamiliar with the term, Animalities

  are a variant of Fatalities that first appeared in 1995’s
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 3
  </em>
  . When players reach the "Finish Him/Her" screen, they can use an Animality to transform into an animal and tear their opponent apart in true
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  fashion. The trailer teases Cyrax’s Animality, where she morphs into a hornet and stings Rain. Animalities will be available as a free content update for all
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  owners when Khaos Reigns drops.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  has announced plans to add 13 more Pokemon to the game's ever-growing Pokedex, including the UK regional exclusive Stonjourner.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has already added some Generation 8 Pokemon, with the first batch added all the way back in 2020.

 <p>
  The Galar region has been represented in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  for years, though fans haven't had a lot of Generation 8 Pokemon to catch in the augmented reality mobile game.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  fans have been patiently awaiting the debuts of more Galar region Pokemon, especially its starters, and soon, they will have the chance to add them to their collection.

  When it comes to wild Pokemon spawns,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players can mostly expect to run into Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble. Previously-added Generation 8 Pokemon will also have their spawn rates boosted, with Skwovet and Wooloo also planned to be featured during the event. Shiny variants of Skwovet and Wooloo exist, so
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players will want to keep an eye out for those. Dreepy will also be appearing in the wild, though it will be rarer than the other Generation 8 Pokemon. Generation 8 Pokemon will also be appearing in eggs and Field Research encounters, so players should have plenty of opportunities to better-complete their Galar region Pokedex.

 <p>
  Fresh Special Research is also making its way to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  next week. The new Special Research story will let players choose one of the Galar region starters and complete a variety of quests to receive various rewards. Those interested will need to make sure that they play
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  and start the quest between September 3 at 10:00am local time and December 3 at 9:59am local time.

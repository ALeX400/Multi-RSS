      <title>How Atomfall Differs From Other Post-Apocalyptic Games</title>

  One of the more exciting releases for the first quarter of 2025 is Rebellion's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Atomfall:
   </em>
  </strong>
  an alternate-history action survival game set in the wake of the Windscale incident of 1957, one of history's most devastating nuclear disasters. Historical games are nothing new for Rebellion, who are primarily known for its long-running
  <em>
   Sniper Elite
  </em>
  series, but
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  presented the team with a different challenge. Namely, this was creating a post-apocalyptic game that still maintains the picturesque beauty of northern England (among other things). As a result,
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  is a game that looks a lot different from what most players would expect when they hear that it's set after an apocalyptic incident.

 <p>
  In reality, the Windscale incident occurred in Cumberland (now Cumbria), a predominantly rural area on the northern English coast containing rolling hills, dense forests, rocky cliffs, and plenty of scenic British villages. It's a far cry from the more urbanized and industrial settings that post-apocalyptic games typically take place in, and it also helps to underscore one of
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's other definitive features: a fun take on the culture and history of the United Kingdom. In a Game Rant interview, Rebellion head of design Ben Fisher talked about creating a "post-apocalyptic" game where the setting itself was still beautiful.

  Atomfall's Setting Sets It Apart From Well-Tread Post-Apocalyptic Territory
 </h2>
 <p>
  The closest touchpoint for
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  is arguably Bethesda's
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games, but a side-by-side comparison of the two immediately highlights the biggest difference between them — their settings. While the world of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  is one in which nuclear warfare has decimated the surface of the planet (and left a dystopian pulp sci-fi landscape in its wake),
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's world is one in which the inhabitants of one specific area have been quarantined off from the rest of the world. The Cumbria region of northern England houses plenty of topographical variety, and it remains lush and vibrant even after
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's alternate history outcome of the Windscale incident.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking with Game Rant about
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's core elements and mechanics, Fisher notes that the team "used the real-world location as inspiration for a kind of 'theme park' version of Cumbria that exaggerates the iconic details of rural Northern England", which allowed the team to get creative with its environmental design. Fisher elaborates, noting that "...the post-apocalyptic genre tends to lean into grey, urban areas that have been abandoned. Instead, Atomfall takes us to a rural setting that has largely been untouched and so remains lush and green."

  The Real-World History of the Windscale Fire Grounds Atomfall
 </h3>
 <p>
  In addition to the visual spectacle afforded by
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's atypical setting, the game's grounding in real-world events gives it an unsettling plausibility that many other post-apocalyptic games lack. Many other games set in a fictional post-apocalypse — one caused by nuclear war, robot uprising, or perhaps a zombie plague — lack any sort of real-world historical connection for their settings and plot, instead leaning heavily into popular themes and motifs.
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  treads new territory by telling an alternate history tale that connects real-world events to an alternate timeline in which the afflicted parties were not so fortunate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking about the choice to ground
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  in the history of the United Kingdom, Fisher points out that Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley felt it was a great opportunity for the studio. He notes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Jason...noticed that there are many “nuclear quarantine” games...but none based around the world's first major nuclear disaster, the Windscale incident. Rebellion is usually attracted to broad, pulpy themes with a British slant to them, so it seemed like a starting point with a lot of potential... the Windscale Incident serves as a moment for us to jump away from history and, in a sense, explore a ‘what if’ timeline influenced by ‘50s sci-fi and British folklore.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Instead of imagining a future apocalypse,
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  stands out by imagining the apocalypse that might have been, tapping into the post-war paranoia and uncertainty that were central to British society at the time.

 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, with a

 <p>
  One crucial rule in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
  </em>
  is to keep the character moving, since many Skill Arts only work if used from specific angles. Staying active helps with offense and defense, because certain enemy attacks miss if players shift position or take advantage of flanking opportunities, which also opens new chances to strike.
 </p>
 <p>
  Movement also aids defense, because some attacks miss if a character backs away or adjusts angles. It is vital to stay mobile in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  , since standing still can lead to major damage and wasted opportunities to reposition or dodge incoming hits, especially against tougher foes, where movement can give a clear edge.

  For players struggling with stronger enemies in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   the fight can be eased by targeting the enemy’s appendages
  </strong>
  . This is because many monsters and other aliens encountered in Mira rely on certain body parts to inflict significant damage, so focusing on destroying them from the start can simplify the battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, it is possible to neutralize a Pugilith’s blasts if attacks are concentrated on its cannons, preventing those strikes from continuing throughout the fight. Furthermore, by destroying an appendage, the enemy is staggered for a few seconds, allowing a brief window for additional attacks and resulting in even greater damage.

 <p>
  The Skill Arts in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  have a cooldown before they can be used again, which limits spamming during combat. Although the Nintendo Switch version has added ways to reduce wait times, managing this element is fundamental to mastering combat against the various enemies in this JRPG.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, what is rarely mentioned in the game and might go unnoticed is that
  <strong>
   weapons also have a secondary cooldown
  </strong>
  . This is indicated by the yellow ring that begins to charge around a weapon when a Skill Art is ready for use; once fully charged, damage and other effects are maximized, which can completely change the flow of combat, especially against stronger bosses, even though it may be less critical against easier foes.

  Although the combat in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
  </em>
  may not seem complex at first, as players delve deeper into its mechanics, it becomes clear that a wide variety of combos can be created during attacks. Therefore, selecting which Skill Arts are active is fundamental to maximizing damage and attack efficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, one of the most effective combos for players in the game’s first class, the Drifters,
  <strong>
   is to combine Assault Hammer followed by Flame Grenade
  </strong>
  . The first skill not only causes damage but also inflicts the Topple status, making the second attack more potent if the enemy is affected; studying each Skill Art and combining them is key to maximizing each character’s potential.

  Allies do not always behave as expected in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  , so players can press + to open Battle Commands that direct the group. These orders make party members favor certain attacks, focus on a target, or perform actions at key times,
  <strong>
   which grants extra control and synergy
  </strong>
  , especially during tougher fights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can issue Concentrate Fire to ensure everyone attacks the same enemy, which helps break an appendage fast. Other commands encourage ranged or melee moves, so it is wise to coordinate these tactics for better results in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
  </em>
  , especially when dealing with formidable foes who demand a strong approach.

 <p>
  At the end of Chapter 5 in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  , following some important story revelations, players gain access to a new skill called Overdrive, one of the best ways to boost each character’s damage output. When active, Skill Arts have a shorter recharge time, and various combos can be executed during this period to increase damage or XP gained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, Overdrive is not a skill that benefits the entire group;
  <strong>
   each character must activate it individually
  </strong>
  . To do so, 3,000 TPs must be available and a specific command used; thus, if everyone is to use it simultaneously, the command "let's build tension up" should be employed so that characters avoid expending TPs unnecessarily.

 <p>
  When engaging in a fight against enemies stronger than the party, particularly those with yellow health bars indicating moderate danger,
  <strong>
   it is important for players to face them one-on-one
  </strong>
  . Otherwise, the situation can quickly spiral out of control, forcing confrontation with three or four monsters above the characters’ level, which may render the battle difficult or even impossible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, if an isolated target cannot be found and the objective is grouped with others in the Sci-Fi world of Mira, the best approach is to launch an attack to initiate the fight and then retreat to an open area. This tactic causes the enemy to pull back, making combat easier since only one target is faced without the risk of being surrounded.

  If the party as a whole appears somewhat weak, even when all are at the same level as the map’s enemies,
  <strong>
   it may be because individual Skill Arts have not been upgraded
  </strong>
  . Therefore, it is ideal to make these improvements whenever Battle Points are available, enhancing both the damage each ability can inflict and its additional effects.
 </p>
 <p>
  To upgrade Skill Arts in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  , players can navigate to the party menu and then to Arts. There, selecting the desired upgrade and pressing Y will display a menu showing the changes, which may range from reduced cooldown times to increased duration of each ability during combat.

  Allies sometimes request specific attacks, highlighted on the Arts bar, and performing those moves triggers a small heal plus affinity bonus between characters. These prompts are called Soul Voices, and they are crucial in
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
  </em>
  to maintain health and teamwork, especially during lengthy battles, keeping the party stable and effective.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The protagonist’s Soul Voices are customizable
  </strong>
  , though it is better to wait until the combat system feels comfortable before editing them. Once a play style is clear, adjusting these triggers can complement strategies, like raising melee damage early or boosting ranged attacks for a personal approach, ensuring synergy with chosen tactics.

 <p>
  If, during combat, it becomes clear that victory is unattainable, press B to secure weapons and begin retreating immediately, but do not run in a straight line, as it is best to seek routes that prevent the enemy from following, such as leaping between platforms or entering water.
  <strong>
   This maneuver can save the party from further battles and prevent a respawn far away.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Allies who die during a retreat reappear once the game decides the battle ended. Survival should be the priority, because losing a party member has no real penalty, but a total wipe forces a respawn far from the objective, so running away can save time and frustration.

  Shiny Pokemon are officially coming to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokmeon Trading Card Game Pocket

  </strong>
  through the upcoming release of a new themed booster pack, which is titled Shining Revelry and will be released on March 27. This new set of cards in
  <em>
   Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket
  </em>
  is set to launch alongside some other exciting new features, including Ranked PvP and a new set of special missions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Released at the tail end of October 2024, the mobile phone version of the classic trading card game has kept a relatively regular schedule of releasing a new booster pack almost every month, starting with the Mythical Island expansion back in December. Launched on February 28, the Triumphant Light expansion in

  Announced via the game's official YouTube channel, Shining Revelry will bring shiny Pokemon, color-swapped variations on their normal designs, to the mobile card game for the first time ever. There's no indication yet about how many cards will be included in this expansion, but a few have been revealed ahead of its release. Players can expect to see shiny
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  versions of Charizard EX, Lucario EX, and Pachirisu, as well as newcomers to the card game like Wiglett and Varoom. A Shiny Beedrill is also clearly visible on the pack's exterior digital wrapping, but its card has not yet been shown.

  The hit action-packed horror parkour platformer
  <strong>
   <em>
    Finding Frankie
   </em>
  </strong>
  is finally making the leap from PC to PlayStation and Xbox consoles on April 15, giving more players the chance to try their hand at surviving the challenges and chaos of the twisted title. Previously released as a Steam exclusive,
  <em>
   Finding Frankie
  </em>
  is set to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and interested players can get a closer look at what lies ahead in a brand-new console release trailer.

 <p>
  Similar to games like
  <em>
   Poppy Playtime
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Finding Frankie
  </em>
  may seem to be a brightly colored family-friendly game on the surface, but it holds a much darker and nefarious story riddled with demented enemies. Players are tasked with completing a series of high-octane parkour courses while navigating around the creepy characters that are lying in wait. The horror platformer has been praised by audiences, and console fans will soon be able to join in the terrifying fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase, publisher Perp Games and developer SUPERLOU announced that the critically-acclaimed
  <em>
   Finding Frankie
  </em>
  will be launching for consoles on April 15 and unveiled a new trailer to whet horror fans' appetites ahead of the big multi-platform release. The game begins with players receiving a special invitation in a cereal box that welcomes them to the Parkour Palace to participate in a thrilling game show. Things quickly take a sinister turn when the mascot host Frankie and his minions have their dark intentions revealed. Players must implement stealth and strategy while jumping, climbing, swinging, and sliding past deadly obstacles.
  <em>
   Finding Frankie
  </em>
  includes heart-pounding gameplay mechanics like wall jumping, rail grinding, and trampoline hopping, making it one of the best action-packed horror games with a deceptively cute aesthetic.

 <p>
  New details about Disney and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s previously announced collaboration have been announced, which might include a completely new game mode that could rival
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Disney Infinity
  </em>
  . Many of the game's biggest pop-culture crossovers have been with Disney-owned properties like Marvel and
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  , with the former even having a massive Doctor Doom-centric event last year. Other popular Disney movies featured in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  include
  <em>
   The Incredibles
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  , with many more likely to come in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking of the future, last year Disney and Epic announced that they were forming a new partnership that would lead to the creation of a full-fledged Disney-themed gaming experience in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  to go with any further crossovers. Further details of what this meant followed in late 2024, with Epic Games EVP Saxs Persson describing the future experience as a sort of standalone game mode that could be accessed through
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and allow gamers to interact with the Disney universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Disney/
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  collaboration was brought up once again during a recent Disney shareholder meeting over the conglomerate's future media projects, as reported by ComicBook. Disney CEO Bob Iger shared some of his company’s plans for the impending Epic partnership, including an “entire Entertainment Universe in parallel with
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  .” Users will reportedly be able to play Disney-themed games in this mode, as well as make their own using some kind of content creation suite.

 <p>

  collaboration will be no different. Additionally, players will be able to buy physical Disney merchandise, though it isn’t yet clear what will be available. This will likely include some sort of Disney/

  Fans have already drawn comparisons between Disney’s planned
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  collaboration and
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  , as well as the defunct crossover title
  <em>
   Disney Infinity
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  that featured collectible Disney, Marvel, and
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  toys that players could use in-game. Others have shared their ideas about what this exciting collaboration could entail, like character skins based on properties like
  <em>
   Beauty and the Beast
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  or a way to have a player’s in-game avatar made into a real doll or action figure. Disney and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ’s future collaboration is filled with possibilities, and more insight into those possibilities will likely be revealed the closer it comes to fruition.

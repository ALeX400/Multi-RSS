  While many Xbox games with a single release can be good enough to become an instant classic without needing further entries, some others really benefit from a prequel that explains a franchise's story in greater depth and lets players resonate better with their favorite characters.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the prequel business is either hit or miss, so developers making games set before the original's main events can either be a horrible mistake that players wish they could remove from canon or a welcome addition that complements the universe's story. In any case, it's undeniable that, while there are a few great Xbox exclusive prequels, many more came to the platform that were also shared with other systems, and not including them would be doing them a disservice. Here are the
  <strong>
   best Xbox prequel games

  <em>
   <strong>
    Batman: Arkham Origins
   </strong>
  </em>
  , while part of the Arkham game universe, is set years before
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum.
  </em>
  This game focuses on a much younger Batman, possibly in the earlier years of his career as a nocturnal vigilante. When the infamous kingpin,
  <em>
   Black Mask,
  </em>
  puts a bounty on Batman's head on Christmas Eve, eight vicious contract killers will compete to claim the millionaire prize and crown themselves as Batman's killer.

 <p>
  This title shares a lot of similarities with its sequels, including the beat 'em up combat game mechanics, the boss fights, and entertaining world exploration.
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  also features two neat multiplayer modes that support up to 8 players while online.

  introduces new weapons and allows for armor customization. The game also has realistic survival mechanics, fast-paced territory warfare elements, and an immersive atmosphere that works incredibly well with the overall theme of the game. This title was very famous for being extremely buggy upon release, but luckily, many of them were patched soon after.

  <em>
   Gears of War: Judgment
  </em>
  might not be the most popular entry in the franchise, but it's very fun to play, and getting a peek into the COG's bureaucratic processes is also very enticing.

  This title combines stealth, gadgets, and first-person shooting to deliver an immersive, action-packed experience with fast-paced combat.
  <em>
   Perfect Dark Zero
  </em>
  is set in the year 2020, and since it was developed in the early 2000s, it has a futuristic aesthetic, which, while not being anywhere close to how the world looked in that year, depicts an interesting concept of "what could have been" in a different world.

  The music is also great, as it complements the fast-paced combat and action movements perfectly, adding to the sense of urgency and danger.

  It could be argued that the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise made Xbox what it is today. After all, would the company have grown so much so quickly during the early 2000s without such a massive hit that keeps spawning new releases to this day? Hard to say for sure, but it's rather unlikely. One of the greatest things about the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  universe is how vast it is. With various creatures, planets, and
  <em>
   UNSC
  </em>
  factions, there never seems to be a shortage of possibilities when it comes to developing new games for the franchise, and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Halo Reach
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a great example of this argument.

  When To Use QB Slide In Madden NFL 25

 <p>
  Now that you know how to use the QB slide in
  <em>
   Madden NFL 25
  </em>
  , let’s examine when to use it.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <ul>
  <li>
   The QB Slide will not be
   <strong>
    available if a defender tackles you
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Your quarterback will also need enough space in front of them to execute a QB slide successfully.
  </li>
  <li>
   The best time to execute a QB slide is when no defender is closing in, and you have
   <strong>
    enough space
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The right time to QB slide is when the defender is approximately 5-10 yards away.
  </li>
  <li>
   Apart from knowing how to QB slide, you need to know your quarterback’s speed to determine when it is the right time to slide. Additionally, you should use the QB slide for a first down or to get the yardage you are hoping for.

  Sierra is one of the most powerful antagonists in the game. The battle with Sierra occurs in three stages, but you must locate Sierra before that.
  <strong>
   Assemble a Rocket Radar
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  by
  <strong>
   collecting 6 Mysterious Components
  </strong>
  . You can get the required components by
  <strong>
   defeating several Team GO Rocket grunts
  </strong>
  ; the Rocket Radar can locate Sierra. This guide details the Team GO Rocket leader Sierra’s Shadow Pokemon for September 2024 and the best counters against them.

  You must engage in a
  <strong>
   3 phase battle
  </strong>
  with Sierra, and each phase poses a formidable threat. The
  <strong>
   1st phase is more accessible
  </strong>
  than the latter ones, since Sierra only chooses 1 monster. The
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Team GO Rocket leader is equipped with 3 monsters to choose from in each of the last phases. The
  <strong>
   2nd and 3rd phases are highly unpredictable

  During Sierra's second phase, the Team GO Rocket leader has three options. The opponent might be anyone from Shadow Sableye, Shadow Ampharos, and Shadow Milotic. These diverse
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  types in the roster make the battle extremely challenging, but choosing counters that work well in most situations can lead to victory.

  There are many Local Legends in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Most of them are found in the open world, but some, like in Natlan, are a part of the Night's Trial gameplay. Unlike some open-world bosses with no unique mechanics, all of Night's Trial challenges have a boss with a specific skill set and achievement that revolves around their moves.

  <strong>
   Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone's Night Trial Obsidian Totem in
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  , then they're in for a fight against an enemy that will hover in the air, hanging on an anchor point while shooting you down with a Dendro gun. If you're struggling to defeat this boss or confused about how to get all three

 <p>
  To beat Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , you have to make sure she doesn’t stay grappled to her sigils/anchor point. At the start of combat, Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone will hit you with a few random hits before she summons her sigils and jumps to one of them. When she’s in Hovering State, Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone will deal amplified damage to your characters while taking less damage. By taking down her anchor points, she will fall to the ground and open up a window to deal some great damage to her.

 <p>
  <strong>
   To take down her sigils, you have to bring a Pyro Bow user in
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Once she summons the anchor points, quit attacking her and immediately
  <strong>
   start aiming at her sigils to hit them with Pyro arrows
  </strong>
  . That will start burning them slowly and Cihuacoatl will eventually fall to the ground. You should also bring a good shielder like Zhongli in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  since you’ll be busy aiming at Cihuacoatl’s anchor points for a while and her attacks might be dangerous while she’s in her Hovering State.

     Electro and Hydro are also viable for breaking the anchor points, but Pyro's continuous Burn makes it easier to ensure all three sigils can break. Electro requires half the hit Hydro needs to break each anchor point, but keep in mind that there aren't many Electro characters who can effectively apply Electro, whereas characters like Neuvillette can effortlessly spray Hydro .

 <p>
  There are a total of three Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone achievements in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . As usual with other Night’s Trial bosses, you get the first one and five Primogems by simply beating Cihuacoatl in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The second one is more complicated among the three Cihuacoatl’s achievements as it requires players to
  <strong>
   destroy all of Cihuacoatl’s grappling anchor points (sigils) while she’s in her Hovering State
  </strong>
  . After she summons all her three sigils, Cihuacoatl jumps to one of them and every few seconds she jumps to the next one, until she reaches the third one and comes back to the ground.

 <p>
  So, in total, you have around 15 seconds to destroy all three sigils every time she summons them. Pyro characters in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  have a clear advantage in achieving these achievements as their Pyro attacks will keep burning the anchor points until it’s destroyed, which allows you to focus more on Cihuacoatl.

 <p>
  Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone’s third achievement rewards players with 20 Primogems in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  .
  <strong>
   Players have to beat Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone while she’s grappling on one of her sigils
  </strong>
  . So, once she’s low HP, make sure to wait until she starts grappling and then start attacking her with everyone’s full force.

  After more than 20 years of waiting, players can finally dive into a new game focused on the primary wizarding sport in the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  universe.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Quidditch Champions
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings a modern approach to the sport introduced in the books, with some updated rules to make matches more dynamic and balanced.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , players can take on any position on the field and try to lead their team to victory, either against other players or the AI. However, choosing the best position and understanding its role during a game can be tricky, as they vary in complexity. In the books, most of the spotlight was given to the Seeker position, which Harry Potter filled. In
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , however, fans will need to familiarize themselves with each position if they wish to improve their chance of victory.

 <p>
  This position is one of the easiest to compare with real-life sports, as strikers in soccer or running backs in football are good analogies. In
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   Chasers
  </strong>
  are highly active throughout the match. They are responsible for moving the
  <strong>
   Quaffle
  </strong>
  down the field and scoring points by throwing it through the goal hoops. Each successful goal by the Chasers earns the team 10 points.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":540} -->
 <p>
  Each team has three Chasers, and only they can score with the Quaffle. During PvP matches, all three players need to cover this position, making it more complex and allowing for impressive coordinated plays. In addition to their offensive duties, Chasers can also assist in defense by tackling opposing players to steal the Quaffle and set up counterattacks.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":900} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Another key aspect of the Chasers' role is their coordination with Beaters and Keepers. By working closely with Beaters to neutralize threats and receiving well-timed passes from the Keeper, Chasers can dominate the offensive flow of the game. Their adaptability on both offense and defense makes them indispensable in high-stakes matches, and strong communication between the three Chasers is crucial for their success.

 <p>
  Ron Weasley and Oliver Wood are the most notable examples of Keepers in the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  universe. Similar to
  <strong>
   Chasers
  </strong>
  , this position has clear parallels with real-world sports.
  <strong>
   Keepers
  </strong>
  are the last line of defense, protecting the goal hoops from opposing Chasers' attacks. The role can be considered challenging because there's only one Keeper, and they must defend three goalposts alone, making it easy for opponents to create strategies to deceive them during the game.

 <p>
  However, a well-played Keeper in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  becomes a crucial pillar of any team. Not only do they prevent the opposing team from scoring, but they can also initiate deadly counterattacks with well-placed passes to their team's Chasers. Additionally, in the game, Keepers have a unique mechanic, where they can create rings on the field that boost their teammates' speed, allowing them to chart a faster course to the opponent’s goal.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Keeper
  </strong>
  ’s defensive responsibilities don’t end with blocking shots. In many cases, they have to manage the game's tempo, making quick decisions to assist the Chasers in breaking through the opposing team’s defense. This dual role makes Keepers not only reactive players but also proactive strategists who can tilt the balance of a match.

 <p>
  In the original
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  books and films, the
  <strong>
   Seeker
  </strong>
  position was regarded as the most prestigious, with catching the
  <strong>
   Golden Snitch
  </strong>
  awarding 150 points and ending the match, virtually guaranteeing victory. However, in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , this mechanic has been reworked to create a more balanced and competitive experience. While still a key role, the Seeker has been adjusted to align with the faster pace of multiplayer gameplay.

 <p>
  Instead, capturing the
  <strong>
   Golden Snitch
  </strong>
  now grants 30 points to the team, which is much less than in the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  books. However, given the mechanics of
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , those points are still vital for securing a win and it no longer overshadows the contributions of other players. Instead, Seekers must collaborate with their team, focusing on capturing the Snitch, while players can also contribute to other aspects of the match.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1117} -->

 <p>
  The position has also been adapted to allow every player the chance to experience chasing the Snitch, with the ability to rotate during matches. However, this role comes with its risks, as opposing
  <strong>
   Beaters
  </strong>
  will aim to knock the Seeker off their broom to prevent the capture. Success in this role requires agility, speed, and a strategic understanding of when to pursue the Snitch or assist in other team efforts.

  <strong>
   Beaters
  </strong>
  are among the most entertaining positions in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , especially for players who enjoy disrupting opponents' progress. Their role is primarily defensive, as they summon
  <strong>
   Bludgers
  </strong>
  to hit against opposing Chasers or Seekers, reducing their HP and knocking them off their brooms to prevent offensive plays.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":982} -->

 <p>
  However, Beaters also play a role in offensive strategies, clearing paths for allied Chasers to more easily reach the opponent’s goal. In
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , they are versatile, even capable of defending teammates from opposing Bludgers to keep them from being knocked off their brooms, which could leave their team at a disadvantage.

 <p>
  Each team in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  has one Beater, and players can take control of this position to ensure their team's protection while neutralizing threats from the opposing side. Their role goes beyond just attacking; they need to keep their Chasers and Seekers safe while creating opportunities for well-coordinated offensive plays.

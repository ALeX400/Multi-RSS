  The new Excision activity introduced with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Destiny 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Final Shape expansion represents the game's first ever 12-player activity, but one fan finds themselves putting an end to The Witness all by themselves after a bug prevents their friends from using their super abilities. Fans have encountered a variety of odd bugs throughout many of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's new activities, both in content from The Final Shape as well as the first episode, Echoes.

  Representing the incredible final mission of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Final Shape campaign and the biggest battle of the game's entire decade-long history, Excision sees a total of 12 Guardians teaming up alongside the many allies of humanity to launch a final assault on The Witness after its hold on The Traveler is broken during the new Salvation's Edge raid. The Grandmaster difficulty version of this activity recently became available to players, offering capable players the chance to earn pinnacle rewards, ascendant shards, an Ergo Sum exotic sword, and the Ergo Sum catalyst.

 <p>
  At the end of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Excision mission, all 12 Guardians receive the ability to use a special, one-off super that allows them to blast The Witness into space dust with the Traveler's Light, but one fireteam experiences a strange bug which allows only one player to use this ability. A clip shared online by the user Lightningboltzl demonstrates how their team could only watch as this player was the only one able to end The Witness with this super, and though it did take a lot longer than it usually would, the player was able to completely unmake The Witness and bring the mission to a close all by themselves.

  While they couldn't partake in the final stand themselves, the player's teammates were able to hype them up using the team text chat, labeling them as "the chosen one" due to the comical circumstances. Many other
  <em>

  Fans have discovered quite a few glaring issues affecting
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Excision mission, with bugs resulting in players getting kicked to orbit and experiencing low frame rates, making the activity all the more problematic when played on the Grandmaster difficulty. This is likely due to the abnormally large fireteam size that can deploy to this activity, though the argument of whether future
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  activities should continue to accommodate 12 players even at the cost of performance and stability remains a prominent one among the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  community.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends Z-A
   </strong>
  </em>
  has a lot to live up to in the shadow of
  <em>
   Legends Arceus
  </em>
  , especially when it comes to quests. Looking back at
  <em>
   Legends Arceus
  </em>
  ’ Spiritomb quest might inspire a similar one in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Z-A
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Arceus
  </em>
  , one of the most memorable (and at times frustrating) quests was Eerie Apparitions at Night. Inspired by Spiritomb, the quest saw players scouring the Hisui Region to collect 107 wisps, which create Spiritomb once they are all placed inside the Odd Keystone. The wisps in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Arceus
  </em>
  could be difficult to find, but the search gave players an extra objective and a reason to search the map even more than the main story gave them. With quests like this one,
  <em>
   Legends Z-A
  </em>
  needs to bring spectacular side content as well, and the return of mega evolution might help. If
  <em>
   Legends Z-A
  </em>
  uses the Spiritomb quest as inspiration, it may have the basis of another expansive questline.

  Since
  <em>
   Legends Z-A
  </em>
  takes place just in Lumiose City, its map likely won’t be as large as
  <em>
   Legends Arceus
  </em>
  ’, but players will still need reasons to explore every inch of it. Side quests are an important part of games like the
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  series because they expand the world and the story, and encourage players to seek out areas they might miss otherwise. With the reconstruction and expansion of the city at the core of
  <em>
   Legends Z-A
  </em>
  ’s story, those goals might be a good excuse to implement fetch quests. The completion of this game’s version of the Pokedex will also probably play an important role.

 <h3 id="a-clear-successor-to-eerie-apparitions-at-night">
  A Clear Successor to Eerie Apparitions at Night
 </h3>
 <p>
  The importance of good side quests means that
  <em>
   Legends Z-A
  </em>
  might want to borrow some successful strategies from
  <em>
   Legends Arceus
  </em>
  . Eerie Apparitions at Night is a very time-intensive inclusion, and is one of several scavenger hunt type quests in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Arceus
  </em>
  , so it would be a good basis for a similar quest in the game's successor. Sending the player out to locate mass quantities of a certain material or phenomenon enforces the exploration basis the
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  series has adopted and could lead to players discovering more of the new Lumiose City as they search.
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Z-A
  </em>
  even has the perfect collectible staring it in the face.

 <p>
  With the return of the Kalos region comes the return of Mega Evolution, something fans have spent years asking for, and it will probably take on an important role in the narrative of the game. In the other
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, Mega Evolution can only be used when the player and their Pokemon are holding the appropriate Mega Stone. In
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  , some of these stones are gifted to the player during the story, but others are only obtainable in a post-game quest. As part of the quest, stones will appear at certain parts of the map at certain times of day, which mirrors the wisps in
  <em>
   Legends Arceus
  </em>
  being easier to find at night. Though it may be a coincidence, this gives Game Freak the perfect blueprint for a successor to the Spiritomb quest.

 <p>
  If players want to discover new and fan favorite Pokemon Mega Evolutions, they might have to earn them in this quest. By searching for each Mega Stone, or maybe shards of Mega Stones that must be pieced back together, exploration will feel more natural. The task might seem tedious at times, like the Spiritomb quest, but the rewards would be even greater, powering up players' favorite Pokemon for stronger battles. No one can be certain what lies ahead in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Legends Z-A
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but it's a safe bet that this type of quest might be in store.

  Xur has returned again to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , complete with new exotic and legendary gear for players to check out for a limited time. With the weekend merchant arriving once more, exotics have recently been a hot topic with the community as Bungie announced plans to nerf three very popular options. Khvostov and Red Death are seeing tweaks to their stability and recoil patterns, with the former also seeing its Ricochet Shots being altered as well, though many of these alterations are only impacting the PvP side of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Speaker's Sight, a Warlock exotic helm intended to look like the former NPC of the Tower, has also been overperforming thanks to its ability to rapidly generate orbs. Given its status as a great support exotic, Bungie is suspending its ability to generate a orbs while in Crucible matches as Bungie felt the exotic was able to produce a substantial amount that would ultimately undermine the long-term health of PvP. While the PvE side of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  is unaffected, Bungie will be revisiting the exotic down the road for a better long-term solution.

  Xur's role continues to offer the usual weekly quests, exotics, and legendary gear. Not only are these quests required to purchase a second fated engram, but they're necessary to acquire legacy exotic gear from the Tower kiosk. Players can earn a new cipher by completing strikes and winning crucible or gambit matches. Gain bonus points for playing with clan mates or finishing more challenging activities.

  Another solid exotic, that, at one point, was the go-to armor for Voidwalkers due to how strong it was. While the Skull is nowhere near that level these days, it will help Warlocks get their supers back faster, though it likely isn't at the top of the meta anymore.

  Once you make it to the West Rampart Site of Lost Grace, you’ll find a tiny door next to the huge gate in front of you. Open that door to find a bridge filled with enemies behind it. Defeat them and proceed forward until you reach the second elevator that takes you out of the Shadow Keep into the Ancient Ruins of Rauh in
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree

  After you’re out of the second gate, keep moving southwest to find the third gate behind a large pillar in the middle of the chamber. Go through and move forward to descend through the gap in front of you with the help of the Spiritspring. Once you make it down, keep taking your left, riding your Torrent under multiple bridges. Eventually, you’ll find the Rauh Ancient Ruins, East Site of Lost Grace.

  From there, jump to the bridge next to you and move to the southwest, following the bridge’s road. Be careful as a Furnace Golem will wake up once you touch that bridge and start shooting fire at you. Reach the end of the bridge and jump to the right onto another bridge that leads to the Furnace Golem’s area. Once you’re there, keep heading south without taking any side to finally reach another Site of Lost Grace.

  The final area before reaching Romina, Saint of the Bud, is a little tricky since it also has a few mazes and enemies protecting their corridors. First, take the southeastern stairs and turn right once you’re on top. Inside that chamber, take your left and follow that corridor to find an elevator at its end.

 <p>
  Romina, Saint of the Bud is a necessary boss to beat to progress in the main story of the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC. Their main strength is their ability to apply Rot with all their attacks, especially when they catch you with one of their tails. They’re also very mobile and make the most of their arena by moving to a different location with each one of their attacks, which makes landing hits on them a hard task for melee players.

 <p>
  Unlike most of the DLC bosses,
  <strong>
   it’s not recommended to use shields against Romina
  </strong>
  since they apply Rot and aren’t very aggressive. Romina's pattern is consistent and normal, while their hits are hurtful if they land.

 <p>
  The boss is
  <strong>
   weak against Frost and Bleed
  </strong>
  , so go in there with your Mimic Tear and one of those two builds to deal more damage against them.
  <strong>
   The boss is also weak against heavy attacks and their stance will break every three to four heavies
  </strong>
  . For that,
  <strong>
   it’s better to be aggressive
  </strong>
  against Romina and read their pattern to dodge their attacks with ease.

 <p>
  During the second phase, most of Romina’s moveset will start spreading Rot butterflies, which will build up the Rot meter faster. You can keep going after the Saint of the Bud since Rot will slowly reduce your HP or use some of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ’s items and Spells that can cure Rot.

  A community manager for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Days Gone
   </em>
  </strong>
  developer Bend Studio apologized to fans who were disappointed to learn the company was not working on a sequel to its 2019 action-adventure zombie game. Some players were unhappy when it was revealed Bend Studio's pitched sequel for
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  was rejected by Sony back in 2021 due to the first game's lengthy development time and lukewarm critical reception. However, many fans still held out hope that a sequel might be possible in the future, leading them to preemptively celebrate when false claims of a new entry into the franchise spread all over several social media sites.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  fan base has recently been abuzz with excitement after a known leaker shared a rumor claiming Bend Studio was in the process of developing a continuation of its post-apocalyptic zombie game for the PlayStation 5. However, other insiders have continuously expressed skepticism about the claim. Many fans were also doubtful considering the developers previously announced they were already busy with the production of another separate project, which will reportedly be Bend Studio's take on a unique live-service IP.

 <p>
  Now, Bend Studio community manager Kevin McAllister has all but confirmed that rumors of an upcoming
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  sequel were outright wrong. In a post to Twitter, McAllister apologized to the members of the
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  player base who were deceived by "people looking after likes," with the community manager acknowledging they were unfairly targeted. He concluded his message by assuring fans that Bend Studio was hard at work on its upcoming title, promising to keep everyone updated on the ongoing development of current and future projects.

 <p>
  Though a
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  sequel isn't on Bend Studio's agenda for the foreseeable future, that's not to say fans of the studio have nothing to look forward to. Its upcoming video game might be its biggest undertaking to date, with reports claiming Sony invested $250 million in Bend Studio's newest project. While nothing has been outright confirmed, Sony has notably been trying to gain traction on the live-service market in recent years, and the overwhelming success of Arrowhead Game Studios'
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  might have convinced it to invest in similar live-service titles.

  However, it remains to be seen if its bet will pay off, as many of the details surrounding the project remain a mystery. Despite the lack of news regarding development, Bend Studio teased that production was proceeding smoothly, and McAllister also previously claimed the next game from the

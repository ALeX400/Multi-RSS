  <em>
   Warhammer's
  </em>
  grim dark universe has exploded onto current generation consoles and blown away the critics as one of the most complete games of the year. The

  k universe is a vast sea with a mix of militarism, cosmic horror, and intergalactic empires.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings the enormous universe and wraps it up in a perfectly crafted narrative third-person shooter experience.

  From story to combat,
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2
  </em>
  is a ten out of ten for all two million players that have purchased the game. While players are still undoubtedly knee-deep in the game's multiplayer and story missions, once that has been completed, there are other titles for players to fall back on while seeking a similar experience. Here are some of the best games to play if you enjoyed

  The most recent installment in the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  series is a top-down grand strategy game that allows players to choose from all the factions in the
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  universe and control entire armies in a
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  -esque battle of the ages. Players can choose to take up arms for the emperor or give in to the chaotic temptation of the warp.
  <em>
   Total War: Warhammer 3
  </em>
  has an enormous amount of content, and if a new experience in the same universe is appealing, it makes a great game to pick up after

  , Saber Interactive, may sound familiar as they are known for the successful horde game
  <em>
   World War Z

  <em>
   Evil West
  </em>
  is a game that went under the radar for many gamers earlier this year, but to the surprise of many, it is an incredibly fun-to-play hack-n-slash third-person shooter. Set in a gritty Western dystopian future, a lone vampire hunter sets out to destroy all the vampires and prevent a war against humanity.

  Players jump right into fast-paced combat and bloody executions that make the game feel like an endless hunt. The game feels like a current-generation successor to
  <em>

  <em>

  is an obvious choice if players are still craving gory, fast-paced action filled with bullets and mayhem. The second installment in the franchise,
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  2 is highly considered the best installment because of the highly requested additions made to the game. Players once again dive knee-deep into the blood and guts as the Locust return after seemingly being defeated in the first game.

  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  was a game that was released some time ago and brought heavy third-person shooter combat to the PS4 and PS5 from the developers that brought you
  <em>
   Gears of War: Judgment
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  has heavy influences from the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  franchise, including cover-based shooting, rolling mechanics, and gunplay.

 <p>
  People Can Fly games expanded on the systems created by incorporating supernatural beings with world-ending powers and wrapped them in a nice bow of hyper-violent combat where killing targets is the only way to survive. The endless waves of enemies will be a good time for players to take a break fro
  <em>

  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  is a spectacular multiplayer game that is set in the dire universe of the Alien franchise, where Xenomorphs are the main threat to a small squad of mercs who seek to push back the waves of enemies and live to see another day.

 <p>
  Players can choose from several classes to drop into multiple mission types and take on tyranid-like extraterrestrials who only have one thing on their mind: kill. With a moderate variety of weaponry and utility,
  <em>
   Aliens: Fireteam Elite
  </em>
  goes the extra mile in providing fun and freedom in how players tackle the game. The sheer number of enemies that pile on is almost a mirror image of the Tyranid hordes that swarm the players in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Army of Two

  is a beloved franchise with a dedicated fanbase that cherishes the multiple games in the franchise. The story follows a rag-tag team of mercenaries trapped in a lawless country who must make it out alive, complete their mission, and try to watch each other back.
  <em>
   Army of Two
  </em>
  provides a multiplayer campaign where one to two players mow down waves of enemies with unique load-outs and extensive weaponry.

  While the science fiction element is lacking, players will still enjoy the cover-to-cover movement like

  The most prominent selling point of the
  <strong>
   Steam Deck
  </strong>
  is that users can take it anywhere and play a vast library of verified games on a handheld. It is a clever device that can be used as a desktop with the right tools and applications, too, making it an incredibly versatile machine.

 <p>
  The Steam Deck can even run some demanding Triple-A games without issues. On top of that, the Steam Deck's portability goes even further than its handheld mode. Users can play it remotely on a PC screen, giving the machine more usability when it comes to compatibility.

    Updated on September 18, 2024, by Michael Llewellyn:
   </strong>
   Remote play requires a solid interconnection whether you're streaming to your PC or using the Steam Deck as a device for streaming services. As such, this guide has been updated to include the steps for installing Decky Loader and the NonSteamLanuncher plugin, allowing you to use your Steam Deck to play games from services like EA Play, PS Plus, Xbox Cloud, and more. Moreover, the Developer Mode settings will help improve your Wi-Fi connection.

  Playing Steam Deck remotely is a practical feature for those who don't always want to play their games in handheld mode. However, some limitations apply to playing remotely, and
  <strong>
   getting it to work will depend on how capable a player's PC or laptop is
  </strong>
  at running games and how good their Wi-Fi connection is at the time.

      <title>8 Enemies Space Marine 2 Should Add To PvE In The Future</title>

  For many
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40,000
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Space Marine 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the video game they have long been waiting for. Its cinematic visuals, themes of brotherhood and honor, and stunning, action-packed gameplay have made it an instant hit with Warhammer veterans and newcomers alike. Its short campaign features two major
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  factions as its antagonists: the swarming Tyranids, determined to consume all biological life, and the corrupted Thousand Sons, the mystical followers of the chaos god Tzeentch.

 <p>
  Along with the campaign, the game features several PvE missions called Operations, where players can team up with friends and take on hordes of enemies and powerful bosses. This game mode offers a lot of potential for additional content, with the developers already teasing that new enemies will be added in future updates. From colossal monsters to hordes of rampaging daemons, both factions hold a lot of potential for new and exciting enemy encounters.

  This Tyranid bioform is designed primarily to consume psychic lifeforms but is more than happy to eat anything in its path. With its huge open maw, grabbing tentacles, and terrifying spider-like design, this fast-moving enemy would make an ideal boss encounter for players to fight.

 <p>
  Once a psyker has been consumed by the Psychophage, it turns this energy into a toxic ash cloud that spews from its back. In-game, this would become a challenging mechanic, where players must avoid both its ash attack and its grabbing mouth, which could pin players to the ground. The Psychophage is a unique and creepy-looking monster that would be a welcome addition to
  <em>
   Space Marine 2’
  </em>
  s roster of grotesque enemies.

  The powerful Screamer-Killer has been an icon of the Tyranid faction as far back as the 1st edition of
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  . It attacks with its four deadly scythe-like arms that can rip apart its enemies. It also shoots bio-plasma from its mouth in a deafening high-pitched shriek.

 <p>
  Standing high on two legs, the Screamer Killer is an alternate version of the Carnifex and would make an imposing boss in a PvE mission. With powerful melee attacks and precise ranged attacks, this enemy could be one of the most challenging bioforms in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  .

  The Norn Emissaries are gigantic Tyranid bioforms created for a singular purpose. This can be killing important and powerful commanders or abducting enemies with key information. These enemies are spawned directly by the Norn Queen and are even larger than the terrifying Hive Tyrants.

  Adding a Norn Emissary to
  <em>
   Space Marine 2's
  </em>
  PvE would bring both challenge and spectacle to the game. They are immense enemies that would pose a significant challenge for players due to their large size, incredible power, and savage intelligence.

  Long before a Tyranid invasion has arrived, a planet will often already be infected with deadly xenos. Genestealers are the powerful, agile vanguard of a Tyranid invasion. They spread their insidious genetic code throughout populations, readying them for the inevitable end.

  Once the Hive Fleet has arrived, Genestealers become some of the most deadly creatures on the planet. With tough armored bodies and sharp claws, they can tear enemies apart with frightening speed and strength. Genestealers are iconic to the setting and would be a welcome addition to

  The Blue and Pink Horrors are common Tzeentch Daemons that can attack in large numbers. Some players will also know these enemies from the recent
  <em>
   Boltgun
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rogue Trader
  </em>
  games. Killing the initial Pink Horror will spawn Blue Horrors in its place, making these dangerous enemies that can quickly grow in number. Each Horror attacks with warp powers and slashing claws.

 <p>
  Including these enemies in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  would add another fun horde enemy to the game. While these enemies would be easily dispatched with a chainsword or bolter, their relentless attacks could quickly overwhelm players if they are not careful.

  The Mutalith Vortex Beast is the terrifying creation of the chaos god Tzeentch. These colossal monsters storm into battle, tearing their victims apart with frightening strength. Their very presence instills fear and madness in mortal minds as they suck in the destructive power of the warp, mutating their helpless foes into new creations for the changer of ways, Tzeentch.

  While the Tyranid faction has many varied monsters rampaging through

 <p>
  Ubisoft is pushing back against claims that its newest multiplayer FPS
  <strong>
   <em>
    XDefiant
   </em>
  </strong>
  isn't doing well.
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  recently revealed its second season, which is set to go live next week and will bring an all-new faction, the Highwaymen from
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  's standalone sequel
  <em>
   Far Cry New Dawn. Season 2
  </em>
  will also introduce the new Search and Destroy-like Bomb mode, as well as new maps and weapons.

 <p>
  Last month, an insider claimed that
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  may be in trouble. Due to diminishing player counts and player spending since its impressive launch in May 2024, the report suggested that Ubisoft was planning to give the
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  team until Season 3 to turn things around or risk support being pulled from the game. Between layoffs that impacted Ubisoft San Francisco earlier in the year and the release of competitor
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  next month, pressure seems to be mounting for
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  as it heads into its second season.

 <p>
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's situation may not that dire, as Ubisoft assures fans that the game is still in solid shape. In a new blog post laying out
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's Year 1 roadmap, the game's executive producer, Mark Rubin, pushed back on the idea that the game is struggling. "Is the game dying? No, the game is absolutely not dying. We know there are things we need to improve like Netcode/Hitreg and adding more content to progression, but the game is doing well," he wrote. Rubin went more into detail on the improvements Ubisoft San Francisco is planning to bring to
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  , namely the game's netcode and hit registration, which have a direct impact on the feel of the game.

 <p>
  Because
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  is only available on PC via the Ubisoft store and not on Steam, there's no way for people to know how many concurrent players
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  has, making it more difficult to gauge how well the game is really doing. With that said, last month's insider report mentioned that
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  is hovering around 20,000 concurrent players across all platforms, but if that number has changed is something only known only by Ubisoft. The game's unavailability on Steam may be directly contributing to the game's alleged player count woes. As for the netcode improvements mentioned by Rubin, the Year 1 roadmap doesn't indicate when players can expect the fix, leading some to believe it will be quietly updated whenever it's ready.

  Season 2 of
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  is ready to go live on September 24. With it, fans can expect to enjoy faster battle pass progression and improvements to mantling, footsteps, and player collision among other quality-of-life changes. Hopefully, the arrival of

  </em>
  s Highwaymen as part of Season 2 will give

     <li>
      The Minecraft franchise is continuing to expand, with its live action movie recently unveiled via a trailer.
     </li>
     <li>
      Initial feedback on A Minecraft Movie's trailer is divisive, but even with a substantial number of complaints, a crossover DLC within the game is likely.
     </li>
     <li>
      Such a collaboration is a golden marketing opportunity, so it would be surprising if some kind of content based on the film was not added.

  As the highest-selling game of all time,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  and its blend of survival and sandbox gameplay has resonated with millions of players. This popularity has naturally brought a lot of opportunities for
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  to expand. From a toy line to LEGO sets, the franchise has become one of the biggest names in the industry. Not only that, but it has paved the way for
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  to feature its fair share of crossovers.

  There have been a variety of franchises that have gotten the
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  treatment. From the incredibly fun
  <em>
   Spongebob
  </em>
  pack to
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  , the game has had its fair share of exciting extra content. Now, the
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  franchise is getting one of its biggest expansions yet, but not in the game. The first trailer for
  <em>
   A Minecraft Movie
  </em>
  was recently revealed, and initial feedback has been rather divisive. Whether one is a fan of the upcoming movie or not, one thing is nearly for certain.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  will likely do an in-game crossover with its own movie.

  Capitalizing On the Movie's Impending Release as Much as Possible
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are still a few months away until the
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  movie hits theaters. While the movie's April 2025 premiere is off in the distance, that leaves room for plenty of discourse about the subject. As of now, feedback is incredibly mixed. While some say the movie looks like a fun attempt at making
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  live action, others have criticized the CGI for looking unfinished. Many have even questioned why
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  is being made into a live action movie instead of animated in the first place.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  could have followed in
  <em>
   The Lego Movie
  </em>
  's footsteps, but it's clear that another path was chosen.

  Regardless of one's views on how
  <em>
   A Minecraft Movie
  </em>
  looks, it would be incredibly surprising if the film's characters didn't get featured in the game sometime shortly before or after its premiere. Whether it's a skin that gives characters Jason Momoa's disturbing wig or a mod that turns mobs into the ultra-3D versions showcased in the trailer, it feels inevitable.

  Since
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  is one of the biggest franchises in gaming, it only makes sense for its movie to be brought into the game. As the premiere draws closer, there is bound to be a variety of ways the game will promote the film. It could also present the opportunity to get more players on board if they are able to get better glimpses of the movie ahead of its release. There will likely be another trailer before April 4, but getting to actually better understand the characters through in-game crossovers could raise interest in a more effective way.

 <p>
  As of now, player reception of the first trailer for
  <em>
   A Minecraft Movie
  </em>
  isn't stellar. The state of live action video game adaptations is in an interesting spot at the moment. There has been a major surge in games being adapted into live action counterparts. While this has worked well for
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , other franchises, like
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  , haven't struck the same chord with audiences. Now, all eyes are on
  <em>
   A Minecraft Movie
  </em>
  . In the upcoming months leading up to April 4, the franchise will likely be doing a lot of groundwork to change fan feedback.

      Players can have a unique connection with video game protagonists, sometimes getting the chance to fight against them in rare instances.
     </li>
     <li>
      In games like Fire Emblem and Pokemon, players face off against main protagonists like Ike and Red, providing a challenging and unique gameplay experience.
     </li>
     <li>
      Phoenix Wright and Asura's Wrath showcase how even main characters can face off against the player, adding layers of complexity to the storyline.

 <p>
  The main protagonist of any video game can connect with the player on a deeper level than most other mediums. This is because they are usually in the control of the player in a way most other characters are not, depending on the genre. Because of this, it's a somewhat rare opportunity in a game when the player gets a chance to fight against the main protagonist.

 <p>
  However, this opportunity is common enough, even in games where the player character is the one most commonly controlled, that sometimes that control is ripped away from the player. Here are some games where you can face off with the main protagonist.

  <em>
   Radiant Dawn
  </em>
  is a sequel to
  <em>
   Path of Radiance
  </em>
  , which starred Ike and tells the tale of him and his mercenary group taking on Daein to save Crimea.
  <em>
   Radiant Dawn
  </em>
  looks at the resulting consequences of this war from multiple perspectives, shifting focus from the Daein liberation group; the Dawn Brigade, the Crimean Royal Knights, and Ike's own mercenary group; the Greil Mercenaries. Despite his status as protagonist being disputable, with Micaiah serving as the lead for large parts of the game, the Greil Mercenaries are the playable faction for most of Part 3.

 <p>
  Ultimately, due to the Dawn Brigade having conflicting goals, the Greil Mercenaries serve as the antagonists of Chapter 3-13, with Ike being the boss. Defeating Ike is a possible way to clear the chapter, but due to how powerful he is, holding the defense line for 12 turns may be the more appealing option. In the following chapter, the player takes control of the Greil Mercenaries once more, with Micaiah serving as the chapter's boss, yet the nature of this chapter makes her impossible to fight.

 <p>
  After these two chapters, the goals of the various groups coalesce, and they pool their units together into three separate, but directly affiliated armies. They further combine into a broader force during the final part's endgame, where any unit is a choice to be deployed.

  This boss battle has the odd distinction of serving purely narrative purposes rather than being a genuinely challenging fight. Lex, the titular bookworm, learns about rifts occurring in the library. He is assaulted by a worm that looks identical to him and steals the fabled Magic Pen. The worm is only differentiated by a futuristic propeller helmet. This worm is dubbed "Evilex" and is teased as a future antagonist. Once Lex ends up traveling to the future, he obtains an identical helmet which functions as a time machine, and decides to travel back in time to face his purported rival.

 <p>
  He makes his way through the library, taking on Anna Karenina, Cyrano de Bergerac, Odysseus, and Moby Dick before facing the heavily-teased opponent. Unfortunately, there is no Evilex to be found, only a significantly weaker helmet-less Lex who can be taken down in one hit (I.E.: the previous Lex whose POV "Evilex" was identified from.) While most boss fights where the player deals with the protagonist are treated with some level of difficulty, this one is perhaps the easiest one ever made. This reinforces the sense of humor the
  <em>
   Bookworm Adventures
  </em>
  series has and is done to directly match the previous segment, where Lex was in fact beaten down with one hit.

  Red is the original main character of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series, an avatar designed to embody the assumed male player (Leaf, the female counterpart, did not debut until the remake). However, as with most variable self-inserts, the common trade-off was an immensely limited personality, usually determined by the player's choices more than any narrative. Canonically, Red beat his rival, Blue, and effectively took his spot as champion.

  <em>
   Gold
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Silver
  </em>
  made the interesting choice of making a 14-year-old Red the final boss of the game. Here he is just as talkative as he is when controlled by the player. This gives him a somewhat foreboding feel when disconnected from the context of him as the player's avatar. Here, he has a team consisting of the Kanto starters, Pikachu, Snorlax, and Espeon. He also appears in the remake, swapping out his Espeon for a Lapras.

  Red has since made sporadic appearances in the series, playing the role of a respected veteran trainer various players can face, or in rare instances battle alongside. His team occasionally changes, but he typically uses all three of the Kanto starters, as well as an un-evolved Pikachu, who also serves as a starter in
  <em>
   Pokemon Yellow
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Phoenix Wright is the main character of the
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  series. His characterization is limited in such a way that gives him a greater connection to the average player, which is further cemented by his everyman appeal. However, there are some limitations to the efficacy this has, especially in later installments.

 <p>
  The primary issue is that the continual lore-building of the game confirms that Phoenix Wright is probably one of the best defense attorneys in-universe. The evidence for this claim is founded on the fact that he has consistently solved seemingly hopeless cases across the previous installments. It gets to the point where Phoenix's protégé, Apollo Justice, was a huge fan of his before getting to work under him.

 <p>
  <em>
   Spirit of Justice
  </em>
  splits the role of protagonist between the two defense attorneys. In the first half of the final chapter, Phoenix is forced to operate as the plaintiff attorney for the cowardly Paul Atishon. Here, Wright faces off against Apollo Justice in a rare civil trial, where the pair determine the ownership of the Founder's Orb, a relic from Khura'In said to grant vast spiritual power.

 <p>
  Although canonically Justice does win out in the end, Wright is no slouch. To make matters worse, his iconic "Objection!" theme, usually a sign of relief in most cases, still plays for him when he finds contradictions as the plaintiff's attorney.
  <em>
   Spirit of Justice
  </em>
  is largely about Apollo stepping out from under his mentor's shadow, and this being one of the game's final trials helps add to that story.

  This cinematic beat-em-up,
  <em>
   Asura's Wrath
  </em>
  , stars a demigod looking for revenge. Asura was betrayed by his comrades, the Seven Deities, and killed, as they planned to make use of his daughter Mithra as a slave, murder his wife Durga, and frame him for the crime. He returns to the world of the living, and indeed, his wrath is what saves his life at times when it is in jeopardy.

 <p>
  However, even when it's righteous indignation, excessive anger is never a good thing. There comes a point in the game where Asura gets so angry, that even the player can't control him. Asura's lifelong rival and Durga's brother, Yasha grows disgusted with the actions of the Deities and decides to betray them. An initial act of defiance is fighting Asura, not to kill him, but to save him. From here, Yasha serves as more of a supporting character than a villain, although the focus largely shifts back to the titular Asura.

      <title>Honkai: Star Rail - Best Limited Light Cones For F2P Players</title>

   <strong>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Gacha system meets expectations in terms of how generous it is and how much it tries to limit the predatory aspect of Gacha systems. However, even with that generosity, F2P (free-to-play) players still have to carefully decide which banners to pull on if they want to make the best out of what they're given to optimize their teams. On average,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  gives out enough in-game currency to pull for at least one 5-star character (90 pulls) per patch. This doesn't guarantee players will get what they want though, as there is a 50/50 system involved.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":594} -->

 <p>
  The 50/50 system means that players will have a
  <strong>
   50% chance of getting the character or Light Cone on the limited banner, and a 50% chance to get one on the standard banner
  </strong>
  when pulling a 5-star. If they pull a standard banner character or Light Cone, then the next 5-star is guaranteed to be the banner-limited character or Light Cone. With this, on top of each patch introducing two new characters and Light Cones (and rerun banners of two characters and Light Cones), F2P players tend to stick to pulling for new characters in order to open up new teams and playstyles.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   limited Light Cones generally aren't worth pulling for, but some of them do provide value to F2P players.
  </strong>
  They can perform at least decently if equipped by several characters. This means that they're not only useful on the character they're meant for, but also ones that players might already own.

 <p>
  This Light Cone can benefit new players, but is situational and hardly worth it. This is a great option for Fu Xuan as it increases her HP, offering more survivability as well as more healing. The energy regeneration helps keep her passive up, and the bonus of buffing allies' damage is always a welcome addition to any sustain and support Light Cones. Healing allies at the beginning of every wave might sound nice on paper, but is more of a convenience than a necessity. It would go unnoticed if it wasn't present.

 <p>
  However, that particular aspect of this Light Cone gives it some viability to be used on anyone else. In the early game, players likely have a limited number of sustain units, which makes it difficult to get through content such as Pure Fiction and Memory Of Chaos. Consider putting this Light Cone on the two free Preservation units obtained early on, March 7th and Preservation Trailblazer. It will not only give those characters more HP to soak up more damage, but also
  <strong>
   more comfortably sustain the team through multiple waves of enemies
  </strong>
  that they otherwise would struggle with if run as a solo sustain. Still, most players would just wait until they were ready for endgame content, making this Light Cone
  <strong>
   extremely situational.
  </strong>

 <p>
  This Light Cone works well on characters with HP-based mechanics or those that want to be attacked often. On Blade, increasing his Max HP means increasing the amount of damage he does. At the moment, he's the only one who can take advantage of this aspect of the Light Cone. With every other character, it only increases their survivability. Extra CRIT stats and an increase in DMG opens up to the possibility of using this Light Cone with other characters. The catch is that part of it only activates upon losing HP, and counter DPS units can take advantage of this.

 <p>
  HP scaling DPS units and HP mechanics are largely unexplored, making this quite a niche Light cone. However, while it is good on just a few characters at the moment, the
  <strong>
   criteria to obtain its buffs are perfect, since it's something any DPS with HP mechanics could easily do.
  </strong>
  Of course, only time will tell when the game will continue exploring that mechanic. If players like Blade, pulling this Light Cone will benefit him and a few others. Otherwise it's
  <strong>
   best to wait until more characters with HP mechanics are introduced.

  As the only Abundance Light Cone on this list, not only does this one provide energy regeneration which heavily benefits abundance units, but it also provides extra healing while buffing ATK. It's a great Light Cone, considering it
  <strong>
   can be used by every Abundance unit
  </strong>
  and is the best in slot for most of them as of version 2.4.

 <p>
  Is this Light Cone a necessity? Absolutely not. While the extra healing and energy regeneration are nice to have, they're not needed if players build their abundance units well. The ATK buff does bump it up compared to other Abundance Light Cones, but it only stacks up to a 12% increase at S1. Pulling it could mean players won't have to worry about which Light Cone to use, which might be the best part about owning it.

  Brighter Than The Sun is great
  <strong>
   for any ATK scaling DPS with a focus on Basic ATKs.
  </strong>
  As of version 2.4, Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae is the only character that fully benefits from its effects, but it can be used by others with a few adjustments in playstyle. The only criteria to meet is to use Basic ATKs every turn if players want full uptime on the buffs.

  Yunli and Clara rely on their counterattacks to deal damage, so this won't affect much (though Clara suffers more). Blade could use it, but won't benefit much from the ATK buff. Considering most DPS units scale off ATK, this Light Cone
  <strong>
   will fit any future characters with a focus on Basic ATKs.

  This strange Light Cone offers
  <strong>
   debuffing capabilities and a CRIT Rate increase.
  </strong>
  Characters following the path of Nihility generally don't want any CRIT stats (with few exceptions). Still, there are cases where building CRIT on these characters could be useful, which is achievable with this Light Cone. The only two Nihility characters that fully benefit from having CRIT stats are
  <strong>
   Acheron and Welt.
  </strong>
  Acheron's signature is by far her best Light Cone, but this one is second in line.

 <p>
  Silver Wolf herself only fully benefits from this Light Cone at E2+, where she can be built as a sub DPS. Anything under E2 is built as a debuffer or breaker. Pela and Luka specialize in debuffing and breaking respectively, but can be built with CRIT where needed. The reason for its ranking is the debuff it applies to the enemy, on top of it being
  <strong>
   usable on different types of characters and offering flexibility.

 <p>
  This is a potentially controversial pick. To start, it should be noted that both Kafka and Black Swan would prefer having their respective E1s before their signature Light Cones, as those result in a higher damage increase. However, DOT teams have a high SPD requirement to be viable, and this Light Cone
  <strong>
   comes in handy when trying to hit that requirement.
  </strong>
  As for Luka, this light cone does perform slightly worse than the 4-star Light Cone "Good Night and Sleep Well." However, it offers synergy when used with other DOT units.

 <p>
  Considering the non-CRIT-based 4-star Nihility Light Cones are very good, this one is far from a necessity.
  <strong>
   Ultimately, it depends on what players want to invest in.
  </strong>
  DOT teams are among the best teams to run, as they offer reliability in almost any fight. Considering this, it makes sense for DOT enthusiasts to pull this Light Cone at some point, whether before or after Kafka and Black Swan's E1s.

  Offering a
  <strong>
   personal damage increase and partly a teamwide damage increase as well,
  </strong>
  this Light Cone can perform well on any Hunt unit with follow-up mechanics. Though it might not perform as well on characters that don't oftem perform follow-up attacks (like Yanqing), it can still be considered due to the debuff it applies. As usual, any additional CRIT stat is welcomed, especially on Hunt units.

 <p>
  This Light Cone falls under the same category as some of the others. The criteria in order to get the buffs is so general that any future Hunt unit with follow-up mechanics could use it easily. Not only does it already perform great on the characters currently available, but it will likely remain
  <strong>
   one of the best choices for any future Hunt follow-up units.

 <p>
  This Light Cone was made specifically for Argenti, he has a mechanic that allows him to unleash his ultimate at two different levels, requiring different amounts of energy (maxing out at 180). When considering the effects of the Light Cone, with the free increase in CRIT DMG aside, it of course works best on Argenti but
  <strong>
   can be used by any Erudition unit with an Ultimate that deals damage.
  </strong>
  As of version 2.4, every Erudition unit does. But
  <strong>
   the higher the Ultimate's energy cost, the more it will benefit them.
  </strong>
  Among the highest in the game are Qingque and Jade at 140 max energy each.

 <p>
  It's hard to say if another unit will ever have 2 levels on their ultimate, let alone that it will be another Erudition unit. The chances of another character being able to take full advantage of this Light Cone is uncertain. However, all current and likely most future Erudition units can benefit from its effect, which makes it a good option for F2P players wanting a 5-star Light Cone.

 <p>
  This Light Cone offers a
  <strong>
   damage increase from every source of damage available, excluding follow-up attacks
  </strong>
  . This does mean Hunt units whose follow-up attack is their main source of damage (like Topaz &amp; Numby) would likely prefer another Light Cone. However, this one has the potential to work well on every other Hunt unit. The major downside is that the user needs
  <strong>
   160 SPD (in combat) to obtain the full buffs.
  </strong>
  Without characters that can naturally increase their own SPD (like Seele), it can be tough to work around. However, Hunt units do have a higher base SPD stat. Running them with SPD boots alongside a support unit that can buff SPD (Ruan Mei, Asta, Hanya) would likely be enough to get the full buff.

 <p>
  Like Argenti's Light Cone, it works best on the character it was made for, but it can still perform well on other Hunt units. There are other sources for SPD buffs like relic sets, support Light Cones, and
  <strong>
   possibly more supports in the future that can buff SPD.
  </strong>
  The value of this Light Cone will only increase over time.

 <p>
  This Light Cone is a phenomenal choice for any Erudition unit with a follow-up attack. As of version 2.4, 5 out of 7 Erudition units can use follow-up attacks (assuming Qingque is at least E4).
  <strong>
   The more reliant they are on follow-up attacks, the better.
  </strong>
  Jade is the only exception, as it's best not to spam her skill. It's harder for her to gain the DMG buff on her follow-ups, but it can still be triggered by using her ultimate.

 <p>
  If more future Erudition units with follow-up attacks are released, they will likely be able to use this Light Cone. If not, it works great with the already existing characters, especially Jing Yuan. It's a
  <strong>
   win-win situation if players enjoy the Erudition playstyle and want to invest more into it,
  </strong>
  which would help with clearing Pure Fiction.

      <title>8 Turn-Based JRPGs Worth Playing Just For Their Stories</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  JRPGs have some of the most compelling stories in video games probably because they have more time to cook. The average playtime for a lot of them ranges in the forty-hour mark which can be a lot to take in for some players with busy lives. That said, some games need to be played just for the story alone.
 </p>

 <p>
  The turn-based combat and graphics may also be compelling about some of these entries, but the narratives transcend the genre. Admittedly, they still won’t be for everyone given that Japanese games can at times be weird too thanks to anime influences. These examples should be given a shot at least.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  is among the top favorites for fans of the series. It begins with a mercenary, Cloud, returning to Midgar where his old headquarters used to be. He used to be in SOLDIER, a top program for combatants within Shinra, the corporation that controls Midgar.

  What begins as a simple series of eco-terrorist attacks turns into a plot revolving around Sephiroth, a man Cloud thought was dead, trying to destroy the world. There are twists aplenty from amnesiac episodes to stuffed animal spies to racing Chocobos. There’s so much to love about the story and the remake series has been doing a good job at translating this masterpiece for the modern age.

   Persona 5
  </em>
  involves a nameless teen getting transferred to a new city in Japan after a political scandal. Here he meets a coffee owner and family friend who helps him get into a new school. As this teen meets new friends, they get involved with magical powers that let them go into an alternate reality wherein they can change the hearts of truly corrupt individuals from a burger chain entrepreneur to a dastardly gym teacher.

  The main plot is interesting but so are the little activities along the way as this teen can befriend side characters through a system called Confidants to form bonds. It’s a long RPG too and players will truly feel like they met a whole series of new friends by the end.

  <em>
   Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch

  is like playing a Ghibli movie. The plot involves a young boy, Oliver, who travels into a new world to rescue his mom. He’s helped by a magical fairy named Mr. Drippy who teaches him about the new world from lore to battle mechanics.

  It’s a wonder to experience for any Ghibli fan who grew up with the films. While it may not be as tight of a plot as it is longer than a two-hour film, it still has all of the charm and heart that will make players weep with joy and sadness.

  <em>
   Parasite Eve
  </em>
  is a good sci-fi horror plot that would work well as a big-budget Hollywood movie. For those curious, yes, there was a Japanese movie and it is overall based on a book. The game stars detective Aya Brea from New York City who witnesses a tragedy at an opera one night.

 <p>
  People burst into flames after a woman, Eve, starts to transform. Now people across the city are turning into ooze and animals are mutating into monsters. It’s a creepy story but excellently paced to make it thrilling with plenty of action along with grotesque scenes of horror.

  <em>
   Radiant Historia
  </em>
  is a time-traveling story about righting the wrongs of the past. Stocke and his small squadron get wiped out during a mission at the beginning but not all is lost. Magical beings grant him a grimoire that can help him travel through time repeatedly to solve puzzles to move the plot forward.

 <p>
  Keeping track of all the timelines can be tricky but satisfying all the same. The core cast of heroes, including Stocke, is small, meaning that players can get to know them easier than with a bigger cast making it a more intimate RPG overall.

  <em>
   Shadow Hearts: Covenant
  </em>
  is a wild plot that rearranges history into an alternate timeline. During World War 1, a group of heroes banded together to stop Rasputin from taking over the world. The influx of real-world characters is fun to see in a new light, especially the unhinged Rasputin.

  Other characters include Princess Anastasia of the Russian Empire and the philosopher Roger Bacon. The plot is more silly than it is gripping and for that reason alone it is worth tracking down on the PS2.

  It can be incomprehensible at times as characters wax poetically about the universe in cutscenes that rival the length of M

      <title>7 Forgotten Heroes In Classic Horror Games</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/forgotten-heroes-in-classic-horror-games/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Horror games have enjoyed a long tenure in the world of games, captivating fans with their terrifying monster design, atmospheric locations, and the intriguing heroes that arm themselves with weapons or their own wits and courage to contend with whatever horrors may unfold before them. These games have only become bigger and better over the years, with more intricate gameplay, plots, and more polished graphics to add a layer of terrifying realism.

 <p>
  But without the horror games of yore, these games would barely exist even in dreams (or rather nightmares) of developers. Many classic horrors and their stars are given the accolades they deserve, such as
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill
   </em>
  </strong>
  , franchises that have survived to this day, with protagonists that have become household names. But there are many more classic titles celebrated at the time of their release that have now faded to obscurity, and the heroes within them are just a name etched into a faded, old manual.

  There are very few who would remember the classic survival horror game
  <strong>
   <em>
    Nightmare Creatures
   </em>
  </strong>
  , despite it being celebrated upon its release. Using a Victorian setting to place an emphasis on gothic horror,
  <em>
   Nightmare Creatures
  </em>
  tells the tale of a cult known as the Brotherhood of Hecate who thinks they are on the cusp of greatness, having created an elixir to gain supernatural powers, only for it to have some very unexpected side effects.

 <p>
  The game features dual protagonists, Ignatius and Nadia, one a Priest, and the other the daughter of the cult's next victim. There is enough of a difference between the two, as they wield their own primary weapon, and both shine with different strengths. Ignatius has knowledge of everything revolving around occultism, and Nadia is an accomplished fencer. Despite this, the game and its charming heroes have fallen into obscurity, begging for rediscovery.

  The Poor, Unlucky Girl is a title bestowed upon Jennifer, the protagonist of the PS2 horror classic
  <strong>
   <em>
    Rule of Rose
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Rose Garden Orphanage becomes the hunting ground of poor Jennifer as she becomes the prey of the young girls that have taken over, forming the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. The girls constantly attack, boss around, and torment poor withdrawn Jennifer, who has to rely on her own courage and whatever resources she can scrounge in her surroundings.

 <p>
  Over time, it slowly grows apparent that Jennifer is trapped within childhood memories she repressed, where she was bullied by other girls in the orphanage. The mental scarring this left has morphed these memories into nightmarish visions, and players can't help but feel for them. Though
  <em>
   Rule of Rose
  </em>
  has become something of a cult classic, its rarity guarantees that eventually it will completely fade from the collective consciousness, and just remain one more obscure relic of the past, and Jennifer along with it.

  Based on the Harlan Ellison short novel of the same name,
  <strong>
   <em>
    I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
   </em>
  </strong>
  features five protagonists who are the last remaining survivors of humanity, trapped within the dystopian world run by a malicious AI known as AM. AM keeps these poor people alive for over 100 years, torturing them psychologically by forcing each character to confront their major flaw while also grappling with real-life horror scenarios such as genocide, paranoia, insanity, and assault.

 <p>
  <em>
   I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
  </em>
  has an impressively large cast considering the time of its release, and by showcasing each character's flaws as a major plot point, players come to know these characters intimately, and may even see themselves reflected in one or more of them. It is definitely one of the most personal stories explored in a horror game, but even this was not enough to save its memory from the erosion of time. But with a plethora of nearly impossible heroes dominating the world of gaming, it might be time to visit this forgotten classic with some of the most realistic game characters of all time.

  When people think of video game heroes, someone brave, selfless, and just likely comes to mind, one who will defend the weak, and gladly lay down their life for another. But horror games always push boundaries and challenge the norm, and players will find not a hero, but a criminal at the heart of the classic PS2 horror
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Suffering
   </em>
  </strong>
  . In this title, Torque has been sentenced to death for murdering his ex-wife and their two children, although he claims he has no memory of the incident. Torque's lucky break comes in the form of malevolent creatures that inhabit the prison island and are freed when a violent earthquake shakes the foundations of the land.

 <p>
  Though a silent protagonist, Torque's story is one fully grounded in reality, albeit the darker sides of it, and the outcome is dependent on the player. The three possible endings will all show Torque's character in a different light, and mark him down as a tragic hero, a dark anti-hero, or a full-blown monster--quite literally. Though a criminal main character isn't completely unique to
  <em>
   The Suffering
  </em>
  , what this game does with Torque and his story makes it worthy of remembrance, even if many fans have forgotten.

  Raised in an orphanage, Jennifer thinks she has found her way to a better life when she and her friends are adopted by the rich Simon Barrows who takes them to the eponymous mansion he lives in. But as is par for the course in horror, Jennifer doesn't get her happily ever after as Mr Barrows goes missing, her friends die one by one, and the dreaded Scissorman makes his entrance, forcing Jennifer to flee the path of his deadly scissors as she tries to escape the mansion and his dreaded reach.

  As a young and vulnerable protagonist, Jennifer's role serves to make the game scarier and more tense, as the player won't have the means to defend themselves in games such as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dino Crisis
   </em>
  </strong>
  , though she still exhibits resourcefulness at some points in the game that would have otherwise seen her killed. This prevents Jennifer from being too much of a liability, and a more enjoyable character to play. But this hasn't stopped her from being largely forgotten by the horror community. Time will only tell if
  <strong>
   <em>
    Clock Tower: Rewind
   </em>
  </strong>
  places her and the franchise back on the map.

  Not to be confused with a Square Enix product,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Parasite Eve
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a PS1 classic title that once enjoyed fame and now claims obscurity. NYPD rookie plans to enjoy a blind date at the opera, only to find she has to immediately go back on duty after a mysterious force causes everyone to combust, except for Aya, her date, and the sopranos on stage, who delivers a mysterious message before transforming into a beast and fleeing, which will lead Aya on a mission she won't ever forget.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, not everyone has as good a memory as Aya, and this has caused her to become a forgotten icon of the PS1 era. Despite being a strong-willed and independent woman with soft edges and a biting sense of humor, which makes her a multi-faceted character with a layer of realism. Her fame was enough to garner her a few sequels, but not enough for fans to remember her decades after her debut.

  Thanks to the popularity of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , other Capcom franchises have become orphans, and as a result, largely forgotten.
  <em>
   Dino Crisis
  </em>
  is one such title, starring the very capable and badass Regina. Often toted as '
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  but with dinosaurs',
  <em>
   Dino Crisis
  </em>
  sees the heroes of the game infiltrating a research facility in which the once-thought-to-be dead Dr. Edward Kirk is involved in a project revolving around some form of secret weapon. Sound familiar,
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  fans?

 <p>
  Regina is a cool and calculated badass who approaches missions with an air of aloofness, not fazed by gore or horror, which just further evidences how strong and independent she is. Despite this, she is not immune to trading witty remarks, or even showing compassion and kindness when the situation calls for it. Hopefully, Capcom will remember they have another secret agent in a game they made outside of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , and fans old and new will see her swing back into action. But for now, she and her game gather dust, waiting to be rediscovered.

  An
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has found an extremely OP tactic for invasions which involves placing Glass Shards around levers, making it extremely difficult for opponents to use levers and run away. Glass Shards are considered one of the most worthless items in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  by far, as they are the only item in the game that have practically no use at all.

  Just like the other Souls games,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is well known for its difficulty and the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC takes it a notch higher. Fans are always looking to make the most of the items in the game to deal with the unforgiving difficulty, and it seems like players have employed their creativity once again to make a completely useless item extremely OP.

 <p>
  In a new post on the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  subreddit, user bugzapperbob reveals an extremely useful trick that makes the Glass Shard OP. During an invasion in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , players can strategically place Glass Shards around levers. This will prevent opponents from being able to use the lever properly, as it is possible that they will get prompted to pick up the item instead. If opponents are unable to use the levers and pick up the Glass Shard instead, it will slow them down significantly and can even prevent them from running away altogether.

  How To Get Glass Shards In Elden Ring
 </h2>
 <p>
  There are a plethora of ways to get Glass Shards in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  both in the base game and the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC. While players can farm them from enemies such as Demi-Human Swordmaster and Perfumers, one of the easiest ways to get it in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is through Patches' shop. However, this item has no apparent use at all, apart from this newly discovered tactic by this user.

 <p>
  Fans are already calling it one of the most evil tactics in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . The tactic of putting messages in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  near levers has been a common practice, and it is quite infuriating for other players as they are unable to use levers at times. In that scenario, however, players don't have much to lose. On the other hand, this invasion tactic can easily put them in an extremely perilous situation where they can get defeated by the opponent in a matter of minutes. That being said, it is going to be a tad difficult to pull it off, since if players do not place them at the right spot, then the lever prompt is going to take precedence.

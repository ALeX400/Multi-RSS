  Piggyback is a fairly new feature in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fall Guys
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which might need to be clarified for some returning or new players. The premise is simple: hop on another player’s back or let them hop on yours and carry each other to the finish line. However, in practice, this feature might not feel instinctive — especially now that you have to press an Emote button to request and accept Piggybacks.

  The following guide aims to compensate for the lack of in-game instructions on Piggybacks in
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  by explaining what the feature is and how you can use it, as well as offering some extra information about this fun mechanic.

  Piggyback is
  <strong>
   a social feature in
   <em>
    Fall Guys
   </em>
   that allows you to carry another player on your back
  </strong>
  . Introduced with the Fall Forever update in April 2024, this feature is part of the new gameplay changes. Piggybacking requires mutual agreement between two players. You can only pick up or be carried by another player if both parties have accepted the request.

 <p>
  Piggyback was introduced alongside a few other new gameplay features, like the Phrase and Emote Wheel, added with the May 2024 update. However, it was the
  <strong>
   only feature that did not face major backlash
  </strong>
  . Most other Fall Forever additions were labeled game-breaking by the community.

  On PlayStation and Xbox, you can request or accept a Piggyback
  <strong>
   by pressing up on the D-pad
  </strong>
  . On PC, you’ll need to press the 'H' key. Mobile users, however, simply need to tap the dedicated Piggyback button located in the top-right corner of the screen (look for the
  <strong>
   icon showing two Beans
  </strong>
  ).

  The main series of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  games has always been handheld-exclusive, up until the release of the Nintendo Switch. While players on handheld were gifted with enthralling and engaging RPG adventures, home console players would also receive
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, albeit in a very different form.

 <p>
  <strong>
   GameCube
  </strong>
  is no exception. Throughout the system's lifespan, Nintendo released four
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, all of which were compatible with third-generation
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games released on Game Boy Advance. The GameCube was also the first home system to receive
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  RPG games, which, however, were very different from the main series titles. With that in mind, which
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games were the best on Gamecube?

  <em>
   : Traditionally, Pokemon was always a handheld console series, but several spin-off games were introduced on consoles like the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube, which were not a part of the mainline run of Pokemon games. This is a trend that has continued to this day with
   <strong>
    Pokemon Snap

   ,
   <strong>
    Pokken Tournament DX
   </strong>
   ,

  The worst
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game on the GameCube is undoubtedly
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Box: Ruby and Sapphire
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The reason is very simple: this is barely a game. In fact, it's nothing more than a storage system for mainline third-generation
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games. Players could upload and store their Pokemon from other games in
  <em>
   Pokemon Box
  </em>
  . To be fair, there are some additional features, such as having Pokemon breed, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is nothing more than a storage system. This is easily one of the worst spin-off ideas of all time, even if applications like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Bank
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Home
   </em>
  </strong>
  could be seen as successors to this original concept.

  While originally released with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Ruby &amp; Sapphire
   </em>
  </strong>
  in mind, as the title suggests, the game is also compatible with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Emerald
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen
   </em>
  </strong>
  , so every third-generation mainline game can upload creatures on
  <em>
   Pokemon Box
  </em>
  . This allows players to transfer between those games without needing two Game Boy Advance and a Game Boy Advance Link Cable, which many players don't have today. Despite its abysmal reputation, the game has become increasingly rare over time and is now very difficult to come by at a reasonable price.

  Is Pokemon Box: Ruby &amp; Sapphire Worth Revisiting Today?

 <p>
  Definitely not. At the time, the game was seen as revolutionary. When starting a new game on
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed or LeafGreen,
  </em>
  the entire game would be reset, essentially wiping all Pokemon from the game.
  <em>
   Pokemon Box
  </em>
  allowed Pokemon to be kept. Perfect for completing the Pokedex, as certain Pokemon could only be caught on one save file; the starter Pokemon, for example. But this is just not necessary anymore.
  <em>
   Pokemon Home
  </em>
  has this exact same feature but is available for modern Pokemon games like the latest entry,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet
   </strong>
  </em>
  . To summarize,
  <em>
   Pokemon Box: Ruby &amp; Sapphire
  </em>
  is completely outdated.

 <p>
  Most
  <em>

  </em>
  games in this era are worth almost four times as much as they were at the time of their original release. Gamers will be looking to pay around $150-$250 to pick up a copy of
  <em>
   Pokemon Box: Ruby &amp; Sapphire
  </em>
  . It can be found on websites like eBay for an unsealed copy. For a sealed copy of the game, fans are looking at paying around $1000-$2000, which is very unreasonable, especially considering this game has no replay value whatsoever.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Channel

  </strong>
  is one of the weirdest spin-offs in the franchise, and it's partially a spiritual successor to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hey You, Pikachu!
   </em>
  </strong>
  on Nintendo 64. The game is very simple in structure yet difficult to explain in a few words. Basically, players are tasked with being beta testers for new TV channels dedicated to
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  . Players will need to surf through various channels to report feedback to Professor Oak, but they will also be able to explore the house they are in and some outdoor areas.

 <p>
  While the game is very short on content and there's arguably very little to play, it still has a unique charm. Watching Pokemon TV is an oddly fascinating and charming experience, and while this is surely a far cry from the epic adventures of the mainline games, it's still a decent distraction, especially for kids, who were the game's main target. Also, the game provides one of the ways to get a legitimate Jirachi, which players can download on
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby &amp; Sapphire
  </em>
  upon beating the game.

  For preowned versions of the game, Pokemon fans will be looking to pay around $20-$70. Prices are extremely varied from different sellers. Sealed versions of the game are $150+, which is a fairer price than

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness

  </strong>
  is the second
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  RPG released on Gamecube. The game is set some years after the events of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Colosseum
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and players are once again tasked with defeating Team Cypher, which is transforming Pokemon into Shadow Pokemon by corrupting their hearts. The game is set some years after the events of the previous game and is probably the closest thing to a mainline
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  experience on the Gamecube.

 <p>
  However, the game still feels very different from mainline games, as the game's focus is more on the narrative rather than the collecting and training side of things. Also, while
  <em>
   Pokemon XD
  </em>
  provides many quality-of-life improvements over its predecessor, it arguably has a weaker plot, and this is what makes the game only the second best on Gamecube. Despite this, every
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan should try and give it a go, even if it won't be easy because the game is still trapped on the Gamecube.

  Definitely, this game offers a very unique experience unlike any other Pokemon game. This story-driven mode does not focus on collecting Pokemon and completing the Pokedex like the mainline games. Shadow Pokemon are an amazing concept that is all but exclusive to this game, apart from
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , so it is a great way to see them in their full glory. Shadow Lugia is iconic. For this alone, it is worth a playthrough. Good luck tracking down a copy of this game, as they are hard to find, and the game is still trapped on the GameCube console. Something similar that is more easily found is
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends: Arceus
   </strong>
  </em>
  , or maybe even the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Mystery Dungeon

  </em>
  franchise.

  For sealed and mint condition copies of this GameCube title, fans will be looking at paying over a thousand dollars. At this price, it is not worth it. However, for a version of the game that has been played before, gamers are looking at a more reasonable price of around $70-$150. Considering this game is fairly iconic with the Shadow Lugia that is a fair price for an almost 20-year-old title. Again, eBay seems to be the best place to pick up

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Colosseum
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the best
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game on the Gamecube and an experience that every
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan should play through. The game was the first
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  RPG on a home system, which was revolutionary at the time. The main campaign has a darker and grittier plot when compared to the series' standards, something that adds a unique charm to this adventure. Players are also able to trade Pokemon with all third-generation games, allowing for their favorites to appear in the game and help them out in beating the main story.

 <p>
  Other than that, the game also provides a battle mode, which allows players to focus on battles, rendered in beautiful Gamecube graphics. It's not much by today's standards, but at the time players had never seen such high-quality
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  battles. Also, the game included notable bonuses at launch: Japanese players got a bonus disc that allowed them to download Celebi on mainline games, while US players got an exclusive Jirachi. Because of all this, many players are asking for a remake of the game, or at least for it to be re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online platform.

  Is Pokemon Colosseum Worth Revisiting Today?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Yes, Pokemon Colosseum has held up to this day as a way for players to experience 3D Pokemon Battles. Although this is now the norm in the franchise, it is awesome to go back and see the first time this happened in the Pokemon games. It is tricky to be able to play this game legitimately, as it is only available on the GameCube. As such, alternatives are
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Battle Revolution
   </em>
  </strong>
  on the Wii, or even the mainline
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games on the Nintendo Switch, which have a very similar style to
  <em>
   Pokemon Colosseum's
  </em>
  battles.

  How Much Is Pokemon Colosseum Today?

  The cheapest option on this list, and it so happens to be the best entry too.
  <em>

  is priced at around $35-$40 which is an absolute steal and a price that even casual
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans could be looking at paying. Sealed versions range from $ 500 to $1000, though only hardcore collectors should look at paying that price. eBay looks to be the best and cheapest place to pick up Colosseum, and for the price it currently is, it would be worth picking up.​​​​​​​

 <p>
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2

  has a lot of gamers' attention right now due to the remake that's rapidly approaching its release date. While many fans are hesitant about the remake, it's brought both versions of the game to the front of gamers' minds. Of course,
  <em>

  </em>
  wouldn't be complete without the legendary Pyramid Head or Red Pyramid Thing monster, which terrorizes James Sunderland throughout his journey in the spooky town.

  Now, Pyramid Head is getting a Nendoroid action figure that turns it into a chibi-style version of itself. Like with all Nendoroids, Pyramid Head has been shrunk down to just a few inches tall, looking short and squashy instead of having its usual lanky build in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  . The Pyramid Head Nendoroid, like other game Nendoroid releases, is articulated, allowing fans to pose Pyramid Head in iconic poses, like it skewering itself during a certain boss battle. It also includes both its Great Knife and Spear, and can hold either weapon for recreating memorable scenes from the game.

  At the time of writing, Pyramid Head's Nendoroid is currently in the pre-sale phase, going for $41.99 from manufacturer Good Smile before shipping.

  remake releases.

 <h2 id="pyramid-head-remains-iconic">
  Pyramid Head Remains Iconic
 </h2>
 <p>
  Although the creator of the monster seemingly regrets creating Pyramid Head, the terrifying creature is arguably the most-recognized thing to emerge from the entire series. The renown and popularity of Pyramid Head led to it appearing in subsequent entries like
  <em>
   Silent Hill: Homecoming
  </em>
  , and even the two
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  movies released thus far. It will presumably also play a big role in the third
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  film, which will be based off the second game. The terror of being defenseless against Pyramid Head while playing
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  has made it memorable, as well as the striking appearance that stands out even among the creepy Bubble Head Nurses.

 <p>
  Since the original
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  launched so long ago, latecomers to the series haven't had much of an opportunity to buy any merchandise related to the game. In advance of these new game and movie releases, though, that has changed. Even if a silly take on Pyramid Head isn't something a fan is interested in, Konami has also revealed other
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  merchandise, like statues, apparel, and even a Dog Ending coin bank.

  CD Projekt Red first introduced weapon crafting in
  <em>
   The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings
  </em>
  , but
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
   </em>
  </strong>
  refined and expanded the system to its peak.
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  offers dozens of uniquely designed silver and steel swords for Geralt to discover in the open world, while players can also search for legendary Witcher gear schematics to craft some of the game's most powerful weapons. These legendary weapons can be upgraded through several tiers, growing stronger as Geralt progresses, though crafting them requires a significant amount of effort.

  First, players must find or purchase legendary schematics, which can be challenging or expensive. Next, they need to locate a master capable of crafting masterwork gear, often tied to specific questlines. Finally, rare and costly components are required for crafting, some of which can be hard to obtain without proper knowledge. Additionally, the
  <em>
   Hearts of Stone
  </em>
  expansion introduced a new rune system, offering even more depth in weapon customization.

  The real highlight of the game, however, is its deep crafting system for weapons and armor. Many items can be crafted using rare schematics, with players able to choose from various materials to determine the final result. Each material used adds unique properties and aesthetics to the crafted gear, encouraging experimentation. Furthermore, secret merchants are scattered throughout the game, offering rare schematics, weapons, and upgrade materials, rewarding dedicated players with the best resources for crafting their ultimate gear.

  Ubisoft has continually refined its gear and weapon systems in the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series, and with
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  , the studio has delivered one of its best implementations yet.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Valhalla
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers a wide range of weapons to discover and upgrade using common resources, but rarer materials — Carbon, Nickel, and Tungsten Ingots — are essential for unlocking new upgrade tiers and enhancing the appearance of gear with more intricate and exotic designs.

 <p>
  With impressive visual and mechanical upgrade potential,
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  also allows players to slot up to three runes into each weapon, granting various effects. These enchantments can add elemental damage types, boost stealth or skill effectiveness, or even provide powerful perks such as knocking enemies down. The
  <em>
   Dawn of Ragnarök
  </em>
  expansion further expands these possibilities, introducing a new upgrade tier that allows players to forge ultimate Divine weapons using Platinum Ingots.

  , alongside its expansion
  <em>

  Many weapons in

  offers one of the most flexible and comprehensive crafting systems in RPGs, allowing players to repurpose nearly every piece of scrap they find.

  When it comes to
  <em>
   Pokémon,
  </em>
  most fans of the series will likely bring up a Fire, Water, or Dragon-type as their favorite, as these typings tend to have the flashiest members. But if Brock from
  <em>
   Pokémon Red &amp; Blue
  </em>
  taught players anything, it's that it's hard to find Pokemon tougher than those of the Rock variety.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rock-type Pokemon come in varying shapes and sizes, but most seem to share a fortitude that matches their natural abilities. Here are some of the toughest Rock-type Pokemon in the games, and how they rank against one another.

  The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise has an exciting year ahead with the impending release of
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Z-A,
  </em>
  which will take players back to the Kalos region for a brand-new adventure. Of course, Kalos was home to some pretty iconic Rock-types, such as the Rock/Dragon-type powerhouse Tyrantrum, as well as the lovably Rock/Fairy-type Mythical Pokemon Diancie. With this impending game in mind, let's take a look at a few of the other tough Rock-type Pokemon in the series' history, including the aforementioned Mythical 'mon who might have a renaissance when Po
  <em>
   kemon Legends Z-A
  </em>
  reintroduces Mega Evolution.

  Iron Thorns may look similar to Tyranitar, another Pokemon on this list. However, it's a completely different 'mon introduced as a Paradox form in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  . Iron Thorns has the Rock/Electric-typing, which is only shared by the Alolan forms of Geodude, Graveler, and Golem. This doubles its weakness to the Ground-type, but gives it access to some powerful STAB moves, too.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a competitive Pokemon, Iron Thorns can prove useful, especially when paired with unconventional moves like Dragon Dance. This move increases its Attack and Speed to power-up moves like Supercell Slam or Stone Edge, which can OHKO an opponent assuming it doesn't miss.

 <p>
  Carbink is a pretty useless teammate for the most part, but its Mythical cousin, Diancie, is quite the incredible Pokemon. With its incredibly high Defense and Special Defense, which can't be lowered by other Pokemon's attacks thanks to its Ability, Clear Body, Diancie makes for an unexpected wall with its strong typing, powerful moveset, and versatile playstyles as either a wall or special sweeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sadly, in
  <em>
   Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  , Diancie is unable to Mega Evolve. In previous generations, this allowed it to trade its incredible defensive stats for offensive strength, paired with the Ability Magic Bounce and STAB moves like Moonblast and Diamond Storm. Hopefully,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Z-A
  </em>
  reintroduces this powered-up form so that Diancie can remain a go-to Rock-type for competitive players.

 </div>
 <p>
  Glimmora has been the recipient of a lot of fan distaste in
  <em>
   Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  , mainly for being the signature 'mon of the game's Champion, Geeta, who is considered one of the easiest Champion fights in the series' history. Sadly, that's because Geeta's tendency to Terastallize Glimmora into a pure Rock-type, removing its useful Poison-type advantages, is quite a rookie mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Competitive players should not underestimate Glimmora, though. It's a high-ranking Pokemon thanks to its powerful Special Attack, making it a perfect choice to lead a match. It automatically sets Toxic Spikes when it's hit, and has access to Stealth Rock. Certainly, players wouldn't want to wait to throw out Glimmora last if they want to have any hope of intimidating opponents.

  When it comes to new-age Rock-type Pokemon that are rough and tumble, players need look no further than Drednaw. Not only does this Pokemon have a striking design, it's pretty capable of dishing out heavy damage to a wide array of opponents thanks to its dual Water and Rock typing.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Drednaw is an excellent Pokemon with a wide move pool, it does have a pretty glaring weakness against Grass-type Pokemon (4x weakness). Those that can account for this weakness will find a visually enthralling Pokemon with decent stats to boot.

  Stakataka is definitely one of the weirdest Rock-type Pokemon to ever exist. Its strange design can be attributed to its place as an Ultra Beast, which serve as some of the most unique, odd, and off-the-wall designs to ever hit the Pokemon world. Not only do Ultra Beasts look strange but they're incredibly powerful to boot and Stakataka is no different.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players are looking for a tough Rock-type Pokemon, they'll definitely want to add this curious creation to their team. Stakataka boasts some seriously impressive defensive stats and is pretty powerful in its own right.

  It's hard to get tougher than a literal rock with arms and legs popping out. At first glance, Golem looks like a giant boulder that sprouted extremities and a head.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's unclear if they have soft bodies underneath the rock-like exterior or if the top layer is an extremely dense skin layer and all of their organs are inside the round rock-like shape. It also happens to have a lower center of gravity which gives it the upper hand against foes looking to topple it over and use its weight and body shape against it.

  At first glance, Crustle may look like a weird gimmick idea of a Pokemon, but it's much more than that. For starters, it has one of the cooler Pokemon designs that aren't reptilian or armored.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering its name is Crustle it makes sense that its body resembles the Earth's crust and its many layers of varying sediment. Crustle is not much different from Golem in terms of being a piece of Earth with limbs poking out, but since its previous evolution is a play on hermit crabs, it can likely change to a different boulder, unlike Golem.

  On the surface, Gigalith simply looks like a mass of rocks with bright red crystals and geodes protruding from its body. It turns out that those red crystals absorb solar energy and that's how Gigalith can shoot out beams of energy from its body.
 </p>
 <p>
  The energy can be compressed so tightly with so much pressure that the attack fired off afterward is capable of blowing entire mountains to smithereens. It also has the drawback of causing an incalculable number of fissures in its own body.

  on the horizon, people have been making fun of the legendary Pokemon called Zamazenta for having a shield on its face. However, longtime Pokemon fans would know that Bastiodon was actually the first face-shield design, and luckily for him, toughness has nothing to do with being aesthetically pleasing.

  They're a pretty docile Pokemon that will spend its free time eating grass and berries. The creature lived or died 100 million years ago, based on how effective it was at keeping threats in front of it.

  Rhyperior takes what many people love about Rhydon and simply coats it in what seems to be rock armor plating. It can be found with an ability called solid rock that reduces super effective attack damage by 25% showcasing just how formidable it can be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rhyperior also has holes in its palms that it will fill with rocks and shoot out at enemies or threats. Geodude have been casualties of this and have been shot from its palms. The previously mentioned rock-like plating is said to be able to withstand volcanic eruptions.

  Sometimes Pokemon, like animals, can be a little too obvious about what their bodies were evolved for. In the case of Rampardos, it's clear they were meant to butt heads for dominance and protection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sporting a large bulbous blue spot on the top of their head, Rampardos uses it to engage in battles for varying types of reasons. The spikes surrounding that spot make it even more dangerous for those looking to challenge it. Funnily enough, Rampardos is a Rock-type Pokemon that may be a rock's greatest enemy.

  Tyrantrum happens to be one of the coolest and toughest Pokemon in existence regardless of typing. It isn't the first design based on the world-famous T-Rex, but the design and color palette make it come to life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tyrantrum's jaw is said to be powerful enough to destroy thick metal plates as if they were cardboard. The toughest thing about them is finding a female as the gender rates are largely in favor of males at an astounding 87.5% to just 12.5% for females. Be on the lookout for that rare T-Rex queen.

  Anyone who grew up watching the
  <em>
   Pokémon
  </em>
  anime or played through the original
  <em>
   Pokémon Red &amp; Blue
  </em>
  are familiar with the rock snake Pokemon known as Onix. In both mediums, Onix was the signature partner of Brock and showed fans how physically imposing certain Pokemon could be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Onix on average is over 28 feet in length and weighs well over 450 pounds. Its body is composed of rock-like segments that come in varying shapes and sizes. It also sports a large piercing horn in the center of its head. Although it has an evolution in Steelix, giving an Onix the Eviolite item is a good way to get some mileage out of this memorable 'mon.

  When Aggron was first revealed many thought that he was just a ripoff of Rhydon from the first generation of games. Upon further review, people began to understand that he was meant to be an armored tank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Rhydon looks like his body is formed of metal, Aggron carries the steel-typing confirming that his armor-plating is composed of metal. Both of the abilities an Aggron can end up having related to a formidable nature as he could either endure one-hit knockouts or receive no recoil damage from attacks.

  Tyranitar is more than just a nod to Godzilla. The 6-foot tall cave-dwelling monster is tough as nails, which is pretty evident simply by looking at it. It's known as the armor pokémon likely due to the green scales covering its body looking thick and impenetrable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fighting it as a trainer isn't only difficult because of how Tyranitar is built, but also because it's known to kick up a sandstorm or two. This will cause it to get an upgrade in damage and make the conditions around the battle tougher to overcome.

  Arcanine is one of the most iconic Pokemon from the first generation, and was well overdue for an upgrade by Gen 8. Luckily, that came with
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  , which takes place in Hisui, the region of Sinnoh far in the past. There, Growlithe and Arcanine have a slightly different design, and boast a Fire/Rock-typing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aside from a little boosted Attack and Speed, there's little else that's different about the two forms. Hisuian Arcanine boasts some pretty great new moves, but also suffers from 4x weakness to Ground and Water. Still, it makes for a strong opponent thanks to its strength.

  Paradox Pokemon were introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  , as version-exclusive past and present versions of recognizable creatures. The DLC expansions to the Switch games also feature some new Paradox Pokemon, including alternate versions of Unova's Cobalion, Virizion, and Terrakion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iron Boulder, Terrakion's variant, is Rock/Psychic-type, with incredible Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Although it's weak to a total of 7 Pokemon types, its moveset is incredibly diverse, and its stats are nothing to sneeze at, either.

  In just a few short months, Garganacl proved one of the most intimidating new Pokemon in
  <em>
   Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  . The pure Rock-type is the third stage evolution from Nacli after Naclstack. Its unique ability, Purifying Salt, makes it immune to status conditions; and its unique move, Salt Cure, inflicts damage every turn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suffice it to say, having a Garganacl on the team is guaranteed to frustrate even the most skilled competitive Pokemon opponents. Its resilience to being taken down easily, given its high HP and Defense, will only create more trouble as the battle continues.

  Finding its origins in turn-based board games and text-based computer games, the 4X subgenre of strategy games is one of the strongest in all gaming, boasting multiple best-selling franchises. Multiple influential titles like
  <em>
   Spaceward Ho!
  </em>
  and the early
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  games have really helped to shape the genre into its current form.
 </p>
 <p>
  The four main components of any 4X game are
  <strong>
   exploration
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   expansion
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   exploitation
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   extermination
  </strong>
  , which is where the name comes from. While the majority are still turn-based, some titles have incorporated real-time elements into the gameplay too. Here are some of the best 4X strategy games ever made, ranked based on a combination of their overall quality and popularity.

  Despite the mixed reception at launch,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Master of Magic
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the 2022 remake of the 1990s classic, is one of the finest 4X games on the market. Gameplay is often compared to
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  , since players are tasked with settling cities and aggressively expanding their chosen wizard’s kingdom, coming into conflict with AI-controlled wizards along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything on offer is largely faithful to the original, but with updated graphics, a new race in the form of the goblins, and new wizards to control. Anybody wishing to dominate the dimensional planes of Arcanus and Myrror has plenty of spells to utilize and fantasy races to choose from. This is the optimal way to experience this influential classic.

  Playing as a species capable of faster than light travel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stellaris
   </em>
  </strong>
  gives players the chance to colonize a galaxy, competing or collaborating with alien races through various crises to achieve space domination. Emphasis is placed on a strong economy, diplomatic relations and warfare, but there are mysteries to uncover, and each crisis must be handled if one hopes to achieve victory.
 </p>
 <p>
  The base game is generally well-regarded, but the myriad DLCs added post-release really put
  <em>
   Stellaris
  </em>
  among the best 4X games, including countless new races, situations and technologies. Opting for real-time strategy instead of turn-based really means that mistakes must be avoided, and events in the end game can really jeopardize a solid run for those who are unprepared.

  Containing RTS and RPG elements and building on the excellent
  <em>
   Endless Space
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Endless Legend
   </em>
  </strong>
  blends sci-fi with fantasy in its rich narrative. Set on the world of Auriga, a planet plagued by mysterious apocalyptic events, players must settle cities, thus claiming entire regions on the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each faction has its own slightly game-breaking strength, which somehow balances proceedings, and gameplay is largely accessible despite its complex appearance. The only real gripe that many players have is that the AI can at times be inconsistent with intelligent decision-making, but this is otherwise an engaging and immersive experience that is unique in every playthrough thanks to the randomized maps.

  Very few games can boast a map as expansive as that of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Distant World: Universe
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the definitive release of the full game with all expansions. Boasting 1400 star systems and over 50,000 planetary bodies, it’s a vast galaxy for players to immerse themselves in, as they compete to shape it as they see fit.
 </p>
 <p>
  The level of complexity and steep learning curve may be off-putting for some, but most of the micromanagement aspects can be automated, so players can focus on their favorite parts of the game. Gameplay is pausable in real-time and players constantly encounter new things, whether it’s an astronomical landmark, a space pirate or a rival empire.

  The measuring stick for 4X games set in space,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Master of Orion 2: Battle at Antares
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an absolute classic and highly influential title in the genre. Building on its predecessor and incorporating mechanics from Simtex’s other popular release,
  <em>
   Master of Magic
  </em>
  , players are able to create their own race as they colonize multi-planet star systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to population growth, food is an important resource to manage, and combat has many new features, such as marines infiltrating enemy ships. Victory can be achieved by either defeating all enemies in warfare, successfully invading the titular Antaran homeworld or by being elected as the supreme leader of the galaxy.

  A spin-off of Sid Meier’s legendary
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alpha Centauri
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes place on a distant planet in the eponymous star system, as seven ideological factions of humans have landed there. Taking place in the 22nd century, this is presented as the outcome of the space race victory condition in the
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  series and features a rich narrative involving alien experiments and planetary sentience.
 </p>
 <p>
  The expansion pack
  <em>
   Alien Crossfire
  </em>
  doubles the number of playable factions, even adding alien groups, each with their own ideologies about how the planet should progress. Gameplay is everything that one would expect of a Sid Meier game, achieving victory through equivalent means to
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  , such as military conquest, economic domination and diplomacy.

  Described as an “RT4X” by its creators,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sins of a Solar Empire
   </em>
  </strong>
  mixes real-time strategy with 4X in a deep space setting. Controlling one of three races, the goal is to conquer the galaxy through warfare, economic power or diplomacy, either playing against AI opponents or real humans via online play.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ambitious map is fully 3D, scaling from entire galaxies all the way down to asteroids and other smaller astronomical objects. Managing resources is vital, and the market can even fluctuate depending on transactions carried out by each competing empire. Various DLCs and expansions have greatly increased gameplay variety, adding new interstellar threats like black holes, new playable factions and other features like pirates and the black market.

  Set in the 23rd century, as humanity and alien lifeforms hurriedly try to take over every planet in the galaxy,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Galactic Civilizations 2: Dread Lords
   </em>
  </strong>
  opts for a singleplayer experience. Gameplay is generally balanced despite each of the ten preset civilizations having individual advantages, and the AI is noteworthy for being intelligent and making sophisticated choices.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a story-driven campaign about the titular Dread Lords, but otherwise players are free to create their own narrative, even altering settings in the pre-game setup to tailor the game as they wish. Expansions give even more options, with
  <em>
   Twilight of the Arnor
  </em>
  even boasting that a new vast map size could allow for a game that takes millennia to finish.

  An inventive
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has created three new Eeveelution designs, with the hope of seeing more Eeveelutions in future games. The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  universe is filled with colorful critters that have captivated the imagination of fans for nearly three decades. Yet, even among the iconic franchise's ever-expanding roster, Eevee remains one of the most popular Pokemon from the original generation. First introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  in 1996, the adorable creature has made appearances in numerous other games throughout the years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eevee is the base form of its evolutionary line, resembling a small fox with brown fur, a bushy tail, and expressive eyes, giving it a playful, cute appearance. In January, The Pokemon Company announced that 2025 will be the Year of Eevee, with many exciting celebrations planned, including the release of new Eevee-themed merchandise. To honor the beloved Pokemon, eBay launched an Eevee-inspired Evolving Shop in February. The Year of Eevee has brought even more attention to this fan-favorite Pokemon, sparking a wave of imaginative new fan-made designs.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Redditor known as Poetically_Imperfect recently shared three creative, self-made Eeveelutions. The designs were named Nimbeon, Wispeon, and Drakeon. Nimbeon is blue, with a cloud-like tail, resembling a small pony, while Wispeon is gray, featuring a pink, fluffy mane similar to a lion, and Drakeon is yellow, with large green eyes and a long, leafy tail. While the Redditor acknowledges that
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans may not get any new Eeveelutions, they expressed hope that one might be introduced in the upcoming
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  .

  Pokemon Fan Creates Three New Eeveelution Designs: Nimbeon, Wispeon, and Drakeon
 </h2>
 <p>
  This is not the first time fans have dreamed up new interpretations of the evolutionary line of the famous Pokemon. Recently, a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan created a suite of Eeveelution rabbit designs that showcased their various forms as cute bunnies. Another fan took a different approach, reimagining all Eeveelutions as adorable teddy bears.

 <p>
  Eevee can evolve into several different types, making it a unique Pokemon. Its evolution depends on specific conditions, such as using certain evolutionary stones, the time of day, or friendship levels. Among the many Eeveelutions, Sylveon stands out for many fans, with its shiny variant swapping the light pink and blue hues of its fur. However, others, like the elegant Umbreon and the intelligent Espeon, are also very popular with some Pokemon enthusiasts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The enduring popularity of Eevee and its Eeveelutions is a testament to the special place they hold in the hearts of many
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans. With the Year of Eevee in full swing and the highly anticipated
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  set to be a major release in 2025, fans of Eevee and the legendary
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  brand have plenty to look forward to this year.

  The
  <strong>
   zombie
  </strong>
  genre ruled the entertainment landscape for the better part of the last decade, and though audiences are currently a bit fatigued, it's a post-apocalyptic setting that comes back in waves. It's been that way since George A. Romero released
  <em>
   Night of the Living Dead
  </em>
  back in 1968.
 </p>
 <p>
  These days, a zombie-focused video game can still capture audiences' excitement and anticipation, but they need to deliver something that feels refreshing, unique, and/or of unmatched quality. More games, both AAA and indie, are released in the modern era than ever before. That means that there's likely more than a handful of
  <strong>
   upcoming zombie games
  </strong>
  to look forward to at any given time.

  Technically,
  <em>
   Killing Floor
  </em>
  's zeds are not zombies, but they essentially play the same role and the games cater to the same crowd. Tripwire's co-op shooter is finally gearing up for its comeback, and while not much has been revealed about
  <em>
   Killing Floor 3
  </em>
  , the franchise is generally quite reliable.
  <em>
   Killing Floor 2
  </em>
  has enjoyed a very long shelf life, and it is still fairly active considering it has been around since 2016; still, the title is starting to show its age, and plenty of similar games have entered the market over the last few years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set in 2091, the upcoming sequel will be taking on an almost cyberpunk theme by presenting a megacorporation as the core evil. Unsurprisingly, this organization has decided to weaponize zeds, forcing a resistance group to rise and rebel. Outside this basic plot summary, Tripwire has kept most other details under wraps, although the developer has confirmed that
  <em>
   Killing Floor 3
  </em>
  will support 6-player co-op. The game has been confirmed for a March 25, 2025, release.

  After going through a delay,
  <em>
   Post Trauma
  </em>
  has confirmed a March 31 release date, making it among the first major
  <strong>
   2025 horror zombie games
  </strong>
  . Developed by Red Souls Games, the project takes inspiration from the old-school greats, with the available footage suggesting a creepy trip reminiscent of early
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  and some traces of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  . In a pretty twist, players are put in charge of a train conductor rather than a soldier or police officer, with Roman finding himself dragged into a strange dimension that seems bent on scaring him to death.
 </p>
 <p>
  While screenshots show Roman carrying weapons like a hammer and a gun,
  <em>
   Post Trauma
  </em>
  will probably not lean too heavily into action territory, instead preferring to deliver a traditional survival horror experience that emphasizes puzzles. Zombies will also not be the only threats that players have to deal with.

  OK,
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  is hardly a new game, with Naughty Dog's sequel originally coming out in 2020. The PS5 remaster has been available since the start of 2024, when it debuted to a pretty positive reception. Visually, the vanilla version was already fantastic, but the remaster provided a graphical boost regardless; more importantly, it incorporated a few fresh twists, including new modes like No Return and Speedrun. While these additions are great companion pieces to the campaign, people who played through the PS4 iteration might want to consider if they are interested in playing through the story again before investing in the remaster.
 </p>
 <p>
  In April 2025,
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered
  </em>
  will make its way to PC stores, granting a new audience an opportunity to experience one of the most talked about releases of the last decade. The sequel's PC debut comes approximately two years after
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 1
  </em>
  made the jump, so it is arguably long overdue. While not usually far better than the PS5 versions, Sony's PC ports have generally been quite decent, and there is nothing to suggest this upcoming release will be a misstep in that area.

  Following up on the relative success of 2022's
  <em>
   The House of the Dead: Remake
  </em>
  , MegaPixel is working on reviving the sequel, which originally debuted in arcades in 1998. While popular during the late 90s and 2000s, the franchise fell somewhat to the wayside once arcades lost some of their relevancy, and modern entries have been hard to come by over the last decade. Remakes of old-school favorites might not be as exciting as completely new projects, but these releases at least keep the IP active to an extent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most people are probably familiar with
  <em>
   The House of the Dead
  </em>
  , so they most likely already know if the upcoming remake is something they might enjoy. For the uninitiated, these games are on-rails shooters where players only control the gunplay and not the movement. While, naturally, at their best in arcades, the series has generally translated well to consoles, and the second entry is fairly well-liked.

  <em>
   Into the Dead
  </em>
  has been around for a while, with the franchise producing two pretty good first-person mobile games. While not extremely well known beyond its fanbase, the series looks set to make the jump to PC and (hopefully) attract a new audience.
  <em>
   Our Darkest Days
  </em>
  will also be quite a change in gameplay style, switching to a side-scrolling perspective akin to something like
  <em>
   This War of Mine
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, the concept also sounds similar to that game, with
  <em>
   Our Darkest Days
  </em>
  revolving around a group of survivors who are looking to find and maintain shelter during a zombie apocalypse. With impressive visuals and a seemingly choice-driven gameplay loop,
  <em>
   Into the Dead
  </em>
  's next effort could be something special.

  While not exactly common, extraction shooters have picked up some steam in recent years, largely thanks to a handful of games that have managed to maintain communities. Fans of the genre craving a flesh-eating twist on the formula might wish to keep an eye on
  <em>
   The Midnight Walkers
  </em>
  , an
  <strong>
   upcoming zombie game
  </strong>
  that should support both solo and team play.
 </p>
 <p>
  Going by the available information, players will be dropped into a mega center that just happens to be overrun with zombies, and they need to search the area for supplies. Naturally, besides trying to avoid the zombies, players will have to be careful to avoid other scavengers who are trying to earn their riches.
  <em>
   The Midnight Walkers
  </em>
  will have multiple zombie types, weapon crafting, and hardcore difficulty.

  Hard to imagine that a game simply called
  <strong>
   <em>
    Projekt Z
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be released too soon, but this World War II zombie shooter has made quite the impression with its trailers. Not only does it provide a captivating atmosphere that infuses a bit of horror into the well-treaded genre setting, but visually the game offers beautiful lighting and textures.
 </p>
 <p>
  The developers are a fresh new German indie studio called 314 Arts comprised of nine total employees. It'll offer both single-player and online co-op zombie killing spectacles as players try to uncover Nazi secrets hidden on an occupied island.

  Now, here is an
  <strong>
   upcoming zombie game
  </strong>
  that could turn some heads, providing it is backed by quality. From the same developer responsible for the polarizing
  <em>
   Dying: Reborn
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Showa American Story
  </em>
  envisions a future where Japan and the United States have effectively fused, with the former buying out most of the latter. Honestly, this is a fascinating premise in its own right and could have made for an interesting experience without incorporating any other twists. However,
  <em>
   Showa American Story
  </em>
  goes the extra mile by introducing a post-apocalyptic element, along with a female protagonist who wakes up from the dead without any real knowledge about what has happened to the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Going by its description and available footage,
  <em>
   Showa American Story
  </em>
  seems to be a hack and slash RPG, with the combat system blending third-person shooting with fast-paced melee combat that seems reminiscent of something like
  <em>
   Onechanbara
  </em>
  . Nekcom is a fairly small company, so it is recommended to keep expectations relatively realistic.
  <em>
   Showa American Story
  </em>
  will likely aim to deliver a B-movie, along with maybe some
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  -esque humor. That is all well and good, and it should make for a fun and silly ride.

  Techland's
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  is well-established as one of the best open-world zombie franchises. While not getting glowing reviews, the original project blended action, parkour, and exploration in a sublime way that did not negatively impact its capacity for horror. Even all these years later,
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  holds up as an impressive sandbox that manages to be scary and constantly fun. The sequel,
  <em>
   Dying Light 2 Stay Human
  </em>
  was more of an action RPG with some horror elements than vice versa, which garnered a somewhat mixed reception from die-hard fans of its predecessor. Nevertheless, the positives outweigh the negatives, making it a worthwhile option for anyone craving a zombie romp.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dying Light: The Beast
  </em>
  appears to be a throwback to the 2015 entry's style and tone, including the return of Kyle Crane as the protagonist. Set in Castor Woods, the standalone adventure starts with Kyle escaping his imprisonment, setting him loose in an environment that has changed a lot over the last decade. More importantly, Kyle has some zombie DNA, which gives him unique abilities.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_64">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     The "Beast" in the title seems to refer to both Kyle and a monster roaming Castor Woods. At least, that appears to be the case based on the currently available information.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Beast
  </em>
  should have most of the staples associated with the franchise. During the day, players will be able to explore relatively freely (although not without risk); meanwhile, the night brings out the worst horrors found in Castor Woods. The game also supports 4-player co-op, which should be a fun alternative to a solo run.

  Be it party-based shooters or open-world survival projects, zombie games can threaten to blend into one, particularly high-profile releases. Fortunately,
  <em>
   Holstin
  </em>
  does not have that issue, and only a glance is required to notice the game's unique presentation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pixel graphics are heavily used by the indie scene, so
  <em>
   Holstin
  </em>
  turning to this art style hardly sets it apart from the crowd; however, the execution is ultimately all that matters. Sonka not only has put together some gorgeous isometric visuals, but the developer has also incorporated 3D support. Yes, players can swap between the two perspectives, changing from an all-encompassing viewpoint that is perfect for puzzles to a behind-the-shoulder camera for third-person shooting gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  The setting is fresh as well, with the story dropping players in a '90s Polish town that has fallen into dark times (literally and figuratively). Some residents have transformed into full-blown zombie-like monsters, while others seem to be in the process of losing their humanity.
  <em>
   Holstin
  </em>
  seems to incorporate classic touches from survival horror, be it scavenging, limited ammo, a vulnerable protagonist, and puzzles.

  Revealed in June 2023,
  <em>
   John Carpenter's Toxic Commando
  </em>
  introduced itself with a gloriously cheesy '80s trailer soundtracked by Bon Jovi. Set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with zombies,
  <em>
   Toxic Commando
  </em>
  looks set to be a co-op first-person shooter with a class system and a quirky sense of humor. Any horror project that carries John Carpenter's name comes with higher expectations, but this game at least left a positive first impression.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saber Interactive has an extensive resume that includes
  <em>
   World War Z
  </em>
  , another co-op zombie shooter that was received fairly well.
  <em>
   Toxic Commando
  </em>
  appears to retain that release's overwhelmingly massive hordes, which is the best part of that game; hopefully, the upcoming title fine-tunes and improves upon
  <em>
   World War Z
  </em>
  's ideas.

  Undead Labs feels like a game developer destined to deliver a truly remarkable zombie experience in the world of video games. Their first entry in the genre was a lower-budget arcade-style zombie survival game that won the hearts of players despite its many bugs and issues. Its sequel,
  <em>
   State of Decay 2
  </em>
  , took the series forward.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2020,
  <em>
   State of Decay 3
  </em>
  was revealed, and interviews with the studio suggest they're working on making this the zombie survival game they've felt they were capable of delivering. Now owned by Microsoft and overseen by Xbox Game Studios, it seems that the third installment in the
  <em>
   State of Decay
  </em>
  series could be the one that puts Undead Labs on the map in a major way.
 </p>
 <p>
  After spending a few years out of the limelight,
  <em>
   State of Decay 3
  </em>
  made its big return during 2024's Xbox Games Showcase, dropping a new trailer that hopefully suggests a release might not be that far away.

  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  is one of the greatest open-world RPGs of all time that needs no introduction. Geralt's adventures make for a great time as players explore massive zones, interact with colorful characters, and save Ciri by any means necessary.
 </p>
 <p>
  The emotional weight of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's narrative helped it stand out in the eyes of many, and this is something that fans of
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  are also familiar with. The narrative's emotional highs and saddening lows are executed perfectly and ensure that players will fall in love with Geralt and his pals by the time this epic adventure and its two incredible DLCs draw to a close.

  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  is one of the prettiest open-world games of all time.
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  fans loved to stop and smell the roses whenever they saw the many beautiful landscapes in this sandbox, and this applies to
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jin's quest to free Tsushima Island from the threat of the Mongols is something that fans will love, especially when they master the game's incredible melee combat. Thankfully,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  fans can also experiment with the game's diverse array of ranged options, even if this long-range combat doesn't feel as cinematic as
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's pulse-pounding shootouts.

 </p>
 <p>

  </em>
  that makes it one of the most riveting and cinematic video game experiences of all time, two adjectives that fans of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  are intimately familiar with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joel and Ellie's adventures make for an emotional affair, with the duo bonding over the course of their adventures. The third-person shooting and stealth gameplay is intense and feels great to this day, with the remake ensuring that the graphical fidelity of this title is off the charts.

  A huge part of what makes
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  so engaging is its focus on historical realism, which is something that is elicited in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  as well. This sequel is a massive improvement over its predecessor and comes packaged with compelling gameplay and a riveting story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who love
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  for its immersive qualities will love
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2

  for the same. Players must stay clean, keep Henry happy, and regain his combat skills to make him a force to be reckoned with in combat once again.

 <p>
  The easiest and simplest PS5 video game recommendation for fans of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is another game made by Rockstar. Fans weren't elated by the prospect of this game receiving a modern console release when
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  was languishing at 30 FPS on older consoles, but all these complaints will be thrown out of the window once they see how beautiful
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  looks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The beautiful graphics and excellent gameplay make shootouts feel tense and engaging in the same vein as
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  . While the narrative may lack the emotional depth of Arthur Morgan's adventures, the rest of the package is a perfect fit for fans of Rockstar's magnum opus. Getting hounded by the cops, having unique interactions with NPCs, and engaging in various side activities are just a few of the many things common between both games.

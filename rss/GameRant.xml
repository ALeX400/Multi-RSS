 <p>
  For players who want to buy a ticket, the Morpoeko Onesie Timed Research isn't a bad option. It gives players a guaranteed chance to get a few costumed Pokemon such as the White Haat Pikachu alongside some handy items. However, players will need to buy a ticket worth $5 to make the most of the available features here. On top of that, some places also need tickets which is very frustrating to handle especially when there are lots of players playing.

 <p>
  The "Costume Party" Timed Research allows players to catch some exclusive Halloween costumed Pokemon as part of the event. However, there is a catch. This is not free Timed Research, and players will need to buy a ticket for $2 to be able to take part in it. That being said, players will get a chance to catch these Pokemon for free during the second part of the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Halloween event, so it might not be that bad of an idea to skip getting this ticket.

  <strong>
   Real-time strategy
  </strong>
  games are beloved by many players worldwide. While these games are somewhat niche given how complex their combat mechanics are and how they demand players to lay out an attack plan before making their first move, it's undeniable that the genre is one of the pillars of modern gaming.

  There are many settings for real-time strategy games, which in turn means that players can encounter many different weapons during their playthroughs. And while commanding various units with smaller, yet efficient weapons is very fun, nothing matches the incredible feeling of turning a nuke on the enemy. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best real-time strategy games with nukes.

  Set several thousands of years into the future,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Total Annihilation
   </strong>
  </em>
  follows the story of the galactic war between the CORE empire, and the ARM Rebellion. With battles taking place on an interplanetary scale and various moons, this game never fails to provide players with a fun experience that requires a decent amount of planning and a strategic approach. Like other real-time strategy games, this title will put players in control of different units to decide who they want to attack, when, and how.

  features many different weapons, including the all-powerful Silencer, which is a level 3 special tower that attacks by launching nuclear missiles at the enemy. This weapon has a lot of potential for destruction and represents a considerable advantage for any players who get the chance to use it against their foes.

  As the name suggests, one of the key elements of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Rise of Nations
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the expansion of territory and the overall development of players' settlements. Within their territories and borders, players can construct buildings that can help them further advance as a civilization. The game starts in the Ancient Age, set roughly between 10,000-800 BCE and continues through the Classical, Medieval, Gunpowder, Enlightenment, Industrial, Modern, and Information Ages. Each Age has its own features, weapons and possibilities that players can explore as they progress through the game.

 <p>
  One of the main weapons of the Modern Age is the Nuclear Missile, which acts as the nuclear weapon of its time. While having so much power in their hands might be tempting, players must be very careful in how they use their nukes, as overusing them can result in Armageddon.

To win a game, players must focus on destroying enemy bases consistently until reaching the point of being considerably superior. It's also important to focus on protecting friendly bases, as failing to do so can result in defeat. There are many tactics players can take advantage of while playing the game, each requiring focus and strategic planning.

Fortunately, players can influence the weather with special items called Totems. Without them, it's quite difficult to progress in this

  . They can only be purchased in places where these items are located, which are often hidden locations. It is important to note that they are consumables, and after use, the Totems disappear. It is recommended that players buy several at once, so that you don't have to return for Totems every time you need them.

  Windset Totem Location

 <p>
  The Windset Totem is located on Snowcap Island in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  . It is one of the most hidden, since the path to it is not at all obvious.

 <p>
  Once you reach the island, move deeper until you get a long cave with leaves at the entrance. There, you will find a ladder leading to the ledge. After that, move further along the cave, walking along a narrow ledge until you reach a column. With its help, you will climb even higher. After walking a little further, you will find the Windset Totem.

  Unlike the previous Totem, Smokescreen is much easier to find. You just need to visit Mushgrove Island. On the outskirts of the island, near the large rocks, you will find the desired item.

 <h3 id="tempest-totem-location">
  Tempest Totem Location
 </h3>
 <p>
  To get to the Tempest Totem in
  <em>
   Fisch

  , go to Terrapin Island. When swimming to the pier, turn a little left to the rock. There, you will find a glow under the water and an entrance to the cave.

 <p>
  We strongly recommend swimming in a boat halfway to the rock. Otherwise, your character will not have enough breath to swim to the end of the cave. Once you've reached the cave, jump into the water and follow the blue lanterns placed along the cave. When you reach a secret cave, you will find the Tempest Totem next to a skeleton.

  Sundial Totem Location

 <p>
  The Sundial Totem is also in a cave but in another location: Sunstone Island. Once there, climb to the top using the ladder. Moving further, you will find several wooden boxes standing on top of each other. From this place, turn right, and you will find the entrance to the cave at the edge of the cliff. At its end, you can find the Sundial Totem and a fishing pond.

  Pocketpair recently talked about exploring ideas for expanding the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  IP. In the same interview, the developers of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  spoke about their vision for the game, such as continued support through updates, and addressed what players can expect in terms of new projects related to the title.

 <p>
  Less than a year ago, Pocketpair surprised the gaming world by bringing a monster-collecting, base-building survival game that players nicknamed “
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  with guns.” After all, while
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  players can catch monsters just like in Game Freak's franchise, it's possible to do more in the game, such as giving weapons to the Pals and putting them to work on a series of tasks. But while
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is one of this year's biggest releases, many players wonder what's next.

  In a recent interview with TheGamer at the Tokyo Game Show, the
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  development team said they are looking for ways to expand the title beyond the base game. They talked about the game having many possibilities, and while they didn't give specifics of these possibilities, they did confirm that they are very interested in the idea of adapting
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  's universe for anime, specifically. TheGamer also notes that the devs have used the line “each project's needs,” hinting that the game's universe is projected to be expanded into different genres.

  While planning to expand

  as a franchise and explore the IP's potential, the studio confirmed that there are currently no plans for a sequel to the game. Instead, the devs are fully focused on bringing new content updates to make the gameplay even more engaging. It's worth remembering that although there is no confirmed sequel, a mobile version of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is on the way, being produced by Krafton's PUBG Studios. Despite the good news, very little is known about the project, apart from the fact that it promises to deliver as faithful and original an adaptation as possible of the original game for mobile devices.

 <p>
  Even though Pocketpair hasn't said any more details about its plans to expand the
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  IP, the fact that the developers are looking at different ways to grow the game's universe should excite fans. After all,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  has a unique lore, and it's interesting enough not only to generate more content for the base game, but also to be adapted into other media, following in the successful footsteps of other franchises such as
  <em>

  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  .

      <title>Avowed Dev Reveals How Grimoires Work</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
  </strong>
  's classless RPG system is designed to allow players to experiment, and it's been obvious from early on that just about anything goes. Showcases of
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's combat, for example, have shown how players could dual-wield wands, use a gun and a wand, and possibly any imaginable combination. Grimoires can also be wielded in combat, combined with a wand, a sword, or whatever the player wants.

  Grimoires have been shown for
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  before, but many may be curious about how they work compared to a wand. When Game Rant sat down with
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  director Carrie Patel and art director Matt Hansen at the Xbox Games Showcase, we asked about these Grimoires, and it's clear they could go a long way in helping a player define their playstyle.

  In many ways,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's Grimoires work the way any
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  player would expect them to. The key difference is that Grimoires were locked to Wizards in
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  , while any
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  player could presumably use one thanks to its classless system. Grimoires grant players access to magic they couldn't utilize otherwise because there are a lot of powerful spells in
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  , such as the returning Fan of Flames. As Hansen explained, the Wizard skill tree does have some spells in it, but many may only be found in Grimoires. This goes a long way because players could invest in the Wizard tree and invest in the Grimoire for tons of spells. At the same time, someone could adopt a Battlemage playstyle by using a sword in one hand and the Grimoire in another. In Hansen's own words,
 </p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "There's this Wizard tree that you have, and that comes with some spells baked into it. There are a lot of spells, like in Pillars, where you can't acquire them unless you have a grimoire. And once you have a grimoire, it expands your options. If you want to be more of a battlemage, you don't want to focus too much on the Wizard tree, but you still want to be able to cast Fan of Flames or whatever, you can have your sword in one hand and the Grimoire in the other. You can use those interchangeably."

 <p>
  It remains to be seen how
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  adopts the "pen is mightier than the sword" mantra, but it's clear Grimoires add a lot of power to a player's build. The spell Hansen references, Fan of Flames, is an incredibly powerful AOE spell in
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  , with its drawback being how tricky it can be to use. How that translates to
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  exactly remains to be seen, but it seems powerful spells will be found throughout the Living Lands.

  No matter what,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's classless leveling system ensures players can invest in their character however they wish. If Grimoires are not their speed, then guns might just be, and of course, there's nothing wrong with a classic sword and shield character either. What matters is players can express themselves however they wish, and that'll go a long way come

  is an unusual success story after having floundered through an initially painful launch. All these years later, the game is on the verge of its Dawntrail expansion releasing, which will introduce players to a new region, new playable race, and two new jobs. It's likely that many new fans will be trying out the game for the first time, and this 10th Anniversary Edition may be a good pick for them.

  isn't just receiving a new expansion, but a major overhaul that's going to change the way the game looks and plays. The MMORPG is getting its first major graphical upgrade that will improve textures and lighting. In addition, a number of quality-of-life improvements are being made in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  , like making it easier to get back to a dungeon fight after losing. Players will also be able to blacklist others, which will stop the offending player from even being seen on the person's screen.

  While the developers have said that the female Hrothgar will be the last playable race to be added to the game, the title shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. The developer has already teased the idea of unique future jobs being added to
  <em>

  </em>
  . With tons of existing content and the promise of more in the future, first-time players have plenty to enjoy.

 <p>
  Synthoceps is utterly powerful in the right hands, and all players need to do to activate its perk is to be surrounded by enemies. With the right builds, players can punch their way through armies without a scratch. If punching isn’t their style, then they will also see a bonus to weapon handling and reload speed, allowing them to shoot their way out of a tight spot. Sadly, the recent nerf means that Biotic Enhancements doesn’t last as long as it did, but it’s still incredible.

 <p>
  Pyrogale Gauntlets are wonderful for enhancing the potential of Burning Maul. Burning Maul is one of the faster Supers that Titans can acquire, and the fact that this exotic will turn Burning Maul into a highly concentrated explosion of flame that is essentially the Titan version of Golden Gun for Hunters, makes it a must-have when it comes to boss DPS phases. The addition of cyclone of flames from Consecration is also great for those who enjoy more melee potential.

 <p>
  An Exotic introduced in The Final Shape, Wishful Ignorance brings perfect harmony to Strand, as it will enhance the abilities of Frenzied Blade and Flechette Storm. With Wishful Ignorance, players will have 4 total charges of Frenzied Blade, allowing for a flurry of death. Even better, each strike deals more damage, and the fact that melee energy will return when fighting alongside allies with Banner of War pulsing, makes for a grand choice when it comes to a Strand Titan build.

   Armor Perk: Firewalker – Solar final blows periodically grant you an escalating bonus to weapon damage, and Solar grenade final blows grant you the highest bonus. You are harder to slow or freeze with Stasis, and when you break out, you take no damage from doing so, creating a burst of Solar energy around yourself.

 <p>
  Path of Burning Steps is completely viable, especially with The Final Shape’s new enemy type, the Dread. The Dread loves to use Stasis, so countering them with Path of the Burning Steps is going to feel great, especially since being slowed and frozen is a near-death sentence. The escalating weapon damage increase from Solar final blows is also a nice touch, if not a little less than one would like, but still great in the long run.

  Titans are great at two things: punching everything that moves and blowing stuff up. With Hazardous Propulsion, they can see further advantages to the latter, where every kill and precision hit will grant Kinetic Exodus rockets. These rockets are fired by using the Titan class ability, and they deal a ton of damage to the targets they seek out. Even better still, is the enhancement to other rockets, whether that’s a rocket sidearm or a rocket launcher, players can essentially buff their damage potential just by throwing up a Barricade.

  Dunemarchers is perhaps the best Titan Exotic for PvP for its ability to allow players to sprint faster, but it’s also completely viable in PvE. If players want to move fast and become more agile as a walking tank, then Dunemarchers is for them, especially when running for a short while will build a static charge to melee-attack enemies that chains the damage forward, taking out armies of Thrall and lesser enemies in the process.

  Whilst Heart of Inmost Light has been nerfed in recent years, it’s still a completely viable Titan Exotic for endgame content. Players can easily throw down their Barricade, an ability rarely used by Titans when compared to Melee and Grenades, and become rewarded with enhanced versions of the other two abilities not used. These abilities will deal more damage and regenerate faster, allowing for a flurry of combat with the right builds.

  Lorely Splendor Helm is essentially an extra life, as it will grant a Sunspot at a player’s location when they are critically wounded, provided that they have a Barricade at the ready. Since Titans rarely use their Class Abilities, saving it to essentially receive a free spot of fast healing is going to be great for endgame activities, especially for the Titans out there that enjoy a solo flawless Dungeon. However, this Exotic Helmet requires players to be only in the Solar subclass.

  Swords are always a fun way to play in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , and with the recent Ergo Sum in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , players might want to give Exotic Swords a try. Enhanced completely thanks to Stronghold, players will see great advantages to their Sword gameplay, where they can block tons more damage without risk of injury, and plenty of restoration to heal them based on the damage blocked and the damage dealt to enemies in their path.

 <p>
  Thanks to the Kintsugi trait, players that wield Precious Scars will see great advantages to their damage and their aiding of allies. The fact that players can create bursts of healing with every kill for both them and allies, as well as receive an overshield for a revive or being revived, makes this a great Exotic Helmet for endgame content, where enemies are thrust upon Guardians from every angle. The only thing that might make players reconsider Precious Stars is the fact that to activate, players need final blows from a weapon that matches their Super, meaning a Solar Titan must use a Solar weapon to see restoration granted.

      <title>Ryu and Other Shotokans in Street Fighter, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Street Fighter
   </strong>
  </em>
  series is seminal to the fighting game as it is known today. Many tropes, mechanics, and various other aspects that enjoy wide usage today originate in
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Street Fighter 2.
  </em>
  But sometimes certain tropes feel most utilized within the game itself. One such example is the "shotokan" or "shoto" characters. Rooted in the incorrect naming of the ansatsuken (the assassin's fist, eventually confirmed to be the actual name of the fighting style) that Capcom USA provided, it has since been used as a term for well-rounded characters and remains a popular archetype.

 <p>
  It's hard for something to become influential without at least a few people riding coattails. In-universe and out, Dan Hibiki serves as a perfect example of this.
  <strong>
   Conceived as a parody of
   <em>
    Art of Fighting's
   </em>
   Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia
  </strong>
  (who seem more than a little influenced by Ryu and Ken), it's hard to become more of a joke shoto than Dan. He debuted as a secret character in
  <em>
   Street Fighter Alpha: Warrior's Dreams,
  </em>
  later being given an oddly tragic backstory in its sequel, involving his father being killed by Sagat.

 <p>
  Once a student of Gouken, Ryu and Ken's master,
  <strong>
   Dan was rejected by his peace-loving teacher for seeking to use his training for revenge
  </strong>
  . Making use of what little he knew of the ansatsuken, Dan retooled these skills to become the ironically named Saikyo-ryu style. Dan's moves tend to be either re-iterations of the typical shoto fare stemming either from
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Art of Fighting
  </em>
  . A lot of his moves are also mere taunts, as a show of his expressive and flashy nature.

 <p>
  In spite of his lack of talent, Dan, like many a shoto, is a fairly visible character, even in spin-off games. Most notably, he is something of a staple in Capcom's crossovers with SNK (the company that created
  <em>
   Art of Fighting
  </em>
  ) and tends to have special interactions when he engages in battle with Ryo. It is worth noting that, despite his continual humiliation, Dan has some level of skill as a fighter. Most of his opponents in the
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  series are just out of his league.

  Ken's student, Sean is conceivably similar to Dan. This is a fact referenced in multiple games in the
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  trilogy as a source of irritation for him.
  <strong>
   Like Dan, Sean's "shoto" techniques are weaker offshoots, in this case, attempting to copy Ken.
  </strong>
  Unlike Dan, however, Sean is less of an outright joke.

 <p>
  He is still fairly weak as a fighter, albeit capable of pulling off moves similar to Ken's, most often in his super arts. That said, his training is shown to be insufficient, with the skill gap between him and his counterparts emphasized in his endings throughout the
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  trilogy. Sean's appearances are fairly limited outside the trilogy.

  Most recently, he appeared as a lore character in
  <em>
   Street Fighter 5
  </em>
  , where his older sister Laura is playable instead. However, his appearance in
  <em>
   5
  </em>
  confirms he has gotten stronger. Notably, Laura's confirmed canon ending in the
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  segment of the
  <em>
  </em>
  arcade mode,
  <strong>
   shows Sean winning a tournament. This was something he previously failed to do in his ending in
   <em>
    Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike

   .

  <strong>
   A massive fan of Ryu, Sakura often fights with the goal of meeting and learning directly from her idol.
  </strong>
  Although she has yet to achieve this goal, she nonetheless has Ryu's respect for her efforts. Despite several preoccupations, including schooling and her part-time gig as an arcade manager, Sakura still isn't half bad as a fighter. She first appeared in
  <em>
   Street Fighter Alpha 2,
  </em>
  notably
  <em>
  </em>
  forming a friendship with her fellow shoto, Dan.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1093} -->

 <p>
  Her attacks tend to be relatively unorthodox. Examples include her hadokens, which tend to have much less range than Ryu and Ken's, as well as her shouoken, a shoryuken that emphasizes running. Unlike Sean and Dan,
  <strong>
   Sakura has never been treated as a joke
  </strong>
  , and can actually be an extremely difficult opponent if given the opportunity to pull off a combo. Even so, her current skill level is far from the peak of a shotokan.

  When it comes to shoto, Ken is definitely one of the stronger ones in the series.
  <strong>
   He debuted with Ryu in the original
   <em>
    Street Fighter
   </em>
   , with the pair remaining the only consistent fixtures on the roster throughout the mainline games.
  </strong>
  He was trained by Gouken alongside Ryu and managed to both learn and modify his own ansatsuken techniques. Among his modifications is the fiery shinryuken, a shoryuken that lands multiple hits on an opponent.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1110} -->

 <p>
  Similar to Sakura, Ken's life tends to get in the way of his fighting. In addition to running the family business, he also wishes to look after his family. However, his own continued dedication to the craft makes him a highly skilled fighter, rivaling and at times even defeating his lifelong friend, Ryu. That said,
  <strong>
   Ryu is often hinted at being the superior fighter, primarily because he's more focused on his training.

  A fairly interesting shoto, Evil Ryu and Kage both exist as a manifestation of the darkness within Ryu.
  <strong>
   The pair are extensions of the Satsui No Hado, a dark energy present in martial arts studied with the intent of killing,
  </strong>
  such as the ansatsuken. Most of their techniques are comparable to Ryu's, although much more in the vein of Akuma.

  Evil Ryu is a non-canonical character, first appearing in
  <em>
   Street Fighter Alpha 2
  </em>
  , showing what would happen if Ryu were to succumb to the Satsui No Hado. Kage on the other hand is a canon character, appearing in
  <em>
   Street Fighter 5
  </em>
  , who is instead a literal manifestation of Ryu's Satsui No Hado, born from him rejecting it. Its strength is presumably comparable to Ryu's,
  <strong>
   but due to his conscious decision not to let it control him, it is clearly weaker than Ryu.
  </strong>

  Ryu is the embodiment of a beginner-friendly shotokan.
  <strong>
   His iconic moves are very easy to execute and powerful to boot.
  </strong>
  This leads him to be categorized by certain players as "boring, but practical." But this in no way makes him a slouch when it comes to a fight. He is capable of holding his own against some of the strongest antagonists in the series, including the likes of M. Bison and Akuma.

 <p>
  Ryu is much more single-minded in his approach to fighting and training than Ken, structuring his life around them. He is considered a very strong fighter, even beating out his own dark half.
  <strong>
   However, he maintains the belief that he has yet to reach his maximum potential as a fighter.

 <p>
  Gouken is Ryu's foster father, who trained both him and Ken in the ansatsuken fighting style. However, due to their own time and effort spent cultivating the technique, Gouken currently views the pair as rivals rather than students. Fans believe him to be based on the initially nonexistent Sheng Long mentioned in Ryu's win quote in
  <em>
   Street Fighter 2
  </em>
  .
  <strong>
   He was presumed dead after a fight with his younger brother, Akuma, but resurfaced in
   <em>
    Street Fighter 4
   </em>
   , both as a hidden boss and playable character.
  </strong>

 <p>
  Well into his old age, he nonetheless maintains his muscular build and physical strength. He is generally able to hold his own against most of the very same fighters Ryu has. However, he is shown to be a cut above.
  <strong>
   This is in part due to his re-invention of the ansatsuken, which focused far more on his own philosophy of self-defense
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Even so, he can still be a brutally devastating opponent, with his powerful shin shoryuken being able to remove a significant chunk of an opponent's health. He is also one of the few shoto to have a powerful unplayable form, appearing as a secret boss with stronger moves in
  <em>
   Street Fighter 4
  </em>
  . His expertise is also communicated in refining techniques in
  <em>
   Street Fighter 4
  </em>
  that Ryu wouldn't come to learn until later in the series (chronologically speaking), such as his chargeable denjin hadoken.

  <strong>
   Perhaps the most definitively powerful shotokan in
   <em>
    Street Fighter
   </em>
   overall,
  </strong>
  Akuma is, true to his name, an absolutely monstrous opponent. Initially, the first-ever secret boss in the series, appearing in
  <em>
   Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo
  </em>
  , Akuma continued to exist throughout the series largely in the same capacity. Unlike the majority of shotokan fighters who either reject or don't tap into the Satsui No Hado, Akuma embraces it. He seeks to use his power to fight opponents he deems worthy of killing, like Goutetsu and Gouken—even those who fail to impress him, like Ryu and Kage.

 <p>
  <strong>
   What speaks volumes about his strength is that his strongest version cannot be played.
  </strong>
  The player-controlled version of Akuma holds back against most opponents, using weaker attacks and less stamina, so each fight is more exciting for him. Even in this limited capacity, he still remains a monster with numerous offensive attacks to control the ground and the air. In addition to modifications of standard shoto attacks, his signature move, the raging demon, is capable of almost singlehandedly ending a fight.

 <p>
  His "final form", Shin Akuma, is even more powerful. He becomes a much faster foe, with far less time needed to recover in between moves. It is implied that even this version of Akuma does not possess his full savagery, with
  <em>
   Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition
  </em>
  introducing a possible future version of Akuma that loses his remaining humanity to the Satsui No Hado, becoming the frightening Oni, who also has a stronger secret boss counterpart. The extent to which his ability is communicated, as well as the fact that few seem worthy of even facing him, let alone defeating him at his peak, proves that Akuma is the strongest shotokan in
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  .

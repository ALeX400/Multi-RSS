  A challenge in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Modern Warfare 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  requires players to get Tactical Stance kills. However, the task doesn’t come with instructions, which has baffled some players. They wonder what a Tac-Stance is and how it can be used to kill enemies. This quick
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  guide clarifies everything about the challenge and offers tips for
  <strong>
   landing Tactical Stance kills
  </strong>
  with ease.

 <p>
  Also known as tac-stance, the tactical stance is a shooting mode in
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  . When toggled on, the player holds the gun tilted to one side, firing without aiming down the sight. Similar to hip fire mode, shots in the tactical stance are less accurate compared to aiming down sights (ADS). However, this mode is advantageous in close-quarter battles (CQB), where quick reactions are more important than precision.

  Tactical kills are achieved by
  <strong>
   shooting down enemies in the side-grip mode
  </strong>
  . First, toggle on the Tac-Stance by pressing down on the D-pad while aiming. (It’s ADS + V on PC.) Next, assassinate enemies while the weapon is tipped on its side.

  Attachment-wise, any component that would increase accuracy and Tac Stance Spread is a must.
  <strong>
   Suppressors, short barrels, and visible lasers
  </strong>
  are excellent for maximum Tactical Stance kills.

  For the equipment, Infantry is the ideal vest. Tracker gear like the Backlight Flashlight is handy. In addition to that, tactical items such as Stun Grenades are a must—as they facilitate hipfire kills by slowing down the enemy.

     Since the Tac-Stance ditches ADS, leave the Optic’s slot empty. Give its spot to a stability-inducing attachment. An underbarrel, stock, or rear grip would be a better replacement.

  Hardcore modes with dense maps are optimal for getting Tac-Stance kills. Enemies in these modes have fewer HPs and are easier to locate, making it feasible to land hipfire and no-crosshair shots.
  <strong>
   Free For All, Kill Confirm, and Domination

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Turn the Center Dot on
   </strong>
   . Go to the Interface Settings and toggle the Center Dot on for your Crosshair. This will show a large dot in the middle of the screen replacing your ironsight in the tac-stance mode.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Reduce Tactical Stance Spread
   </strong>
   . When building your weapon, aim to pick attachments that minimize tac-stance spread. This will maximize your accuracy while shooting with your gun tilted to the side.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Hunt the enemy down
   </strong>
   . A “track &amp; assassinate” strategy is ideal. Spot the enemy in advance and approach them poised to attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Exploit tactical equipment
   </strong>
   . Stun Grenades, Flash Bangs, and Dead Silence Field Upgrade can maximize Tac-Stance kills. (They neutralize the enemy and expose their position.)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Slow down before shooting
   </strong>
   . The tac-Stance cuts accuracy. Stabilize before engagement for less gunkick.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Just like with almost every game these days, Traveller's Tales' LEGO franchise has seen a plethora of DLC packs over the years. Games like
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   LEGO DC Super-Villains
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   LEGO Jurassic World
  </em>
  were all expanded upon considerably with character-based packs. But, while that has been fun to see, these DLCs could be so much more. Specifically, they need to resemble the days of
  <strong>
   <em>
    LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham
   </em>
  </strong>
  once more.
 </p>

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham
  </em>
  was not the first LEGO game to get DLC, it was the first to take it beyond simply expanding the character roster. Alongside these new characters, the game also introduced brand-new levels for players to explore. They may not have been the most advanced of levels, but their inclusion made these DLCs feel far more worth it. So, if Traveller's Tales wants to continue down this post-launch content route, then it needs to really consider bringing those fun additions back.

  LEGO Batman 3 Had the Perfect Approach to DLC
 </h3>
 <p>
  Released in 2014,
  <em>
   LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham
  </em>
  took the DC LEGO games to new heights by whisking players away on an intergalactic adventure. It may not have matched the quality of its predecessors, but that blend made for something that felt truly unique. Instead of leaving it behind for the next LEGO adventure, Traveller's Tales would end up expanding upon it with numerous DLC packs themed after current and past DC projects.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":675} -->

 <p>
  These DLC packs would expand
  <em>
   LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham
  </em>
  's character roster with over 40 new characters. Additionally, some of these packs would include new levels to go alongside the new playable heroes. Players could fight their way through a climactic chase from
  <em>
   The Dark Knight
  </em>
  , they could experience Oliver Queen's desperate fight for survival in
  <em>
   Arrow
  </em>
  , and even explore new levels based around
  <em>
   The Suicide Squad
  </em>
  and Bizarro. All of these not only gave players more levels to conquer, but also served as a great way to introduce these brand-new characters.

 <p>
  This DLC model would continue in
  <em>
   LEGO Marvel's Avengers
  </em>
  , with levels based on various MCU films that were coming out around that time. Along with that,
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   LEGO DC Super-Villains,
  </em>
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  <em>
   LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2
  </em>
  would also receive level packs. But, outside of that, the majority of other LEGO games simply got character packs or no DLC at all.

 <h3 id="future-lego-games-need-to-offer-more-substantial-post-launch-content">
  Future LEGO Games Need to Offer More Substantial Post-Launch Content
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga
  </em>
  has gotten the most DLC packs so far, yet none of them include any levels. Additionally, many of the packs have garnered criticism from the fanbase as many of the characters are not even voiced or that unique enough to warrant a whole pack. While it may be fun for diehard fans to play with them, this approach to DLC leaves much to be desired.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":206} -->
 <p>
  However, it does not have to be this way. If Traveller's Tales continued to follow the model it started with
  <em>
   LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham
  </em>
  , then these DLC packs could feel worth it. Letting players play as characters from shows like
  <em>
   The Bad Batch
  </em>
  is fun, but if there was also a level highlighting a pivotal moment from that show, then the entire pack would be improved tenfold.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  There is no news on when Traveller's Tales' next LEGO adventure will be released, nor has the topic been revealed yet. But, when it does finally release, it really needs to make that post-launch content feel worth it. And if the rumors of it being a
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  game are true, then there is seemingly infinite potential for this type of content. So, hopefully, the studio ends up delivering.

 <p>
  With shiny hunting and shiny hunters making up a sizeable portion of the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fanbase, several content creators in the fandom often host themed shiny hunting events as a way to interact and somewhat unify the community every so often. This summer, running from August 2nd to the 11th, the Fossil Week event, hosted by content creators Tales of Taylor and Kwikpanik, focuses entirely on hunting one of the smallest Pokemon groups - fossil Pokemon.

 <p>
  Since fossil Pokemon have been around since
  <em>
   Red and Blue
  </em>
  and feature in
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , there are plenty of ways to go about hunting these prehistoric monsters. And unlike the similar past paradox Pokemon, there are far more options than roaming around the overworld. From the most involved to the simplest, the options for shiny hunting any kind of fossil Pokemon are obvious.

  While fossil Pokemon rarely appear in the wild, given their whole gimmick and theme, it is entirely possible to shiny hunt almost all fossil Pokemon in the overworld. In both
  <em>
   Sword and Shield
  </em>
  's Crown Tundra and
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  's Blueberry Terrarium, players can find fossil Pokemon roaming around freely.

  Although the Galar mismatched fossils aren't included in this, players are able to find practically every fossil walking around the overworld between the four games.
  <em>

  's chaining system and
  <em>

  's sandwiches may speed up the process of finding an off-colored, formerly extinct Pokemon, but isn't even close to being an efficient process.

 <p>
  One of the main mechanics of
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus'
  </em>
  maps, the occasional space-time distortions offer players chances to catch Pokemon completely out of time, including Sinnoh's two fossil lines. Certainly one of the most involved processes for shiny hunting given the inherent timer associated with the space-time distortions, and the often limited return for these events, the notable benefit to shiny hunting with these distortions is the chance for a shiny Alpha, or ShAlpha, fossil.

 <p>
  While the Alpha trait is hard enough to guarantee a shiny through the distortions, the chance of having a gigantic, red-eyed, and red-crowned Rampardos in a shiny collection is a hard offer to pass up. The chance at a ShAlpha fossil, whether Shieldon or Cranidos, is too good for shiny hunters to ignore.

 <p>
  With only two fossil Pokemon in
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , and with the usual option for reviving these prehistoric Pokemon not existing, the option for Cranidos and Shieldon to appear in mass outbreaks is a wonderful bonus compared to previous entries. Featuring effectively infinite chances at finding a shiny Pokemon, and with the ability to combine with the shiny-boosting powers of sandwiches, outbreaks are easily one of the fastest options for finding shiny fossils.

 <p>
  Since only two fossils can be found this way, it isn't quite as useful for players wanting to hunt something beyond the Sinnoh fossils. For players that want Shieldon and Cranidos or otherwise don't care, this is potentially the best method once the appropriate outbreak has been found.

 <p>
  Depending on the game and the hardware used, reviving fossils at a given location and soft resetting when a shiny doesn't appear is probably the fastest possible way to find a shiny fossil of any kind. For players with access to a 3DS, cycling through hundreds of revived Pokemon is a breeze, no matter what game they use, so long as they have enough fossils for their given hunt. For players on the Switch, the Sinnoh Grand Underground is just the place to search.

 <p>
  While certain games work best when resetting with five fossils and games such as
  <em>
   XY
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Let's Go
  </em>
  work wonderfully with as many fossils as possible, all players have to do is find enough of their chosen Pokemon's fossil item and save right before reviving. After that, it's often a mindless and exceedingly simple process of checking either the team summary or PC for the rare find. Since this is the intended way of obtaining fossil Pokemon in general, shiny or otherwise, it is usually the go-to for shiny hunting the fossils, as it fits the theme perfectly and appeals to the general aesthetic of these extinct Pokemon.

 <p>
  Often the defacto option for shiny hunting given the ease, guaranteed capture, and increased odds, the Masuda method is still one of the best options for trying to find a shiny fossil Pokemon. Possible with every single fossil Pokemon except Dracovish, Arctovish, Dracozolt, and Arctozolt, it's also one of the most convenient choices as well.

 <p>
  Since this works across practically every Pokemon game, especially games post generation five for increased shiny odds and most notably in
  <em>
   Sword and Shield
  </em>
  , and it only requires the revived fossil Pokemon and a Ditto, it's very accessible for even the newest player. While not exactly as engaging as other choices, it is a tried and true method, and now that fossils can be in other Poke Balls beyond the classic, it's even better.

  There are many people around who are very eager to label EA as one of the worst gaming companies of all time, but the truth is that this organization has tried its hardest to turn its image around after becoming the punching bag of the gaming industry. Their renewed focus on single-player games while trying to rework how they integrate microtransactions has done a great job of letting players appreciate them instead of calling them out time and time again.

   Electronic Arts is a company that gamers know all about. This AAA publisher owns some of the most profitable sports video game franchises of all time and houses certain studios that have made huge waves in the gaming landscape. While not all of their games have been absolute hits and the company is known for pursuing profits instead of making creative games, that's not to say that games with the Electronic Arts label are completely devoid of quality. Some of the
   <strong>
    best EA games
   </strong>
   are beloved by the masses and should be played by fans of the respective genres. These good-quality video games will capture their attention for hours with no problem.

  's launch was rough, with a wealth of bugs marring what should've been a fun experience. Thankfully, Respawn wasted no time in ironing out the kinks, letting players enjoy an incredible video game that is arguably one of the finest single-player

  Cal Kestis is a compelling protagonist who ends up playing a major role without being too grating in the process.
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  continues the story of this hero, and it's a shame that the launch of this title somehow managed to be even more broken than its predecessor.

  Most people would just dismiss the
  <em>
   FIFA
  </em>
  series and comment on the fact that every title is pretty much interchangeable when it comes to the gameplay. While this is true to an extent, there's no denying that the polished gameplay of this annual sports video game series makes the act of controlling one's favorite soccer team to score goals a highly engaging one.

  <em>
   FIFA 12
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   15
  </em>
  are considered by many to be two of the best games in the long-running series, with the latter edging out the former because of how fun its gameplay felt. Later titles have tried to make some changes to the gameplay with varying degrees of success, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    FIFA 15
   </em>
  </strong>
  continues to stand strong as one of the greatest sports games that deserves all the time in the spotlight, and then some.

  attempted to make the franchise appeal to a broader market. Forming an Inquisition and saving the world from Corypheus' malevolence is a blast, especially with the many things players can do along the way.

  The idea of separating the story into DLCs was maligned by many, but
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  has slowly garnered a positive reputation over time. It's easy to see why players are hotly anticipating the release of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , even if the reveal of this game worried many. Fans will be replaying this game right now to keep their memory fresh when it comes to the series' impressive lore.

  The acquisition of BioWare by EA allowed the studio to flex a big budget in their game like never before. After being hailed as the king of the CRPG genre, the company moved to a more mainstream action-focused title with the advent of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: Origins
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

  The experiment was a massive success, with the varying origins of the player character, a rich fantasy world, and some great storytelling turning

  into one of the most beloved Western RPGs of all time. To this day, fans still consider this game to be the best title in the series, and understandably so.

  Most people consider
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  to be the best game in this popular life simulation series, with the inclusion of a seamless open world and new mechanics being seen as groundbreaking by many. While this game could be rather demanding for PCs at the time, it didn't take long before post-launch support for this game stabilized the experience.

  This, coupled with the wealth of new content that was added, made
  <em>
   The Sims 3
  </em>
  one of the best video games ever made. The reason why so many people continue to be disappointed by
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  is because it was a step down from its predecessor in many ways, and fans can only hope that
  <em>
   The Sims 5
  </em>
  doesn't repeat the same mistakes.

  After working on
  <em>
   A Way Out
  </em>
  , Josef Fares went all out in the development of a co-op story-driven game that ended up being one of the best titles that fans can get their hands on.
  <strong>
   <em>
    It Takes Two
   </em>
  </strong>
  focuses on the story of Cody and May, two people in a strained marriage and on the verge of getting a divorce when their child, Rose, wishes for a way to make them see past their differences.

  This turns them into two dolls who have to go through a wide range of challenges that switch up the gameplay in fresh and engaging ways.
  <em>
   It Takes Two

  was lauded for its incredible gameplay, even if the narrative was a bit too cliched and uninteresting for most people, who considered it to be the weakest part of the experience.

  It's a shame that no new title in the
  <em>
   Burnout
  </em>
  series has arrived after all this time, with a remaster of
  <em>
   Burnout Paradise
  </em>
  being the only thing that fans have enjoyed recently. It's a shame that this franchise has remained dormant for so long, but the fact that fans were reminded of the excellence present in
  <strong>
   <em>

   </em>
  </strong>
  was a nice treat nevertheless.

  The game is arcade racing at its best, allowing players to take out other races in the most ostentatious manner possible. It's impossible to start up a session and get bored of
  <em>
   Burnout Paradise
  </em>
  because of the sheer carnage that can arise from its scintillating racing gameplay.

  The fact that one of the greatest survival horror games ever made was greenlit by EA is a testament to the studio's penchant to put their eggs in riskier baskets from time to time. Visceral Games developed one of the most atmospheric and entertaining horror titles, with
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  's claustrophobic atmosphere and immersive design making it one of the
  <strong>
   best EA games
  </strong>
  in the eyes of many.

  Isaac Clarke's grisly adventures aboard the USG Ishimura make for a captivating time, with players having to deal with necromorphs and other grisly enemies in a game packed with gore and disturbing moments. A huge part of the storyline involves Isaac's hunt for her girlfriend only to find out that the Marker was causing him to hallucinate whenever he thought he was speaking to Nicole.

  Live-service games have attained somewhat of a poor reputation in the industry, with many players feeling like these games are nothing more than elaborate schemes to eat through as much of a player's funds as possible. Regardless of how true this statement may be, there's no denying that some live-service titles have extremely fun gameplay loops, with
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  being a great example of the same.

  The movement mechanics in this game are truly impressive and are the best part of the experience by a country mile. While there are some pay-to-win mechanics in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Apex Legends
   </em>
  </strong>
  , they aren't anywhere near as egregious as most people would expect from a free-to-play title.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Titanfall 2

  </strong>
  is one of the most underrated sequels in gaming history. Not only did it address all the problems of the first game and improve the groundbreaking traversal system, but it also features a single-player campaign that is entertaining and emotional at the same time.

  It's saddening that this game didn't match EA's sales expectations, which led to the cancellation of
  <em>
   Titanfall 3
  </em>
  with EA putting all their resources into developing
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  instead. This bargain may have worked for EA, but it came at the cost of a sequel that had the potential to be one of the greatest FPS games ever made if its predecessor was anything to go by.

  The first game in the
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  series made for a great immersive time as players took on the role of Isaac Clarke and explored the desolate halls of the USG Ishimura. When
  <em>
   Dead Space 2
  </em>
  rolled out, fans were pleasantly surprised to see how far things were pushed in this amazing game.

  There was a greater focus on action over horror, but that did nothing to take away from
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  's amazing atmosphere in the slightest. The game had the power to terrify the player in each combat encounter, and it helped that everything from the story to the presentation was a step up from the first game.

  There's no denying that Maxis had settled on a winning formula with the advent of
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  . However, the game was still rough around the edges and needed some polishing before this life sim could become even more popular. With their publisher's guidance, the sequel to this title ended up being one of the
  <strong>

  blew everyone's minds when it launched, with the graphics of this title being so advanced that even high-end rigs at the time had a problem running this game.

  Controlling Nomad and using his nanosuit to take out hostile soldiers makes for a great time, with players accessing their power fantasies as they become invisible and use the enhanced power of their nanosuit to grab hapless soldiers and fling them around like ragdolls. Players who managed to run

  When
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  came out, many people were glad to see BioWare make a return to the sci-fi genre with an epic tale that players absolutely loved. The first game may have some gameplay quirks that are hard to ignore now, but the
  <em>
   Legendary Edition
  </em>
  takes care of this gripe and lets players have way more fun with the gameplay of the first
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Commander Shepard's companions are quite interesting, and the player character themself can form a personality of their own, even if it may be a bit too binary for most people's tastes. Still, the slow burn of this narrative sets the stage for an epic tale that spans two more games and is an incredible ride in every way.

  The first
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  title was a valiant foray into the sci-fi genre by BioWare, with the result being appreciated by many despite the combat feeling rather static at times. Well, not only does the sequel improve upon the first game's gameplay in every way, but it also enhances the quality of the storytelling significantly.

  To this day, the narrative and characters of
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  continue to hold a special place in the hearts of fans. The suicide mission is easily one of the best ending sequences in any video game ever. This is precisely what makes the conclusion of the final title in the trilogy such a disappointing one.

  To close out a busy July,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </em>
  </strong>
  has launched Patch 7.05, bringing with it a new treasure dungeon, the first Savage tier of The Arcadion raid series, and several Job changes across the board. The latest
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>

 <p>
  The new
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  update arrives shortly after the launch of The Arcadion raid series in Patch 7.01, introducing the AAC Light-Heavyweight Tier for level 100 players to test their skills. Players who complete the raids once per week will earn tokens that can be exchanged for corresponding armor pieces and accessories based on a player's chosen Job and role. The 7.01 update also implemented changes to a handful of Jobs, with Monk in particular receiving the most attention from the developers. In response to player feedback, the Monk's Beast Chakra gauge was updated, and several core skills were adjusted to reflect this change.

  Two weeks after the release of Patch 7.01, Square Enix has released another content update for players to enjoy. According to a Lodestone post,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  Patch 7.05 brings a new Treasure Dungeon called Cenote Ja Ja Gural, located in the ruins of the Yak T'el region. Similar to
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  's Excite-A-Tron 6000 map dungeon, Cenote Ja Ja Gural is best done with a full party of eight players and requires Timeworn Br'aaxskin Maps to access. Patch 7.05 also brought the AAC Light-Heavyweight Tier (Savage) raid series, which includes four grueling boss fights. The new Savage raid tier is the first in over a year, following the Pandaemonium: Anabaseios (Savage) series released during
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  's Patch 6.4.

  As for Job changes,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's 7.05 update buffs many Jobs across the board. Several Jobs, including Paladin, Machinist, Ninja, and Dark Knight saw some adjustments to their main skills to bring them in line with other Jobs in their respective roles. The Samurai saw a major change to Tsubame-gaeshi, which will see it used more often. However, the change resulted in some nerfs to other Samurai skills. In a continuation of its 7.01 changes, Black Mage saw further adjustments to Umbral Soul and spells such as Fire IV, Paradox, and Flare. The Viper saw more changes this time around, as its Noxious Gnash debuff was removed and several skills were adjusted to compensate.

 <p>
  Between the new 7.05 update and an upcoming appearance at Gamescom,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's summer schedule remains a busy one. With future
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  patches still to come, it remains to be seen how Jobs will continue changing to keep up with player feedback.

  Known Issues

 <ul>
  <li>
   An issue when undertaking the healer role quest "Taste of a Toxin Paradise" wherein using Esuna on the NPC Laugh-weary Lalafell before the NPC Befuddled Bather prevents the subsequent cutscene from triggering, thereby preventing players from progressing through the quest. * In the event you encounter this issue, please log out of the game and log back in, and ensure you use Esuna on the NPC Befuddled Bather before using it on the NPC Laugh-weary Lalafell.
  </li>
  <li>
   An issue with AAC Light-heavyweight M1 and AAC Light-heavyweight M1 (Savage) wherein, under certain conditions, players do not immediately fall when the portion of floor beneath them was destroyed. * This issue was discovered shortly before the release of the patch. We are currently examining whether a server-side solution is feasible, and plan to implement a fix as quickly as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience caused, and ask that players refrain from strategically exploiting this issue while we work to resolve it.
  </li>
  <li>
   An issue wherein Quetzalli Bracelets of Casting erroneously appear as Quetzalli Bracelets of Healing. * Due to this issue, two items are listed as Augmented Quetzalli Bracelets of Healing when speaking with Theone in Solution Nine (X:8.5 Y:13.6). Please note that the first of the two items are Augmented Quetzalli Bracelets of Casting, and the required jobs are listed correctly when viewing their item descriptions.

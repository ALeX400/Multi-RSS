  In many online games, a lot of players love to stand in the back behind the tankier builds. These players can act as support characters, or as ranged DPS.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Throne And Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  lets players select two weapons to swap between, and this will dictate the class they use. Players without any ranged weapons will be at risk of being taken out of fights after taking little damage, so melee DPS players are going to need some tricks up their sleeves to stay alive.

 <p>
  Deciding the type of DPS a player will be can be a rather daunting choice, with some classes in
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  being far more challenging to master than others. It doesn’t matter what tier a class is in if the player cannot make use of its Skill rotations and optimal damage output. Here are some of the best DPS classes in the game, as well as how difficult they are to play effectively.

 <p>
  This build takes a while to come into its own, and players may not find it very good early on. It makes use of three of the game’s stats, and players will need the right gear to help round up all these numbers. Players will not have a lot of mobility as a Liberator, and will be sitting ducks while dishing out their damage.

 <p>
  These might sound like a lot of negatives, but the end result is a build that can pour reliable, effective damage onto a single target from a distance. Since players will have access to the Longbow, they can heal up any damage they take. They can also top up their mana when they need to finish off tankier targets.

 <p>
  Infiltrators are a brilliant choice for a ranged DPS player. Swapping out the Crossbow for the Daggers means players have a massive boost to their survivability. They will still be glassy, but will now have the mobility to constantly be on the move. They can even exchange some of their life to get their hands on some emergency mana thanks to the longbow.

 <p>
  This build is easy to play, can heal itself up after escaping a bad situation, and can deal out massive amounts of damage in short bursts before going back on the move. Daggers have always been one of the best PvP weapons in the game, and their synergy with longbows makes the Infiltrator a fun class to try out.

 <p>
  This melee DPS build will be at risk of taking damage, and to make matters worse, it is quite glassy. While this class gets the most from Dexterity, players will want to dip into Strength if they feel they need to increase their survivability. Players will want to master using skills that can help them escape danger.

 <p>
  Once this survivability learning curve is out of the way, players will see some high damage numbers whenever they dive into their targets. The Ravager will be able to deal out large burst damage numbers before escaping, or they can deal consistent damage while their targets are crowd-controlled. Players will want to use gear that lets them have access to a large pool of mana so they can get in and out of combat reliably.

  When it comes to the best
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  DPS builds, players need to consider how easily they can rotate between skills. Scout is an easy build that will let players reliably deal continuous damage against targets. Players will not have much mobility, so they will need to constantly be aware of their surroundings, and where their opponents are.

 <p>
  Most DPS builds will have a large focus on the Dexterity stat, so players can't go wrong putting points into it. Once in position, the Scout will stand in place and rain down massive damage before relocating. Players will not want to stay in one place or be predictable, as this is a glassy build that cannot afford to be targeted by opponents.

  The best DPS builds in
  <em>
   Throne And Liberty
  </em>
  will involve either the Dagger or the Crossbow. The Scorpion makes use of both — and is arguably the best DPS class in the game. However, they are not the best DPS class for every player. This build is one of the hardest to master, and not executing everything flawlessly means not seeing optimal damage output. Some players might get better DPS results by playing something easier.

  The Scorpion has outstanding versatility, allowing it to evade being pinned down and giving it the ability to relocate constantly. This will be very important considering how glassy it is. Players will also be able to deal out massive damage numbers wherever they need, with low cooldown times. This means a player can effortlessly relocate to pick off already damaged enemies in quick succession. When it comes to very hard builds like this one, some players might want to try remapping their keys to see if it makes things simpler.

  <strong>
   <em>
    New World Aeternum
   </em>
  </strong>
  has introduced several changes to how weapon skill trees work. And even though most players will barely feel the change, some of these differences between the previous version of the game and the new release will impact the weapons' power and utility.

 <p>
  These examples are the best two-handed melee weapons, with all their particularities, the best skills, and the best ways to combine them to create cool and powerful builds. From one of the favorite weapons for Dexterity players to the definitive weapon of mass destruction, capable of breaking apart opponents en-masse, and buffing its user to resist damage more efficiently.

 <p>
  The Spear's main strength resides in its ability to close the gap between players and their opponents, causing severe CC, as well as many status effects that diminish mobility, armor, and resistance. It can also cause bleeding, as well as increase the damage output of the user. The Spear is an all-rounder weapon, with not too many mitigation choices though. Spear users are exposed to counter-attacks from their opponents, especially when attacked from behind, and lack the versatility of other weapons like the Great Axes and War Hammers that can clear out huge groups of opponents in one strike.

 <p>
  It's especially effective against Creatures and Animals since it causes Trust Damage, but less effective against Undead enemies. It is also good for PvP, though mainly as a complement to ranged weapons like Bows and Muskets. Since its primary stat is Dexterity, having another weapon that scales with said stat is the optimal choice for spear users. They can even go Rapier/Spear, although that's not a recommended build for the current meta.

 <p>
  The Spear has two branches of skills: Zoner and Impaler. The first one focuses on crowd control effects, like pushing and throwing opponents prone. It also has a reliable Javelin-Toss ability that turns the Spear into a throwable weapon, considerably deadly for those players with extreme precision. The second branch, Impaler, is all about causing damage to a single target, as well as bleeding and chasing down opponents thanks to its Vault Kick ability that serves as a gap closer. The more negative effects the Spear user causes on their opponents, the more the Impaler skill branch shines, dealing even more damage and empowering attacks.

  A good choice for those who enjoy raw unbridled power, the Great Axe has the highest slashing damage of all the melee weapons, but it's a bit slower than War Hammers and Greatswords. With sweeping attacks, Slash Damage, and powerful skills, the Great Axe excels at picking up single targets in PvE and dealing considerable damage. In PvP, the Reaper kit shines as a beacon of crowd control thanks to its Gravity Well skill, which even in
  <em>
   New World: Aeternum
  </em>
  is an absolute game-changer.

 <p>
  The best kit to beat down opponents in single combat is Marauder, with access to chase abilities and the powerful Execute skill that resets every time players slay an opponent. The great thing about the Marauder branch is not only its access to extra mobility (that with strength-based builds becomes critical) but also its powerful passives that turn the player into an off-tank capable of resisting quite a lot of punishment before they even start to flinch. On the other hand, the bad thing about the majority of Great Axe skills is that none except Execute grant Super-Armor (the ability to resist interruption), and players become vulnerable to stuns, blocks, interruptions, and other crowd control effects. But it is a great weapon, fun to play, and feels powerful enough to satisfy those with a thirst for blood.

  The Greatsword is nearly perfect. With great balance between damage and tankiness, players building to get the hang of this spectacular two-handed weapon will feel all the power of a heavy tank, and the powerful skills of a bruiser in an all-in-one kit. The major strength of the Greatsword lies in its ability to shift between "stances" upon using skills from each of its branches, so players might feel the need to build a hybrid between the two specializations to get the perfect combos that suit their needs.

 <p>
  The particularity of the stances is that each of them has a different effect. Onslaught turns the player into a berserker, which trades his own defense in exchange for damage. The Onslaught passives also grant life steal. Then, the Defiance Stance offers more damage reduction, while also reducing the damage the player causes, but automatically blocking incoming attacks when charging a Heavy Attack. This gives Greatsword users a lot of tactical advantages to outsmart their opponents both in PvE and PvP, especially when they become the frontline in the absence of better tanks or Shieldbearers. The downside is that these weapon mechanics are quite hard to master, especially for new players, and finding the right equipment to accompany a Great Sword build can be a problem too.

  With a huge and raw piece of metal (or stone) at the end of a long handle, War Hammers in
  <em>
   New World: Aeternum
  </em>
  are a representation of strength and pure unbridled power. Capable of powerful and long-reaching attacks that break the foes' defenses, War Hammers boast the strongest attack power of all melee weapons in the game. Both of the Warhammer's ability branches are powerful for tanking, but the best among them is the Crowd Crusher branch.

  With access to supreme crowd control, overreaching AoE effects, and a great deal of damage, Crowd Crusher is the perfect skill tree for those who want to slam the ground and send every foe flying away. On the other hand, Juggernaut has quite an assortment of mitigation skills, which combined properly can turn the player into the ultimate tank that can withstand any attack in the game. Perhaps the War Hammer's only flaw is that since it's a pure strength weapon, there are not too many combination possibilities, and a pure strength build can leave the players exposed to being squishier in the end game. Nevertheless, there's not a single doubt that the War Hammers are the strongest two-handed melee weapons in
  <em>
   New World: Aeternum
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan recently designed several new sprites that give Leafeon a sakura-themed makeover. The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan's artwork showcased several variations for the Grass-type Eeveelution, all of which featured gorgeous pink cherry blossoms at the design's core.

 <p>
  Leafeon is the pure Grass-type evolution of the Gen 1 Pokemon Eevee. Like the other Eeveelutions, the Pokemon's design is inspired by its type and features a green, yellow, and brown color palette alongside a leaf-like tail and ears. While the original design of Leafeon is relatively simple, it is well-loved by the community and is oftentimes considered one of the best designed Grass-types in
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  . Alongside being loved in its base form, Leafeon is also the subject of a lot of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan art, in part due to its straightforward design that allows extra room for creativity from fan artists. That is exactly the case with this fan's sakura-themed Leafeon.

 <p>
  Reddit user Zalveris shared their sakura Leafeon sprites online with the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community. The artist featured several new designs for Leafeon, all of which added a soft pink coloring to the Pokemon's feet and gave it cherry blossoms for a tail and ears. Alongside that, the ears were also given similar treatment and made to look like a cherry blossom petal. Like other fan art for the Pokemon Leafeon, the eyes were also re-colored to match the new design's aesthetic and were now a pale pink that matched the Pokemon's tail and ears.

 <p>
  The cute sprites were incredibly well received by other
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans online. Many loved the idea of switching out Leafeon's tail for cherry blossoms, alongside the other variations that the artist provided. One commentor suggested that, much like how several Pokemon have regional variants within the games, it would be awesome if some Pokemon had environmental variants depending on the biome or season in which they were evolved or found in. While
  <em>
   Pokemon Black
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   White
  </em>
  had a seasonal cycle implemented, some users agreed that it would be cool to see variations of Pokemon like this sakura Leafeon during various seasons in games that featured that mechanic.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Sword of Convallaria
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a beautiful turn-based strategy game with a brilliant soundtrack, cute pixel art, and a gripping story where decisions can influence the outcome. Featuring a vast range of characters to choose from, the game presents it in a typical gacha fashion.

 <p>
  Similar to other gacha games,
  <em>
   Sword of Convallaria
  </em>
  categorizes its characters by rarity, with higher rarity characters possessing superior stats, skills, and even exclusive abilities. Characters are divided into rare, epic, and legendary tiers.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  While legendary characters are often considered the top choice in the game, they can be quite challenging to acquire. On the other hand, rare units may not provide sufficient strength on the battlefield. To balance this, players can take advantage of epic-tier characters, which are generally easier to obtain and upgrade.

 <p>
  These epic characters should not be underestimated, as they can deliver impressive performances on the battlefield at a lower cost, appealing to both free-to-play players and high spenders. The game offers a wide variety of epic units, with more being added to the roster over time. Here’s are the best epic units players can choose from to take on enemies in

 <p>
  Taking on the role of an assassin, Crimson Falcon is an epic character in
  <em>
   Sword of Convallaria
  </em>
  that is worth investing in. Coming from the seeker class, Falcon’s main ability lies in catching targets off guard by sneaking and attacking them from behind.

 <p>
  Her trait allows the player to deal more damage from the side or behind and reposition herself after the attack. Functioning more like Col, the legendary class assassin, Crimson Falcon possesses a skill tree that helps her specialize in ambushing enemies.

  From stealing a random attribute from enemies to increased crit on back attacks, Falcon’s ability to maneuver through the map while easily dodging enemy attacks makes her a great asset for the team and the players.

 <p>
  Another character on the list from the papal faction, Lash, is a destroyer class character in
  <em>
   Sword of Convallaria
  </em>
  who has the potential to be a strong damage dealer if built correctly. Utilizing dark magic, Lash is capable of dealing impressive damage numbers with the help of his skills, which can cover multiple tiles at once.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1049} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Talking about Lash’s skill tree, players can either build her as an offensive character ready to punish characters with her whip of blame or as a designated healer. However, with the game providing Angel as a free healer character, it is better to utilize Lash as an offensive mage befitting her destroyer role.

 <p>
  The judge of Papal can be a ruthless attacker who can deal damage by ignoring enemy defenses. Lash can also reduce the enemy’s healing factor and prevent them from using their skills while dealing AoE damage, which makes lash worth investing in when preparing a team.

  Stormbreaker’s special trait is her mastery at dealing AoE damage, which is what makes her a valuable asset on the battlefield. Utilizing an axe to wreak havoc in the warzone, Stormbreaker’s skills comprise abilities that strengthen her attacks and, with each skill used, results in a more ferocious Stormbreaker ready to do the killing.

  She is also able to crowd control and, with her abilities, she can clear an entire map full of enemies with ease. Among all the free-to-play units available in the game, Stormbreaker stands out as the best AoE damage dealer, even better than Rawiyah, making her a must-have character, especially for free-to-play players.

  Fulfilling her role as a pharmacist, Nightingale possesses numerous healing abilities, but her true expertise lies in offensive support. Though she belongs to the Watcher class, Nightingale offers more than just healing. She can put troublesome enemies to sleep, boost the speed of allies in critical need, and even deal AoE damage when surrounded by foes, turning her into a character that can fill in the shoes of multiple characters from different classes.

 <p>
  Nightingale works best when paired together with a strong damage dealer. Early on in the game, she can also be used as a healer because of her initial skill. With such utility and the power to control the battlefield, nightingale is a solid unit worth spending time leveling up in the game.

  In
  <em>
   Sword of Convallaria
  </em>
  , there are only a handful of characters playing the role of a tank and much fewer in the epic rarity. However, suppression, despite being an epic character, packs a solid punch. Capable of absorbing enemy attacks on the team’s behalf, Suppression is perfectly capable of keeping the teammates alive.

  His trait reduces the damage dealt by magic attacks while allowing a pre-emptive hit from the front or side. Suppression’s skill tree is quite versatile as it comes with a variety of useful abilities ranging from recovery to protection and buffs.

 <p>
  Suppression can also recover NRG with his skills, which further extends his usability. The Papal Radiant Guard works the best with characters from the Papal States faction as one of his skills – Leader’s Aura straight-up buffs the attack and defense of the characters from the faction.

 <p>
  While suppression may not be necessary for every battle, he can certainly be a valuable asset against seeker-class enemies or when using a team focused on high offense with lower defense stats.

  Abyss is a powerful spellcaster in
  <em>
   Sword of Convallaria
  </em>
  and ranks among the top destroyer class characters of epic rarity. Specializing in debuffs, the dawn maidservant can inflict multiple debuffs whenever it's her turn to attack.

 <p>
  With a diverse skill tree, there are multiple ways in which players can use Abyss in the game. Depending on the right skills, she can be played as a single target DPS that inflicts sleep status or as an AoE damage dealer who can also cast multiple debuffs over an area.

 <p>
  Abyss can be compared to the likes of Beryl, a legendary tier character in the game. While her damage output will not be anywhere closer to Beryl's, her ability to wear down enemies with many debuffs makes her a great replacement for the team.

  Her kit comes with plenty of useful skills, ranging from recovering HP for allies to dispelling debuffs applied to the party members. Her initial skill allows her to heal a single target, but the deeper one goes in her skill tree, the better skills can be found, like AoE healing, increased healing factor, or attack and defense buffs.

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has recently designed a new regional variant for Skarmory, coming up with an inventive take on the popular steel bird. The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise is widely celebrated for the variety of designs its creatures have, and talented fan artists are always ready to give new spins on the most beloved critters.

 <p>
  Skarmory is a Steel/Flying-type monster originally introduced in the second generation of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games. It was one of the few creatures to have the new Steel type, which was added in Gen 2, and it’s not known to evolve into or from any other Pokemon. When compared to other Pokemon in its generation, Skarmory stands out due to its strong metal body, and for being able to use powerful Steel-type abilities such as Steel Wing. In later games, the bird also gained access to new moves like Metal Sound and Iron Defense.

 <p>
  Now, a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan called meluharegion devised an amusing regional variant for Skarmory called Skarigami. This new take on the Gen 2 creature reimagines Skarmory as an origami paper bird with white, black, and red colors. It’s a creative idea, especially considering that the original Skarmory has steel skin, and this one seems to be made out of paper. Meluharegion also asked fans what type they thought this monster should be, and some fans suggested combinations such as Steel/Grass-type, Grass/Flying-type, Normal-type with Sharpness as an ability, and more.

 <p>
  This is not the only fan art featuring Skarmory shared with the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community recently. A few months ago, one fan designed a cute baby form for Skarmory. In this form, the popular Gen 2 creature was depicted as a tiny steel bird that looked adorable with a round head and small claws.

 <p>
  Other recent fan art of Gen 2 critters include a regional variant of Ho-Oh. The legendary Pokemon was redesigned as an even more colorful bird with green, yellow, blue, and red feathers in this fan art, as well as a tail inspired by a peacock. According to the creator, this beast comes from an undisclosed Indian-inspired region in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  world.

 <p>
  Hopefully, other fans will keep making fan art of the most popular Pokemon in the franchise, especially with the launch of other games such as
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , which will be released in 2025.
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will be set in Lumiose City, and will bring Mega Evolutions back, as well as new creatures, marking an exciting period for fans.

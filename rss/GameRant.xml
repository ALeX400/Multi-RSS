  The amount of hype around

   <strong>
    onster Hunter Wilds
   </strong>
  </em>
  among gamers just before its release is powerful, and Capcom is well aware of that. Aside from those who will be playing the game right after its launch, many gamers will celebrate the release of the game with their favorite Twitch streamers.

  Thankfully, Capcom will not leave Twitch viewers empty-handed if they do support a streamer with a gift or a subscription. The reward program for
  <em>

  </em>
  will remain live for nearly a month after its release, with the reward codes remaining redeemable for a year.

 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  will not reward Twitch Drops for those who just watch the streams. Instead, Capcom will offer a
  <strong>
   Hunter Help: Assistance Pack
  </strong>
  to every viewer who supports a streamer of the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  category by gifting or buying a single Twitch subscription. Here is all that is included in the pack:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   5x Sharp Fin
  </li>
  <li>
   5x Large Barrel Bomb
  </li>
  <li>
   2x Shock Trap
  </li>
  <li>
   5x Slinger Flash Pod
  </li>
  <li>
   3x Demon Powder
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This program kicks off on
  <strong>
   February 27 at 9 PM PT
  </strong>
  (or February 28 at 12 AM ET), and it will wrap up on
  <strong>
   March 20
  </strong>
  at the aforementioned time. Players should gift or buy the Twitch subscription within a certain timeframe based on the platform they play
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  on.
 </p>
 <p>
  To be more accurate, Twitch will distribute the redeemable codes for the Hunter Help: Assistance Pack for three weeks after the game's release, and each week, the codes will be specific to a certain platform. Below, you can check out the distribution period for each platform:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation:
   </strong>
   From February 27, 9:00 PM PT until March 6, 8:59 PM PT
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Steam:
   </strong>
   From
   <strong>
   </strong>
   March 6, 9 PM PT until March 13, 8:59 PM PT
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Xbox:
   </strong>
   From
   <strong>
   </strong>
   March 13, 9:00 PM PT until March 20, 8:59 PM PT
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  So, if someone plans to play
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  on Xbox, for example, they need to gift or buy a Twitch subscription in the third week of the game's launch to receive the reward pack that is eligible on Xbox only.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep in mind that the reward is not stackable. This means a single Twitch account can only receive the pack once for each platform.

 <p>
  It's crucial to note that not every Twitch subscription is eligible to receive the Hunter Help: Assistance Pack. According to Capcom, only the following subscriptions are counted as eligible:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   New monthly subs (any tier)
  </li>
  <li>
   Multi-month subs (3-month, 6-month)
  </li>
  <li>
   Gift subs (any tier for any number of months)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Any Twitch subscriptions aside from the ones mentioned above will be deemed
  <strong>
   ineligible
  </strong>
  , such as Prime subscriptions, recurring subscription renewals, and subscriptions received through Sub Token redemption.

  <strong>
   Twitch Drops inventory
  </strong>
  , where you will have a new reward to claim, revealing a code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Redeeming this code on the corresponding platform will reward the player with the Hunter Help: Assistance Pack. Here is how to redeem the code on each platform:

    What Two Point Game Would You Like to See Next?

   <p class="display-card-excerpt">
    Two Point Studios have released two hilarious management games: Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. The next entry in this series was announced in August 2024, and this time around players will get to design their dream museum with Two Point Museum. The question is: what comes next? I would love to see Two Point Hotel, Two Point AirBnB, or Two Point Resort. They could even tackle all of these at once, by increasing the grandeur of buildings as gamers progressed through the game. The possibilities are endless here, whether it comes to amenities, rooms, guests, and hotel staff.

  To be successful in
  <em>
   Two Point Museum
  </em>
  , players will need to establish as many revenue streams as possible to ensure the customers are happy, staff are being adequately paid, and the business is making money. As you accumulate profit, so too will you be given more chances to expand your businesses with new exhibits, additional land, and even entire museums for you to curate. Below are some tips on how you can make your museum profitable as soon as possible.
 </p>
 <h3 id="collect-donations-from-visitors">
  Collect Donations from Visitors
 </h3>
 <p>
  Aside from entry sales, donations are the most basic way that players can accumulate a passive flow of income. It's a relatively easy process to set up, but it will require frequent management of both the donation stands and the surrounding exhibits to ensure you are maximizing your income potential. Donation stations will be available very early in the game, and require a Janitor for any maintenance, a security guard to collect the money, and nearby exhibits to attract donations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The size and frequency of donations you receive all depend on both the quality and quantity of exhibits within the vicinity. It is one thing to surround a donation box with interesting things to see, but exhibits that you complete and are lavishly decorated will attract the highest possible donation amounts. Ensure you have a security guard frequently checking, as you won't be credited the funds until they take them out of the station.

 </h3>
 <p>
  Players will have the power to dictate how cheap or expensive a visit to their museum is. It doesn't just apply to the entry fee, but you can also adjust the value of food and drinks from the vending machines, as well as the cost of books, onesies, plush toys, and trinkets that can be purchased in the museum's gift shop.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will need to be wary of how customers feel about the prices you said, as making the experience too expensive will drastically lower your guest satisfaction statistics, but a steady increase as your museum grows will facilitate a healthy flow of income and opportunities to train and hire staff, as well as venture out for more valuable exhibits.

 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_12">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     After you make a price increase, come back to the Finances menu or click on a relevant station to check how customers feel about the new price. If they are satisfied that it is good or fair value, then you can keep it as is. If, however, they feel the price is unfair, consider lowering it again until you have inserted more exhibits and activities for guests to enjoy.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>

 <h3 id="partake-in-sponsorship-agreements">
  Partake In Sponsorship Agreements
 </h3>
 <p>
  Players will have ongoing opportunities to earn additional funds via the Finances menu by showcasing an external organization's art or advertising materials, but this can be risky if unsuccessful. Many of the sponsorship agreements will pay you bonuses for the number of times your guests interact with them, but they may also penalize you if you place them in a poor traffic area where they are largely ignored. As such, make sure that any exhibits you accept are in high-traffic areas, near some of your more popular attractions, or even at the end of a guided tour, so you are getting as many guest interactions as you possibly can. If the agreement rewards you for the number of interactions the exhibit receives, then it can be a very effective source of additional revenue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just because sponsorship offers are there doesn't mean they're worth taking, so consider the benefits versus the potential risks when deciding whether to accept or decline. Some offers will have a negative influence on customer happiness, so ensure any potential disadvantages can be negated with the right staff, decorations, or facilities. If you choose to decline one, then another will be presented in due course, so don't feel obligated to take the ones you see.

  's guided tour feature until you have acquired your first star on your Prehistoric museum and either your Supernatural or Marine Life one, but these are an excellent way to make quick money in bulk. The value of your tours will dictate the volume of donations you receive, so take due care in making sure you work towards giving five-star tours.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a number of factors that influence how lucrative your tours can be for the business, and the UI in this popular sandbox game makes it very easy to identify strong and weak points. In general, you'll want to group exhibits of the same nature together, such as fossils with fossils or skeletons with skeletons, and ensure the path the tour takes makes sense and isn't too lengthy. As a rule of thumb, customers are generally really satisfied if you can curate a tour that looks over 3-4 very high-quality exhibits with a guide that is engaging and informative.

     Your choice of Expert can have a significant impact on the quality of the tour. Ensure you hire someone that doesn't have any negative traits that will impact tour engagement, such as "Dull", and take the time to train that expert so they are better equipped to captivate guests.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <h3 id="sell-exhibits">
  Sell Exhibits
 </h3>
 <p>
  While it might not be the sure-fire quickest way to make a buck or two, accumulating duplicate exhibits in your quest to complete your bigger ones can actually prove quite fruitful. Of course, there are costs involved with setting up expeditions, but you can make that money back, and then some, by selling any unwanted items that you have collected.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same principles can be applied when refreshing your museum. As you amass a collection of more rare and valuable exhibits, you may want to consider taking a quality-over-quantity approach and begin trading some of your less-loved exhibits for some well-needed cash, which you can, of course, put towards more expeditions and even more top-quality items for show.
 </p>
 <h3 id="manage-staff-numbers-and-wages">
  Manage Staff Numbers and Wages
 </h3>
 <p>
  Players will need a variety of different staff specialists to cover the various facets of the business, from selling tickets and merchandise, to going on expeditions and ensuring the security of the venue, all of which will naturally require that you pay individuals to cover these roles. While the business will largely be profitable off the back of investing in personnel, poor management of staff numbers and task allocations can actually end up costing you money.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best way to make use of your staff and get maximum value for money is to establish zones, which you'll find under the menu tab at the bottom of the screen. By setting zones and allocating staff to them, you're able to split the museum into sections and have a staff member cover each of them (where applicable). This will allow you to identify whether you have enough or too many staff, so you can ensure you have the right number working and maintaining the exhibits and features that are bringing you profit.
 </p>
 <h3 id="take-out-a-loan">
  Take Out A Loan
 </h3>
 <p>
  Just like in real life, taking out a loan is not something you'll want to do light-heartedly. Generally, it is considered a last resort for when your museum encounters some financial troubles, but it can also give already-successful businesses a boost that will take their guest experience to the next level. This tip may not necessarily be an effective "make money quick" strategy on the surface, but spending money in the right places can tip the financial scales in your favor.
 </p>
 <p>
  With extra funding, players can send their staff out on expeditions to collect more exhibits, which are essential for a profitable museum. With the addition of new exhibits, you will be able to facilitate some of the other revenue-earners, like guided tours and donation stations, which will hopefully increase your monthly profit. Be wary of the risks involved, which increase with higher-volume loans, as it may not end up being a fruitful venture if all of your profit goes straight to paying it back.

 <p>
  It's fairly commonplace for games to have more than one type of currency, and
  <em>
   Two Point Museum
  </em>
  is no different. While players will be most concerned with their monthly profit, as it is their primary means of organizing expeditions, training staff, and adding essential components to a museum, it is worth paying attention to the game's seconday currency, which is called Kudosh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kudosh is your ticket to unlocking almost all the additional cosmetic items available in
  <em>
   Two Point Museum
  </em>
  , including museum and staff customization options, and it is relatively straight-forward to earn, so long as you know where to look. Primarily, Kudosh can be earned by
  <strong>
   completing objectives in the Sticker Book
  </strong>
  , which is found under the exhibits tab at the bottom of the screen (the T-Rex skull). There are three tabs in your Sticker book, which are Exhibits, Guests, and Features, all of which have a number of objectives available for you to complete for Kudosh. To view the objective, simply click on a sticker and scroll down to the bottom of the guide.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_7">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     Additional stickers with objectives will be unlocked as you progress through the game and discover new exhibits, features, and types of guests.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  In saying that, there are a few pop-up events that will earn you Kudosh. For example,
  <strong>
   earning a star for your museum
  </strong>
  will give you a bunch of rewards, including a few hundred Kudosh, as well as
  <strong>
   performing well in annual health inspections
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  You can track how much Kudosh you have accumulated at the top right of the screen, indicated by the yellow K symbol. Once you have acquired a healthy amount of this currency, you can make use of it to expand your catalog of cosmetic items. Kudosh is generally available to be spent on the following types of items:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Museum Utilities - these include larger info stands, vending machines, temperature control tools, and waste bins.
  </li>
  <li>
   Building Foundations and Decorations - these include partitions, doors, wallpapers, and flooring patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
   Staff Cosmetics - you can use Kudosh to buy different outfits for your staff, which are split according to their role within the museum.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  To use Kudosh, players simply need to click on a locked item with the K symbol underneath it, and confirm their purchase. For museum utilities, this is in the Items menu (the chair symbol), for decorations the Building Foundations menu (the paint roller symbol), and for staff cosmetics by clicking on an individual staff member and the t-shirt symbol.

  Graffiti is often thought to be a modern sensation, but for millennia, people have wished to say "I was here", leave political messages, or engrave something funny on walls. Pompeii, for example, contains a plethora of graffiti from Roman times, and this was no different in the Middle Ages of
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  ​​​​.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there aren't many church interiors where medieval graffiti seems to have been particularly present with prayers or even curses scratched into the walls, graffiti can be seen in some of the
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  taverns and other places. One example is at the Grund tavern, with a demon and a pentagram mirroring real-life graffiti from a church in Troston, Suffolk in England. Small details like this help players feel like they are living in a world populated by other humans.

  NPCs chatting among themselves isn't exactly new in video games, but in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,
  </em>
  it feels especially impactful. Not only do conversations heard in the streets or in the back of carts sound realistic, but at times, characters will even gossip about real events that have happened in the game as a result of the player's actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, after Henry finds a body as part of a sidequest, he may overhear villagers at the local tavern gossiping about this horrific discovery the next day.

  Dropping items in games due to being encumbered or simply wanting to have a clean inventory is nothing new, but in most games, the items will stay on the ground until they despawn. This is not the case in
  <em>
   KCD2.
  </em>
  Instead, characters in the street will be glad to see some free armor, Groschen, or food lying around, and will grab it.
 </p>
 <p>
  They will even comment on their luck. Incredibly, if players drop nicer clothes than another character is currently wearing, then the next day, they may see them in their new attire. Furthermore, players can also drop carrots and some other food in front of their horse, who will eat it.

  One achievement the
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  franchise should be most proud of is highlighting how rich and colorful the Middle Ages were. Status, class, and wealth were of huge importance to many medieval people, and the primary way to showcase this was via their clothes and belongings.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there are numerous beautiful outfits in
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  ​​​​​, one small detail that stands out is the decorated scabbards for swords. Every sword has its own sheath, and while there are simpler ones, a few have incredibly fancy designs. For example,

    Master Menhart's Longsword

  's scabbard boasts intricate scrollwork at the bottom, and at the top is the crest of Frankfurt, from where he hails.

  No world is ever standing still with everything complete, and
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  showcases this by having multiple buildings that are in the process of being constructed. The main examples are the half-complete castle at Pschitoky, with numerous laborers working on its construction, and the Church of St. Barbara.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can also see a man working on the foundations of a new house or other small building. Small details like this not only make the world of
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  feel alive, but they can also teach fans a little about history. It also helps that many of the important buildings in
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  are real-life locations that fans can visit.

  One of
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  's many small but impressive mechanics is the ability for Henry to physically peer out of certain windows. He will stick his head out of the window, giving himself and the player the best view of the surrounding countryside or a city like Kuttenberg.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such windows are often found in Henry's rooms, whether they be inside a castle or a tavern. Extra ways to look at this beautiful game are always a bonus, and players can use photo mode in
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  to snap some funny pictures of Henry peering out of a castle.

 <p>
  One of the most impressive details in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  is the fact that if players happen to hit a wooden structure with an axe, for example, a visible mark will be left. While this does not make a difference to gameplay, it helps players immerse themselves in
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  , as every action has consequences, even if they are small like this.
 </p>
 <p>
  What's more impressive is that the marks aren't all the same, and the angle depends on which direction the axe swing came from. By shooting arrows through thin pieces of wood, players will also see that they not only damage the wood but pierce them too.

  Deaths can often feel inconsequential in video games. However, not only does
  <em>
   KCD2
  </em>
  have a vigorous crime and punishment system to punish Henry if he ever commits murder, but NPCs will react to all deaths, and there is one interaction that feels particularly immersive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes, after a fight between two sides, such as the one at Ruthard Palace, characters will come out and pray over the dead bodies and ask why this happened. Other characters will instead inspect dead bodies and look for perpetrators.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Two Point Museum
   </strong>
  </em>
  follows on from other popular simulators from Two Point studios, such as
  <em>
   Two Point Campus
  </em>
  , but instead tasks players with the responsibility of getting several different museums up and running. As a curator, you'll open and expand on a number of locations, each with their own distinct theme.

 <p>
  A pivotal part of the customer's experience in your museum is the collection of exhibits that are on display. These are relatively easy to come by, in theory, but their requirements will become more challenging as the game progresses, and some exhibits will only be revealed to you in parts. With this in mind, an understanding of
  <strong>
   how to complete exhibits in
   <em>
    Two Point Museum
   </em>
  </strong>
  will help you on your way to curating a number of incredibly informative and extremely profitable establishments.

  Without any exhibits in your museum, there's nothing for your paying customers to appreciate when they visit your establishment. Thankfully, there's a fairly simple way to resolve this obstacle, but it is one that gets progressively more complicated as you earn stars and open more museums.
 </p>
 <p>
  To acquire exhibits, players will need to
  <strong>
   send their staff on expeditions across
   <em>
    Two Point Museum
   </em>
   's ever-expanding map
  </strong>
  , with each location requiring a certain number of objectives to be completed first. Some of the more basic exhibits can be sourced from simple one-person trips, but the rarer and more valuable pieces will require multiple staff members, a lot more experience, and plenty of time to carefully uncover them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each location will indicate how many discoverable items you have found, which will give you some incentive to either repeat previous journeys or move on to more challenging trips. In saying that, discovering an exhibit doesn't necessarily mean you have acquired all the necessary parts to complete it, which is where multi-part exhibits add another layer of gameplay to your experience.

  Along their journey to curating the ultimate museum experience, players will need to carefully put together a cohesive exploration of a museum's many themes. A big part of this is the collection of exhibits they amass, some of which won't come to you completed from the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  For some exhibits, such as the Prehistoric Boa Constrictor Skeleton, you will need to
  <strong>
   embark on multiple trips to the same location
  </strong>
  , some of which will require staff to be trained in certain skills, to complete it. While it certainly holds a degree of interest and prestige in an incomplete state, there are far greater rewards and customer reviews to be gained from having all pieces of an exhibit. To increase your chances, selecting "Detailed" when choosing the duration of an expedition will bring you greater success.

     You can check the Rewards tab in each location to find where the missing parts of your incomplete exhibits can be sourced.

 <p>
  Once completed, an exhibit's value will increase, which will reward players with much higher customer reviews, and even increase the monetary value of the piece, in case you wish to sell it for cash.

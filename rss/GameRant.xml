      <title>Once-Great FPS Game Franchises That Lost Their Identity Over Time</title>

 <p>
  First-person shooters exploded in the 90s, and they are now one of the most hyped up genres around. They’re also more fluid than they once used to be, adding in things like RPG elements and multiplayer to help evolve the video game industry.
 </p>

 <p>
  Some of the best shooter franchises of all time have dipped in quality or never found their identity.
  <em>
   Wolfenstein
  </em>
  was a series that was growing stale, but then
  <em>
   Wolfenstein: The New Order
  </em>
  revitalized the brand. The following FPS series may not be dead or bad, but they are certainly starting to grow a bit weaker in identity and could use a reboot like
  <em>
   Wolfenstein: The New Order
  </em>
  or a bold new game to evolve the genre.

 <p>
  Under Bungie’s umbrella, they put out five
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  games for Xbox consoles exclusively. Bungie was Microsoft’s golden child who could do no wrong, and the fanbase agreed, although things shifted when 343 Industries took over for
  <em>
   Halo 4
  </em>
  , which was a good shooter, but something felt off.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the next game, Master Chief was labeled as a villain and wasn’t always playable, and then the most recent game added an open-world design. It’s not what
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  started as, a solid shooter starring a quiet but unbelievably cool protagonist via Master Chief, and things just haven’t been the same in over a decade now.

  <em>
   Medal of Honor

  was certainly not the first shooter experience that focused on World War 2, but it was an early example on consoles. It was a premier series that most associate with PlayStation consoles from the first game on PS1 to
  <em>
   Medal of Honor: Frontline
  </em>
  on the PS2.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Medal of Honor: Frontline
  </em>
  was like the crowning achievement for the franchise, as all other sequels were slightly lesser experiences, and yet things trickled on. The franchise even tried a modern setting, which was not met with positivity, and now, this once great World War 2 shooter franchise has largely been forgotten.

 <p>
  Overall,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is a solid shooter series that somehow manages to get a game out every year. The first three games focused on World War 2, while the fourth main title,
  <em>
   Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
  </em>
  , changed things forever. The modern setting was new, the shooting was tighter, and the multiplayer was a revolution. Even though the series bops around between different developers most years, that doesn’t mean there isn’t fatigue behind the scenes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
  </em>
  is a good example that some fans aren’t on board with because the multiplayer, while stellar, is leaving a lot of players feeling like it has become too stale and less innovative. The campaign is also a bit messy as an online-only experience. So, while the games are never bad,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  could use a break to try and reinvent the wheel again, like what
  <em>
   Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
  </em>
  did for the series.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Tom Clancy
  </em>
  series of video games started with
  <em>
   Rainbow Six
  </em>
  titles before
  <em>
   Ghost Recon
  </em>
  quickly became more popular. Most games feature squad-based gameplay wherein players can command their soldiers to do things like hold or provide cover fire. It was the norm for about a decade until
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands
  </em>
  and its sequel reshaped the experience as open-world tactical shooters.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the first game was great, the second was met with less enthusiasm. Either way, between spinoffs, gameplay changes, and cancellations,
  <em>
   Ghost Recon
  </em>
  is a phantom of its former self, but maybe the upcoming game can make things better.

 <p>
  <em>
   Duke Nukem

  was a huge shooter in the 90s, even though it started as a side-scrolling game. Fans loved
  <em>
   Duke Nukem 3D
  </em>
  in particular, which was almost like a parody of shooters, but one that still managed to be a fun experience on the scale of Doom and Wolfenstein, as established 90s first-person shooters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between some spin-offs and waiting over a decade for a new game that didn't quite meet expectations,
  <em>
   Duke Nukem Forever
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Duke Nukem

  name is far from what it used to be. It will be interesting to see whether the franchise can still turn things around after its latest entry.

 <p>
  The first two
  <em>
   Red Faction

  games were groundbreaking because they let players do something unexpected in a first-person game: blow up walls. That was the gimmick of the first two games, which were more linear shooters. The third game upped the ante on the destruction levels, but shifted the focus to third-person action in an open-world environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last game was more linear again, but it added a new wrinkle to the destruction gameplay, which allowed players to repair some things they broke now. Beyond destroying things, it seems like the
  <em>
   Red Faction
  </em>
  series never found its true voice beyond destructible gimmicks.

  The

 </p>
 <p>
  Fans loved the first game because there was nothing else like it at the time, but the dip in quality did take its eventual role in the series, which led to a reboot that went over poorly. While the franchise has become a bit stale, there is hope that a new game could revive the brand,
  <em>
   Turok: Origins
  </em>
  , as long as it doesn’t get canceled like so many other
  <em>

  was cool upon launch because it looked great as an FPS, and it had a cool gimmick involving chasing the paranormal. The first two games, along with the multiplayer segments, won a ton of praise over the years. Unfortunately, the third game was a bit more middling in terms of reviews, and there hasn’t been a new mainline game since 2011.
 </p>
 <p>
  After this initial trilogy, including DLC packs and standalone projects, there was a multiplayer-only game in 2014 called
  <em>
   F.E.A.R. Online
  </em>
  , which sort of defeated the purpose of the main games. There needs to be more spooky FPS games, and
  <em>

  ,
  <em>

  <em>
   LEGO Bricktales

  , now available for $2.99 (90% off). This marks the ClockStone-developed game's lowest-ever price on Valve's storefront, with the discount being set to run through December 12.

  has also hit an all-time low, currently discounted by 20% just two and a half months after its release, thus offering $5 worth of savings. The price cut is part of Steam’s sale for The Game Awards 2025 nominees;

  Separately,

The discount brings the game down to $19.99, matching its lowest-ever price, previously reached only once in late September 2025. Its higher-tier version has also received a 50% cut. While fans generally agree the Deluxe Edition of
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  wasn’t worth its original $69.99 launch price—later permanently reduced—it’s a far more appealing offer at $24.99.

  <em>

  Season 20 drops on December 9, and while much of the update’s contents are still shrouded in mystery, a new trailer coming on December 2 will reveal what’s in store for fans. With a new high-skill feature, at least one map, and a hero named Vendetta confirmed for update, it is clear
  <em>

  is ending 2025 with a bang.

  It is no exaggeration to say that 2025 has been a good year for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  . After a rocky start in 2022 and several setbacks in subsequent years, Blizzard scored win after win in
  <em>

  this year between features like Perks and Map Voting, game modes like Stadium, and countless other improvements.

  2025 may be coming to an end, but
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  has one more big update before the new year. Season 20 arrives on December 9, bringing with it some massive changes to the game. Not everything for this new season has been revealed yet, but the headline attraction for the update is undoubtedly Vendetta, the third hero for the year. This aggressive and highly-mobile melee damage hero fills a unique gameplay style in
  <em>

  Beyond this, at least two other things have been confirmed for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 20. Some sort of feature for high-skill gamers is being implemented in response to feedback and suggestions coming from competitive players. Additionally, a Stadium map based on a new location that appeared in recent lore will be coming. The exact location is currently unknown, but fan speculation points to Argentina, China, or even Mars as potential locations for this Stadium battleground.

  There are a few features that have also been confirmed to be arriving at some point after Season 19, though it is unclear if players will see them in Season 20 or some time next year. Two new maps for traditional
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  games set in Atlantic Arcology and Tokyo are coming at some point, as are Stadium Trials, which are objectives fans can complete mid-match to earn rewards, and could arrive in Season 20 or later. Additionally, fans will likely see new heroes for Stadium, as well as another crossover event.

  Overwatch 2 Season 20 Trailer Airs December 2
 </h3>
 <p>
  Luckily,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players won’t have to wait until season launch to find out what is in store for them. Blizzard just scheduled the official
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 20 trailer for December 2. Judging from past releases, fans can expect to see a showcase of the main features for Season 20, which appears to be aptly named “Vendetta” after the new hero. Players will ostensibly get a companion blog for this reveal that will go into a deep dive on the skins, game modes, potential collaborations, and other features that will arrive in Season 20.

  Beyond gameplay, something big is also coming to lore of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  soon, too. The in-game Story feature added in the mid-Season 19 patch was recently updated with Vendetta’s prologue, which teases the new hero seeking “retribution on those who stole her life away.” There is an empty spot for a new cinematic featuring this character on the timeline, so fans can expect to see this no later than December 9 as well, if not at some point in the week leading up to it.

  Luckily,

  players looking forward to this new trailer have the perfect event to occupy their time before then. The Vendetta Hero Trial is ongoing through the weekend, ending a couple of hours after the Season 20 trailer launches on December 2. This means fans will only have to wait one week between the end of Vendetta’s Hero Trial and the gladiator’s grand debut in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  as the next playable hero.

  Those who’ve spent enough time exploring the lands of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Where Winds Meet
   </em>
  </strong>
  have probably heard a soft meow, followed by a tiny, well-dressed magical cat staring at them. These adorable creatures, known simply as Meow Meows, are scattered all over Qinghe and beyond. Meo Meows have a bunch of puzzles and minigames for you.

  Completing their tasks rewards you with Echo Jade, coins, EXP, and contributes to Meow Meow Bells, which you can later submit at the Meow Meow Temple at Halo Peak. This guide covers all 31 Meow Meows in Qinghe, to help you find them and solve their puzzles in
  <em>
   Where Winds Meet
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The Will-O’-The-Wisp Collection makes up the largest portion of the Meow Meow quests in
  <em>
   Where Winds Meet
  </em>
  . Each challenge sends you sprinting through a marked area, collecting glowing blue wisps before the timer runs out.
 </p>
 <p>
  You don’t need to interact with the wisps. Simply running through them counts as collecting them. Each route also gives you more wisps than you actually need, so missing one or two won’t ruin the run.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are 14 Wisp challenges in Qinghe, each tied to a Meow Meow sitting somewhere along the path.

  Puzzles make up the second-largest category of Meow Meow quests in Where Winds Meet. Puzzle Meow Meow cats won’t directly tell you what they want. Instead, you must observe your surroundings, read clues, and figure out how to make each cat satisfied. There are 11 puzzles across Qinghe, mentioned in the table below.

 <p>
  The Unstoppable Bamboocut quests are one of the simpler Meow Meow challenges in Where Winds Meet. Much like the Will-o’-the-Wisp challenges, you’re given a timer and a target. In these tasks, the goal is to cut down a certain number of bamboo stalks before the countdown ends. As soon as the challenge starts, swing your weapon wildly and chop through as much bamboo as possible. Every stalk that falls automatically adds to your total.
 </p>
 <p>
  These quests are not mechanically difficult. Speed is more important than precision, and going full frenzy mode is usually the fastest way to succeed. You can find four Unstoppable Bamboocut challenges located throughout the Qinghe region.

  If you think you’ve figured out the Meow Meow tasks, just then one of the cats decides to sprint away the moment you interact with it. These tasks turn into fast-paced chase sequences. As you chase the cat, you’ll see white, smoky rings appear. Passing through them will make you fly and keep the chase going strong.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can run into two Cat Chase quests in Qinghe, and they’re among the trickiest Meow Meow puzzles because they require precision, speed, and staying on the cat’s trail.

     To keep up with the cats. You have to activate one of your Lightness Skills to leap into the air and glide toward the fleeing cat. Watch the floating paw prints closely because they show you exactly where the cat is heading.

   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  is getting a special Black Friday sale, giving fans a chance to pick up the new shooter. The launch of the newest entry in the long-running series stood as one of the most highly anticipated games of the year, going head-to-head with
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Black Ops 7
  </em>
  saw mountains of hype ahead of its release by Treyarch and Activision, peaking at over 100,000 players following its launch, though the total player count was notably lower than
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . Now, fans are getting an early chance to save some money when picking up the newest
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  .

  With the release of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
  </em>
  coming on November 14, the developers have already started to tease new content for the shooter. Treyarch is giving fans a free Operator skin to celebrate the launch of the game's Season 1 update on December 4, gifting a
  <em>
   Black Ops 7
  </em>
  skin based on the "Replacer" used heavily in the franchise's marketing. Season 1 is also set to debut multiple new maps in the game and a staggering nine new game modes for players.
  <em>
   Black Ops 7
  </em>
  is now getting a nice discount for the holidays.

  's many different game modes and new features come as Treyarch has continued to push improvements since the title's launch. A recent update made a positive change to Endgame, with
  <em>
   Black Ops 7
  </em>
  's new Disconnect Protection ensuring that players won't lose their progress for unexpected disconnects in an Endgame match. Season 1's launch will also give some extra perks for
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  players who own
  <em>

  </em>
  , seeing a 30% XP boost throughout the entirety of the latest
  <em>

  's life cycle. The Black Friday sales for
  <em>
   Black Ops 7
  </em>
  should be a perfect opportunity for more fans to try out the new shooter.

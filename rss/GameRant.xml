  The Skullduggery side quest asks players to
  <strong>
   obtain eight Mortaskulls
  </strong>
  , an item that can be obtained by defeating Skeleton Soldiers in the Grand Cathedral Mausoluem (Catacombs). The Skeleton Soldiers are not common enemies inside the dungeon and only sometimes appear from the coffins lining the walls of the Catacombs.

  To make the Skeleton Soldiers spawn, walk close to the wooden coffins until one of them starts moving and wait for the enemy to jump out. Repeat this until you have enough Mortaskulls to complete the quest.

  Skeleton Soldiers are

   weak to Light and Strike damage

  . Archetypes like Healer and Brawler make quick work of them. Once they're defeated, they will automatically drop Mortaskull. Once you obtain eight Mortaskulls, Gallica will comment that you have what you need and can report the quest as finished. Return to the dungeon entrance and talk to the Nervous Guard to turn in the quest and claim the rewards.

  There is a major bug related to the Skullduggery quest that can sometimes make it impossible to complete because the Skeleton Soldiers that players need to defeat to obtain the Mortaskulls stop spawning. Here is how it happens and how to prevent it.

  How Does Skullduggery Get Bugged
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are two quests that appear in Grand Trad after players return from Martira, Old Castle Town. One is called the Haunted Heirloom, issued by a Resentful Noble in Sunlumeo Street, asking players to retrieve a valuable item from the newly unlocked dungeon, Grand Cathedral Mausoluem, and the other is Skullduggery, the quest detailed above.

  Both quests require visiting the same dungeon but with different objectives. While most players will pick up both before heading inside, some won't. For the players who pick up and complete the Haunted Heirloom quest without starting Skullduggery at the same time, this quest will become bugged.

  <strong>
   If players accept and complete the Haunted Heirloom without starting the Skullduggery, Skullduggery will become bugged.

  If this happens, the skeletons that spawn in the Catacombs dungeon—the ones players need to defeat in order to get the items for the quest—will stop spawning. Since Mortaskulls obtained from this specific dungeon are the only way to complete this quest, there is no recourse.

  Skullduggery Bug Solution
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   only way to fix the Skullduggery quest bug is by reloading the save to an earlier point in the game
  </strong>
  . If this is not possible for whatever reason, players can only choose to let the deadline for this quest run out (July 30) where it will naturally fail and disappear from the quest logs without issue. The rewards for completing this quest are nothing major, only a common armor piece and 3000 Reeve. However, completing it is a requirement for obtaining the
  <em>
   'Help Anyone In Need'
  </em>
  Achievement (Complete All Quests), which means players aiming to get all trophies in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  will not be able to.

 <p>
  Fortunately, this is a very common bug reported by a lot of players which means it is very likely that it will get patched in a future update.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night

 <p>
  <em>
   Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night
  </em>
  was originally released in 2019 following a successful Kickstarter fundraising campaign. It is produced by former
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  producer Koji Igarashi, and is a spiritual successor to Konami's franchise, taking cues from games like
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night
  </em>
  . The original launch of
  <em>
   Ritual of the Night
  </em>
  was somewhat rocky, especially on the Switch. Despite that, it still garnered praise and managed to sell over 2 million units by the end of September 2023.

  's latest patch comes after May's version 1.5 update, which added new multiplayer modes and cosmetics. The version 1.6 update fixes a number of bugs and issues for all platforms, including a crash exclusive to the contentious Nintendo Switch port of
  <em>
   Ritual of the Night
  </em>
  . The update specifically fixes a softlock in the Store menu, slow loading in the game's Classic Mode, and the Glacial Tomb crash found in the Nintendo Switch version. All of these fixes will be coming to the game on October 22, 2024.

 <p>
  Rockstar has always loved putting obscure, mysterious, and sometimes downright creepy Easter eggs in its open worlds. As the most ambitious open world game the studio has created to date,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was obviously no exception to this. Spread all across the game’s five states are mysteries hidden throughout the wilderness that range from humorous Easter eggs to downright bone-chilling mysteries that may or may not get any sort of resolution.

 <p>
  While every state in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is beautiful in its own way, Lemoyne might just be in the running for the prettiest. Something about the wide open green and red plains around Scarlett Meadows, the peacefully ominous bayou, and the absolutely stunning city of Saint Denis are just a handful of the breathtaking sights this state has to offer. But under the surface of all that graphical fidelity are some of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  ’s strangest mysteries.

 <p>
  In a game that’s mostly entrenched in the gritty realism of the Wild West, it can be kind of alarming to stumble into a scene out of an Anne Rice novel, but that’s exactly what this Easter egg brings to the table. To find the Vampire of Saint Denis, players first have to track down his five diary entries scrawled in white/red ink on walls across the city. Once these entries have been located, players will note that the layout of these writings forms a pentagram over the map of the city, which will lead them to the location of the vampire itself.

 <p>
  Go to the alleyway behind the cathedral at nighttime. If the vampire is present, there will be a black “X” on the minimap indicating there is a corpse in the alley. Approach the vampire as he feeds, trigger the cutscene, kill him, and take his unique dagger to finish this secret quest. It’s worth noting that the vampire can kill in just one hit, and he does not respawn, so be sure to act fast.

 <p>
  This is a pretty creepy Easter egg and seeing the Nosferatu-esque NPC in a dark alley way is enough to give anyone chills, but the jury is out if he’s actually supernatural. In traditional lore, vampires can only be killed in a few very specific ways, and the Saint Denis bloodsucker can be killed like any conventional NPC. This could either indicate that Rockstar has bucked the old school vampire rules, or that this is just a mundane serial killer who’s really committed to his gimmick. Both are pretty unsettling.

 <p>
  Most players have gone through Jeremiah Compson’s sidequest and know full well about his history in the slave trade, but a hidden detail just behind his old home makes his already dark story all the more nightmarish. In the dried up well behind the home, players can find a ladder going down to the bottom. Not much is down there by way of loot besides a few coins likely thrown in by passersby. But scrawled on the walls of the well are tallymarks, much like those used by prisoners to note how many days they’ve been locked up.

 <p>
  Compson was likely keeping slaves as prisoners at the bottom of the well for weeks, if not months, at a time. A shockingly cruel misdeed from an already horrible man, this hidden detail can go completely missed by anyone not taking the extra time to explore. That positive honor spike Arthur gets after killing Compson feels a lot better after learning this not-so-fun fact.

 <p>
  Pleasance is an abandoned township in the state of Lemoyne located in the Scarlett Meadows region. There’s not much by way of missions for this area, so a lot of players probably pass right through on their way to another more important objective, but there’s more than meets the eye to this little town-that-was.

 <p>
  Nobody knows what exactly happened in Pleasance. Founded in 1883, it only lasted one month before becoming a ghost town. There’s a cemetery full of graves that all indicate violent ends for everyone buried there. But beyond those sparse details, there’s nothing concrete about what precisely happened that wiped an entire town off the map.

 <p>
  Some clues scattered around the map in the form of graffiti have led some fan theorists to two leading hypotheses: plague and some sort of occult activity. While widespread sickness could have absolutely wiped a small settlement off the map in that day and age, occult activity seems slightly more likely due to the preponderance of violence in the town, the church’s lack of any and all crosses, and the messages scrawled on walls reading “Unclean Sinners” and “Ill with Sin.” No answers have ever been given for the town’s actual fate, leaving Pleasance one of the truly unsolved mysteries of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2

  .

  While not exactly a mystery in the traditional sense, these swamp-dwelling enemies are among the most frightening and unexplained in the game. Other rival gangs in
  <em>

  </em>
  like the O’Driscolls, the Murfree Brood, and the Lemoyne Raiders all have pretty concrete backstories with identifiable motives, but the Night Folk are something else entirely.

 <p>
  Little is known about the Night Folk's backstory, only that they live in the swamps and bayous surrounding Saint Denis, communicate almost exclusively via animal calls, and prefer traps and ambush tactics under cover of darkness. The latter is especially terrifying because they target horses with the intent to kill, and, like the vampire, they’re one of the only enemies in the game able to one-shot the player themselves.

 <p>
  Very little is certain about this subculture outside of how brutally they attack anyone they deem an enemy. They’re an unknown quality, which makes them one of the most frightening opponents to go up against should players ever find themselves unlucky enough to be stuck in Bayou Nwa after dark.

 <p>
  Unlike the Saint Denis vampire, who may or may not be supernatural, it’s hard denying the ghost of Agnes Dowd is actually something from the other side. She’s fittingly difficult to actually see in-game, though her wails will be easily heard floating through the swamps of Bluewater Marsh.

  Agnes Dowd will only spawn between the hours of 9pm and 3am in foggy weather. The ghost will appear in the northwest area of Bluewater Marsh (that’s between the “B” and the “L” on the map) but can easily be tracked by her screams. Allegedly, this encounter can happen up to 16 times, with each appearance revealing more about Agnes’ tragic life story.

  One of the series most open-ended mysteries is that of the Strange Man, seen most prominently in the original
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption

  . This dapper gentleman will appear throughout the game several times and act as a sort of commentator on John’s morality or lack thereof. His exact nature is completely unknown, with over a decade of fan speculation claiming he’s God, the Devil, the Grim Reaper, or something unknowable in its entirety. Developers at Rockstar have weighed in, claiming even they don’t know for sure who the Strange Man is supposed to be.

  In Bayall Edge, players can find an unoccupied, yet lavishly furnished cabin, belonging to the Strange Man. If the player visits as Arthur, there will be an unfinished portrait of the Strange Man, along with various references to the player’s choices in the story up to that point. If the player visits as John, however, things start getting a little creepier.

 <p>
  On consecutive visits with John, the portrait will slowly reach further states of completion. Eventually, on the players’ final return to the cabin, they will see a mirror with the reflection of John, with the Strange Man standing ominously behind him. He’ll disappear before the player can turn and face him, but it’s safe to say this is where the Strange Man, whatever he is, developed his interest in the Marstons.

  This one’s a mystery that would make even Indiana Jones “nope” right out of the game. Located just west of Pleasance is a tree with a gargantuan snake hanging dead from its branches. This monster must be 20 feet long and would have been an absolute nightmare to face off with had it been alive. But despite its threatening appearance, it is harmless and very much dead.

  Fans have speculated for years as to what the meaning behind this creature could be, but there’s nothing conclusive as of yet. Theories range from the remains of a scrapped legendary animal to a light, passing reference to the film
  <em>
   Anaconda
  </em>
  . One darker, more theological theory is that the snake is meant to be a representation of the devil from the Christian story of creation. This is mainly driven by the creature’s close proximity to Pleasance, the town which many fans believe was engaged with devil worship.

  Anyone who’s played
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  has tried their hand at outrunning one of the many trains on the
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  map on their trusty horse. It’s just something everyone tries at least once. But the most elusive train in the game is the ghost train that rips through the state of Lemoyne.

 <p>
  The ghost train in
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  can be found at 3:00 am in the northwest part of the state near the “Welcome to Lemoyne” sign. Simply ride up and down the tracks; there’s no guarantee the train will spawn. But when Arthur/John’s horse starts whinnying, that’s a surefire sign the train is arriving at the station, so to speak.

 <p>
  There’s no in-game lore for this ghost train, leaving it something of a mystery. It could just be a fun bit of spooky flavor to the open world, though some fans have noted the train’s similarities to the Phantom Train in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  . Maybe the devs at Rockstar are just shouting out their peers at Square Enix.

 <p>
  Do enough snooping around the Braithwaite property and players will come across a heavily fortified outhouse. At a glance, the boarded-up door might just indicate an out of service commode, but the chains certainly do seem to be overkill. Closer investigation reveals a disfigured young woman trapped inside, who’ll take a swing at Arthur if he gets too close.

  Without further investigation, players may or may not get answers as to this woman’s identity. If Arthur brings Penelope to the outhouse while helping her escape, she will reveal the woman’s name is Gertrude Braithwaite and that they are cousins. Penelope will go on to reveal that Gertrude was born physically disfigured and mentally unwell and that, instead of getting her the help she needed, the family locked her away on the property to save face. Penelope claims she will send help for Gertrude if she manages to get to Boston.

  Returning years later as John reveals that Penelope did no such thing; Gertrude’s outhouse will be a dilapidated wreck with her skeleton rotting away inside. A tragic ending, but one sadly very much in line with how people with mental health issues were treated at the time.

  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass

  is firmly established as gaming's definitive subscription service, a reputation built upon years of goodwill. Each month, Microsoft adds a few games to the service, ensuring subscribers always have something new to check out. While slightly overshadowed by its console counterpart,
  <strong>
   PC Game Pass

  is a great option for people who prefer to play on a computer rather than an Xbox.

  Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass offer many of the same games, which reflects Microsoft's desire to cater to its whole customer base rather than just those who own consoles. That said, there are differences between the two, including some great titles that are only on the PC iteration. What are the

   PC Game Pass has a pretty big October 2024, with Black Ops 6, Modern Warfare 3, Dead Island 2, and Ashen all set to debut within the coming days. MechWarrior 5: Clans has also just landed on the service and is worth checking out, even if it is an acquired taste. While those are all big releases, an October 16 arrival should not be overlooked either.

  Despite being slightly overshadowed by its predecessor,
  <em>
   The Stick of Truth
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   South Park: The Fractured but Whole
  </em>
  is nevertheless a fantastic RPG adaptation of the iconic and irreverent animated series. Once again, the new kid finds himself in the middle of an all-out war between South Park's resident children, with Cartman naturally adding constant fuel to the fire. Unlike the first game's fantasy tropes, the sequel focuses on superheroes, taking potshots at comics and, more emphatically, the movie craze that was running rampant in the mid-2010s (and still is, to an extent).

  The story and humor are quintessential
  <em>
   South Park
  </em>
  , in the sense that they mostly repeat ideas that have originally been mined by the show and
  <em>
   The Stick of Truth
  </em>
  . However, that does not mean
  <em>
   The Fractured but Whole
  </em>
  has no narrative value, as it still manages to get a few comforting laughs while taking some comedic risks that threaten to be poignant. Crucially, the game is just fun to play, largely thanks to a revamped combat system that presents players with a bit more control and choice during battles. The campaign is still pretty easy, but fights do require thought to maneuver and surpass.

  <em>
   Frostpunk

  is still one of the best strategy city-builders on PC Game Pass, and it is now joined by a successor. Excitingly,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  introduces so many new ideas and expands the scale so significantly that it feels notably different from its predecessor; consequently, the sequel has not rendered the first game obsolete. That said, if someone loves the original title, they are likely to adore the second entry, as long as they do not go in expecting an identical experience.

  Set a few decades after the first game,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  puts players in charge of New London, a city that is trying to balance progression and survival. As always, leaders will need to find a way to drive the city's growth while meeting the basic needs of its citizens, which is no easy task when there is the ever-present threat of a shutdown due to unpredictable snowstorms. Although very much a survival game,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  is first and foremost a city-builder, and players will spend a great deal of time setting up connections and tiles. Beyond that, the sequel focuses quite a lot on politics, very much emphasizing that players are (essentially) running a government that has to take into account various factions with contradictory wants.

  Regardless of somebody's familiarity with the first game, they should consider starting with
  <em>

  <em>
   Sifu

  has an inspired death mechanic. Players step into the shoes of a martial artist who goes on a revenge tour that involves taking on five fighters, each of whom comes with their own stage. Now, whenever the protagonist fails, they revive as an older version of themselves, allowing them to keep going with stronger attacks but less HP. Eventually, they die permanently and have to start from scratch.

  This concept is brilliant, and it allows some more room for failure than the typical roguelike. However, do not mistake this mechanic as a sign that Sloclap decided to take things easy on players. No,
  <em>
   Sifu

  is an extremely difficult 3D beat 'em up with complex controls and a lot of attack options. By the time they defeat all five bosses, players will be genuine masters.

  features six characters, each of whom represents a different class and background; more importantly, players get to pick three fighters for a playthrough, enhancing the game's overall replayability. While initially coming across as somewhat simple, the hack and slash combat steadily improves as players unlock more skills and upgrade their characters. The campaign also opens up about halfway through, granting a bit more freedom in how players progress.

  While also available on the Xbox Series consoles,
  <em>
   Age of Mythology: Retold
  </em>
  just feels at home on PC. An updated version of the 2002 cult classic, the RTS game takes the
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  formula and engulfs it in mysticism, creating an experience that sticks fairly true to the mainline entry's loop while still very much being unique.
  <em>
   Retold
  </em>
  is mostly pitched as a "remaster," but that would be underselling the changes since they extend beyond improved graphics. World's Edge and Forgotten Empires implemented a range of quality-of-life adjustments to cater to a modern audience, all the while trying to respectfully retain the original game's rhythm and tone. The endeavor was mostly successful, resulting in a project that should hit the mark with both young and veteran RTS fans.

 <p>
  As with nearly any great RTS game,
  <em>
   AoM: Retold
  </em>
  primarily boils down to effective planning and resource management. Each available myth has well-defined strengths and weaknesses, along with unique traits and god abilities that need to be properly analyzed and mastered. In terms of single-player content, there are campaigns containing unique missions that can keep people engaged for a while.
  <em>
   Retold
  </em>
  also supported co-op and PvP, with the latter likely determining the project's longevity.

  At this point, recommending the original

  and its sequel continue to be revisited all these years later. They are masterpieces that set the standard for an entire genre, and their influence can still be seen in the countless retro boomer shooters that are released every single year.

  2024 has not been stacked with Xbox console exclusives so far, but Ninja Theory's
  <em>
   Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2
  </em>
  stands as a proud and powerful exception. Similar to its predecessor, the fantastic
  <em>
   Senua's Sacrifice
  </em>
  , the sequel is very much a unique beast that focuses on telling a character-driven story, with combat and puzzles taking a backseat throughout most of the campaign. That's not to say players will be just watching a glorified movie play out, as they will find themselves engaging in some fairly intense battles throughout Senua's journey. However, the combat exists entirely in service of the narrative and is only marginally better than the first game.

 <p>
  <em>
   Hellblade 2
  </em>
  should be entered as blindly as possible, especially since most people will probably only stick around for a single playthrough (that will be relatively short). While avoiding specific spoilers, it can be revealed that the sequel focuses more on Senua's connections with the living rather than the dead. Also, the game is genuinely gorgeous, perhaps to the point of being the best-looking title on the Xbox Series X.

  The entirety of the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise took a lengthy hiatus from PC after its initial outing with
  <em>
   Combat Evolved
  </em>
  , but all of that finally changed in 2019 — when the
  <em>
   Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  finally migrated to PC. Now mouse-and-keyboard warriors can follow the whole of Spartan-117’s saga and indulge in the full suite of multiplayer offerings alongside their Xbox brethren.

  The
  <em>
   MCC
  </em>
  is virtually a crown jewel on the Xbox side of Game Pass, and it loses very little of that status in its transition to PC.20greatest achievements of the 2010s. So, does this make it a must-play for anyone with a PC Game Pass subscription? Well, yes and no. If someone loves 2D platformers, they owe it to themselves to try Extremely OK Games' title. However,
  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  is a hard-as-nails precision platformer that can be exhausting for anyone who is not really looking for an especially difficult challenge. It is not particularly accessible.

  Unlike quite a few entries in the genre,
  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  has a pretty in-depth story. Players control Madeline, a woman who goes on a soul-searching journey to climb Celeste Mountain. Touching upon mature themes like depression, the platformer is surprisingly character-driven, and its punishing gameplay reflects Madeline's journey.

  Angel Matrix's
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  took the world by storm in 2022, and the innovative platformer is a fantastic addition to PC Game Pass. Now, this is one of those projects that generally must be played to be properly understood, and it is entirely made by its controls, gameplay feel, and seamless blend of mechanics. Still, the core concept revolves around managing multipurpose cards to pick the best action in a given situation, all in the hopes of clearing out stages and reaching their endpoints.

  While the story is kind of weird,
  <em>
   Neon White
  </em>
  nails pretty much everything else. The visual style is slick and eye-catching, while the gameplay is fast-paced, satisfying, and strategic. The level design is consistently strong and caters to repeat attempts, particularly for players interested in speedrunning.

  should consider hopping into
  <em>

  Along the way, they will uncover an underlying storyline that will have them traveling all over the backyard to collect a variety of specialized computer chips. Players can embark on this journey by themselves or join in with up to three other friends, both of which should result in mostly enjoyable survival sandbox experiences. That said,
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  really comes alive in co-op, especially since players take on four different characters who can pursue unique and complementary builds.

  After spending almost a year in early access on Steam,
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  made its full debut on October 20, 2022. The top-down roguelike has been nothing short of a colossal hit, and it has received plenty of updates over the last year. After selecting one of
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  ' available characters, players drop into a stage where they are bombarded by waves of enemies. The goal is to simply survive until the time limit while upgrading weapons, unlocking power-ups, and gaining gold coins.

  Although initially seeming very simple, this indie darling has surprising depth thanks to its wide variety of characters and weapons, all of which require a lot of effort to fully master. Even unlocking everything is hard work.
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  is a great
  <strong>
   PC Game Pass game
  </strong>
  with a gameplay loop perfect for a subscription service that encourages playing multiple titles simultaneously.

  <em>
   SteamWorld
  </em>
  is an odd duck that refuses to stick to a single genre, with most games seemingly exploring new avenues that are only loosely connected to their predecessors and successors. Despite this suggesting inconsistency, to its credit, the franchise has rarely set a foot wrong, with basically every game having something to offer and being worthwhile additions to their genre.
  <em>
   SteamWorld Dig 2
  </em>
  was something of an exception as it was the IP's first sequel, and it specifically sought to fine-tune the 2013 project to craft an experience that is strictly an evolution rather than a complete renovation.

 <p>
  SteamWorld Dig 2 is fantastic and close to the franchise's pinnacle, although opinions will depend on the player's preferred style of game. The sequel is an explorative Metroidvania that casts players as a digger who must traverse a labyrinth under a Western town in search of resources they can then sell off. Naturally, they will have to fight a lot of enemies along the way, all the while unlocking an ever-expanding arsenal of gadgets and abilities.

  <em>
   SteamWorld

  can seem a bit unapproachable due to its scattershot approach to game design, but
  <em>

  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
  </em>
  took the most popular sci-fi franchise of all time and gave it a Soulslike makeover. While not perfect (a tolerance for backtracking is required), the marriage was generally fruitful, and the game balanced story progression, combat, and puzzles fairly well. Unsurprisingly, in 2023, a sequel found its way to current-gen systems and PC, and it was arguably an improvement over its predecessor in nearly every area. However,
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  's launch was muddied by performance issues, specifically on PC. Although not usually unplayable (although a person's mileage may vary),
  <em>
   Survivor
  </em>
  suffered from framerate drops and stuttering, even on high-end systems. Post-game patches improved a few things but hardly everything; consequently, even now, players should be prepared for the occasional glitch.

 <p>
  Now that
  <em>
   Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  is on PC Game Pass, people who were put off by the negative press can finally give it a try without worrying too much about wasting their money. Bugs and glitches aside, this title has a lot of things going for it. The story builds very nicely on Cal Kestis' journey in
  <em>
   Fallen Order
  </em>
  , expanding not only his moveset but also his character in the process. The campaign features an impressive array of worlds, including returning favorites and new planets, and they are brought to life beautifully. Fine-tuned and improved with a few new options, the combat and traversal mechanics are slightly improved as well, although they are still quite similar to the first game.

  Mostly developed by one creator and currently in Game Preview,
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  is a medieval sim that blends a few genres: survival, city-builder, and tactics. While the latter appears in the form of occasional battles with neighboring towns or bandits, the former elements take center stage during most playthroughs, and they are handled with care and creativity. As suggested by the title,
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  is all about setting up a settlement during the Middle Ages, a journey that starts small but ambitious and gradually snowballs into expansive and ambitious.

 <p>
  City-builders tend to cast players as deities towering over their creations, setting them apart from the worlds they rule.
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  shakes this formula up by placing players in the dirt alongside their citizens, all of whom are treated as people with personalities rather than just numbers. Surviving is a group effort that requires everyone to pitch in, and
  <em>
   Manor Lords
  </em>
  allows players to make the necessary choices to facilitate this mentality and then witness the fruit of their labor. While still a work in progress, this title is already among the most exciting
  <strong>
   PC Game Pass games
  </strong>
  .

  Atlus'
  <em>

  <em>

  games are firmly established as cornerstones of the turn-based JRPG world. While the selection is not quite as robust as it used to be, PC Game Pass players still have a couple of Atlus options at their fingertips, including 2024's
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  . A full-blown remake of the 2006 PS2 classic, this edition retains most of the original's story beats and mechanics, all the while providing a few quality-of-life adjustments along with far improved visuals akin to

  showcases not only Atlus' license at its best but also serves as a prime example of the JRPG genre's potential to craft dense narratives with lovable characters, strategic combat, and stellar world-building.

  When it comes to sports games, there seems to be no middle ground. Either they hog all of somebody's time and energy or they are the worst thing to happen to gaming. If nothing else, these annual releases attract passionate responses, be it positive or negative. Out of all these franchises, EA's soccer games are arguably the most divisive, something that survived a change in branding (from
  <em>
   FIFA
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   EA Sports FC
  </em>
  ).

  As with most of these yearly releases,
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 24
  </em>
  was added to Game Pass as the standard club season ended and the project's relevancy started to draw to a close, with a sequel likely debuting around September 2024. That said, the EURO 2024 tournament extended soccer/football fever for an extra month, causing the game to receive noteworthy updates for a while longer than usual. Nevertheless,
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 24
  </em>
  's peak has passed.

 <p>
  These Game Pass sports additions are strange since they are targeting people who are, at best, mildly interested in jumping into career mode for a season or two. At this point, players who might genuinely enjoy
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 24
  </em>
  have long since decked out their Ultimate Teams; consequently, the game can only really be recommended to lapsed players or newcomers who might be tempted to purchase the next edition. Before investing cash in
  <em>
   FC 25

  , give its predecessor a try to see if it manages to keep your interest beyond a few matches.

  Starting 2024 on an exciting note,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  launched directly on Game Pass, although it is still in Game Preview (basically, early access). An open-world survival game where players catch monsters and engage in third-person shooter action, Pocket Pair's title sounds like a fever dream that haphazardly blends inspirations, genres, and selling points to create a malformed mess weighed down by ambition; except, it is pretty great.

 <p>
  Although still an in-development project,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is already an easy recommendation thanks to its addictive gameplay loop, immersive world, a robust selection of Pals, and accessible but engaging survival mechanics. The latter arrives in the form of base building and meter management, both of which are enhanced through Pals that can fulfill roles within their master's home. Battles are chaotic and fun, especially when played in co-op. While still too early to say,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  should go down as one of the
  <strong>
   best PC Game Pass games
  </strong>
  of 2024.

  Available through EA Play (and Game Pass Ultimate), the
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  remake revamps the 2008 sci-fi horror classic, delivering a package that honors its predecessor while still taking enough risks to present a fresh experience. While the story hits most of the same beats, the journey itself can feel wildly different due to the implementation of a more open-ended map and the distribution of items like weapons and suits.

  Newcomers who have never played a
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  project can jump directly into the remake without feeling lost. Meanwhile, long-time fans who adore the 2008 masterpiece should give the remake a try since it is not simply the same experience with a fresh coat of paint.

  While
  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  fans have presumably anticipated many things about
  <strong>
   <em>
    GreedFall 2: The Dying World
   </em>
  </strong>
  , there's a good chance its new companions have taken precedence in that anticipation. This is largely due to how much impact
  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  's companions had on its story and the game's following, so looking forward to what
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  may bring to the table in terms of companions would be understandable.

  's current early-access content, with three more still to appear in the game by the end of the upcoming winter season.

  Nilan Is a Fierce Doneigad and a Close Friend of the Protagonist
 </h3>
 <p>
  Nilan is one of the more notable companions in
  <em>
   GreedFall 2: The Dying World
  </em>
  , simply due to his pre-existing relationship with Vriden Gerr,
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  's protagonist and player character. The two have been friends since childhood and Nilan becomes one of the player's companions within
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  's first few minutes, as both he and Vriden Gerr are on their way to be initiated as Doneigad. As far as his personality goes, Nilan is a very fierce and stubborn person of conviction. As a native of Teer Fradee and a Doneigad, he feels very responsible for taking care of his people and their island. His impulsive nature often threatens to get him into trouble, but his loyalty to his people is unmatched, remaining slow to trust anyone else.

 <p>
  Fausta is another companion players should meet within
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  's first few hours, so long as they stay on track with the main story. Fausta was born in Theleme, but she was banished and sent to prison because she "saw things [she] wasn't supposed to see," hence why Vriden Gerr ends up meeting her in prison in Olima. Fausta could be considered the literal definition of a "smooth criminal" simply due to her uncanny ability to change her personality to better suit her audience.

  Sybille Is a Member of the De Vespe Family Who Is Slow to Trust Others
 </h3>
 <p>
  Players will meet Sybille almost immediately after they meet Fausta in
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  , as she breaks Vriden Gerr, Nilan, and Fausta out of prison. Sybille is a member of the De Vespe family and somewhat shares a quality with
  <em>
   GreedFall
  </em>
  's De Sardet in that she is a former Legate of the Congregation of Merchants. Unlike most of
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  's companions, Sybille is almost all business. This ultimately means she shares Nilan's apprehension, as her trust is not liberally given away. She also exudes confidence, to the point that it can often come across as pure haughtiness to the unacquainted, and she has a habit of making light of things, no matter how serious they may be.

 <h3 id="alvida-is-an-honest-but-defiant-naut-of-conviction">
  Alvida Is an Honest but Defiant Naut of Conviction
 </h3>
 <p>
  While players will meet Alvida a bit sooner, she becomes a companion within minutes of the encounter with Sybille and Fausta in prison. Alvida is a longtime friend of Sybille's and a Naut with a strong conviction to do what is right and a heart of gold, no matter how much her reputation or pocketbook is put at stake. Alvida's strong desire for justice makes her quick to defy overbearing and dishonorable authority. Being a Naut, one would think her loyalty is given solely to her faction, but injustice is a deal-breaker for her. As such, although Vriden Gerr and Nilan are captured and taken from Teer Fradee on the Naut ship on which Alvida is a crew member, she still deserts her crew to save the two natives in an attempt to make amends.

  Ludwig Is a Sarcastic Former Soldier of the Deutan Empire
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ludwig is yet another companion players will meet shortly after arriving in Olima in
  <em>
   GreedFall 2
  </em>
  's main story. As a smuggler, Ludwig possesses knowledge of every backroad between Olima and Deutan and thereby becomes immediately useful to Vriden Gerr and Nilan after their escape from prison. Ludwig's personality and ideals could be described as a blend of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood and Harrison Ford's Han Solo. So much of what Ludwig says has a hint of sarcasm, yet he is very earnest in his desire to see the poor remunerated for their sufferings inflicted by the wealthy.

   Blue Prince
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dispatch

  <em>
   Cronos: The New Dawn

  When it comes to the best overall deals,

  <em>

  are some of the clear highlights.
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  is the only one among these large price cuts that wasn't released this year, so it's exciting to see so many fresh games get such substantial discounts. Games like
  <em>
   ARC Raiders
  </em>
  already have budget-friendly price points, but an extra discount on top of its usual pricing may entice some curious gamers to finally give the increasingly popular extraction shooter a try. Other discounted titles like
  <em>
   Silent Hill f
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  have only been out for a few months, so the sale also introduces a great opportunity to catch up with some of the year's most recent releases.

  Regardless of one's gaming preferences, Steam's annual Winter Sale offers something for nearly everybody. Steam's free games are exciting enough, but when some of the most popular titles around get massive discounts, it further showcases why so many gamers love the platform. Steam has built a solid reputation on giving gamers sales worth going wild over, and although the Winter Sale is short-lived, it's an exciting time for players to decide which games they want to jump into next.

      <title>"This is Wild" Xbox Game Pass Subscribers Don't Think Recent Additions Justify the Price Hike</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-new-releases-december-bad-price-increase-not-worth-it/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Some
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  subscribers aren't thrilled with some of the latest additions to the service, especially since the Ultimate tier now costs $30 per month instead of $20. Microsoft first caused an uproar when it made the decision to restrict most day one games to the Ultimate tier of Xbox Game Pass, and then it upset subscribers even further when it announced that the Ultimate tier's unfortunate price hike.
 </p>

 <p>
  Now, even though Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs $30 per month, someone that actually uses the service regularly should still be getting their money's worth and then some.
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  players who were signed up for Fortnite Crew actually save a couple of bucks now because those benefits are now a part of Game Pass Ultimate. But there are many subscribers who have decided that $30 doesn't justify the price of admission and have ditched their subscription as a result. Microsoft will need to make sure that there is a constant stream of high-quality games added to Game Pass Ultimate if it wants to keep people signed up, and it seems that it is failing to do so in the eyes of some fans.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <h2 id="xbox-game-pass-subscribers-aren-39-t-happy-about-the-latest-games">
  Xbox Game Pass Subscribers Aren't Happy About the Latest Games
 </h2>
 <p>
  A Reddit post by ZTK94 throws shade at the recent Game Pass Ultimate additions, which include
  <em>
   Bratz: Rhythm &amp; Style
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Ultimate Sheep Raccoon
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   A Game About Digging a Hole
  </em>
  . Over 1,000 other Reddit users have upvoted the post, clearly agreeing with the premise that it's "wild" for Microsoft to raise the price of Game Pass Ultimate and then offer these particular games in return. Unfortunately for subscribers that are unhappy with the latest games, there will be no new Game Pass games added for the rest of the year.
 </p>
 <p>
  But while some of the more recent Game Pass additions may be underwhelming, it's worth pointing out that 2025 has otherwise been an incredible year for Game Pass. Game of the Year winner
  <em>
   Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
  </em>
  was a day one Xbox Game Pass game, and
  <em>
   Blue Prince
  </em>
  , which has the same 92 Metacritic score as
  <em>
   Expedition 33
  </em>
  , was also available day one on the service. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers were also treated to blockbuster games like
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
  </em>
  this year, among many other titles.

 <h2 id="xbox-game-pass-has-big-plans-for-2026">
  Xbox Game Pass Has Big Plans for 2026
 </h2>
 <p>
  So far, there are only five Xbox Game Pass games with
  <em>
   confirmed
  </em>
  release dates for 2026. Two Xbox Game Pass games are dropping in January, with Metroidvania
  <em>
   Mio: Memories in Orbit
  </em>
  releasing as a day one game on January 20, and
  <em>
   Nova Roma
  </em>
  coming to PC on January 22.
  <em>
   Menace
  </em>
  will be added on February 5, while comedy FPS
  <em>
   High on Life 2
  </em>
  is making its debut on February 13. Finally, the long-awaited
  <em>
   Replaced
  </em>
  will be joining Game Pass on March 12.
 </p>
 <div class="valnet-gallery images-count-4">
  <div class="article__gallery image-masonry masonry-images-4" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-96370580" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-96370580" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-96370580" data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-96370580" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-96370580-img" data-gallery-type="image_masonry" id="article-gallery-1-96370580">
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  But those games are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to new Game Pass games for 2026. While they don't have specific dates just yet, we do know that Microsoft plans on releasing the
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  reboot, the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  remake,
  <em>
   Forza Horizon 6
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  next year to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of Xbox. We also know that there will be over 75 new day one games added to Ultimate, so subscribers should have plenty to look forward to. Whether the new games justify the price increase is going to be on a case-by-case basis, however.
 </p>
 <p>
  Budget-minded gamers or those that simply do not want to pay more for Game Pass Ultimate may want to start simply being more selective when they are signed up for it. Just wait until a day one Game Pass game comes around that you really want to play, and
  <em>
   then
  </em>
  upgrade your tier or sign up. Then cancel when you've had your fill. This way, you can still enjoy Game Pass Ultimate's benefits without taking too much of a hit from the price hike.

  When

  teased the Cold Snap update for December 2025, one of the first reveals was the Guitar instrument. What players didn't know, however, was that the Guitar wasn't the only new addition. The update also introduced a percussive instrument called the Shaker, which players could obtain and play for some topside music vibes.

  The Shaker is a Residential item, which means you're more likely to find it in apartments. A good spot to check is the Pale Apartments in the Dam Battlegrounds, a relatively calm area that gives players plenty of time to search.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's no guaranteed way to get the Shaker right now, as it's entirely RNG-based. However, focusing on Residential areas does increase your chances of finding one.

  To play the Shaker in a match, place it in your Quick Use slot. During the match, equip it and hold the left click—or whichever button you use to fire weapons—to start playing a song. To stop, simply release the button.

 <h2 id="what-playing-the-shaker-does">
  What Playing the Shaker Does
 </h2>
 <p>
  From the
  <em>
   ARC Raiders
  </em>
  ' 1.7.0 patch notes, we know that playing the Shaker applies the Vibing Status to nearby raiders. Early testing shows that this status triggers a small animation, causing nearby raiders to shake or bob their heads to the music.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's also been confirmed that when multiple players in the same area have the Vibing Status, their instruments sync, allowing them to play a rhythmic melody together using different items, like the flute and guitar.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the Vibing Status effect, the Shaker has another guaranteed effect: it attracts nearby ARC enemies. Like other instruments in
  <em>
   ARC Raiders
  </em>
  , playing the Shaker generates noise that can draw enemies and make the player an active target.

      <title>New Free PS5 Multiplayer Shooter Has Over 10,000 Dislikes on YouTube, But It's Unironically One of My Most Anticipated Games of 2026</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Highguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  , an upcoming free-to-play multiplayer shooter game in development for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, has been flooded with dislikes, but shooter fans should definitely still give it a chance. Developed by Wildlight Entertainment, a studio comprised of ex-Respawn Entertainment devs that worked on hit games like
  <em>
   Titanfall
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  is a bold new take on the hero-shooter genre, though it was unfortunately set up to fail at The Game Awards.

 <p>
  Besides awarding video game developers with trophies, The Game Awards is also known for its exciting world premiere announcements. The final announcement at The Game Awards usually has a great deal of hype behind it, and so there was a lot of anticipation as to what could possibly be revealed at the end of The Game Awards 2025. The show had already seen the return of Leon S. Kennedy, Casey Hudson confirmed as the director of
  <em>
   Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic
  </em>
  , and the shocking trailer for
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  developer Larian's next game,
  <em>
   Divinity
  </em>
  . As The Game Awards 2025 reached its conclusion, everyone was sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting to see what reveal could possibly top those big announcements. Unfortunately, there was no reality where the
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  reveal could live up to such lofty expectations, and so having it go on last as opposed to somewhere in the middle of the show did it absolutely zero favors and only amplified the internet hate for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hero-shooter genre has always been divisive. While
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  have proven to be massive hits,
  <em>
   OW2
  </em>
  has routinely found itself the center of controversy, and elements of these games bleeding into other shooter franchises have not been received well by fans. These factors have fueled general disdain for hero-shooters, and so when new hero-shooter
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  was the last announcement at The Game Awards 2025, it was met with severe backlash. To date, the
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  reveal trailer has
  <strong>
   over 10,000 dislikes on YouTube
  </strong>
  , and a measly 973 likes. Despite this, it's still one of my most anticipated games of 2026.

  Highguard Looks Like a Fresh Take on the Hero-Shooter Genre
 </h2>
 <p>
  If you don't like hero-shooter games, I can totally understand why you weren't intrigued by the
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  trailer. But I am someone that loves the genre, having played
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  religiously since the original game launched in 2016. I met one of my best friends in the game, and so it's a special one for me. My positive experiences in
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  (wildly toxic chat notwithstanding) have made me appreciate hero-shooters in general, and so I am always interested in giving a new one a try.
 </p>
 <p>
  I've played plenty of
  <em>
   Paladins
  </em>
  , and also played a lot of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  when it first came out. I was big into
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  when it first hit the scene as well, and I even enjoyed what I played of
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  , PlayStation's ill-fated attempt at a hero-shooter, was like a combination of
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  , but with the ugliest characters ever designed and a poorly thought-out live-service model. I maintain that the core gameplay in
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  was fun and that if it was free-to-play with better-looking characters, it wouldn't have died in two weeks like it did. As it stands, hardly anyone even bothered to play
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  , meanwhile, has to deal with the negative publicity from its announcement trailer, but it has some things working in its favor.

 <p>
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  's characters have yet to be fully detailed, but they already look a lot better than what
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  had to offer. The abilities in the trailer look derivative of other hero-shooters, but they still look impressive. And while we are still waiting on specifics of exactly how every match plays out, what was shown in the trailer looked like an intriguing new way to play a hero-shooter.

 <p>
  Based on
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  's announcement trailer, the gist of it is that players ride across a large battlefield on horseback (or bearback or pantherback), and fight over a sword that allows them to access and raid the enemy base.
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  gameplay looked plenty action-packed, and I am excited to give it a try for myself. Even if
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  ends up being another
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  as opposed to another
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  , it stands a much better shot at success right out of the gate by releasing as a free-to-play game.

  Highguard's Release Date is Right Around the Corner, and It's Free-to-Play
 </h2>
 <p>
  Most games announced at The Game Awards take years from their big reveal trailer to actually release, but
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  will mark a rare exception to the rule. Barring any unfortunate release date delays,
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  is set to launch on January 26 as a free-to-play experience. It will be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S at launch, which should do wonders for its player count.
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  , by comparison, released as a $40 game and was only available on PC and PS5.

 <p>
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  could still wind up being a bad game, but I am still greatly looking forward to it. Most hero-shooter games I've played are fun, and with
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  being free-to-play, there is literally zero financial risk to checking it out. I'll be seated for the
  <em>
   Highguard
  </em>
  release date on January 26 and can't wait to see how it turns out, despite how much hate it's currently getting.

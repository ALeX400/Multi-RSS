  <strong>
   Batman
  </strong>
  video games have allowed fans to truly experience what it feels like to be Batman. With this added immersion, these games have produced some of the best versions of Batman to date, with the Batman from the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  series being regarded as one of the best versions of Batman across all Batman media and content.

 <p>
  A key reason for these video games producing such great versions of Batman is the amount of time players can spend with these characters. The
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  series alone is estimated to take around 60 hours to complete when playing at a leisurely pace. This playtime dwarfs most other Batman content, with
  <em>
   The Dark Knight
  </em>
  trilogy taking just under 8 hours to finish, and the fan-favorite Batman: The animated series taking around 38 hours to complete. The amount of time players have with these characters has allowed for some great quotes and scenes that leave players in awe. Here's a look at some of the best quotes from Batman video games.

  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  has some of the best interrogation scenes that fans have ever seen in Batman-related content. While Batman is trying to track down Scarecrow, he comes across one of
  <em>
   Arkham Knight's
  </em>
  mercenaries and brutally integrates him.

 <p>
  After threatening to break every bone in the man's body, he finally gets a potential location for Scarecrow's whereabouts. Just before leaving, Batman says "If you're lying, I'll break the other one!". The confused mercenary responds with "The other wha…" but before he can finish his sentence, The Dark Knight snaps the man's arm in one brutal movement. The quote is a fan favorite for showing a darker and more aggressive side to Batman that fans don't get to see too often.

  The
  <em>
   Lego Batman
  </em>
  series is a fan favorite for its more comical and joyful take on the Batman character. Despite its playful style, there are a few times in the
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  games where the story takes a more serious turn.

  In
  <em>
   Lego Batman 3
  </em>
  , during the mission Breaking The Ice, Brainiac takes control of Superman. Despite our hero's best efforts, Superman is still under the control of Brainiac. As Superman Grabs Batman and is about to crush him, Batman opens up to him and makes a last-ditch effort to break him free of Brainiac's control. Batman expresses himself in an emotional scene, stating that he fears losing his best friends.

  In

  , while trying to track down the Black Mask, Batman encounters the monstrous Killer Croc. During a vicious beat down, Batman asks Killer Croc, "Your Boss. Where's he going?", after receiving a response he doesn't like, Batman punches Killer Croc, saying "You want teeth. I want answers."

 <p>
  This has become a fan-favorite quote, especially because right after saying this, Batman immediately hits Killer Croc, knocking out some of his teeth. This quote perfectly reflects the aggression and impatience of Batman during
  <em>
   Arkham Origins
  </em>
  , and combined with the excellent performance from Roger Craigh Smith, creates a memorable scene.

  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  is often regarded as the best Batman game of all time. From start to finish, this game has one of the best Batman storylines in all Batman-related media, and when combined with the excellent gameplay and world-building, it is easy to see why this game is so beloved by many.

  During the final showdown with the Joker, Batman has the cure that will save the Joker's life. Before Batman can decide whether to save the Joker or let him succumb to his illness, the Joker stabs Batman, causing him to drop the cure as it smashes onto the floor. As they both realize the Joker is going to die, Batman says this quote revealing that as evil as the Joker is, he would still have stuck to his code and tried to save his life. This is one of the best examples of Batman sticking to his code no matter who needs saving.

  Despite the controversy surrounding the overuse of the Batmobile in
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  , fans can all collectively agree that the first time players get to see the Batmobile in this game is one of the best scenes from the franchise.

  After saving Officer Kavern, he mentions to Batman that the city is overrun, and implies there is nothing they can do. When Batman walks towards the edge of the building, the Officer asks him what he is doing. Batman simply replies "Evening the odds." the player is then prompted with a button titled 'Even The Odds'. The player then gets to witness one of the coolest scenes in the franchise as the Batmobile drives to Batman's location, and he jumps in.

  <em>
   Arkham Knight

  has some of the most memorable Batman scenes of all time. After the Scarecrow rigged a chemical bomb big enough to engulf Gotham in fear of toxin, Batman takes it upon himself to attempt to save as many people as possible by reducing the blast radius.

  He did this despite knowing that he would have to remain at the source of the blast, as he worked until the last second. While talking to Alfred on his earpiece, fans get to hear one of the most emotional quotes from Batman from as he recalls how Alfred raised him to always do the right thing, and despite Alfred begging him to leave, he chooses to stay. Adding to the emotion of the scene, he ends the conversation with "Goodbye Alfred".

  During a heated argument with Alfred, Batman drops one of the most hard-hitting quotes in the series. As Batman is trying to go after Black Mask and his people, Alfred attempts to stop him stating that Bruce is "not some hardened vigilante".

 <p>
  This statement from Alfred causes Batman to go off on a rant-like explication, where he states, among other hard-hitting truths, that “He is the reason the criminals breathe easier when the sun rises.” This quote shows the confidence and aggression of this young Batman, as he implies that the criminals of Gotham fear him so much that come the daytime they are relieved to have survived the night without an encounter with The Dark Knight.

  <em>

  Many fans have a love-hate relationship with the
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  games and the overall
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  storyline. Although an evil Superman-style character is all too common these days, many fans were introduced to the idea with
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  At the end of
  <em>
   Injustice 2
  </em>
  , as Batman and Superman prepare for one last showdown, they share some words where Batman says "I miss the people we were then", referring to before Superman killed the Joker and started his regime, and Superman replies with "Me too". Considering the development of these two characters in the
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  story, this was a heartfelt quote that perfectly reflected the regrets both characters had.

 <p>
  The quote is arguably one of the most famous Batman quotes of all time and was delivered by Kevin Conroy in the original show and in the game, making it an even more exciting callback to many fans. Not only was the quote an exciting callback, but with a fresh delivery and new context, it made for an extremely memorable and powerful scene.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  player online has noticed a bizarre detail involving bodies falling from the sky in the new Zombies map, Liberty Falls. Gamers are still finding all the hidden secrets in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , but this is surely one of the strangest discoveries yet.

 <p>
  At launch, there are two maps in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies maps: Terminus and Liberty Falls. Both have their own share of hidden secrets for players to find, and it'll likely be a long time before everything is unraveled by the community. Gamers have already figured out the steps to complete the Liberty Falls main quest in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies, but that doesn't mean there isn't more hidden away by Treyarch. This falling bodies Easter egg isn't related to the main quest in any way, but still represents an interesting find in its own right.

 <p>
  Redditor MidnightMarauder427 noticed something that piqued their interest in the new Liberty Falls
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies map. While at the map's church, they saw a small zombie head sitting near the top of the spire. It looks very out of place, so it's only natural to assume something is awry. Shooting the head did nothing, so they pulled the pin on a grenade, throwing it at the perfect moment so that it would explode near the head. After this, zombies began raining from the sky, and loot was even dropped for the player to collect. Interestingly, the player took damage whenever the zombies landed on top of them.

  In the short clip, MidnightMarauder427 also pointed out what they initially believed was a limb hanging from a tree outside the map. Gamers in the thread pointed out that this was actually a pair of bowling shoes, of which there are five littered around the map. Shooting all five of these shoes will teleport players to the Mister Peeks bowling alley Easter egg in

  At the moment, there's very little news on what the future holds for
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies regarding more new maps. Terminus and Liberty Falls have plenty to keep players busy for a while yet. Meanwhile, over in multiplayer, there's plenty to look forward to in the near future. Nuketown is coming back to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  on November 1, marking a return to the classic version featured in the original
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  . There's also the game's Season 1, which is rumored to start in mid-November, although no concrete date has been confirmed for this yet.

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds’ Oilwell Basin Looks Like the Series’ Most Unique Environment Yet</title>

 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </strong>

  will introduce players to Oilwell Basin, and it could turn out to be a stunning new location for the series. Considering how dynamic the world shown in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' trailers looked, it's natural to expect some of the series' more exciting environments to date. Thankfully, early indications are holding up in that regard, with Oilwell Basin being a notable example of such. From the theme to the name, there's a lot of potential for it to be one of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' more thrilling locations. From an early look, Oilwell Basin looks set to impress.

 <p>
  The environments of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  are building up to be some of the most dramatic thus far. The introduction of seasons, particularly the volatile Inclemency that comes with the change of seasons, provides a lot of variables that can shake up the new locations. That alone should offer plenty of content to keep players invested for a long time. After all, the monsters that populate the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  series need exciting environments to act as the arena for their hunts. So far it looks like
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  should have little difficulty in surpassing that requirement, especially with the new monsters in store.

  Oilwell Basin is Monster Hunter Wilds' Fiery New Environment

 <p>
  One eye-catching addition to
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' world map is Oilwell Basin. It's not the first volcanic environment in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  , but Oilwell Basin's aesthetic makes it hard to forget. In addition to rocky caverns and spouts of flame, there are fields of oil for hunters and monsters alike to traverse. In addition, some areas of the Basin look more like a burning building than a cave, with scaffold-like structures amid the blaze. The same oil can even be spotted dripping from these structures. Out of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  's volcanic locales, Oilwell Basin has a distinctly unsettling vibe that sets it apart.

The Rompopolo, Ajarakan, and the titular Black Flame could not look more suited to the environment, with the latter two being fire-wielding monstrosities, and Rompopolo and the Black Flame sharing an oil theme. Not only do all of them look fearsome, but their distinctive designs could lend themselves to some very cool equipment sets for victorious hunters. The footage of these monsters in the Basin, especially the horrific form of Black Flame itself, easily sell the area's dangerous nature.

  The Oil in Oilwell Basin Could Add an Explosive Twist to Hunts
 </h3>
 <p>
  One aspect of Oilwell Basin could provide fuel for a notable gimmick in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  . The oil that covers parts of the environment could play a significant role. For instance, oily areas could be more slippery, adding an extra obstacle for hunters without proper equipment. In addition, since the oil is clearly flammable, perhaps fire attacks could cause the oil to combust on hit, dealing area damage from the explosion. This would add extra utility to both fire attacks as well as flame-resistant equipment. With mechanics like these, Oilwell Basin would be a difficult biome to handle, but that could make it more exciting.

 <p>
  In regards to
  <em>
   Monster Hunter WIlds
  </em>
  ' locations, Oilwell Basin may be hard to top. Even with
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  lacking new weapons, the game still has many ways to innovate, with Oilwell Basin being a prime example. It's a twist on a volcanic biome with a unique identity thanks to the oil theme, and monsters that match it perfectly. If it fully leans into its theme, then it should prove a highly memorable locale. If Oilwell Basin is any indication,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' biomes will be well worth exploring.

  Unlike most
  <em>

  challenges, players don’t have to start a new life for the Oogity Boogity Boo challenge. Furthermore, it doesn’t require any specific gender either. If you’ve already got a character with a high health stat, you are good to go.

 <p>
  Living a long life in
  <em>
   Bitlife
  </em>
  can be a bit challenging, but there are some things that players can try to improve their chances. First off, make sure your character has high health and happiness stats.

 <p>
  To stay healthy, go to the Mind and Body tab and pick the Mediterranean Diet. Furthermore, your character should go to the gym regularly, Players can do that by going to the Activities tab, then Mind and Body, and choosing Gym. Furthermore, make it a habit to visit the doctor regularly to catch any health issues early on. And as a final tip, keep your character out of trouble and avoid any fights or crimes.

 <p>
  Having said that, reaching age 80 mainly depends on luck. Your character might unexpectedly die while sleeping or catch a serious disease. If that happens, Bitizens will have to create a new character and restart the challenge. But if you keep your character healthy and happy, you’ve got a good chance of living to 80.

      <title>Subnautica 2's Map Expansion Can Go Above and Beyond The Original's in a Big Way</title>

  The original
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  is often heralded as one of the greatest exploration games of all time, yet
  <em>
   <strong>
    Subnautica 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  has the opportunity to deliver an even more fleshed-out world than its predecessor thanks to plans for the game to feature a much more ambitious map size. For it to really achieve that, though,
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  is likely going to have to do a few things differently than the first game. While the sequel shouldn't stray too far from the formula that defines the franchise,
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  will be taking players to an entirely new planet, and with this new setting comes endless possibilities.

  Following the game's official reveal earlier this October, which gave fans a look at

  's first official teaser trailer, developer and animator Scott MacDonald - otherwise known as Obraxis - hinted that the team plans to deliver a bigger and deeper map in

  by the time of the game's official 1.0 release. This hyped up the
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  community even further, of course, with many fans having hoped for years that the next game in the series would bring an expanded map, particularly after
  <em>
   Subnautica: Below Zero
  </em>
  left many fans of the original game's scarier theme concerned that the franchise was moving in a different direction.

 <p>
  Obviously, a bigger and better map would be good news for fans. It's rarely a bad thing to have more space to explore, but in a way not seen in most games, environments throughout the
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  series benefit hugely from verticality. Depth is a significant aspect of the game, as players are forced to discover and manufacture new technologies and upgrades to reach these deeper areas. A greater range of depth also allows for a more diverse range of biomes and ecosystems, though, as the darker and colder depths force life to develop and adapt differently to life that flourishes in the sunlit shallow waters.

 <p>
  With that in mind,
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  has the potential to fill a larger map not just with more distinct biomes, but also a greater diversity of life in general. Discovering the many alien creatures that inhabit the world of
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  is a big part of what makes the games' exploration so exciting in the first place. It's very likely that alien creatures will be even more valuable to players in the sequel, since
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  is set to involve gene modification mechanics which will allow players to infuse alien DNA and develop new abilities as a result.

  But above all that, deeper and darker expanses of explorable ocean give the developers room to create some seriously terrifying new settings. While
  <em>
   Subnautica: Below Zero
  </em>
  generally featured more shallow environments,
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  could very well build on the first game's sense of fear that builds when plunging into deep, black waters for the first time. More expansive underwater environments also allow for the introduction of new leviathan-class creatures which are physically larger than those that the previous games offered.

  Subnautica 2 Shouldn't Repeat One of The First Game's Mistakes
 </h3>
 <p>
  For
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  's environments to really shine, the game will have to give each of them a real reason to visit - especially the dark and dangerous ones. The original
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  offered a sizeable map to explore, and while all of it is worth seeing at least once, many of the biomes further out from the shallows offer many of the same resources and creatures. While generally more rich in resources,
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  's biomes such as the dunes and mountains are also heavily populated with dangerous leviathans, making them less than ideal to mine in compared to other, safer regions which offer the same loot.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":476} -->
 <p>
  The abundance of Reaper leviathans in such biomes also has a tendency to discourage new players from exploring the environments at all, rendering a great deal of the map space that's rarely touched by first-time players. Despite the criticism
  <em>
   Subnautica: Below Zero
  </em>
  gets, it actually did well to solve these problems despite featuring a smaller overall map size, with almost all of its biomes offering resources and creatures that couldn't be found anywhere else.
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  would do well to make the best of both worlds, opening up a massive new world with distinct biomes that can offer
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  fans totally new and distinct experiences - giving them a good enough reason to get out and see it all.

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077: Project Orion Can't Walk Back One Phantom Liberty Addition</title>

  Despite launching in a state as rough as the relic chip lodged in its protagonist's brain,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  was eventually able to fulfill many players' pre-release expectations. CD Projekt Red's post-launch patches and updates culminated with the simultaneous releases of Update 2.0 and the
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  DLC last September. In addition to
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's new espionage storyline, this major content drop overhauled multiple gameplay systems and gave players the ability to further fine tune their version of V.

  With the game's sequel — currently codenamed Project Orion — in development, there are plenty of lessons CD Projekt Red can learn from their work on Update 2.0 and
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  . While some changes like the clothing system rework in Update 2.0 could be left behind, one mechanic added in the DLC absolutely needs to make its way into the next entry in the series: relic points.

 <p>
  Unlike many of the changes that came with this update, the relic point system could only be used by players who bought
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  and explored the dark underbelly of Dogtown. By venturing into this new zone, players were able to obtain relic points by downloading them from the many Militech data terminals scattered across the map. The points could be used to fill out a new skill tree associated with V's biochip from the main story.

 <p>
  Not only were the relic points integrated into
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's narrative, but the upgrades they provided made V feel far more powerful than they did prior. V could choose to jailbreak the already deadly cyberware housed in their arms, visualize weakspots on enemies to deal additional critical damage, utilize optical camo during combat, and more. This system paired nicely with the perks and cyberware in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  as it allowed players to further customize V and noticeably enhance their combat performance.

  A Relic-Fueled Power Fantasy in Night City
 </h3>
 <p>
  Especially if the Tower ending from
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  is ignored and V somehow returns as the protagonist in Project Orion, CD Projekt Red should leave the relic point system intact. It's a popular trend in video game sequels — one example being
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
  </em>
  — to completely strip a protagonist of the upgrades that they earned in the previous title. This is done so that the designers can implement a natural power curve for the player's progression and not have to balance their encounters around high level abilities from a prior game.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1072} -->

 <p>
  Though this design mentality is understandable from a developer's perspective, it remains highly unpopular among players. Nobody wants to grind out hours and hours of playtime only to acquire a fraction of the power that they just had at the end of the previous game. Project Orion should fully embrace the power fantasy that
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  provided its players. Give players a majority of V's abilities from the previous game and make that the baseline for progression in this next game. That might seem difficult to balance, but the Cyberpsychosis from
  <em>
   Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
  </em>
  could be brought over as a perfect way to allow for overpowered builds while still encouraging players to consider moderation.

 <p>
  Even if V isn't the main character of this next entry, relic points — or a reskinned version of them that suits the new narrative — are a needed inclusion. The powers they bestowed were instrumental in curating the hectic yet fluid gameplay of
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  , and the relic points also gave players a worthwhile reason to explore CD Projekt Red's intricately crafted world. The value that relic points added to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  shouldn't be overlooked, especially when deciding what features will make the cut in Project Orion.

  A new leak from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  is hinting at a major rerun gacha banner set to arrive during Version 2.6, seeing the return of one of the game's most popular characters. The massively popular sci-fi RPG from HoYoverse has introduced plenty of unique new characters to the game, while also offering numerous chances to pick up past members. Each update to
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  typically features at least two rerun banners, bringing previously featured characters back into the spotlight. Now, one of the HoYoverse RPG's most powerful characters is rumored to be coming back.

 <p>
  <em>

  's Version 2.6 has already been teased to be a packed update with loads of new content coming to the RPG. Version 2.6 will debut one new character, with the Galaxy Ranger ninja Rappa joining the roster as a new five-star character. The update has also been the subject of several rumors about its featured content, teased to be bringing a new Trailblaze Continuance story quest to the game alongside the next expansion to the Simulated Universe game mode. Now, another Galaxy Ranger-adjacent character is expected to join Rappa's addition to the game.

According to the leak, the Version 2.6 update will feature the re-appearance of Acheron on the game's limited gacha banner, serving as one of the featured reruns.

 <p>
  Acheron's return to the gacha banner will see one of the game's most powerful characters once again available for players to pick up. Acheron is widely considered to be one of the strongest DPS units within
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , owing to her unique Ultimate as her main source of damage. Acheron also operates in a completely different playstyle than other characters in her Path, with
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's Nihility characters more typically focused on debuffs than raw damage.

 <p>
  The rumored appearance of Acheron in Version 2.6 comes as fans have been given plenty of teasers about future
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  characters. Leaks have heavily teased two fan-favorite characters arriving within the next few updates, including the long-awaited release of Sunday and a new version of Tingyun. Early leaks have even begun to hint at
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's next playable world, suggesting it may take inspiration from the Greek and Roman empires. Acheron's rerun joins a stacked lineup of characters said to be joining
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  throughout its upcoming patches.

  Capcom will continue to produce

  <em>

  Widely regarded as one of Capcom's most influential franchises,
  <em>
   Gyakuten Saiban
  </em>
  , known in most parts of the world as
  <em>

  Talking to Japanese media outlet and polling website Netlab, Capcom's Kenichi Hashimoto flat out declared that the company would not stop producing
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  content. Hashimoto, who produced the well-received
  <em>
   Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy
  </em>
  that launched in January, made similar remarks in a past interview. Capcom specifically wants to develop the
  <em>
   Gyakuten Kenji
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Ace Attorney Investigations
  </em>
  spin-off, in various ways, including through the lens of mixed media, Hashimoto told Netlab. He also said that the company wants
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  to reach its 25th and 30th anniversaries. The franchise's titular debut title initially released on the Game Boy Advance on October 12, 2001.

  Hashimoto was unable to disclose any details regarding
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  's developments, but he promised that Capcom would make an announcement about them in the future. His latest interview was published before the series' latest release,
  <em>
   Ace Attorney Investigations Collection
  </em>
  , came out on September 6. This compilation contains the two entries in
  <em>
   Ace Attorney Investigations
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Miles Edgeworth
  </em>
  and its sequel,
  <em>
   Prosecutor's Gambit
  </em>
  . The latter is considered by some to be among the best games in the entire
  <em>

  </em>
  franchise.

  The

  <em>

  A seventh mainline entry in the

      <title>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra Makes a Case for Its Independence in an Era of Franchise IPs</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
   </em>
  </strong>
  plants itself firmly in a singular year and a niche setting whether players actually get to see and explore Wakanda or not. It seems as if Wakanda won’t be part of the equation in
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  , though, at least with regard to Azzuri’s Black Panther and Nanali being in the most recent cinematic trailer’s snow-blanketed and occupied Paris, France. Either way, Skydance has pigeonholed the game’s narrative by restricting it to a specific timeframe as opposed to, say, the 1940s in general, and sequel potential is limited as a result unless it abandons its naming convention.

 <p>
  This may be precisely Skydance’s intent after all, and putting its foot down could be a genuine attempt at solidifying its vision for
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  without any consideration for where the story might be headed after credits roll. It would appear odd for a Marvel entity to not have an inkling of franchise potential even brainstormed given how that is a primary crux of popular culture, and yet developing
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  as a standalone game that doesn’t depend on future sequels or related spin-offs could grant it a level of authenticity that few Marvel endeavors have nowadays.

  Giving itself such a particular setting and specific title,
  <em>

  is declaring that it belongs inseparably to WW2. It’s difficult now to imagine how Skydance could hope to craft a series of related games based on this particular premise and it isn’t clear whether that is the goal or intent, but again it would be alarming if sequels weren’t already being theorycrafted with however Skydance chooses to conclude the story of
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  . Of course, not every game with a gargantuan IP needs to have its own franchise.

 <p>
  Knowing that Steve Rogers’ Captain America is inevitably frozen during WW2 and, once thawed, reawakens in the present day, it could be impossible for Skydance to resist the urge of having that be a post-credits scene if nothing else. Doing so would suggest that a sequel could depict the beginnings of an eventual Avengers game not unlike how the titular MCU movie was established and built up incrementally, and that could be a big mistake if it takes away from what is meant to make
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  special.

  A Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra Sequel Might Create an Awkward Narrative and Gameplay Dissonance
 </h3>
 <p>
  How Skydance is structuring its ensemble WW2-era Marvel game is exciting with four playable characters who all seem like they’d be polar opposites of each other in gameplay. Meanwhile, a sequel going that route with the Avengers would jeopardize the rarity of
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  ’s titular era while also jeopardizing the uniqueness of its playable cast, which would have an interesting choice to make regarding which characters on the Avengers roster are selected.

 <p>
  Hawkeye and Black Widow might be Avengers affiliates who don’t have powers or iconic equipment of their own, but they’re far more popular than Gabriel Jones and Nanali, who at least have obscurity on their side to make them narratively compelling characters in
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  . Skydance will hopefully look at
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  as a lone game unless it can justify sequels also taking place in the 1940s—if not, it risks bleeding into the same Marvel homogeneity that lacks an inspired, original take on the mythology.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  On June 13, 2022, Sony launched its new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  in North America. Split into three tiers, this model combines the previous version of PS Plus with PS Now; depending on which level someone subscribes to, they will gain access to certain services and games.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Essential ($9.99/month):
   </strong>
   This tier is the equivalent of the old PS Plus. A subscription includes online access, monthly free games, and discounts.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Extra ($14.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential tier benefits, Extra provides access to hundreds of PS4 and PS5 games.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Premium ($17.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential and Extra tier benefits, Premium includes a library of classic games (PS3, PS2, PSP, and PS1), trials, and cloud streaming in certain regions.

 <p>
  <strong>
   PS Plus Premium
  </strong>
  has over 700 games covering more than two decades of PlayStation history. Such a huge collection can be overwhelming, and the PS Plus app does not make it very easy to browse through the library; as such, it can be useful to know this tier's highlights before investing in a subscription. Each month, Sony adds a handful of new games. While most of these are PS5 and PS4 releases, they are occasionally accompanied by a few classic titles.

 <p>
  While not a common occurrence, PS Plus has steadily increased the number of Day One games. September 2024 had two such titles:
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  . The former launched directly on PS Plus Essential, granting subscribers one month to add the magical sports game to their libraries. Meanwhile, the latter is available to everyone committed to the Extra or Premium tiers, and it was the standout game of the month. All Possible Futures'
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  plays around with dimensions as it follows the hero of a storybook who jumps back and forth between their world and the real one. This whimsical premise lends itself well to an imaginative platformer that incorporates fun puzzles along with a bit of action.

 <p>
  Although someone's mileage may vary, this indie project has more than enough charm to warrant a quick try, and the campaign's opening hour should be enough for a player to determine if they want to sit through the whole thing. The PS5 does not have all that many platformers or top-tier family-friendly games, and
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  is among the console's best efforts in both categories.

  80% of PS Plus Premium subscribers will ignore
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  , and they might have no choice since it requires a PS VR2 headset. Consequently, one of the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus games
  </strong>
  will only be experienced by a very small group of players; however, anyone who has the required hardware should download Cloudhead's project ASAP. Sony has been steadily adding virtual reality games to the service since June 2024, and
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  is currently the top pick in this niche bracket.

  So, what is
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  ? Well, it is basically a modern take on the traditional on-rails shooter format, albeit with a beat thrown in for good measure. Across a series of stages, players will work their way through creative and fairly abstract levels filled with enemies that need to be shot down, all while a song plays in the background. While they don't have to shoot with the rhythm, players earn more points for doing so, and it is just satisfying to pull off.

 <p>
  Although not necessarily the deepest game ever,
  <em>
   Pistol Whip

  is simply fun and a great showcase of virtual reality's appeal and capabilities.

  For most months, picking the biggest new PS Plus Extra game is just a matter of personal taste; however, August 2024 was not one of those months. That's not meant as a criticism of games like
  <em>
   Wild Hearts
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Watch Dogs 2
  </em>
  , but rather a celebration of CD Projekt Red's RPG masterpiece.
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  was a landmark release for the genre, establishing a new era that emphasized storytelling, secondary content, and world-building more than ever before. While not flawless, the 2015 game is arguably timeless, at least up to this point. Hard as it is to believe,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  has been out for nearly a decade, and its shadow continues to loom large over RPGs and even CD Projekt Red specifically.

 <p>
  Due to its popularity and relative accessibility,
  <em>
   Wild Hunt
  </em>
  is probably not a new game for most PS Plus subscribers. Certain projects are so big that they stop being exciting additions to subscription services, simply since most people would already own them. Still, there must be a few exceptions who have never loaded up Geralt's final (full) chapter, and they can now experience the best console iteration since PS Plus Extra has both the PS5 and PS4 versions. They will find an ambitious and (at times) overwhelming open-world RPG with fully realized characters, immersive exploration, rich side quests, and a unique combat system.

  Is this the cutest cult simulator of all time?
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  is an unapologetically dark roguelite that follows a Lamb as they diligently work to set the stage for their god's return, a process that involves defeating four bishops, recruiting plenty of followers, and the occasional sacrifice. Roguelikes are a dime-a-dozen nowadays, and the genre can be automatically written off if someone does not see the appeal of endlessly replaying the same loop.

 <p>
  In cases like this, roguelites can act as a fun middle-ground between the replayable nature of roguelikes and more story-driven adventures, and
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  walks this line expertly. While, for the most part, players will revisit the same four (randomly generated) dungeons to try and clear them out and take out their bosses, they will constantly be recruiting new characters for their town/cult, which will further unlock new mechanics and upgrades.

 <p>
  Most importantly,
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  is just an absolute sinister delight that revels in macabre imagery and ideas. Along with just being very dark, the humor frequently hits the mark as it constantly pushes the envelope. Furthermore, the gameplay is rock-solid as well, be it the dungeon runs or the town-management aspect. The latter is arguably the best part of the game, as the followers have a ton of personality and evolve alongside the Lamb and cult.

  While
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  was the biggest PS Plus game of August 2024, an argument could be made that it was not the most exciting. In a move that was a long time coming, Free Radical Design's
  <em>
   TimeSplitters
  </em>
  trilogy finally made its way to modern systems, with all three PS2 games landing on the PS4 and PS5. These are mostly straight ports of the original versions, and they do show their age in a few ways. However, they are still fantastic console shooters that represent the genre at its early best, especially
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Both entries are great, and they also shine in somewhat different areas. In terms of pure gunplay,
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  is arguably the superior of the two games, and it still sits among the best shooters of all time. Although containing something resembling a plot, the story mode is mostly just a series of extraction-style maps, all of which are well-designed and a blast to master. As the franchise's title suggests, players travel through time, ensuring the stages have quite a bit of variety to them. Co-op is supported as well.

 <p>
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  has a far more robust and prominent story that creates a cohesive adventure rather than a loosely connected jumble of maps. While not high art, the campaign is fun in the way that a blockbuster can be. The gameplay is quite good, although it is notably less intense and frantic than
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  . Nothing wrong with that, but
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  feels a touch less special in this area.

     The first
     <em>
      TimeSplitters
     </em>
     has charm as well, but it is rightfully overshadowed by both of its sequels. To be clear, the 2000 release is worth a playthrough, as long as newcomers prepare themselves for a somewhat rough experience. Also, its gameplay is not that similar to
     <em>
      TimeSplitters 2
     </em>
     or
     <em>
      Future Perfect
     </em>
     , so do not ignore the latter if the former fails to strike a chord.

  Rockstar's portfolio is not over-represented by PS Plus, but the developer's biggest names are on Sony's service. Added back in May 2024 after already being removed once,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is still a big deal, despite the game being more than 5 years old by this point. An ambitious prequel to 2010's decorated Western,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  brings to life a unique period in American history: the end of the Frontier. The Van der Linde gang represents the dying Wild West, and Arthur Morgan specifically finds himself ripped out of time and in an era that no longer wants his type.

 <p>
  Offering a 50+ hour campaign,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  is an immersive open-world game that emphasizes character-driven storytelling, both in its main quests and also the optional content found across the map. The latter missions tell personal and often emotional stories, and they play a part in shaping Arthur Morgan's personality and (ultimately) destiny. The writing is superb, but that means nothing in the face of unenjoyable gameplay, and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is a peculiar case. Rockstar prioritizes authenticity, delivering an immersive gameplay loop that highlights the tedium that makes up an outlaw's ordinary everyday existence. This decision can be somewhat polarizing, but it does make for a unique experience.

  While the PlayStation 3 had a somewhat slow start to life, the console bowed out in style. Naughty Dog's
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is a haunting action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with infected creatures. The narrative follows the grizzled Joel and the immune Ellie as they travel across the United States in search of a group rumored to be able to craft a cure.

 <p>
  The journey is tough, brutal, and unforgettable. Both of the main characters undergo a great deal of development, particularly Joel, while
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  raises questions of morality through its ambiguous narrative. Even though PS Plus does not have the PS5 remake, the PS4 remaster of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  holds up well and offers a fantastic means to experience an industry-defining gaming story.

  FromSoftware has cornered the hard-hitting action RPG genre through its immaculate
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy, and that looks set to continue with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Out of all the studio's many great games,
  <em>

  There are a handful of
  <strong>
   PS Plus games
  </strong>
  that everyone with an account should play, and 2018's
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  should be at the top of that list. This "reboot" of the series sees Kratos living in a different part of the world, far from the Greecian roots players are used to seeing him in.

 <p>
  Kratos' move to Midgard gave developers a chance to shine a spotlight on some different gods, tapping into the deep Scandinavian folklore surrounding the Norse Gods and their mythology. With RPG elements, an incredible story, breathtaking visuals, and some awesome combat mechanics,
  <em>
   God of War

  is a
  <strong>

  While not unheard of, Day 1 PS Plus arrivals are rare, with most months not featuring this type of release. Consequently, whenever an exception materializes, it is always a cause for celebration; more importantly,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is an exceptional exception. Technically, Mintrocket's indie darling has been around since 2023, but it had to wait until April 16, 2024, to make its PlayStation debut, so it still counts as a Day 1 addition. When this year comes to an end,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  will almost certainly be remembered as one of the best PS Plus newcomers.

 <p>
  Combining restaurant management with fishing, Mintrocket created a package that feels oddly unique, despite sharing similarities with many other projects. As Dave, players have two general responsibilities: catch and serve fish. The former takes up the protagonist's days, forcing him to constantly make trips into an evolving ocean in search of materials that can be used to create sushi at his restaurant. Naturally, the nights are spent running the establishment, making sure that customers are satisfied. While the management aspect is not as deep as some other titles on the market,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  gives players more than enough control to make these segments engaging. However, the fishing element is the game's highlight and adds the most replay value.

  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  is without question the most famous horror franchise in gaming, and it is eternally linked to the PlayStation brand. Premium subscribers can play through a healthy selection of entries from Capcom's license, including classics such as
  <em>
   Resident Evil Code: Veronica X
  </em>
  , polarizing sequels like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  , and HD remasters of masterpieces like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  . The Extra tier does not have quite as robust of a catalog, although it includes two notable projects in 2019's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake and its sequel. When the main entries successfully shifted to a first-person perspective with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  , some fans might have feared that could spell an end for classic third-person releases; fortunately, Capcom relaxed those anxieties with a couple of stellar remakes.

  2020's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  is the weakest of Capcom's modern remakes, although it is still a solid action-horror game that does justice to the classic PS1 original. However,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is considerably more complete and satisfying, delivering a robust two-protagonist campaign that is consistently intense and terrifying. The controls are immaculate, the visuals are stunning, and the sound design is among the best in the genre – an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is almost the perfect horror game.

  One of the
  <strong>
   best PlayStation Plus games
  </strong>
  to launch on Day 1,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is an inspired Metroidvania with simple but effective controls. For the most part, the game sticks very close to the genre's standard formula of unbound exploration, puzzles, platforming, and the gradual reveal of new items that provide access to different areas; however, Shared Memory succeeded in stitching these well-worn pieces together to create something that feels at least somewhat fresh. A big part of this comes down to
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  's haunting aesthetic and ambient music, which combine to create a campaign oozing in atmosphere and style, making up for a lack of a conventional story.

 <p>
  Although fun, the platforming sections are quite easy, with most of the jumps providing players with plenty of room for error. However,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is still pretty darn difficult due to its puzzles, very open nature, and clever boss fights. The game's brainteasers often require lateral thinking (and clever use of a slink), while the latter could cause players to feel lost on occasion. That said, the in-game map is detailed and useful.

  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  is among the most high-profile PS5 games available on PS Plus Extra. As a console exclusive, this reveal seemed destined to transpire sooner or later, although almost two years from the game's debut had to pass for this moment to arrive.
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  might very well still be the most beautiful PS5 title on the market, a testament to Insomniac's mastery of technology and talent for creating vibrant and stunning worlds that would not look out of place in a Pixar movie.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  backs up its good looks with fantastic gameplay and an enjoyable story that allows its lovable characters to shine. Although Ratchet and his robotic companion take center stage, they are accompanied by a new playable Lombax in the form of Rivet, who also comes with her own partner. In combat, the characters largely control the same; however, the game does a great job of establishing Rivet's own identity through her personality.

 <p>
  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank
  </em>
  lives and dies on the strength of its gameplay, and
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  is right up there with the franchise's best efforts. Ratchet and Rivet have access to a wide assortment of fun weapons, all of which serve a purpose within the campaign.

  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11 S

  is on a whole other level as it is one of the best JRPGs on the PS4. Set in a vibrant world brimming with style and personality,
  <em>
   DQ11

  delivers familiar but addictive turn-based combat, lovable characters, and a simple but effective storyline.

 <p>
  Rather than reinventing a wheel that has never been broken,
  <em>
   DQ11
  </em>
  opts to modernize mechanics and concepts that have been successful for decades. Ultimately, this game just proves that

   Dragon Quest

  and
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  are fantastic and easy recommendations for anyone who enjoys shoot 'em ups or top-down shooters, respectively; however, Housemarque's portfolio seemed to be all leading to one particular project:
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  . Among the first titles to truly showcase the next-generation hardware, the 2021 release is still comfortably among the best PS5 games, even if it comes with a fairly steep learning curve.

  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  is a roguelike third-person shooter set on a strange alien planet. As Selene, players will have to make their way through six biomes, all of which are reasonably large, filled with secrets, feature unique enemies, and culminate in spectacular boss fights. Death means returning to the start or the mid-point, depending on how far someone managed to get. As with most roguelikes, players need to find and upgrade their weapons and stats during each run, and things like parasites and artifacts add extra nuance.

  The 2010s was the decade of indie games, so much so that it is near impossible to select the independent scene's crowning achievement for that period. That said,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is undoubtedly one of the top contenders. Inspired by the
  <em>
   Mother
  </em>
  series, Toby Fox's RPG follows a child as they explore the Underground, a seemingly typical monster-filled setting for the genre. Obviously, players can decide to adhere to RPG tradition and massacre everything that moves, but they do not have to do that.
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  does not force anyone to play a certain way, and players can follow a few different routes.

 <p>
  Blending meta-commentary with nuanced world-building and a strong narrative,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is the full package. Anyone remotely interested in RPGs or just gaming in general should give this seminal project a try, and the game's player-driven structure means multiple playthroughs are encouraged.

  While no longer exclusive to PlayStation consoles,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  will always be associated with Sony's brand to an extent. In recent years, Capcom has tried to lower the barrier of entry for the franchise, crafting projects that are more accessible in their opening hours, all the while retaining most of the earlier entries' depth.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  is the most beginner-friendly project in the series, and it comes with a short "campaign" that should teach the basics in roughly 10 hours. Just to be clear to people not familiar with
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  , finishing
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  's village quests and rolling the credits only means they have completed the tutorial. Now, they can focus on working through the Gathering Hub missions as they collect resources to craft better equipment, allowing them to take on harder quests that will reward higher-tier resources. Repeat the cycle until the end of time (or until it becomes dull).

 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  has a fairly simple formula, but it is expected to perfection. Lasting less than an hour at most (and usually considerably shorter), quests drop players in open but not massive maps which will have a few major monsters, including that mission's specific target. Players will then have to track down the enemy and slowly whack away at their health, all the while utilizing the tools at their disposal. Eventually, the fun comes in the preparation for each hunt, crafting a loadout designed to fully target a monster's weaknesses while elevating the hunter's strengths.
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  has a robust selection of weapon types as well, and they all control differently.

  PS Plus has more than a few Soulslike games, reflecting the genre's explosion in popularity over the last couple of years. In most cases, people's first exposure will be a FromSoftware project, be it
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  . These are all great places to start, but if the introductory game fails to hit the mark with a new player, they might conclude that Soulslikes are just not for them and ignore any releases by other developers. While most titles take heavy inspiration from the
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  games, the genre has enough variety to offer genuine alternatives that do their own thing. Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  games serve as prime examples of Soulslikes with unique identities that set them apart from their contemporaries. The first game is not available on PS Plus, but Sony's subscription service has the (arguably) superior sequel.

  Starting with the most "obvious" distinction,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is predominantly a third-person shooter, although melee weapons are available as secondary options. Players steadily gain access to a respectable selection of hand and long guns, with the latter generally acting as a loadout's main option. While most guns are purchased rather than looted, enemies regularly drop mods and mutators that can be used to modify builds on the fly, providing customization without flooding the inventory.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  's class system is also fantastic.

 <p>
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is at its best when played in 3-player co-op, to the point that many of the archetypes (classes) and bosses feel tailor-made for parties rather than solo runners. The latter can pick a class that includes a dog companion, so they have an option; however, they might find the campaign to be quite difficult, even on the lowest challenge level. Still, the gameplay is fun, the build variety is solid, and the world-hopping structure is pretty awesome. The bosses are also awesome, including a few that have an impressive sense of scale.

  Most players are well aware of the numerous optional bosses that have become a mainstay in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with these encounters pushing players to the max or rewarding them for exploring additional areas. However, there are times when the difficulty of these battles reaches ridiculous levels.

 <p>
  Some of the most infamous optional boss fights in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  are a downright nightmare to tackle, with most players preferring to avoid these encounters altogether. However, players who optimize their party loadout and level up to the max can take out these bosses after a lengthy and grueling battle.

 <p>
  Given how
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  embodies the best qualities of the series, it's easy to see why this game has two superbosses that can be quite challenging. While Hades can still be defeated as long as players are diligent in this encounter, the same can't be said for Ozma.

 <p>
  This boss is no joke, and players who don't complete the Friendly Monsters sidequest will find this encounter to be downright impossible to get through. Thankfully, completing this side activity ensures that Ozma is not out of reach for regular attacks and makes him weak to the Shadow element, making this encounter slightly less grueling to get through.

  Emerald Weapon's fight occurs underwater, which gives players 20 minutes to defeat this boss before they drown. They can overcome this issue by equipping the Underwater materia, but there's a catch — Emerald Weapon boasts an attack called Aire Tam Storm that hits for 1111 damage for each piece of materia equipped. This means that players who equip more than eight materia on a character will doom them whenever Emerald Weapon whips out this attack.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 3
  </em>
  can be a challenging game for players who struggle to get used to its dated mechanics. However, the game is largely doable after the party becomes stronger, but all their progress will count for naught if they decide to take on the dreaded Iron Giant in battle.

 <p>
  Despite boasting a simple moveset, what makes Iron Giant such an imposing enemy is that it attacks four times per turn and starts using Swipe after 2/3rds of his health is depleted. This all-attack move hits for major damage and can wipe out the party if no safeguards are put into place to deal with this move.

  However, these failures may not be all that punishing. After all, the toughest superboss in the game, Chronodia, becomes stronger with each completed puzzle. Players who successfully solve all eight puzzles will be greeted with the hardest version of this boss who takes no prisoners and can wipe out the party in a flash.

  Geryon can be encountered in a first playthrough, but players must steal the Dark Matter item from Zeromus and use it in New Game+ to fight against Proto-Babil. This is the hardest boss in the game by a country mile, and players must be equipped to the nines to even stand a chance of defeating this tough foe.

 <p>
  The unique combat system of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 12
  </em>
  can take a while to get used to, but players who put in the work and master the Gambit system can essentially put down the controller and let every battle play out automatically to secure victory in a flash. However, players must be active at all times when completing the Trial Mode challenges added to the Zodiac age version of the game.

  The final trial qualifies as one of the hardest fights in
  <em>

  history. Taking on all five Archadian Judges at once is no joke, and players must ensure that their Gambits account for every possible scenario in this encounter to come out victorious after a long, challenging encounter that leaves no room for error.

  Players who think that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  becomes too easy after acquiring the Celestial Weapons will sing a different tune after trying to battle the Dark Aeons. Players must grind out the Sphere Grid to stand a chance against these foes, and their main party should be maxed out if they wish to tackle the game's ultimate superboss, Penance.

 <p>
  This fight is no joke, and players must unleash a steady offense to ensure that they aren't wiped out by Penance in record time. It's a stressful battle where a single misstep can lead to the party's demise, which makes victory taste that much sweeter as players complete the game's ultimate challenge.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  has its fair share of superbosses, but it takes something special for a boss to be so powerful that it attracts negative press for one of its games. Such was the case with Absolute Virtue, a battle so lengthy and taxing at the time that players felt the Level 75 cap was a slap in the face of players who didn't stand a chance against this boss even with an optimized build.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":930} -->

 <p>
  With the game being targeted by the gaming press for promoting unhealthy habits where players were forced to sacrifice precious sleep as they clocked in thirty hours or more in this boss, it's easy to see why the developers nerfed this boss fight in later patches. Even with the level cap rising with subsequent expansions, Absolute Virtue is a nightmare to deal with and one of the hardest encounters in this beloved MMORPG.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Rivals
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan made a stylish poster heavily influenced by the
  <em>
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  series of games.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is one of the latest titles to utilize various Marvel Universe properties. As it includes many famous characters from the Marvel roster, some fans have taken it upon themselves to produce aesthetic artworks which showcase the playable Super Heroes and Villains in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  When the game was first announced, it caught the eye of not only just competitive shooter players, but also of many Marvel fans. The huge
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  roster included solid favorites such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, and even the likes of Scarlet Witch. Some avid followers of Marvel have claimed that the selection of Super Heroes rivals that of the classic
  <em>
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  titles. One
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  fan eventually made a tribute to the famed franchise by creating artwork inspired by it.

  Reddit user OK_Classroom_554 shared their take of a
  <em>
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  -styled
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  poster. As with both entries in the franchise, the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  version of Spider-Man retains his position on center stage with various characters, such as Venom, Hulk, Storm, and others, surrounding him. Fans from the comments section shared their feelings on how much they missed the
  <em>
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  titles. The majority of the feedback on the poster was positive, with a few people suggesting that Spider-Man's hand should be out of the frame to accurately mimic the
  <em>
   Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  art.

  While
  <em>
   Rivals
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  are both different takes on the Marvel Universe property, it seems fans are very much comparing the two games in terms of the characters included. The idea of selecting Heroes and Villains to make up a team is something that both titles share. Perhaps players are also missing the
  <em>
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance
  </em>
  series as it has been a long while since the last entry was released. Not to mention, the said title was a Nintendo Switch exclusive, something that didn't sit too well with fans of the first two games. In the same way that Rivals is only currently playable on

  A

   </em>
  </strong>
  player has shared a funny clip from the game showing a personal superstition finally paying off. Set in the
  <em>

  </em>
  Zombies game mode, the clip involves a player's personal "good luck ritual" performed online to influence what should be random rewards.

 <p>
  The regular release of new
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles can sometimes make it easy to forget that the series has been around for decades at this point. That's long enough for entire generations of players to grow up alongside the franchise, and for it to develop its own subculture, in-jokes, and superstitions. This is particularly true of the franchise's Zombies modes, which originated as a "secret" game mode packed with Easter eggs. Developer Treyarch also leaned in on the phenomenon, packing Terminus Island and other locations full of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies secrets.

  That in mind, it's no surprise that players might come up with their own little tricks for good luck when playing Zombies mode. Player McHarzberg experienced their own "nostalgic superstition" yielding good results in a clip they shared with the CODZombies Reddit community. The clip shows McHarzberg performing a good luck ritual before opening a
  <em>

  mystery box.

 <p>
  As seen in the clip, McHarzberg's good luck ritual consists of shooting the corners of the mystery box, meleeing the latch, and spinning around twice before opening it, then jumping up and down as the box cycles through its potential rewards. The mystery box, which drops a random
  <em>

  weapon, hands out one of the mode's most powerful weapons, the Thrustodyne M23.

  For years,
  <em>
   Zombies
  </em>
  players have claimed, with varying degrees of seriousness, that doing things like knifing a mystery box or performing some series of bizarre moves as the box opened would improve the results. Mystery boxes are designed to give out random rewards, and there's no evidence to suggest such rituals actually influence the drop rate of desirable weapons. Fellow
  <em>
   Zombies
  </em>
  players were amused by the lucky result, joking that someone had finally managed to "crack the code" and perform a good luck ritual that actually works. Even McHarzberg acknowledged that their receiving the powerful Jetgun was unlikely to be due to the ritual itself, calling the outcome "1% skill, 99% nostalgic superstition."

  While most players acknowledge that such good luck rituals are purely the product of myth and superstition, it's still amusing to see one work out to the player's benefit. One of the most attractive parts of
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  has been its embrace of mystery and long-term storytelling, which keeps players invested despite setbacks caused by recent
  <em>

  leaks.

  As challenging as the genre can get, strategy games can be cathartic too. Seeing a plan come together as more territory is obtained, resources are gained, and the enemies are left scattered across the battlefield can be very satisfying. But for some, the joy of conquest is rather fleeting. Pooling resources into having the best, most reliable arms? It’s a rather predictable strategy.

 <p>
  What if they wanted to out-think their opponents in other ways? Outsmarting them without needing to send in troops, convincing them to work together for a common cause, or simply focusing on their own survival and progression. If players want to test their wits by taking these or other pacifist approaches, they can give these strategy games a go.

  The classic historical strategy series
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  has always let players achieve non-violent victories. By
  <strong>
   <em>
    Civilization 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players could win by having the most widespread religion, the best scientific technology (i.e. landing a man on the moon or launching a satellite), producing the most inspiring culture through their art and wonders, or the most diplomatic points, alongside dominating the land through sheer force. However, it’s not usually very easy to do all this without having a strong military.

 <p>
  There will always be a more aggressive civilization at the player’s doorstep, and appeasing them could get them into more trouble down the line. That’s without getting into the tricky nature of balancing enough policies to help foster enough wonders and geniuses before their rivals for that victory. Pacifists will still need to invest in their military, as no one will listen to them unless they carry this proverbial big stick.

  and its predecessors focused more on building cities, raising economies, and establishing businesses and trade routes. It is possible to go to war and fight on land and sea to establish new colonies. But, with clever play, people can get ahead in the series without firing a single shot. Through careful diplomacy, trading, and investing, players can expand their influence.

  For example, instead of taking over an island, they could become its majority shareholder, taking it for themselves gradually by being the driving force of its economy. Then, if it aggravates any rivals, players can come up with a way to ease their tempers with some deal sweetening. It’s both a sneaky kind of capitalism and a peaceful approach to becoming an economic powerhouse.

All while being sure not to anger their rivals through mutually beneficial deals and careful agreements. Or through out-and-out aggression and conquest. Players can shape their civilizations in all sorts of ways: spiritual or materialistic, authoritarian or egalitarian, xenophobic or xenophilic, and militaristic or pacifistic.

  They can be mildly one or the other, or fanatical about them, with each path offering different pros and cons. Pacifist civilizations offer more stability, but they can’t engage in any aggressive approach. Their military might can only be used for defensive purposes. No indiscriminate orbital bombardment, and no aggressive first contact protocols, which can lead to interesting results when paired with the other parameters. Players could be the ultimate space hippies, or something more sinister.

  Once upon a time, the universe was run by an advanced race called the Endless. Their scientific knowledge was so vast they managed to achieve immortality by uploading their minds to machines. But this caused a schism between those who embraced this new technology and those who didn’t. It sparked a war that decimated both sides by the end, leaving a few Endless survivors to appreciate the irony of their fate.

  Tens of thousands of years later in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Endless Space 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , it’s up to the player to pick one of twelve factions and establish their galactic empire. They can learn from the Endless’ mistakes by making peace with their rivals and avoiding confrontations. There are even achievements in the game for winning a session without engaging in fights or winning a battle. As tricky as it sounds, it can be done with the help of the Umbral Choir’s cloaking technology, enough resources for making deals, and knowing where and where not to tread.

  Through them, they can shape social, technological, and economic policies to avert climate change (based on real data from the University of Oxford), improve impoverished areas, and more. But it’s not as easy as it seems, as they have to keep their public opinion polls high in all twelve regions. If players aren’t careful, those polls can drop low enough to get them banned from an area for the rest of the game. People aren't going to give up gasoline-powered cars or fund social programs without the player thinking ahead.

  The god game genre has kind of been quiet since the days of
  <em>
   Black &amp; White 2
  </em>
  . The debacle of
  <em>
   Godus
  </em>
  probably didn’t help either. Luckily,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Reus
   </em>
  </strong>
  gives fans of those old games something to sink their teeth into. This time, they guide four elemental giants around a 2D world where they can grant resources to humble humans. It’s not like
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Fate of the World
  </em>
  , so where’s the strategy?

 <p>
  That lies in how they arrange the giants and their bounties. They can’t directly control the humans, and they can act in all sorts of different ways. Without enough minerals, plants, and animals, they’ll die out. Give them too many resources, and they can grow greedy and wage war over them. It offers an intriguing challenge for a pacifist, as they have to find the right balance between helping everyone thrive equally without causing them to fight.

  offers another outside-the-box option as it offers the city building and resource management of

  without the rival civilizations. It’s all about building homes from scratch in an isolated community and making sure they survive. To do that, they have to manage the economy, assign jobs to citizens to help them provide people with what they need, and grow the town in both territory and population as the generations pass.

 <p>
  It’s an intriguing idea, and one
  <em>
   Banished
  </em>
  mostly gets right. However, once players got to grips with it, they found it became less of a survival game and more like
  <em>
   Sim City
  </em>
  , complete with hazards like natural disasters and economic depression. Nonetheless, like
  <em>
   Reus
  </em>
  , it gives pacifist players a completely non-violent alternative to the likes of
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  , where keeping their people happy and their hometown thriving is the name of the game, not waging war and raising soldiers.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Age of Empires Mobile
   </em>
  </strong>
  , gold is a crucial resource needed for upgrades and kingdom advancements, similar to other
  <em>
   AoE
  </em>
  games. Fortunately, it’s not as scarce as some other upgrade materials, allowing most players to start farming it within a few hours of the campaign.

  Here, we’ll discuss
  <strong>
   three reliable methods for farming gold
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Age of Empires Mobile
  </em>
  . Additionally, we’ll cover other ways to acquire this resource, especially for those who may not be familiar with the options available. We’ve excluded obvious methods like collecting daily or progression rewards, which are hard to miss, and instead, focus on gold farming techniques that beginners might overlook.

  In
  <em>
   Age of Empires Mobile
  </em>
  , there are three methods for farming gold: building gold mines, constructing workshops at resource points, and completing Expedition objectives.

 <p>
  Gold mines become available once you reach chapter fifteen of the campaign. At level one, a mine produces 400 gold per hour, but when maxed out at level 30, it generates 20,000 gold per hour, eliminating the need for additional farming.

 <p>
  Resource points on the overworld map can also yield substantial amounts of gold. When you send troops to these points, they will start mining, which usually takes an hour, though it may take longer depending on the resource point’s level. However, be cautious, as these points are vulnerable to enemy attacks while your troops are farming gold.

 <p>
  Also, by playing the Battlefield Survivor minigame in the Expedition mode, you increase your passive gold gain every time you complete an objective. Starting at around 1,000 gold per hour, the idle rewards gradually become more lucrative based on your playtime.

  To increase your gold storage capacity in

 <p>
  Gold bullion will stay in your inventory as a potential gold resource. You can manually convert them into coins from the inventory menu whenever you're low on gold. If you don’t need this resource, it’s best to avoid exchanging your bullion, as they are safe in your inventory and cannot be looted by other players.

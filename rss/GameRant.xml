 <p>
  Open-world titles have become an incredibly popular genre within the last decade or so, bleeding out from their own niche of titles to find variations across all other gaming worlds. Gritty tactical shooters, epic fantasy titles, survival horror, and even racing games have all found themselves with an open-world counterpart. Regardless of what kind of setting an open-world title would fit into, the narrative is an essential component of what makes many of these games tick.

 <p>
  And what good is a story without a villain? In some games, players can take it upon themselves to be the villain, but in most, players will find themselves clashing against a powerful, villainous antagonist in the story. These open-world RPGs have some incredibly compelling villains in store for the player to try and defeat.

 <p>
  There are many characters in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  who could hold the title of the most evil villain in the series. Is Marika evil? Is the Greater Will evil? What about those people who want to set existence on fire, that
  <em>
   sounds
  </em>
  evil. But all these characters have some kind of justification for their acts, and in the obfuscated storytelling style of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , it's hard to call them compelling unless players have pieced together the 27 items that mention them and chronicle their stories, before deciding for themselves if the character in question is truly evil.

  The Loathsome Dung Eater, however, holds none of these caveats. He appears directly before the player, tells them exactly how profane his actions are to both the living and the dead, and wishes for nothing more than the world to experience a level of suffering so intense it changes the paradigm for what is the default state of existence. Dung Eater is a refreshingly and unapologetically evil character - not even his name exempts him from his crimes.

  Kellogg is not the central antagonist of
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , but he is a core, driving factor for much of the story, setting the tone for the intrigue and mystery in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's opening chapters. An apathetic mercenary with a surprising amount of depth that is inextricably tied to the protagonist as their first foil.

  Gaunter's ability to shape reality, uphold cursed Faustian Pacts, and even pause time at will make him a strong force to be reckoned with, but what makes him so compelling is his deceptively easygoing charm and absolutely stunning voice acting behind him.

  Dutch Van Der Lin has one of the most interesting dynamics with Arthur out of the entire Van Der Lin Gang. He took Arthur under his wing and raised him, but as the Pinkertons continue to hound his gang, Dutch grows increasingly paranoid of all his comrades.

  Like a lot of characters that enjoy waxing hypothetical about philosophy while also being kind of terrible (there are a few on this list!), Dutch is functionally a hypocrite. He condemns civilization in favor of the open wilds and individualism his gang enjoys, but his literacy, intellect, and even the well-tailored clothes he wears all come from this society he claims to hate so much.

  Night City has produced some truly evil people within its glossy world. There's a case to be made that Night City itself is
  <em>

  's most compelling villain, but the apathy and entropy of the average citizen - the City's indifference, rather than its malice - is what gives rise to so many of the genuinely evil people that V comes across.

  Saburo is a compelling villain, but is he evil? That depends on V's perspective, more than anything else, but Saburo's all-consuming desire to master death, and live forever, is a driving force of the many, many obstacles that occur in the story. Saburo, having reached a level of wealth and power so great it eclipses any other person on earth, puts all his resources towards a singular, terrifying piece of tech that could rewrite how humanity works.

  Candidly speaking, the Tribunal is a bigger villain than Dagoth Ur in
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  . Okay, yes, Dagoth Ur released a magical disease that turns people into encephalid zombies, and his cult is functionally a group of disgruntled fascists, but the Tribunal are three vain, traitorous false gods - and they are what catalyze Dagoth Ur as a potent and compelling force of villainy.

 <p>
  Even towards the late game, Dagoth takes an interesting place in the story by seeing the protagonist as a friend rather than a foe - he knows the Nerevarine in any form, and it's simply his madness after years within Red Mountain that has turned him into such an overwhelming antagonist towards Tamriel.

  What makes

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  has addressed the Max Raids issues and revealed changes that will be made in the coming days. This year,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  trainers ended a long wait, as Dynamax and Gigantamax forms finally became available, bringing another well-known gimmick.

 <p>
  The Dynamax forms were introduced when Niantic announced
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Season 16, which will end on December 3. With this, the devs introduced a new raid called Max Battle, in which players team up to defeat and capture critters in Dynamax form. On October 14, it was the turn of Gigantamax Venusaur, Blastoise, and Charizard to be added to the augmented reality game in Max Raids, offering another challenging experience. But this challenge proved trickier than expected, which generated a wave of backlash.

 <p>
  Addressing this backlash,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has revealed adjustments to the Max Raids that players will see when Gigantamax Gengar debuts on October 31. According to information from Pokemon GO Hub, a reward of 25,000 Stardust will be introduced for each battle against Gengar that players complete. The devs' idea is to encourage the community to participate more in these raids, and to help recover the resources invested. In addition, the Ghost-type's catch rate will be increased, as according to Niantic, the chance of capturing a Gigantamax critter “didn't align with the intended experience.” The Kanto monster's Max Raids promise to be more doable than previous battles, giving a fair chance of defeating it.

  The community has recently complained about the difficulty of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  's Max Raids, especially when they failed to gather 40 people. In addition, there have been criticisms of technical problems, such as crashes and the ineffectiveness of helpers. The high cost of jumping into these raids was also debated, which, together with the bugs, generated a big controversy when Dynamax Beldum debuted in the game. As well as complaining about the difficulty of Max Raids with groups smaller than 40, criticism was directed at the difficulty of finding enough players to close a group of this size, especially for trainers in rural areas.

  Fishing in

  is a great way to make gold, though it requires some patience at the start. Fishing early on can be a bit tough for players until they improve their fishing skill and purchase better

  fan ODBC_Error shared their find with others, admitting that they'd only realized it after having put over 250 hours into the game. They shared that
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  players have the option of casting their fishing rod lines diagonally, rather than just straight ahead of their character. To do so, all a player needs to do is use their movement options, meaning WASD on keyboard or the left stick on a controller, after casting their line but before the bobber hits the water. Doing so will alter the trajectory of the cast, allowing players to move their fishing line to exactly where they want it to end up. This could be a big help, especially for those pursuing fishing professions in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  .

  Stardew Valley Fishing Tip Could Be a Big Help

  <em>

  fans have been openly surprised about this discovery, with many having put hundreds or even thousands of hours into the game without knowing about it. Clearly, plenty of fans have been able to make fishing work for them without this tip, but it could be a huge boon depending on the player's situation. For example,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  waters often have little patches of bubbles appear on the surface that can spawn better fish or increase the odds of a quick bite. However, it's not always easy to hit these, as they often appear in an area where a player can't stand directly across from. By utilizing this tip, they can adjust their fishing line to hit these bubbles, potentially improving what they catch and earn for the day.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has caught the gaming community's attention by making their Titan look like a Javelin from
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  . When playing
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , players often model their Guardians based on characters from other popular games. Still, this
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  -themed design has some gamers thinking about what could have been for the action RPG.

  Released in February 2019,
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  was developed by BioWare and published by EA. The game looked to stand out thanks to its combat featuring exosuits called Javelins. While the game had some redeeming qualities, it failed to meet expectations, with players complaining of a lack of content. Unfortunately, the unsatisfactory reception to the game led to the cancelation of some post-launch content, and development on
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  ended in February 2021. Despite its underwhelming run, many players have fond memories of
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  , with one
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  player making an impressive tribute to the game's Javelins.

  In a Reddit post, a user known as G-man69420 shared screenshots of their impressive Titan design based on
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  . Specifically, they revealed the look was inspired by the Colossus, one of the types of Javelin exosuits found in
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  . While the Reddit user’s Titan design was not as big as the actual Colossus, it had a striking resemblance. The Titan featured bulky and predominately dark green armor to match the Javelin, helping sell the appearance. The Titan helmet also featured an orange visor to mirror the one seen on the
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  exosuit.

  When sharing their Titan with Reddit, G-man69420 provided a screenshot of the armor pieces used in the build for those interested in replicating the design. Based on the image, Unsated Curiosity and Abyssinian Gold shaders were used for the armor parts. Since sharing the post, the player’s Titan has made waves on the Destiny Fashion subreddit. The post has already gained more than 2.2K upvotes, with players enjoying the callback to
  <em>

  Beyond complementing the player on their unique Titan, many Reddit users reminisced about what could have been regarding
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  . In the comment section, some pointed out the potential that BioWare’s action RPG possessed. A common opinion was that the game was conceptually “brilliant.” However, the idea was never realized the way many in the community had hoped. Despite
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  's untapped potential, gamers said they enjoyed aspects of the gameplay, including its aerial combat.

  While

  is no longer receiving support,
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  continues to get updates from Bungie. As a result, the game has maintained an active player base, and many of these fans have been sharing Guardian transformations on social media. For example, one player showcased their Soulsborne-themed Guardians made in
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  . Thanks to the customization options present in the game, creative players will continue to share memorable Titan, Hunter, and Warlock designs with the community.

  To become the best angler in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  , players will have to catch rare species of fish. What’s more, you can catch not only fish but also an Alligator. This creature is found only in one place and is required for one of the quests. Therefore, in this guide, we will tell you how to catch an Alligator in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  .

  Like other fish in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  , it is found only in a certain place. To get to it, you will need a boat. On it, you must sail around the starting island and go to Mushgrove Swamp. Alligators spawn only in this location.

 <p>
  To find the exact fishing spot, you will need a Fish Radar, which costs 8K Tokens. If you do not want to spend money, then get to Alligator Marsh in the center of the island. Fish near the boat in this lake, and you will be able to catch it.

  After you have found the spawn location of an Alligator in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  , you need to prepare for fishing. First of all, stock up on bait. The best option is Fish Head, which Alligators adore. However, it drops quite rarely, so you will need a lot of Bait Crates.

 <p>
  In addition, players need to pick up a suitable fishing rod. We recommend choosing tools that can withstand up to 1000 kg, such as a Carbon Rod or Steady Rod. Weaker rods will not work for catching Alligator in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Finally, after choosing your equipment, you will have to wait for suitable weather conditions. As befits a rare catch, Alligators only spawn at night. In addition, the weather must be rainy or foggy. Otherwise, you should not even try to fish.

  If you do not want to wait and have enough Tokens, then we recommend that you purchase Totems. For only 2K Tokens, players can change the weather to the desired one. For an Alligator, you will need the following items:

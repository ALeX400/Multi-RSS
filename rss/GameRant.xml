  Skyline Valley update has brought in lots of new weapons, enemies, events, and rewards for players to earn and unlock. As players explore the game's first-ever map expansion, they will come across all sorts of strange and creepy encounters.

  There are several new random encounters that players have a chance to come across while making their way around Skyline Valley. Random encounters are a big part of almost all of Bethesda's games, and players can't get enough of them. Out of the new random encounters added to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , there's one creepy one that stands out from the others.

  One of the new random encounters involves players going toe to toe with a mysterious enemy called The Mole.
  <strong>
   The Mole wears a mole mask and a straightjacket
  </strong>
  and makes Mole Miner sounds when approached. It is unclear where he has come from or who he is, but as soon as he sees the player, he will turn hostile.

  The only way to stop The Mole is to kill him. Unfortunately, he doesn't drop any special loot that gives more information on who he was. However, some players have come across a location that could be connected to this bizarre madman.

 <p>
  According to a video posted by Rifle Gaming, there's a mysterious shed below Slumber Mill Hotel. The shed is locked and has a keep-out message written on the door. While this doesn't seem all that interesting, behind the shed, there are several graves. In between the graves is a Mole The Mole poster.

  Since this is a random encounter,
  <strong>
   there's no guarantee that you'll come across The Mole.
  </strong>
  The only thing you can do is server-hop until you eventually find him. Since Skyline Valley is still pretty new, there's a good chance that players will find more unique encounters and interesting secrets as time goes on.

  A modder is rebuilding
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario 64
   </em>
  </strong>
  to be playable on the Game Boy Advance. While the task may seem impossible at first glance, as the Game Boy Advance’s hardware is not as powerful as the N64, this modder is achieving amazing progress in their
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  recreation.

  Released in 1996,
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  is not only one of the best Nintendo 64 games but also one of the most beloved titles of all time. The game was Nintendo’s first attempt to move its most prominent franchise to 3D, and it was a huge hit, selling almost 12 million units on the N64.

  A
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  fan called Joshua Barretto shared a video update of their
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  recreated on the GBA a few days ago. Barretto initially wanted to try a direct port using the game’s code, but that proved troublesome, so they decided to rebuild the code from scratch, and the current results are amazing. In early May, Barreto shared a video in which Mario was a red triangle that looked very rough, and in less than two whole months, the game’s first level is already playable.

  Modder Joshua Barretto Shares Progress on Super Mario 64 Recreated on the GBA

  Barretto’s
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  for GBA currently runs somewhat smoothly between 20-30 FPS, and Mario can perform several moves such as somersaulting, crouching, and long jumping. While not everything is running perfectly, it’s frankly amazing to see one of the best
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  games running on a GBA. The project is still in the early stages, but Barretto intends the full game to be playable on the GBA. Hopefully, the project won’t get a cease-and-desist letter from Nintendo, which is often hostile against fan projects using its properties.

  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  has been living through a sort of renaissance in recent years, as modders and hardcore players keep achieving major feats with the game. Back in May, a gamer finished
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  without using the A button to jump. This was a huge feat, which had been attempted since the early 2000s by different gamers, and this player only managed to do it after keeping the game running for 86 hours, exploiting a rare occurrence that only happens when playing on the Wii Virtual Console.

 <p>
  Soon before that, another gamer opened
  <em>

  ’s unopenable door for the first time without using any mods. Located in the Snow World region, this door puzzled the community for decades until the gamer used a very complicated process to open it.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  player seems to be extremely popular, as a pair of NPCs simply won't leave them alone. The brief
  <em>
   Pokemon

  gameplay video shows the player locked in place while two NPCs endlessly spam their phone with calls.

  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  introduced the ability for players to get a phone number from select NPCs that they can save after battles. Once a player makes a connection with an NPC, it's possible for that NPC to call them. These calls can be simple check-ins to say how they're doing as a trainer, or can offer story updates or the chance at a rematch. However, this player's game seems to be acting up, as they're stuck in a loop of phone calls from two overly eager trainers.

  fan FodderWadder shared a brief video of them standing in the corner of a Pokemon Center in one of the classic Game Boy games. Shortly after the video begins, a call comes in from Wade the Bug Catcher, who proceeds to tell the player about their progress training a Caterpie and how they had encountered a Pidgey the other day. After the call completes, the player doesn't even have a moment to react before their in-game phone is ringing again, this time with a call from Youngster Joey. Joey wants to have a rematch on Route 30, and tells the player to stop by if they're interested.

  The Pokemon Calls Continue
 </h2>
 <p>
  Two phone calls in rapid succession wouldn't be a big deal, but it quickly becomes apparent that there's a problem. After hanging up with Youngster Joey, the phone rings again, only for it to be Joey repeating what he had just said a moment ago. If that weren't enough, as soon as that phone call ends, another one begins with Wade the Bug Catcher once more. While that call cuts off, he presumably says the same thing as in the prior phone call.

 <p>
  There's no clear reason why this player is getting bombarded with NPC calls in their copy of the game. Youngster Joey and the call system in
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  are notorious for annoying, repetitive calls, but it's not usually this absurd. FodderWadder speculated that their save might be glitched somehow. Other players seemed amused at the conversations, saying that the NPCs just wanted to chat.

 <p>
  While it's possible to delete phone numbers in the original
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  , the phone also answers automatically when an NPC calls. FodderWadder did manage to escape the endless spam, but noted it was difficult to find an opening where the calls weren't constantly coming in so they could access the menu, delete the phone numbers, and finally escape from the Pokemon Center. Unfortunately, it's also left them afraid of registering any new numbers for fear of getting stuck in an endless call loop again.

  To find the Flowerstone Gavel, players will first need to traverse the Dragon Pit to reach the eastern mountain known as the Jagged Peak. Once at the Jagged Peak and coming across the first fork in the road,
  <strong>
   travel south to find the Grand Altar Of Dragon Communion
  </strong>
  . Here, players can talk to the Dragon Priestess and consume the draconic essence. Now the Priestess will send you on the quest to defeat Bayle at the top of the mountain.

  The Flowerstone Gavel is a unique weapon for a few reasons beyond just its appearance. Despite requiring and scaling with Arcana, it doesn't have any major status ailment bonuses like most Arcana weapons, and
  <strong>
   can't be equipped with an Ash of War
  </strong>
  to give it one and further its Arcana scaling.

   Flowerstone Gavel

  can't be equipped with an ash of war because of its unique skill
  <strong>
   Flower Dragonbolt. This skill calls down red lightning on an enemy

  , dealing substantial lighting damage at a range. This lightning is called from above, so players don't need to worry about obstructions in the way of the player and target blocking the skill.

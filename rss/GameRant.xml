  won't be open-world, BioWare has confirmed. A senior company official has also offered some explanation for why that is the case, including the claim that the developer wanted to deliver a "highly curated game" with
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  .

  The fourth numbered installment in the popular RPG series is presently targeting a late 2024 release for PC and the current-generation consoles. EA and BioWare have recently shifted their efforts to market the game into a higher gear, having at last treated
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  to a gameplay reveal come mid-June.

 <p>
  Game Rant was subsequently given an opportunity to witness the opening hour of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  at Summer Game Fest 2024. That section of the game was about as linear as the introductory segments of the past series entries, with BioWare stating that the game will eventually open up as the story progresses. However, at no point will
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  turn into a full-fledged open-world experience. That's according to BioWare Game Director Corinne Busche, who said as much in a recent IGN interview.

 <p>
  The upcoming RPG has instead been envisioned as a "mission-based" experience, the official said, noting how every single aspect of the game has been "hand-crafted" and "highly curated." That design philosophy is how BioWare plans to deliver "the best moment-to-moment experience" possible, Busche said. The developer has already been hinting at its narrative-first development approach in recent days, most notably when it ditched
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's original name,
  <em>
   Dreadwolf
  </em>
  , citing a change in the game's story focus as the reason for that decision.

  Dragon Age: The Veilguard's Hub Area Will Be Called the Lighthouse
 </h3>
 <p>
  Despite not having a fully open world, the fourth mainline
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game will still be non-linear. Aside from branching story choices, the RPG is also confirmed to feature a number of larger levels that offer exploration opportunities. Optional content in the vein of side quests and various secrets will also be part of the package, as is to be expected of a
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game. The RPG's mission-based structure wouldn't be complete without a hub area in the vein of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  's Skyhold fortress. This time around, the player's base of operations will be called the Lighthouse.

 <p>
  Based on Busche's comments, it sounds like
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  may feature fewer giant open areas than
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  , but still more than
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  . Whether that assessment is accurate should be clear before long, as the much-anticipated RPG is set to hit the market in fall 2024. EA has yet to attach an official release date to
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   <em>
    Phantom Blade Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  's director claimed the upcoming title does not fall under the Soulslike genre. Gameplay trailers for
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  have invited comparisons to several popular Soulslike titles, such as
  <em>
   Nioh
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  . However, users who were lucky enough to play the offline demo during the recent Summer Game Fest have rejected the label and instead praised the series for its thrilling, fast-paced combo-focused combat system and stylish wuxia-inspired moves.

 <p>
  This year's Summer Game Fest had no shortage of major announcements from a variety of beloved video game franchises. It was therefore somewhat of a surprise that one of the most eye-catching titles to be featured during the event came from a relatively unknown Beijin-based developer, S-GAME, which arrived at the festivities with a gritty action-packed gameplay trailer along with an offline demo of
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  . Announced back in 2023 during PlayStation's State of Play,
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  drew attention from gamers bewildered by its majestic combat and its dark "kungfupunk" setting, which inevitably drew comparisons to several of the most beloved Soulslike titles.

 <p>
  Now, in the wake of Summer Game Fest 2024, the game's director, known by his moniker Soulframe, released a message addressing the Soulslike comparisons through
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  's official Twitter account. Soulframe notably stressed that
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  was never intended to fall under the Soulslike banner and that developers envisioned it would instead revolve around "combo-driven, heart-pumping combat that is hectic, rewarding and exhilarating." The director additionally clarified that
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  includes features typically not found in a Soulslike, with Soulframe confirming that the game will have multiple difficulty settings and mobs that don't respawn after a player dies or uses a checkpoint.

  While the game is not a soulslike, Soulframe additionally confirmed that they did take some inspiration from the genre, particularly in regards to their approach to the world. The director implied that
  <em>
   Phantom Blade Zero
  </em>
  's maps would heavily rely on
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  -esque interconnected vertical-level design, with different areas stacked atop each other and then linked through multiple avenues scattered around the world. Soulframe further hinted that many of the game's secrets were hidden away in the darkest corners of the map much like other Soulslike games but also emphasized that was where the similarities ended.

  Developer Undead Labs has enlisted the help of two new game studios, The Coalition and Obsidian Entertainment, to work on
  <strong>
   <em>
    State of Decay 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Undead Labs hopes to foster new talent to assist with the game's online co-op flexibility and to utilize Unreal Engine 5, the graphics software used in the latest trailer.
  <em>
   State of Decay 3
  </em>
  will be the first title released following Microsoft's acquisition of Undead Labs in 2018 and the release of
  <em>
   State of Decay 2
  </em>
  , and will mark a first-time collaboration with third-party studios outside of Undead Labs and Xbox Game Studios.

 <p>
  The original
  <em>
   State of Decay
  </em>
  was released in 2013 and tasked players with surviving a zombie apocalypse by scavenging for resources in the desolate Trumbull Valley and taking down the undead. Players ensure their survival by building a base, reinforcing nearby facilities, and rationing food sources by conserving home-grown goods and trading with NPCs. While
  <em>
   State of Decay
  </em>
  was initially a single-player game, the sequel introduced cooperative gameplay in an open-world environment. Now,
  <em>
   State of Decay 3
  </em>
  seeks to improve on the multiplayer aspect of its predecessor while also enhancing the single player experience.

  could borrow from other zombie games, but Creative Director at Undead Labs, Kevin Patzelt, is after a more novel experience. “We’re heavily emphasizing engaging co-op combat, taking a close look at our level design and approach to how we’re building the world to ensure that players can have a blast smashing and shooting zombies together out in the open world. To support that effort, combat needs to be downright fun. We’re looking at deepening our combat systems, our designs for enemy behaviors, and our animation fidelity to level up the moment-to-moment experience across the board

  Patzelt said to Xbox Wire.

  If there's one major asset that has benefited
  <em>
   State of Decay
  </em>
  , it's the freedom of an open-world environment. In regard to enhancing this key component, Studio Head and Head of Product Philip Holt has entrusted the use of Unreal Engine 5 to Obsidian Entertainment. “It’s all in-game assets, all rendered from the game, and it’s a depiction of a typical scene that you would encounter in a four-player co-op session. We wanted to give you a representative feel of what the game would be like, but also tell a story," Holt stated.

  Unreal Engine 5 launched in 2022 and many developers flocked to snag the latest product, which has been used to craft the new generation of video games as well as to improve existing ones. Some of the biggest games to bring Unreal Engine 5 into play include
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  , and several upcoming games, such as
  <em>
   ArcheAge 2
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  remake, and
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Ride of Hydra
  </em>
  . With
  <em>
   State of Decay 3
  </em>
  , it has become evident that Undead Labs and its collaborators intend to turn things up a notch to improve the game's overall quality and allow it to stand out against its competitors and predecessors.

  Undead Labs believes in "investing time" in a customizable experience that's tailor-made for each player.
  <em>
   State of Decay 3
  </em>
  promises a visual ride that's just as cinematic as it is practical and engaging to play. The

  trailer clearly tells a story, but the obvious graphical improvements were the first thing to grab people's attention, painting a clear image of how Undead Labs intends to take the franchise to even greater heights.

 <p>
  In this
  <em>
   Brawl Stars
  </em>
  community event, the developers aim to promote positivity. In order to spread the message of positivity in gaming, players need to use a particular Thumbs Up pin during a match, which will count towards the ultimate goal. Every Thumbs-Up pin used would be recorded by Supercell and would unlock tiers of rewards. However, the Legendary Starr Drop rewards will be banked and stored for redemption on June 20, 2024. Players must remember that they require at least 400 Trophies to claim the rewards.

  It wouldn't be an expansion for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  if it didn't include a new raid. Raids have been a popular part of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  as a series since Vault of Glass was first released in 2014, and it is unlikely that will ever change. After all, raids are where players can find the best rewards if they can overcome the most difficult challenges that
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  has to offer.

 <p>
  Salvation's Edge, the new raid in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , is easily the hardest raid ever released. Since this raid involves a direct confrontation with the Witness, it makes sense that Salvation's Edge would be unlike anything that has come before. Shortly after the raid begins, you and your team will come across the first encounter known as Substratum. This encounter teaches you several important mechanics that you will be doing for the rest of the raid, so it is critical to master the fundamentals of it.

  Before starting this encounter, make sure you have equipped your best add clear loadout. While there is no boss during the first encounter, it is important to be able to kill as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. To begin the first encounter, you will need to have the entire raid team assembled in the center room where there is a glowing chest. Nearby the chest, a small glowing pyramid. This pyramid is referred to as Resonance. One player must take the Resonance and deposit it into the glowing chest to start the encounter.

 <p>
  As the encounter begins, there are two things you will immediately notice. First, one of the Witness's hands comes out of the ceiling. Second, a timer will appear below your health bar that is called "Final Shape Looming". This timer indicates how much time you have before you and your entire team instantly die. Throughout the encounter, you will see glowing triangle fields appear. Do not stand in these, as they do a lot of damage.

 <p>
  Shortly after the encounter begins, Supplicants will pour into the room. Take out all of these enemies and the doors to other rooms will open. Split into three teams of two, and quickly clear each room. Make sure to take out any Hydras that spawn along with the Overload Champions. Eventually, you will see a message in the bottom left-hand corner of your screen that says: "You are beckoned toward the center". Once this happens, quickly go back to the center chamber.

 <p>
  At this point, a Tormentor will spawn in the center. Quickly kill it and then be ready for another horde of supplicants. You will then repeat the entire process above, but once you kill the second Tormentor, it is time for the main mechanic of this encounter. In two rooms, there will be a glowing plate and an open totem with a glowing part. All of these plates are connected with orange lines that run throughout the entire arena.

  The glowing plate can be referred to as the "sending plate" and the plate next to the floating totem is the "receiving plate". Have one player step onto the sending plate and then get off it. A beam will shoot out from the plate and go along the orange line toward the receiving plate. Once it arrives, the player next to the receiving plate should wait until an orange circle appears on the plate. Quickly step on the plate and then get off to send the light back to the sending plate. At this point, the player who is managing the sending plate should step onto the plate the moment the circle appears so that they can send it back.

 <p>
  While the light is being sent back and forth, more Resonance will appear on the ground nearby. While waiting for the light to return to your plate, grab any nearby Resonance. Do not pick up more than three or you will instantly die. The timing of stepping on the plates is very narrow, and if you mess it up it will shut down the plates and spawn a Subjugator that must be killed. Ideally, everyone should have three stacks of Resonance.

 <p>
  After each team has gathered enough Resonance, it will be time to close the totem next to the receiving plate. To close the totem, you must have at least one stack of Resonance. While the light is moving toward your plate, shoot the glowing middle part of the totem and then step onto your plate once the circle appears. If done correctly, the totem will close and will glow with orange light. You will also see "The resonant conductor sparks to life" in the lower left-hand corner of your screen.

  Once both totems have been closed, everyone should head back to the center chamber. A Subjugator will spawn along with a large group of adds. Quickly kill them and the glowing chest that started the encounter will reappear. One at a time, every player must deposit their Resonance into the chest. Doing so will add more time to the timer that is below your health. The more Resonance deposited, the more time you get. From here, you will repeat the entire process. You have to kill enemies, kill the Tormentors, gather Resonance, and then deposit it. After you have repeated this process enough times, you will have completed the first encounter of Salvation's Edge.

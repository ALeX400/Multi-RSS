	One
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Fallout 76
	 </em>
	</strong>
	player with some serious design skills has recently put together a C.A.M.P. inspired by Nacht Der Untoten, an iconic
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	map. Their inventive creation later made the rounds on social media, impressing many
	<em>
	 Fallout 76
	</em>
	fans.

 <p>
	Nacht Der Untoten, which literally translates to "Night of the Undead," is the first-ever
	<em>
	 Call of Duty
	</em>
	<em>
	 Zombies
	</em>
	map. Its original iteration debuted in the 2008
	<em>
	 Call of Duty: World at War
	</em>
	and returned in a slightly altered form as part of
	<em>
	 CoD:
	</em>
	<em>
	 Black Ops
	</em>
	two years later. Since then,
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	has treated Nacht Der Untoten to multiple revisions, some bigger than others.

	Nacht Der Untoten Recreated in Fallout 76
 </h2>
 <p>
	Reddit user RyanGosliwafflez recently decided to pay tribute to the iconic level by using it as inspiration for building their
	<em>
	 Fallout 76
	</em>
	base. The end result of their efforts is remarkably faithful to Nacht Der Untoten, both in terms of configuration and aesthetic. Since Nacht Der Untoten is by far the smallest of all
	<em>
	 Call of Duty Zombies
	</em>
	maps, featuring only three rooms, the player was able to recreate the level's layout in its entirety. RyanGosliwafflez primarily modeled their C.A.M.P.
	<em>
	</em>
	after the
	<em>
	 Black Ops
	</em>
	version of the level, although they also took some inspiration from its
	<em>
	 World at War
	</em>
	edition.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":360} -->

 <p>
	Keeping up with the overall theme, the player opted to situate their Nacht Der Untoten recreation near a spot that spawns ghouls, the closest thing the game has to zombies. Although they did not reveal the exact location of their
	<em>
	 Fallout 76
	</em>
	camp, the color of the sky seen in the images of the building suggests that they opted to build somewhere in the Mire, a swampy region in the eastern and northeastern parts of Appalachia.

 <p>
	RyanGosliwafflez's creation recently surfaced on Reddit, eliciting praise from other
	<em>
	 Fallout 76
	</em>
	players. Multiple fans said that the C.A.M.P. absolutely nailed Nacht Der Untoten, to the point that just seeing it instantly made them nostalgic. Reflecting on their achievement, the creator revealed that the entire build took about a day's worth of play to complete, with hourly breaks for completing
	<em>
	 Fallout 76
	</em>
	's currently ongoing Grahm's Meat-Cook event.

 <p>
	RyanGosliwafflez is still in the process of tweaking their Nacht Der Untoten recreation, having said that they had already improved its central staircase since they first shared it online. The player has also been trying to decorate their base with some mannequins, but found that to be challenging due how much C.A.M.P. budget they require.

	What is the Definition of Lemmings?
 </h3>
 <p>
	Lemmings is the plural form of the word lemming, which refers to a small mouselike creature that are known for massive migrations that sometimes lead them through water. This led to a myth that lemmings would follow one another no matter what, even if the lemming in front of them drowned. This has turned lemming into a sort of insult that can be used to describe someone who is a sheep, or who follows the herd even to their detriment.

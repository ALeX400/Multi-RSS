  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  is a visual novel series that has slowly but surely become one of Capcom's most popular properties. The series combines mystery solving with comical exaggerations of the Japanese legal system, known for frequently finding defendants guilty.

  The story primarily focuses on Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney who believes the goal of his work is to find out the truth behind every case. He gathers evidence from his investigations, which he uses to argue his point in the courtroom. Inevitably, he discovers the truth, and gets the guilty party arrested.

 <p>
  Several sequels and spin-offs later, Wright can no longer be considered the sole main hero of his game. With other characters taking on the defense in his absence, it's worth questioning how well each one has been used.

  Athena Cykes first appeared in
  <em>
   Dual Destinies
  </em>
  as the newest member of the Wright Anything Agency.
  <strong>
   She combines her skills as a defense attorney with a super-sensitive hearing that can detect emotions, and a knowledge of analytical psychology
  </strong>
  that one would expect from a detective rather than an attorney. All these skills coalesce to give her the ability to read emotions in a person's testimony and detect contradictions through them when making use of her portable computer and AI companion, Widget. Having appeared in a mere two
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  games, she still feels fairly green compared to Apollo and Phoenix.

 <p>
  Not for nothing, Cykes has only ever served in court as the primary defense attorney twice. Often serving as co-counsel despite being billed as a protagonist in
  <em>
   Dual Destinies
  </em>
  . Her first full trial as the primary defense attorney,
  <em>
   Turnabout Academy
  </em>
  , remains one of the best trials in the game. It makes the entertaining choice of investigating a murder in a high school that also happens to be a law school, and features an interesting cast of characters. It also makes Cykes the only female character to lead an investigation (with other temporary protagonists like Mia Fey and Susato Mikotoba doing strictly courtroom-only trials.)

 <p>
  Her second full trial as the primary defense attorney,
  <em>
   Turnabout Storyteller
  </em>
  , remains a unique entry as well. However, it is fairly short and confirms Cykes still has a long way to go before becoming a defense attorney on the level of her colleagues.
  <strong>
   A future installment that sees Cykes come into her own would be an interesting concept for an
   <em>
    Ace Attorney
   </em>
   game.

 <p>
  Phoenix Wright is perhaps the most well-known leading lawyer from
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  .
  <strong>
   His sarcasm, emotive nature, and occasional goofiness make him an entertaining character to follow the game's perspective from.
  </strong>
  He also uses a magatama, a sacred charm gifted to him by Pearl Fey, to detect if a person's lies regarding any given question he asks them. Though the games aren't considered canon, he has also been charged with helping save the world multiple times in games such as
  <em>
   Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Project X Zone 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  While he is fun to follow, narratively there is a bit of a dissonance between Phoenix's informed ability and his continual participation in cases. Wright has pretty much been built up as a legendary defense attorney. Indeed, he has managed to hand defeats to several prosecutors previously thought to be unbeatable. This becomes a narrative fixture at points in
  <em>
   Spirit of Justice
  </em>
  , where his absence from America (or Japan in the original dub) is used as a plot device in multiple cases. He spends this time in Khura'in, resolving court cases where the law dictates he could be punished as badly as his clients if they are found guilty.

 <p>
  <strong>
   At this point, his ability is such that it's hard to derive as much pleasure from him as the protagonist.
  </strong>
  Initially, Wright's final appearance was to be in Trials and Tribulations. However, the popularity of the original trilogy led to demand for more sequels. A better role in the future for him might be as a mentor, similar to how he was used in
  <em>
   Apollo Justice
  </em>
  . That game featured a more casual side of Wright, one less directly involved with the courts since his disbarment years ago.

 <p>
  However, he was still intensely dedicated to pursuing the truth behind the case that lost him his badge, and managed to steer Apollo in the right direction several times. While he doesn't need to lose his badge again, if another
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  game is released, he may work better as a supporting character.

  Apollo Justice is fairly similar to Phoenix Wright in the English translation.
  <strong>
   He is a sarcastic yet noble man who seeks to find out the truth behind every case.
  </strong>
  He also possesses a bracelet which tightens around his wrist when his eyes spot someone lying.

 <p>
  Apollo Justice has appeared far more often as a defense attorney than Cykes. Not only starring in his own game, but also being the co-protagonist of
  <em>
   Spirit of Justice
  </em>
  and appearing as the primary defense attorney in two cases of
  <em>
   Dual Destinies
  </em>
  . Ultimately, Justice left the Wright Anything Agency in order to rebuild the decimated legal system of Khura'In.

 <p>
  This was probably an optimal choice narrative-wise, as the trilogy, despite its inconsistent backstories for Apollo, did continually build him up by making an effort to have him stand as an equal with Phoenix.
  <strong>
   Allowing him to branch off and begin his own law firm was probably the best way to wrap up this narrative beat.

  Edgeworth debuted as Phoenix Wright's rival in the original
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  game. He is presented as a haughty prosecutor with a great fashion sense who would do anything to win a case
  <strong>
   . However, after being defended by Wright in court, Edgeworth re-evaluates his beliefs and decides to dedicate himself to discovering the truth.
  </strong>
  He was first utilized as a protagonist during the first half of
  <em>
   Bridge to the Turnabout
  </em>
  , the final chapter of
  <em>
   Trials and Tribulations
  </em>
  . After suffering a debilitating injury, Phoenix calls upon his friend and rival, to act as a defense attorney in his stead.

 <p>
  Despite being a prosecutor, Edgeworth feels compelled to accept. His temporary brush with the role of a defense attorney was only a taste of things to come.
  <strong>
   Edgeworth starred in two spin-off games which made use of his "logic" as a primary means to solving cases.
  </strong>
  Due to the prosecutorial bias in the series' justice system, Edgeworth's series focused more on investigations than trial appearances.

 <p>
  When faced with various barriers to effectively solving cases, Edgeworth even flirts with the idea of becoming a defense attorney. However, in the end, he decided that the system was in need of decent people to function efficiently, and continued working as a prosecutor.

 <p>
  Since then, Edgeworth has become the chief prosecutor, often only appearing during major events, and occasionally to prosecute against Wright in court. Ultimately, Edgeworth was allocated fine as a protagonist, with the two games focused on him connecting well to his concerns about systemic corruption, as well as his own unique style of reasoning and argumentation.

  <strong>
   Phoenix Wright's Japanese ancestor from the Meiji era was also a defense attorney.
  </strong>
  He stars in a spin-off series known as
  <em>
   The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles
  </em>
  . Ryunosuke is similar in a lot of ways to his modern-day descendant, with developers admitting the differing time periods act as the best way to distinguish the two. A string of events compels him to study law in London, where he operates as a defense attorney with aid from his more learned assistant, Susato Mikotoba. The pair investigate various mysteries tied to the courts with the help of Herlock Sholmes, a local detective who is famed for his mystery-solving prowess.

 <p>
  With Sholmes, Ryunosuke performs the dance of deduction, where Sholmes' initial conclusions from cursory glances end up corrected by Ryunosuke, whilst the pair dance around the scene of the crime. Ryunosuke is also exposed to racism, with many English people decrying him for his Japanese heritage upon their frustration with him, most notably his rival prosecutor, Barok Van Zieks. Ultimately, he is able to prove himself as a capable attorney, uncovering the fetid underbelly of London's criminal justice system.

   <em>

  , players face threats at every turn. And there is nothing more frustrating than dying from damage after jumping from a not-so-great height. Fortunately, there is a set of armor that will help you forget about this problem. Therefore, this guide will tell you where to find Freefall Legs in
  <em>
   Fallout 4

  This unique combat armor consists of only two parts and has an acrobat's legendary effect. Thanks to the latter, players can jump from any height without fear of losing health. However, getting this armor can be quite time-consuming.

  Fall Damage Immunity is a powerful and useful ability. Therefore, it is not surprising that Freefall Legs are hidden quite well. In addition, players need to progress quite a lot in the game before they can get this armor.
  <strong>
   You can find the Freefall Legs set in
   <em>
    Fallout 4
   </em>
   once you reach the Mass Fusion Building, although you will have to climb to the top
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Even though the Mass Fusion Building can be found quite early in the game, getting to the top is extremely difficult. First, you need to unlock the elevator, which can only be done during the storyline. Secondly, even after reaching higher floors on the elevator, players will need Power Armor with a jetpack to get Freefall Legs in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  However, with Power Armor, you can skip the first step. Instead, you have to look for a workaround. On the floor with a glass ceiling, you will need to use the Jetpack to jump on the platforms and balconies until you reach the room with the safe. Open it to get various loot, including two pieces of the Freefall Legs set.

  Now that you know how players can get Freefall Legs in

  This glitch is quite simple and, after a little training, you will master it without any problems. Once you manage to successfully complete the glitch jump once, you need to get into a hall with a glass floor. Then lean against the wall nearby so that the elevator shaft is to your right, and use the glitch again.

  When you hit the ceiling, you will need to climb to the left and jump into the hole in the wall. Be careful, as falling at this stage can easily kill you. Finally, having reached the room, all you have to do is open the safe to get the coveted Freefall Legs in

  There are many great units in
  <em>
   Anime Last Stand
  </em>
  ; we will mention only a few here. These units will help you beat the most challenging game modes and earn plenty of rewards. So, let’s take a look at the best units in
  <em>
   Anime Last Stand
  </em>
  .

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Animated Crow
   </strong>
   is an amazing tower that deals a lot of damage with its attacks and flames. Also, it has a decent range and can hit a lot of enemies thanks to its large AoE. With the help of this Celestial-type unit, you will be able to destroy hordes of different mobs. To obtain Animated Crow, you will need to evolve a Mythic-type unit called Illusionist.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Green Esper
   </strong>
   is another Celestial-type unit that deals massive AoE damage and slows down the movement speed of your enemies. It is a decent tower for different game modes, and you may find it especially useful in Progressives. You can obtain this unit from the Banner 2.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Ice Elf Emperor
   </strong>
   is an Ultimate unit that you can get in the Snowy Domain Stage 6. There is a small chance that you will get this tower as a reward after completing this stage. Ice Elf Emperor has great AoE damage and is able to inflict the Cripple effect on your enemies. This unit is an excellent support that will work fine in any game mode.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Similar to many other tower defense games,
  <em>
   Anime Last Stand
  </em>
  has a massive roster of different units, and it constantly gets updated with new towers. So, the meta in
  <em>
   Anime Last Stand
  </em>
  changes quickly, and some of the towers in the top tier may not be as effective in the future.

  <em>
   Stardew Valley

  doesn't have many absolutely mandatory requirements for players to fulfill, allowing them to choose how they want to play it. Still, planning for seasons in advance is a common tactic among fans, but this fan ended up losing the entire season.

   Stardew Valley

  follows a simple calendar system that divides the seasons up as they are in the real world. Certain crops can only be planted and harvested during select seasons, and animals can only head outside during the warm seasons. For

  perfection speedrunners, every day counts, but it's rare to hear of someone that managed to miss out on an entire season.

  <em>
   Stardew Valley

  on the PC, and apparently made the mistake of thinking that they had paused the game by entering their inventory, when in reality, they hadn't. This allowed the title to continue running in the background, letting the days pass one by one.

Many thought it wasn't possible for time to accidentally pass in the game past a single day, as the title brings up a confirmation screen showing the player their level progress, if any, and what their sales netted them for the day. However, if the player doesn't level or put anything in a shipping bin, the game simply saves when the day completes and continues on to the next one. Apparently, they hadn't done this when they stepped away from the PC, and it proceeded to let the days pass until winter.

  While some mistakes in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  can be reversed by quickly quitting out without saving the day, this isn't one of them. The game automatically saves at the completion of each day, so there's no restoring the lost season for this player. The player didn't mention if they ended up losing any important crops, but their chickens did suffer a bit, as they weren't fed for the entire season that passed by. Their coop ended up being completely packed with uncollected eggs, as well.

  As
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  player Thick_Suggestion_ noted, it's not a bad idea to put something simple into
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's shipping bin at the start of any day that the player thinks they might get distracted by something. That fan accidentally fell asleep while playing the game and woke up to an entire year having passed. This simple tip will ensure that at most, players only lose a single day's worth of time.

  A clever
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan recently made competitive
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  stats for all 12 of the tank heroes in the game. Each character has typing, stats, abilities, moves, and even items that translate their strengths and weaknesses from
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  into
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  On Reddit back in April,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  fan HelloIamTaylor shared an image assigning
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  types to every playable hero at the time. The image went viral, with thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments on the post discussing the choices they had made, and what others might do differently.

 <p>
  Now, another fan inspired by this simple image has taken the assignment and run with it.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  player and Redditor EdarkSummie took all the tanks from the game and turned them into competitive
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  . They changed some of the types from the original post based on their own interpretations, and assigned abilities, items, and a slew of moves that mimic the iconic abilities used by the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  heroes. Lastly, they paired the dozen heroes with their pixel sprays, making them truly look like they belong in a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game.

 <p>
  To determine the stats of these “Overmon,” EdarkSummie took the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  tank heroes’ strengths and weaknesses into account. ATK and DEF were based on the close-range capabilities of the heroes, while SP. ATK and SP. DEF were derived from their long-range offense and defense. Their SPD was a combination of mobility and projectile speed, while their HP was simply a fifth of their health in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Needless to say, EdarkSummie’s fellow fans were impressed by their work. Given the popularity of both games, many
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players also enjoy
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , so seeing this incredibly creative project was a delight for many. Between their comprehensive explanations and discussions about their choices, it is clear they put a great deal of thought and effort into the project over the last couple of weeks – and fans appreciated it, with tons of comments and upvotes across their various posts.

 <p>
  Luckily, this likely won’t be the last fans see of EdarkSummie’s “Overmon” project. According to the post, EdarkSummie intends to move on to some of the DPS heroes next. They even fielded making a simple
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  hack using these
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  heroes to battle against one another. An official
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  crossover probably won't happen any time soon, but
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is doing a collab with
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  , so anything is possible. Until then, players will have to look forward to more of EdarkSummie's amazing stat blocks.

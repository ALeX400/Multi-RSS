  The City Racers minigame is back in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and it’s one of the most fun team events we’ve seen in a while. This time around, it has a bunch of lucrative rewards. It started on April 2 and will be around for
  <strong>
   four days

  The City Racers event has three races, and you need Flag tokens to move your cars forward and win prizes. But now that we’re getting close to the end of the event, a lot of players are wondering: What happens to leftover Flag tokens once City Racers ends? That’s what we’re going to talk about today.

 <p>
  Every minigame in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  handles extra tokens in its own way. Whether it’s Hammers from treasure digging events or Juggle Jam tokens from Carnival Games, it can get a little confusing trying to figure out what happens to leftovers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, just like with other tokens in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , your leftover Flag tokens will not go to waste.
  <strong>
   Once the City Racers event is over, any unused Flags will be automatically converted into cash.
  </strong>
  So even if fans don’t get to use all their Flag tokens during the event, they will still get something in return. The amount of money you get depends on the number of flags you have.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now cash is nice to have because you’ll need it to upgrade landmarks and finish boards. But let’s be real: it is one of the easiest things to earn in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  . It would’ve been way more helpful if we got some extra dice instead. So if you’re trying to grab the best rewards like the Wild Sticker, a 5-star sticker pack, or the new Champ token, it would be better to use all your Flags before the event ends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who want to collect more flags should join the solo event and tournaments. The ongoing Midnight Drive solo event offers 2,630 Flag tokens, while the Desert Drift tournament offers 2,160 tokens.

  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  goes in phases between releasing something revolutionary and something that lands with a thud. The Switch was definitely a game changer when it launched in 2017, prompting many companies to develop their own Switch-like consoles with portable options. The Steam Deck became the default, but other portable consoles are noteworthy, including the ASUS ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, and to a lesser extent, the PlayStation Portal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Will the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  be just as revolutionary as the Switch with its features? So far, Nintendo has shared details on GameChat, GameShare, guides players can access on their phone, and the news that Amiibo will still be around. However, there are
  <strong>
   some features they should announce next or get ready by the June 5 launch date if they want to make the Switch 2 another hit Nintendo console.

  While the Wii U wasn’t a smash hit for Nintendo, it had some fun ideas that fans fondly remember, like Miiverse. When booting up the Wii U, players could see their Miis, and the Miis of their online friends, in a little plaza. They could see what games people were playing, represented by their gathered Mii bodies, and they could even doodle notes, which wasn’t anything game-breaking for the industry but was cute all the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then there was SpotPoss and StreetPass on the 3DS, which updated social interactions as players passed others while traveling, leading to some mini-games. This was a fun social era for Nintendo, and it would be nice to see some sort of social hub return to the Switch 2.

  Streaming apps on consoles became ubiquitous in the HD era. If a new console came out, chances are Netflix, Hulu, and others would follow, which made sense for the evolving digital era of streaming content. Nintendo has a 4K-capable system in the Switch 2, so these apps will be in greater demand now.
 </p>
 <p>
  Everything under the sun should be available to download onto the Switch 2 from the Nintendo eShop, from standards like Disney+ to weird outliers like Tubi. It’s an obvious ask, and yet, given the last console, it seems like a big wish to ask for from Nintendo.

  Honestly, for many fans, the GameCube icon appearing was one of the biggest hype moments in the Switch 2 Direct. Those poor games have remained trapped on Nintendo's old system for ages, and now they can finally be played again, albeit through a slow drip feed.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of the previous classic console selections had relatively small download sizes because old cartridge-based games didn’t have that much data. However, GameCube games can easily reach a GB in size, and the more Nintendo releases in the catalog, the bigger the app will get. Nintendo should consolidate all of these classic console collections into one single app, and then allow players to download the games they want onto their system; otherwise, it’s going to turn into a storage hog.

  The DS had some amazing games, and the problem with porting them to modern consoles lies in the dual-screen setup. Many re-releases have tried different schemes, like
  <em>
   The World Ends With You
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection
  </em>
  . It all depends on what the bottom screen was used for. If it was a map, then it seemed like a no-brainer to just shift that functionality to a menu, but with the Switch 2, Nintendo has another option.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo showcased support for the upcoming enhanced versions of
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,
  </em>
  wherein players could set up the game's map on their phone. Nintendo could use this same technology and add DS games to the Switch’s classic library with ease.

  The 3DS and Wii U were a fun era for socializing with friends and random people online, but further back, the Wii had a spunky social feature too. The Wii’s eShop jingle became so catchy that a lot of YouTubers parodied it, like this skit from
  <em>
   Nirvana the Band the Show
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Why was this jingle abandoned by Nintendo? It helped them stand out from other digital storefronts, and now they are all just blank slates for players to CONSUME products, devoid of all flights of fancy. Let’s go back and embrace the weird Nintendo.

  There’s a secret feature a lot of people don’t know about on the Xbox app. Players can go into the store and pre-download a game even if they haven’t purchased it yet. Players cannot access the game until release time, and of course, they have to buy the game, so there is no harm from Microsoft’s perspective in allowing users to do this. This can be done on consoles for pre-downloading Game Pass games as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  The PS5 should allow this, along with the Nintendo Switch 2. It would be nice to give players the option of a digital game in case they can’t get a physical copy. That’s one scenario, but there are many reasons why this feature would be attractive.

  When the $10-per-game price hike happened on the PS5 and Xbox Series X &amp; S, fans were shocked. First, game prices hadn’t risen in over a decade, and it happened during one of the worst times in global economic history: the COVID-19 pandemic. It wasn’t an easy pill to swallow on top of the high price point of these consoles, but fans had to bite the bullet, and it seems like that proverbial bullet will be even harder to swallow with the Switch 2’s game price announcement.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Nintendo can make history by keeping their high prices but offering players digital discounts, like some sort of payment plan for games, which have become common options for most online purchases these days. If players cannot meet payment thresholds, then Nintendo can always revoke the digital license. It’s not a perfect setup, but it’s one they could explore.

      <title>Best Crossplay Games On Xbox Game Pass (April 2025)</title>

  Although still not a default practice, crossplay has grown considerably in popularity. Nowadays,
  <strong>
   cross-platform games
  </strong>
  are not unheard of, which makes sense since these titles rely on having active communities. If it is possible to bring everyone together rather than divide the player base, that should extend the project's lifespan.

  One of the best deals in gaming, Xbox Game Pass has an impressively diverse library that caters to most genres and player requirements. Although not heavily promoted, Microsoft's subscription service also has a few cross-platform titles. Therefore, that begs the question – which are the
  <strong>
   best crossplay games on Game Pass
  </strong>
  ?

  Currently available in early access/game preview,
  <em>
   33 Immortals
  </em>
  is still a work in progress; however, the current version is already impressive and provides a fairly complete experience, at least in terms of showcasing the roguelite's core gameplay loop. One of the most existing co-op games in a long time, Thunder Lotus's project delivers on its title's promise: 33-user multiplayer. Now, that does not mean players will be constantly battling alongside 32 other people, as that is rarely the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Putting aside time spent in the Dark Forest, which is the hub area, players are dropped onto a fairly large map, where they are encouraged to explore, kill monsters, collect resources, take on Torture Chambers, and eventually defeat the main bosses. For the most part, players will split up into smaller groups so they can cover as much ground as possible, especially since certain challenges come with restrictions anyway.
  <em>
   33 Immortals
  </em>
  emphasize smart and cohesive teamwork, and even as groups spread across the terrain, they are still all working toward the same endpoint.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of actual gameplay,
  <em>
   33 Immortals
  </em>
  shares similarities with
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  , offering fast-paced isometric action with stylish combat. As a roguelite, players will constantly be upgrading their skills during a run, and long-term progression is tied to the Feat Level. There are also plenty of weapons to pick from, although sticking to one is generally advised.

  Perhaps in preparation for its sequel,
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  has found its way to Xbox Game Pass, greatly enhancing the service's co-op catalog in the process. While somewhat polarizing due to its story and a few of its characters, the 2019 title has by far the best gunplay in the franchise, arguably even surpassing
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Ultimate Edition
  </em>
  also comes with the four DLC campaigns, which are generally a lot of fun to play through. Even if the writing might not be to everyone's tastes,
  <em>
   Borderlands 3

  While not 100% guaranteed, most modern sports games tend to incorporate crossplay support, just because these projects live and die because of the viability of their online sessions. Thanks to its collaboration with EA Play, Xbox Game Pass has a few cross-platform sports games, although exceptions exist. For example,
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 24
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   NHL 24
  </em>
  support crossplay, but
  <em>
   UFC 5
  </em>
  does not.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Madden NFL 25
  </em>
  is another project that allows PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S users to play with or against each other, and the feature is activated by default (although it can be turned off via the Xbox's system settings).
  <em>
   Madden NFL 25
  </em>
  has quite a few multiplayer options, and they generally support cross-platform play. For instance, the feature is available in Franchise and Ultimate Team, which are arguably the most popular modes in the game.

  With new releases being a yearly tradition,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  should not have felt like a big deal. Activision's game was always going to be a huge commercial success because the IP has become so inescapable that financial failure seems impossible; however, the previous entry,
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  ​​​​​​, garnered pretty universal criticism, especially its single-player campaign. Even the usually reliable Zombies mode struggled to receive a global nod of approval, largely thanks to
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  taking an open-world approach that lacked the intensity of waved-based missions. Therefore,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  was a sure-fire blockbuster, but it was hardly a guaranteed critical darling.
 </p>
 <p>
  More importantly, the game debuted directly on Game Pass, a first for the franchise. This presented a rare opportunity for
  <em>
   COD
  </em>
  to bring back lapsed players who had grown tired of the formula and had no desire to drop cash on a new project. To cater to these returnees (or even newcomers),
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  wisely incorporated a lengthy and enjoyable single-player campaign that hearkens back to the franchise's glory days.
 </p>
 <p>
  As good as the story is,
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  's legacy will be defined by its multiplayer, both the PvP modes and Zombies. Wisely, crossplay is thoroughly supported, allowing players from all ecosystems to play together. This is a particularly big deal for Zombies, which mostly reverted to
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  's formula. That is not a bad thing. PvP also plays things safe, delivering reliable maps and staple game modes.
  <em>
   BO6
  </em>
  is among the best
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games in a long while, and it serves as a great reintroduction to the franchise.

  Nothing in the world is less fun than moving from one house to another. The event is tedious, frustrating, and prone to disastrous errors; the sooner it is done, the better. Naturally, this process sounds like the perfect basis for a video game series!
  <em>
   Moving Out
  </em>
  serves as a prime example that developers can make anything fun with the right creativity and, more often than not, co-op. The original 2020 entry is a delightful psychics-based sim that challenges players to take charge of a moving company that tends to accept requests that are a bit unusual. It proved that this concept can work in a party setting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  builds upon its predecessor's foundations, delivering a similar gameplay loop that is enhanced through far more absurd scenarios. Yes, this is a multiverse adventure that sends movers across dimensions. Putting aside the ridiculous missions,
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  is, at its core, a puzzle game about finding the ideal path to ensure that as many items survive the transfer process in one piece, which is easier said than done. Communication is key, especially since the title really should be played with a few friends. Sure, single-player is an option, but
  <em>
   Moving Out 2
  </em>
  loses a lot when co-op is not involved. It is simply designed for multiplayer. Fortunately, the game supports cross-platform play, so it should not be that difficult to set up a play session.

 <p>
  Following a stellar debut,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's post-launch life has been slightly messy. Blizzard's action RPG has developed a mixed reputation, with every new update seemingly muddying the water more. Even if not universally loved,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is nevertheless a big deal with plenty of positives in its favor, including a reasonably fun single-player campaign that should be able to keep someone entertained for a couple of hours. However, this franchise has never prioritized storytelling, and that remains true with the 2023 entry. As such, players will be spending most of their time grinding for loot in the endgame, which is the section that has arguably garnered the most criticism.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unsurprisingly,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  shines the brightest when played in co-op, a feature complemented by widespread cross-platform support. The multiplayer element has some issues, like launching with a lack of a global chat, but co-op can be an absolute blast as it allows players to take advantage of the different classes' complementary capabilities. More importantly,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has come quite far since its launch, steadily developing into a more robust and complete experience. While the
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  expansion requires additional investment, Blizzard regularly releases free updates that improve (or just change) the base game.

  is firmly cemented as the definitive baseball franchise, with each entry offering a realistic but accessible sim that honors the sport's history while reflecting on its current status. Although perhaps not the most highly regarded entry in the series,
  <em>
   MLB The Show 24
  </em>
  still features top-notch gameplay, high production value, and modes that can keep players engaged for months on end.
 </p>
 <p>
  People who want to play alone can focus on Road to the Show, Franchise, or Storylines, all of which are huge time sinks that provide fairly different experiences from each other. The game supports cross-progression fully too. Nowadays, a modern sports game cannot exist without an online component, and
  <em>
   MLB The Show 24
  </em>
  has that covered with Diamond Dynasty. Utilizing cards and seasons, this mode can be addictive and polarizing.

  Ever since its rough launch in 2018, Rare's
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  has amassed a dedicated fanbase who appreciate its free-roaming structure, stylish visuals, and frequent updates. Although the waters are not bereft of solitary adventurers,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  is largely intended to be a co-op experience, with players being encouraged to create crews to get the most out of the pirate life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of whether someone seeks companionship or not, they will meet other players at some point or another since
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  is an always-online multiplayer game; consequently, it benefits from crossplay support. Considering the title will likely always be available on Game Pass, it makes sense to combine the community into one online space. That said, controller-only players might struggle in PvP scenarios against pirates controlled by keyboards and mice, leading to a few unbalanced encounters. As such,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves'
  </em>
  crossplay is mainly for when friends from different ecosystems want to join forces.

  games are generally dependable, even if the curse of the annual release means improvements are incremental rather than significant.
  <em>
   F1 24
  </em>
  is arguably the best entry since EA's acquisition of Codemasters, and it is a fairly accessible experience that tries to be welcoming to new players while still catering to veterans. Solo players who have no intention of taking part in online races can just stick to MyTeam or a career mode that features real-life drivers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The online scene primarily comes down to ranked races, although there are more casual options as well. Honestly,
  <em>

  's multiplayer modes are inconsistent, providing races that can get frustrating rather quickly. Newcomers who are still coming to grips with the basics will also want to stick to single-player. Still, online is part of the equation and supports crossplay.

  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  casts such a dense shadow over the platform fighting genre that any project that enters the space will automatically be compared to Nintendo's juggernaut crossover franchise, and they are always in an uphill battle to stand out in a positive light. Even though
  <em>
   SSB
  </em>
  is exclusive to one ecosystem and not direct competition for multi-platform releases, an IP has yet to come that succeeds in defining itself as the definitive option on Xbox or PlayStation consoles. Although not an exception,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
  </em>
  is among the better alternatives available to modern players, especially the sequel.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the first game kind of fell flat,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2
  </em>
  managed to improve significantly on its predecessor's rocky foundation, providing a far more complete and well-rounded experience. Featuring an impressive roster of characters that should delight both old-school and new fans of the channel's cartoons, the game offers a decent range of modes, including a must-welcome single-player option that incorporates roguelike elements. Filled with Easter Eggs and consistently charming, the latter serves as a decent introduction to the game's mechanics while delivering enough entertainment to keep somebody busy for a few hours. If nothing else, the campaign is perfect for kids who are maybe too young to jump online.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still,
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2
  </em>
  's replayvalue is entirely based on its multiplayer options, which allow up to four players to engage in all-out war or 1v1 and 2v2 battles. Nothing too special for the genre, but the chaotic gameplay, fun character movesets, and slime mechanic keep things interesting and silly.

  By this point,
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  has more than proven its staying power. Every few months, Behaviour Interactive boosts the game's relevance through expansions, most of which contain versions of popular horror icons. While hardly the only egg in the basket,
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is undoubtedly the most popular 4v1 survival horror project on the market.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2020, Behaviour added cross-platform support on consoles and PC, which undoubtedly extended
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's lifespan. For the uninitiated, the game pits four survivors against a single killer, challenging the former to fix generators and escape before they are wiped out by the latter. Each character, both good and evil, comes with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Although matches can get formulaic after a while,
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  's vast selection of killers and survivors should keep players busy, provided they are willing to try out different characters.

  After a lengthy spell in early access, Obsidian's
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  made its full debut in 2022. The survival game shrinks players down to (ant) size, before dropping them into a seemingly average backyard. However, due to their miniature dimensions, players quickly discover that this is a dangerous and cutthroat world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  is perfectly enjoyable as a solo experience; in fact, there is something to be said about facing the game's challenges without any support. However, the Xbox title supports co-op and permits up to four (online) players to embark on this journey as a unit.

  brings medieval warfare to life, and it is gloriously bloody. Featuring three fractions and allowing for up to 64 players per match, the game drops players in grand battlefields and challenges them to complete an objective while slaughtering everything that moves. The result is a messy and addictive melee that comes with a fairly steep learning curve, although the bouts' chaotic nature should be entertaining enough to keep newcomers hooked while they come to grips with the basics.

  Although its reputation has arguably diminished since its 2021 launch,
  <em>
   Deathloop
  </em>
  is still a fun title with a unique take on multiplayer. Arkane Lyon's time-loop game casts players as Colt, an assassin who must take out eight targets in a single day. Failure restarts everything, with Colt remembering his experiences. Functioning somewhat like a roguelite, each run is largely the same, and players are expected to learn from their past attempts as they plot out better strategies for taking out Colt's targets.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides dealing with the many enemies that populate the island of Blackreef, Colt also has to keep an eye out for Julianna, an agent who is specifically there to ensure the time loop remains intact. Basically, she needs to kill Colt. While this character can be controlled by AI, Julianna can also be handed over to another player, creating a unique take on multiplayer. This aspect is arguably the best part of
  <em>
   Deathloop
  </em>
  since it adds an element of unpredictability that tends to be otherwise missing, especially since the game's AI is not fantastic. The game supports crossplay in an attempt to prolong PvP, which is not an easy thing to do in what is otherwise a single-player experience.

  Xbox Game Pass has both
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  projects, although the 2023 sequel does not support crossplay. If someone will be playing solo or only with Xbox users, they should go with
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  since it does improve on many of its predecessor's ideas, and it has a class that makes single-player runs easier to manage. However, anyone requiring cross-platform play between PC and Xbox has no choice but to pick
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  . Although it does feel like old news by this point, the 2019 release is still a very good time in its own right, and it still stands as one of the better Souls-like shooters on the market.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  drops players in a version of Earth that has been corrupted, sending them on missions that utilize random generation to add an element of unpredictability. A single playthrough will not contain all the game's content, so players will need to go for multiple runs if they want to experience everything the title has to offer.
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  is 100% designed with co-op in mind, with the game allowing three players to jump into a campaign. They will be allowed to pick from three archetypes, which are fairly flexible since they do not block players from using certain weapon types. Like most Souls-likes,
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  is challenging, although it is still one of the theme's more accessible options.

  <em>
   Space Engineers

  is an ambitious sandbox project set in space, granting players the freedom to mine and craft to their hearts' content. The game can be quite overwhelming at first since it does not provide much direction or hand-holding, but once someone learns the basics, they can lose a lot of time in this universe.
 </p>
 <p>
  While newcomers should start with solo servers until they come to grips with the controls, they will eventually move over to the online options, which allow them to play with other people.
  <em>
   Space Engineers
  </em>
  has a fairly active and passionate community too, so it is a good game to jump into if someone is looking to craft, build, and communicate.

   For Honor
  </em>
  has managed to survive longer than most people might have predicted when it launched in 2017. While always somewhat niche compared to other popular multiplayer games, Ubisoft's game has established a dedicated and passionate fan base who just want to see if a Samurai can beat a Knight or a Viking.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unique presentation aside,
  <em>
   For Honor
  </em>
  is essentially part of the fighting genre, and it comes with a steep learning curve that will likely push newcomers away during their first hours. Fortunately,
  <em>
   For Honor
  </em>
  has a tutorial and AI enemy options to help beginners come to grips with the difficult core mechanics. Obviously, the game's selling point is its online modes, but jumping in without knowing the basics will result in a frustrating and demoralizing experience. Although varying depending on the mode chosen, battles are largely group affairs, with the game emphasizing teamwork quite a bit. The combat system is tactical, deliberately paced, and reactionary; while far from easy to master, it has quite a lot of depth.

  Ubisoft's modern releases tend to get passionate responses, both positive and negative. The publisher has a well-defined formula for open-worlds that has worn thin with certain players over the last decade; conversely, these games can be engaging and comforting escapes from reality that offer (usually) decent gameplay, stories, and visuals. While somewhat different from
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Riders Republic
  </em>
  nevertheless has the heart of a traditional Ubisoft release, a loaded statement that might provide enough context for somebody to determine whether this game will suit their interests or not. That said, when it comes to extreme sports projects, the 2021 release does not have much competition, particularly on this scale.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smashing together a few different real-life mountains and locations,
  <em>
   Riders Republic
  </em>
  drops players on a huge and gorgeous map that is packed with challenges, races, and stunts. From there, they have access to an array of disciplines (skiing, biking, snowboarding, wingsuit), all of which control differently and take a while to master. Now, riders can opt to focus on their preferred specialty, but they should consider dipping their toes in each area to help unlock the whole map.
 </p>
 <p>
  While playable solo,
  <em>
   Riders Republic
  </em>
  is very much designed to be a social game, with 64 players sharing the server. All the events are designed to be played with other people, and crossplay has helped keep the online scene healthy for longer.

  Originally going by
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown
  </em>
  before receiving a substantial upgrade in 2024, the
  <em>
   1896
  </em>
  variant is still primarily the same game, albeit with a significant change in setting. Taking place on pretty cool maps with an old-school Louisiana vibe, the title challenges hunters to take on bounties, with the goal being to discover clues and take on the final boss. However, players can opt to simply engage in the PvP element of this PvPvE game and gradually accumulate small gains, allowing them to extract safely and securely as long as they remain in one piece. People who prefer to go for solo runs will likely have to use this strategy as it is pretty darn difficult to compete against teams, and even the AI enemies can quickly overwhelm the poorly prepared or unlucky.
 </p>
 <p>
  In most cases, players will likely approach
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  as a multiplayer co-op experience, where they can team up with a few friends. Now, this is where some issues arise with crossplay. Technically, the game allows PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players to jump into the same match, something they might accomplish if they queue roughly at the same time. However, it is not possible to invite friends across platforms, which makes matching up with friends quite difficult. Still, crossplay support helps keep the community alive on these platforms, even if
  <em>
   Hunt: Showdown 1896
  </em>
  will always be more popular on PC.

  OK, this one is a special case.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is a free-to-play game that can be accessed without a subscription, so players do not need to grab Game Pass just to play HoYoVerse's action RPG. However, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers receive some benefits if they happen to play
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , with the bundle's content including a few items that provide a tiny edge during the opening few hours. Honestly, the gifts will not make a huge difference, but they are still worth picking up if someone wants to try
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and already has a Game Pass Ultimate sub.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has been showered with praise for the best part of four years, during which it grew into one of the most successful games on the market. While debuting in 2020, the project did not join the Xbox ecosystem until November 2024, making it a relatively "new" Series X/S title. By the time of its debut,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  had already gone through a lot of updates, to the point of now being so packed with content that it will probably keep new players entertained for months on end.
 </p>
 <p>
  While working brilliantly as a single-player JRPG,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  can also be enjoyed with friends, although players will need to advance the story a bit to unlock co-op. Four people can join forces to either explore the world or take on events, as long as a quest supports co-op.

      <title>8 GameCube Games That Should Be On The Nintendo Switch 2</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/gamecube-games-that-should-be-on-switch-2/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The GameCube launched in 2001 and had a distinct design that made it easily portable. While it didn't live up next to its biggest rival, the PS2, it still had some stellar software. Fans have been waiting for GameCube games to come to the Switch ever since their classics library opened up for the online service and it looks like the Switch 2 is getting GameCube support.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  When the Switch 2 launches on June 5, these GameCube games will be available:
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   F-Zero GX.
  </em>
  Later, Nintendo plans to put out
  <em>
   Luigi’s Mansion, Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Strikers, Chibi-Robo, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pokemon Coliseum
  </em>
  too. What games should come out after that second rollout?

  <em>
   Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem
  </em>
  was one of the best horror games on the GameCube: a system without many to speak of. It played with the minds of players by breaking the fourth wall including switching screens and turning down the volume. Many games have tried doing this since the horror genre has evolved, so
  <em>
   Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem
  </em>
  ’s tricks may seem quaint by today’s standards. Still, as a history lesson, it seems like a necessary digital addition to the Switch 2’s GameCube collection.

  It’s great that
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
  </em>
  will be available on day one on the Switch 2 even though Nintendo made a better version on the Wii U via a remaster. That aside,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures
  </em>
  would be another welcome addition to the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  series on the Switch 2. This little marvel required four players to each have a GBA and cable to play together around the GameCube. It was a big requirement but the modern age could rectify this costly setup with proper online or local integration.

  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes
  </em>
  was a remake of the PS1 classic using similar gameplay mechanics as Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. For example, when aiming guns, players could go into a first-person perspective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides the gameplay tweaks, the story got improvements too with more in-depth cinematic including an infamous one wherein Solid Snake dodged a rocket like he was in
  <em>
   The Matrix
  </em>
  . There was also a multiplayer mode which was one of the earliest implementations in the series which could see a fun resurgence online if only Konami and Nintendo willed it.

  <em>
   Odama
  </em>
  is a forgotten exclusive from the GameCube era and one of the more odder gameplay setups and that’s counting all of the GBA and cable shenanigans from games like
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures
  </em>
  . Odama was essentially a castle destroyer game set in the feudal era of Japan wherein players could command their soldiers using a packed-in microphone. It was also like a pinball game as soldiers could bounce around a large boulder. With the Switch 2’s 3D audio capabilities, it makes sense to bring back games like this.

  <em>
   Skies of Arcadia: Legends
  </em>
  was a GameCube port of a Dreamcast game and to this day, it’s the only port this Sega RPG classic ever got. Fans have been begging Sega to remaster the game or make a sequel for decades. If they aren’t willing to do either then Nintendo could at least step in and re-release the GameCube version on Switch 2. It’s unlike any turn-based game of this era, featuring sky pirates in an unforgettable adventure. Sega fans would admittedly also love to play
  <em>
   Phantasy Star Online Episode 1 &amp; 2
  </em>
  on Switch 2 if it got proper online support.

  <em>
   Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2: Rogue Leader
  </em>
  was a launch title for the GameCube and it’s still one of the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  games that fans love to point to as an all-out banger. The story content, level design, and available ships all helped it rise above its predecessor on the N64 which is also well-celebrated.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a curiosity why there haven’t been more games like this and the most recent game, Star Wars: Squadrons, even had VR support. Fans still want aerial fighter games like this and bringing back classics via digital storefronts is one step.

  Even though fans loved
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  on the Switch for its character selection and gameplay, there will never be a bigger game in the franchise than
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Melee
  </em>
  . It’s still played in tournaments even though Nintendo has put the kibosh on its inclusion more than once. An easy way to appease to fighting game community would be to re-release this game on Switch 2 which would win them so many brownie points. They probably could get away with re-releasing this game alone and fabs would be happy.

  <em>
   Wario World
  </em>
  was Wario’s only 3D platformer which was still mostly in 2D. While it never got as much praise as the
  <em>
   Wario Land
  </em>
  games, it had plenty to love. Wario’s weird noises, gameplay mechanics, and more helped him stand out next to his rival Mario. Wario deserves better like a brand new solo adventure on Switch 2 that isn’t just a mini-game collection and re-releasing Wario World could help engage interest again.

   <em>
    Star Wars Outlaws
   </em>
  </strong>
  has a strange way of leveling up players through the protagonist Kay Vess. Players can run into NPCs called Experts who can bestow abilities onto Kay in the game. They can increase her HP or make her little buddy Nix more helpful during combat.

 <p>
  By completing main missions and moving onto other planets, Kay will also level up her Charm slots. She begins with one Major Charm slot and then several more Minor slots will open up with each progressive level. They act like accessories do in other RPGs that increase stats and grant buffs just like the armor does in
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  . There are many to find in the game, so let’s get to some standout Charms.

  The Copalroot Bead can be a bit tricky to find as it belongs to a traveling merchant on Toshara. If players manage to find Chrissanta Palus, they will be rewarded with a fine Minor Charm. It is one of the many ways to increase Kay’s health in
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  . Other ways include equipping her with various armor choices along with the abilities taken from Experts. The Copalroot Bead is a basic piece of gear for any video game but it is still important especially since Kay is not armed to the teeth, unlike other video game heroes.

 <p>
  The Weathered Seashell Charm is another Minor Charm that players can find in the game. It can be acquired at Akiva’s bizarre from a woman through a quick exchange. Ubisoft gives players free range to play the game however they like but it is certainly more set up like a stealth game. That means that Kay can die easily, as previously mentioned, since her health will be low and enemies can overrun her easily. The Weathered Seashell Charm is handy then because it will decrease the chance of Kay getting hit while dodging or running sort of like that invisible barrier that keeps heroes mostly injury-free in movies. Players will be doing a lot of running while trying to find cover, or to get back to their Speeder to escape the law.

 <p>
  The Baby Rancor Fang is one of the better Major Charms on the list and it can be found after the Rancor fight. The Charm will benefit Nix as it will make him more aggressive in battle. Nix is a great companion to Kay but from a gameplay perspective, Nix is also kind of a tool in
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Players can deploy him to steal cash from enemies or he can attack them. Nix’s “attacks” won’t damage enemies but they can distract enemies until Kay can finish them off. There is a timer going and the Baby Rancor Fang can elongate this stunned effect.

 <p>
  The Frostfire Crystal Shard is a Minor Charm and it can be bought from Neva Yaranu who is a vendor on the planet Kijimi in
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  . From grenades to rocket launchers to other explosive devices, enemies will have a lot to throw at Kay in battle. Stormtroopers will especially be armed to the teeth the more players increase their wanted level in
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  . That’s where the Frostfire Crystal Shard comes in handy as it will reduce explosive damage. Players need to be vigilant about watching out for explosive cues, but mistakes can happen which is why having that extra layer of protection is important.

  The Sunset Pebble can be found in Hutt Cartel territory around the middle of Tatooine from a random seller known only as Adventurer. This Minor Charm will increase the amount of Adrenaline Kay gets when caught. There are ways to negate the immediate effect of getting caught while trying to be sneaky. Fast-Talk is an Expert ability in
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  that can be learned from Bram Shano. The great Lando Calrissian is also an Expert who has the Just Improvise ability. Together, they will give players more time to talk their way out of a situation. The Sunset Pebble can give players that extra edge of Adrenaline so that they can execute their captors if negotiations go poorly.

  It will make it harder for enemies to detect Kay while she is sneaking around. There are other abilities and gear that can deafen her footsteps as well, but this Minor Charm should be enough depending on how high their difficulty setting is in

 <p>
  The Cyclone Relic can be found in some ruins called Excavation Site 12 on Akiva and it is a Major Charm. This one will give players a chance at recovering a Bacta Vial or a grenade upon using it in
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  . The grenade should be self-explanatory to anyone who has played an action game before but the Bacta Vial may require some extra explaining. It is the healing item in the game and all Bacta Vials can recover the full amount but it takes time for players to recover and the healing process can get interrupted. There are similar Charms to this like the Aurora Snowflake Pin which only works at recovering Bacta Vials, so overall the Cyclone Relic is the superior version.

 <p>
  The Overgrown Amber Stone can be found via intel recovered on Toshara called the Mysterious Charm. This Major Charm will increase Kay’s health like the Copalroot Bead with the bonus of Adrenaline. This will kick into activity if players get to a near-critical level with Kay in battle, giving her literally another shot to stay alive. It’s not a flashy Charm and most of these on the list aren’t. The Overgrown Amber Stone is practical though and these tips overall are meant to keep players alive as long as possible while supplying them with items and getting them an extra edge during combat.

  It seems many
  <strong>
   Xbox
  </strong>
  fans on Xbox One and Series X/S are having trouble installing backward compatible original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles. Xbox has been praised for its renowned backward compatibility program that allows gamers to play and even purchase older Xbox and 360 games on the newer consoles. While not every game has been brought forward, large swaths of the Xbox and 360 library have, including most well-known AAA franchises like
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , and even some lesser-known niche titles, like
  <em>
   Blue Dragon
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Binary Domain
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Xbox's recent August update, while having added many welcome features like more support for the Fire TV Stick and Discord, seemed to have caused a major issue leading to gamers not being able to connect to multiplayer games. Some of the biggest, most popular multiplayer titles were affected, like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  , and others. Thankfully, team Xbox was able to get the problem resolved in a matter of days with a small update that just rolled out today.

 <p>
  While it fixed the multiplayer connectivity issue, it seems this same update has caused a new problem affecting backward compatibility on Xbox. Many users are reporting being met with a "There's a problem getting this content right now" message when attempting to install backward compatible Xbox games via disc. Luckily, some are reporting that Xbox 360 games that are already installed are working just fine; it's in trying to install these titles that gamers are being presented with this disheartening error message.

 <p>
  Reportedly, there seems to be somewhat of a workaround for those uninterested in waiting for a fix from Xbox. Searching up the particular backward compatible title via the Xbox store while the disc is in the console will usually provide players with an install prompt, though using this prompt doesn't seem to have a 100% success rate. This is especially unfortunate for the Xbox fans who scrambled to purchase backward compatible Xbox 360 games ahead of the closure of Xbox 360's Marketplace, which sadly took many titles with it in July.

  Those who don't have any luck installing their backward compatible disc games via the Xbox store will have no other option than to wait for Microsoft to fix the issue.

  Khaos Reigns is set to provide a significant expansion to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </strong>
  </em>
  , but it may not be the only big event in the game's future.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  not only provided another installment of the hit fighting franchise, it also rebooted its timeline once more, putting extra pressure on it to succeed. With Khaos Reigns bringing the count of DLC fighters to 10, the game has already significantly grown in the year since its release. There is reason to believe that the game isn't done growing, and Khaos Reigns could only be the latest stage of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  's development.

 <p>
  The upcoming Khaos Reigns DLC for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  is going to be an expansion reminiscent of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  's Aftermath. In addition to bringing a new story for the DLC, it's also bringing six new DLC fighters to the game, including:

  The DLC has a definite theme for both sides of its roster. The
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  originals are all Lin Kuei ninjas, while the guest fighters are all film icons, albeit from three different genres. Following up on Kombat Pack 1, Khaos Reigns looks to be another notable expansion for

  , though there is a good chance more big content drops will follow.

  Mortal Kombat 1 Could Surpass Mortal Kombat 11's Support
 </h3>
 <p>
  Prior to the game's release, Ed Boon implied that
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  's post-launch support could be the longest in the series. For context,
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  had recieved a healthy amount of content after release, with multiple waves of DLC fighters in addition to the Aftermath campaign. The amount of content in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  was comfortably able to keep it popular in the five years until the next installment came around. If
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  is to match or exceed that, then Khaos Reigns will not be the end of its support.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  has yet to meet the bar set by its predecessor.

  Many Key Characters Still Have Not Entered Mortal Kombat 1

 <p>
  It should be pointed out that there are still several
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  fighters missing as of Khaos Reigns. This includes series mainstays such as Jax and Sonya, who were a surprise to not see in the base roster.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  has several games worth of characters that have yet to be added to
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  , and in many cases haven't even been sighted in the new timeline yet. That means that even discounting guest characters, there are plenty of potential options for future expansions.

 <p>
  Further expansions could also be used to explore more of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  's timeline. There have already been many lore changes in
  <em>
   M ortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  , and it would be interesting to see if any other characters or factions have been through significant changes in Liu Kang's new world. In addition to fleshing them out with new campaigns, the expansions could also bring new modes to play as well. New ways to play would be another way to extend the game's shelf life in addition to adding new characters.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  has already experimented plenty, and it doesn't have to stop yet.

 <p>
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  did incredibly well, and surpassing it should be a goal for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  and its developers. While the prospect of upcoming fighters in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  is naturally exciting, future expansions can add even more. Fighters, stories, and game modes are all on the table when it comes to what could be added to
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  , and each would do wonders for the game's longevity. If
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  is going to last, then Khaos Reigns probably won't be the end of its updates.

  While many of these popular cosplays are understandably of humans and more humanoid Pokemon, there are times when a creative fan chooses to channel more difficult characters like Magikarp or its considerably more powerful evolution Gyarados. Introduced in the first
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  generation as the 129th and 130th Pokemon, respectively, these two contrasting Water types are infamous among fans for how radically different they are in both appearance and abilities. Magikarp is often mocked for how weak and ineffective it is in battle, while Gyarados is feared for its violent temperament and destructive power.

The following year, Lucasmh returned to Dragon Con as the crimson Shiny Gyarados, as if they spent the entire year evolving from a small, timid fish into a massive, raging sea serpent.

  Lucasmh’s post on the Pokemon subreddit has been flooded with compliments for their impressive cosplay work, with some comments even coming from people who had met the user on the Dragon Con 2024 floor. Understandably, Lucasmh has been flattered by the positive response and says that they intend to keep showing off their
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  cosplays in the future. Some Reddit users are already suggesting that they go to Dragon Con 2025 as the dual Water/Dark type Mega Gyarados evolution that was introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  .

  As Lucasmh notes in one of their Reddit comments,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  is one of the biggest gaming franchises on the planet, and this rings especially true in how it has continued to inspire artists and cosplayers to create their own versions of popular Pokemon and trainers alike over the years. Returning to Dragon Con next year as the fearsome Mega Gyarados would be a great way to continue this creator's imaginative run of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  cosplays that have already captivated fellow fans.

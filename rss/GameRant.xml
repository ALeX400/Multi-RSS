	<em>
	 <strong>
		Elden Ring
	 </strong>
	</em>
	players are trying to crack another map mystery before the release of the
	<em>
	 Shadow of the Erdtree
	</em>
	DLC, with the origin of the illustration on the Haligdrake Talisman being the point of contention this time around. While it is not uncommon for
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	theories to spark discussions in the community, this one seems to have stirred a much-heated debate among fans, with players having several plausible claims on both sides of the spectrum.

 <p>
	As the release of the
	<em>
	 Shadow of the Erdtree
	</em>
	DLC draws closer,
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	fans have been going absolutely berserk with their theories. While some are coming up with new ways to defeat bosses like the Mimic Tear in
	<em>
	 Elden Rin
	</em>
	g, others are trying to find any leftover hints they might have missed in their initial playthroughs. Amid that, a new map theory seems to be the biggest buzz in the
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	community.

 <p>
	In a new post on the
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	subreddit, user chrysamere highlights that one of the Talismans in the game could actually be associated with the map. As per the user, the Haligdrake Talisman depicts a version of the map prior to the birth of the Erdtree, and they highlight several important traits to back up their claim. They correlate the head of the dragon to the Volcano, while the tail is associated with
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	's Castle Morne. Likewise, the space between the dragon's body and wings has a small projection, which the player thinks is an island representation of Leyndell. The central part is believed to be obscured by the veil, which many feel is also the place where the Land of Shadow resides.

 <p>
	In fact, another post on the
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	subreddit by user Armillian argued how many in the community would've believed that it was a map if VaatiVidya, a creator well-known for demystifying the Soulsborne lore, had claimed so. Armillian further adds that it could be possible that FromSoftware might actually have designed the figure to have a dual purpose, serving as a dragon as well as a representation of the map. Considering that FromSoftware had already suggested that one
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	mystery is yet to be solved, this might not be far-fetched.

	The Warrior of Light is a central character to the
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Final Fantasy 14
	 </strong>
	</em>
	story, and choosing the appearance the players want for their hero well is crucial. If players aren't satisfied with the appearance they've chosen for their character or have changed their mind, everything can be changed.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":299} -->

 <p>
	But some elements will require a crucial price. While it's easy to change things like the haircut, hair color, and more through the Aesthetician, the race of the character requires one Fantasia use. The developer only hands a few of them for free, but otherwise, it has to be bought with real currency at the Mog Station. With that in mind, choosing the correct Race for the Warrior of Light is an important decision.

 <p>
	There is a total of eight races playable in
	<em>
	 FF14
	</em>
	. Some of them are locked behind expansions, since the developer adds a new one for each release. Each race features specific bonuses in the following base stats: Strength, Vitality, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Mind.

 <p>
	However, those don't make any difference once players start to level up, so it's not advised to choose a race based on this information. Some other things can change depending on the race, however. Here is the list.

 <p>
	Hyur is the closest thing from a human race players can get in Eorzea. According to their description, they are the most populous of all civilized races in the
	<em>
	 FF14
	</em>
	world. Their shape is standard, although Highlanders are taller than Midlanders.

 <p>
	Elezen are, as their name suggests, elves of Eorzea. They have long ears that players can customize at will, as well as a long and thin shape. Surprisingly enough, they aren't commonly found in the game, as players are more keen on playing Mi'qote, Viera, and other hybrid races, rather than elves.

 <p>
	Lalafells are the most discreet folks in
	<em>
	 FF14
	</em>
	, with a very small size and cute features. This unique race isn't easily noticed in a crowd, but players usually react to these characters because there aren't a lot of them in the game. They will often receive patpats and more signs of affection, so players who want to be cute should consider them.

		 Don't worry about the peculiar size of Lalafells: the game is well-adjusted to them. Cutscenes are adapted to their small size, as well as clothes and mounts. It might help that the Game Director Naoki Yoshida is a big Lalafell player.

	<strong>
	 Miqo'te is the most popular race by far in

	, and those players will see the most among NPCs, too. They are hybrid humans with cat ears. This particularity aside, they have models close to the human's. In addition to their ears, they have very recognizable voices. Players can choose either Seekers of the Sun, with lighter skin, or Keepers of the Moon, with darker skin.

 <p>
	The most famous Roegadyn in Eorzea is Merlwyb, the wolf Roegadyn who, after a career in piracy, took the lead of the Grand Company Maelstrom. She's fierce and represents the race, as Roegadyn are among the
	<strong>
	 underdogs of Eorzea
	</strong>
	's races in terms of representation.

 <p>
	Roegadyns are among the tallest playable races. The male models are very bulky. They have two variants: Sea Wolves, with lighter skin, and Hellsguard, with darker skin. Players who want to play
	<strong>
	 underrepresented races
	</strong>
	can consider this one, since it's one of the least popular.

 <p>
	Au Ra is a race installed in Ilsabard. They are wild-looking, with horns and scales on their faces. This race is quite unique, although their shape is similar to humans. This appearance is due to the fact that they're
	<strong>
	 progeny of dragons
	</strong>
	. Players who are willing to main Dragoon can consider those, if they want to fit the theme. Male models are largely taller than Female ones. There are two variants of Au Ri: Raen, with lighter skin and white scales, and Xaela, with dark horns.

	While the Hrothgar race has been exclusively Male since its release,

	Vieras are inhabitants of the Rak'tika Greatwood. They are tall humanoids with bunny ears who live in a matriarchal society, as males are rare and bound to protect their territory from outside threats.

	This is the latest race to be released in
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Final Fantasy 14
	 </strong>

	. When it released alongside
	<em>
	 Shadowbringers
	</em>
	, only Female characters were available. Then, the developer added Male character models with the release of
	<em>
	 Endwalker
	</em>
	in 2021. Viera is a unique-looking race. They are the tallest character models available in the game, which means players can’t go unnoticed when playing one. Viera have two variants: Rava, with dark skin and a taller model, and Veena, with a more petite silhouette and lighter skin.

 <p>
	The main downside of Viera is that
	<strong>
	 only a limited number of hairstyles
	</strong>
	is available to the race, because bunny ears require some design adjustment to fit. In addition, most head-gear isn’t available either, for the same reason. With that in mind, players who are keen on changing their customization options often might get frustrated with a Viera.

	<strong>
	 <em>
		Castlevania
	 </em>
	</strong>
	has brought gothic horror and action-adventure from the NES in the 1980s to Netflix in the 2020s. Many entries in the franchise have been marked as some of the best of all time and entries like
	<em>
	 Super Castlevania 4, Symphony of the Night,
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Aria of Sorrow
	</em>
	have been regarded as some of the best on their respective platforms.

 <p>
	For all the praise, however, the games have also gained a reputation as being fiendishly difficult. Rigid jumping, limited attack directions, and some cursed staircase climbing amid harsh enemy placement have cemented a legacy of hard games. Yet this would be selling the franchise as a whole somewhat short. Numerous
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	games are accessible to players and make for great entry points to the series for first-time and new players. Below are some of the easiest
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	games in the long-running franchise.

		Updated June 3rd, 2024 by Jacob Buchalter:
	 </strong>
	 Castlevania is honestly probably at another peak of its popularity, given how beloved the Netflix show is and how iconic the franchise is overall. There are so many games in this franchise as a whole, and tons of them are completely different from each other in story, gameplay, and general design. The Castlevania IP, however, is known for being difficult, as defeating Dracula should be difficult, and for the most part, this is a true statement. However, there are some games in the annals of Castlevania history that are easier than most of the others, and those are the ones we'll be talking about here. These games are not only some of the easier titles in the IP, but they're also commonly some of the best ones for new fans of the Castlevania franchise to hop in on.

 <p>
	Starting things off with a
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	game that's 'technically' the one set in the earliest time period canonically,
	<em>
	 Lament of Innocence
	</em>
	. This is a 3D
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	game that was released on the PlayStation 2 and had players controlling Leon Belmont as he explored a vampire's castle to find his fiance, Sara. Overall,
	<em>
	 Lament of Innocence
	</em>
	is both praised and criticized by the fanbase for feeling almost too inspired by
	<em>
	 Devil May Cry
	</em>
	, which had just been released about 2 years prior.

 <p>
	The game has a unique story, creative gameplay, great music, and fantastic graphical fidelity for the time. However, it also forces the player to backtrack quite a bit, the combat isn't as deep as it would make it seem, and the level design gets pretty repetitive. All of this adds together to make a game that seems difficult at first but ends up being pretty easy.

	<em>
	 Order of Ecclesia
	</em>
	is such a unique
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	game in so many ways. Whether it's the more 'explorable' map, the side quests players could take on, the new systems it introduced, or the RPG elements it brought into the franchise as well. Shanoa, who is the heroine of the game is also well-liked by the fanbase, and for good reason, she's an absolute badass. And funnily enough, the game is pretty difficult all around, but then why is it on this list?

 <p>
	Well, it's at the bottom of the rankings, which means it's one of the hardest games on here, and the RPG elements brought into the game such as the Glyph System give players a ton of freedom in how they play, but also make the game easier as a whole. Overall

	is a
	<em>

	<em>
	 Castlevania Bloodlines
	</em>
	, just like a lot of the
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	games included here, is a pretty unique entry into the franchise overall. First of all, the playable characters are barely, if at all, related to the Belmont or Tepes bloodlines, which is ironic given the game's name.

	Second, the game was designed from the ground up to be tailor-made for the Sega Genesis, which meant increasing the overall speed of the gameplay while still trying to keep as much of that '
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	foundation' as possible. The end result is a pretty fantastic game, but the focus on more action-oriented combat ends up making the title a bit easier than most of the
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	games overall.

	An odd entry for the franchise,
	<em>
	 Castlevania Legends
	</em>
	would release late in the Game Boy’s life cycle in 1997/8. A supposed origin story for the franchise before being declared non-cannon, the player controls Sonia Belmont as she hunts down the very first manifestation of Dracula. Featuring a signature Belmont tank-like stroll and one direction for whipping, the game promises much of what the previous Game Boy entries did but to a lesser extent. This is a short game that opened to middling reviews, it’s a curiosity piece but an easy one.

	The gameplay can be let down by some wonky collision detection, however, Sonia’s ‘burning mode’ can speed up the gameplay and leave her invincible for 10 seconds once per stage, making some memorable moments.

	Regarded by many as one of the best videogames of all time,
	<em>
	 Super Castlevania 4
	</em>
	has faced numerous re-releases since its SNES debut in 1991. Taking the role of Simon Belmont in 1691, the player must traverse Dracula’s castle and defeat the Dark Lord himself. Bringing the series to 16-bit home consoles for the first time under a memorable soundtrack along with Mode 7 depth effects,
	<em>
	 Super Castlevania 4
	</em>
	is a beloved and celebrated entry for good reason. Despite the series' notoriety for difficult games, this SNES entry is certainly one of the more accessible ones.

	, it would also debut new control features including an 8-dimension whip and the ability to swing across gaps with it.

	What should have been known as the sequel to
	<em>
	 Rondo of Blood
	</em>
	ended up as a full-blown rebirth for the franchise.
	<em>
	 Symphony of the Night
	</em>
	was released in 1997 to critical acclaim and became the sleeper hit of its console generation, a 2D side scroller in an age of 3D. Utilizing the PlayStation and Sega Saturn’s processing powers, Dracula’s castle was brought to a brand new labyrinthine scale granting the player exploration as a leading gameplay element. The winning formula found in the game would prove a pioneer moment leading to an entire genre of inspired Metroidvania titles.

	The first Game Boy Advance
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	entry would give players a considerably challenging experience, more akin to its NES ancestors. However,
	<em>
	 Harmony of Dissonance
	</em>
	brought the portable series closer to the Metroidvania formula and a markedly smoother gameplay experience. The player is placed in the role of Juste Belmont, Simon’s grandson, as he searches for a captive friend in Dracula’s castle. Graphically the game would take a significant leap from its predecessor and distinctive of this entry, Juste can take furniture and collectibles from Dracula’s castle.

	Famously, this game would have an incredibly bright and colorful presentation to compensate for the GBA's lack of a backlit screen at the time. It's not the perfect handheld entry, but it is a good one and not intimidating in difficulty.

	The first entry to follow the universally acclaimed
	<em>
	 Aria of Sorrow
	</em>
	arrived on the Nintendo DS. Its direct sequel
	<em>
	 Dawn of Sorrow
	</em>
	, would receive similar acclaim and commercial success, revitalizing the RPG elements and fantastic atmosphere of its predecessor. Bringing the franchise to the DS would enable the stats of the game and leveling elements to be displayed on the above screen, bringing a new level of customization to
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	overall. This sequel places the player in the role of Soma Cruz as a cult manifests to resurrect Dracula by taking Soma’s life.

	Winning several awards and high praise on its 2006 release,
	<em>
	 Portrait of Ruin
	</em>
	would be the second DS entry for the
	<em>
	 Castlevania
	</em>
	series. Choosing the rich setting of Europe in 1944, the game’s plot would continue the story from the Sega Genesis entry
	<em>
	 Castlevania: Bloodlines
	</em>
	. The player is given two protagonists to play as which they can change anytime, Charlotte Aulin and Johnathan Morris, son of
	<em>
	 Bloodlines
	</em>
	protagonist John. Where
	<em>
	 Portrait of Ruin
	</em>
	stands out is its exploration of portraits with Dracula’s Castle, giving players an exploration of locals not seen since
	<em>
	 Bloodline
	</em>
	s.

	Widely regarded as the worthy successor to
	<em>
	 Symphony of the Night
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Aria of Sorrow
	</em>
	would be released to critical ovation on the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The player takes the role of Soma Cruz in 2035, a student with powers of the occult and a potential vessel for the reincarnation of Dracula. Remarkably,
	<em>
	 Aria of Sorrow
	</em>
	manages to bring everything outstanding from
	<em>
	 Symphony of the Night
	</em>
	and successfully translates it to the portable format. This third entry is the high point for the Gameboy Advance games and can be enjoyed through modern platforms on the Advance Collection released in 2021.

	A
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Pokemon
	 </strong>
	</em>
	fan has shared their cute design that crosses Bulbasaur with a boba tea drink. The wordplay and creativity of the art is charming
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	fans.

 <p>
	With Bulbasaur having been a Gen 1 starter, the Pokemon has gotten plenty of attention over the years. Although some fans are content to catch Bulbasaur in the most recent game releases, others celebrate it with fan art, 3D prints, and unique sculptures. In this particular case, Bulbasaur's inherent cuteness is amplified by crossing it with a popular beverage.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	fan and artist MunchyKu shared their concept for a "Bobasaur," a cross between Bulbasaur and a boba tea drink. For those not in the know, boba is a type of beverage, typically tea, that's served with tapioca balls floating in the drink. The chewy treat is extremely popular in Asia, though it can be readily found in the west these days, as well. The boba cup, complete with straw, has taken the place of Bulbasaur's bulb sitting on its back, while the remainder of the Bulbasaur has been recolored a shade of pink to match the drink.

 <p>
	Plenty of fellow fans of
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	have shared their feelings on the piece, with many finding it cute and amusing. One suggested that it seemed like the kind of thing that could be added to an official game like
	<em>
	 Pokemon Cafe Remix
	</em>
	as an alternate skin. Another fan shared a creepy concept for a Pokedex entry for the unique Bulbasaur, imagining the "drink" as just being part of Bulbasaur's body and warning trainers to not try actually drinking it, as what looks like tapioca balls are instead exposed parts of the Bulbasaur's nervous system. While disturbing, a lot of cute official Pokemon have creepy or disturbing Pokedex entries, so it fits well.

 <p>
	It seems that many
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	fans can't get enough of crossing Pokemon with treats, whether in the form of fan art or as actual snacks. Many fans create charming reproductions of
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	favorites in the form of cakes, cookies, and other edible treats designed to look like favorite pocket monsters. However, crossing Pokemon with food items isn't uncommon, either. In fact, this isn't the first time that someone has seen a similarity between the words boba and Bulbasaur, as another fan previously penned a different take on a Bulbasaur crossed with boba tea.

	A worker at Google might be behind a series of major leaks involving games developed by
	<strong>
	 Nintendo
	</strong>
	or coming to its platforms. The Nintendo leaks involve Google employees' access to YouTube, its video streaming and hosting service.

	Leaks and rumors have always been a problem for the game industry. Leaks of upcoming releases can upend a carefully calibrated marketing plan, while more serious leaks involving business information or privileged data can even affect investor confidence or a company's relationships with partners and press. Nintendo is no exception to leaks, with leakers on social media amassing followers and attention by hinting at future releases. Even now, leakers and insiders have revealed the possible existence of a new Nintendo project from the
	<em>
	 Mario Party
	</em>
	developers.

 <p>
	Now a new report published by 404 Media suggests that at least one component of the leaking scene involves an employee (or employees) working for Google via its video service YouTube. Recent months have seen the leak of major companies' streaming agendas, and the YouTube administration is actively seeking those who might be responsible.

 <p>
	404 Media's report is based on a leak not from a game company but from Google itself, in the form of an internal database of privacy and security issues tracked over a period of six years. The issues and incidents were reported internally by Google employees, and reveal a variety of issues and incidents ranging from technical vulnerabilities in third-party software to glitches in Google-operated services that accidentally revealed private or confidential information. The relevant incident involved a Google employee accessing private videos on Nintendo's official YouTube account, using the access to leak information about the company's upcoming announcements. Nintendo hosts its highly popular Nintendo Direct broadcasts exclusively via YouTube.

 <p>
	The report did not specify when the leaking incident occurred, but multiple Nintendo Direct broadcasts have been leaked ahead of time. As such, the report could refer to any incident in the last several years. The report does shed light on a possible method used by various anonymous leakers to reveal everything from PlayStation State of Play broadcasts to footage from
	<em>
	 Grand Theft Auto 6
	</em>
	's trailer. Workers who have internal access to corporate accounts on YouTube would check or view private or unlisted videos uploaded ahead of time by company staff (which were scheduled to go live at an appointed time), then leak the information via social media or into their communities.

 <p>
	Given how damaging leaks can be in some circumstances, it's no surprise that companies are on the hunt for leakers, but the report highlights that it's not just insiders working at the companies themselves that pose a potential leaking threat. YouTube itself is a potential outlet for such incidents, thanks in part to the sheer demand for early information about new game releases and reveals.

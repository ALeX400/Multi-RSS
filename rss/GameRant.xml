 <p>
  Every
  <strong>
   <em>
    Vampire
   </em>
   game
  </strong>
  , from the incredible
  <em>
   Soul Reaver
  </em>
  saga to
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,
  </em>
  have forgotten some crucial aspects of the supernatural beings who are their main characters. Even when trying to design a quality game with tremendously complex world building and storytelling, there are bound to be some things developers miss, or things they add that are not necessarily good.

  In the case of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , there are a lot of expectations, more so now that The Chinese Room have updated its release window to early 2025. What do fans actually expect of the game? Do they want it to be focused on the narrative aspects of the original IP, or do they want it to be more combat-oriented, like other modern RPGs? This list contains all the mistakes
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2
  </em>
  should definitely avoid.

 <p>
  One of the most notorious problems with modern RPGs is that they consistently mess up encounters in such a way that it is impossible to distinguish one enemy from the next. Each combat encounter feels, objectively speaking, a little bit repetitive. All combat phases start the same: Get into a position that won't alert enemies, do some stealth, maybe take down one or two enemies with stealth, then get discovered and go full Rambo on them.

 <p>
  So, in a game where we incarnate a Vampire from the
  <em>
   WOD
  </em>
  universe, and an Elder Vampire at that, with so many powers and abilities to use, why choose to repeat this pattern? Couldn't we just become mist and avoid dealing with smaller goons, and still be rewarded for doing so? Similar to how
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  dealt with the powers of The Outsider, where there was some sort of environmental stealth system instead of just plain duck and dodge. Then again, repetitive combat was also present in games like
  <em>
   Vampyr,
  </em>
  which was fun regardless, but still managed to disappoint gamers in some crucial aspects of representing an immortal and powerful being.

 <p>
  In the universe of
  <em>
   Vampire
  </em>
  , there's an important thing players should always remember: The Masquerade protects not only the Vampire lifestyle, but all its subrogates (like Ghouls and Human Minions) as well. Of course, it was one of the main aspects of
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,
  </em>
  where players had to carefully plan their actions or risk triggering a Bloodhunt. So, how will
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2
  </em>
  handle this particular mechanic? Will players be punished little by little for revealing their true selves to humans? Or will they be limited to action in certain areas of the game?
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":991} -->

 <p>
  For example: Elysiums should be mostly social, and it should be impossible to attack anyone inside of them. The same goes for human nightclubs. For players who tried the first game, they'll have noticed that nightclubs were important for regaining humanity points. Will all those mechanics be related to each other in the sequel? Limiting the actions of the player definitely sounds frustrating and limiting, and in more than one case, could totally break immersion. So why do it? Let players break the rules and face the consequences. Don't sugarcoat it; after all, it is part of being a Vampire.

 <p>
  One of the things that is particularly annoying about Vampire-related games (and we are talking all around the genre, not particularly this series) is that they are obnoxiously fixated on the visually impeccable and sharply-dressed stereotype of vampires that was drawn out of the imagination of authors like Anne Rice. The truth is, Vampires in
  <em>
   WOD
  </em>
  are not all perfectly dressed for the occasion, and there are several of them who are more like free spirits. The usual "role model" of the vampire is that of a 19th-Century noble, perfectly adapted to modern civilization. Or at least, that is what it looks like on the outside, and that is the stereotype.

 <p>
  Think about Becket or Smiling Jack from
  <em>
   VTM - Bloodlines;
  </em>
  they don't look particularly disheveled, but are still visually impactful without relying on stereotypes. One is a scholar, the other is a punk Anarchist vampire who wants to stick it up the Camarilla's backside every once in a while.

 <p>
  Speaking of the Camarilla: How will that work in the game? Factions are tremendously important for
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade,
  </em>
  and since the devs revealed that we will be playing the "Sheriff" of Seattle, and that means a Camarilla-only gig. Yet vampires are fickle, and their morals and alignments are constantly shifting according to their selfish desires. That is, perhaps, one of the most important aspects of the Vampire: Its true nature as a predator, not cattle. While predators are free to roam, cattle stay obediently in a pen. Will players be forced to stay in a pen, or will they roam free?

 <p>
  One of the aspects of the original game that was so controversial was its insane level of difficulty if players made certain narrative choices. In every traditional RPG, stats are important for the outcome of gameplay, more so if players keep in mind that certain stats are placed there to make their lives easier when it comes to choosing a playstyle. What happens if the stat system is unnecessarily constraining the player, and basically bars them from getting the best possible outcome? Isn't the purpose of RPGs to provide alternate routes for reaching the same goals, encouraging players to use their wits and adapt?
 </p>

 <p>
  One option is giving players the choice and the outcome of said choice as part of the narrative of the game. Another entirely different option is punishing players who want to solve things in an alternate or outside-the-box way, and that is usually bad. Most RPGs give players this false sensation of agency, while in reality, they just offer one or two (with luck up to three) "right" dialogue choices to set things in motion and discover "the best possible outcome." That is not player agency; that's just bread-crumbing with extra steps, and it would be a mistake to do that in a deep RPG that caters to an adult audience.

  In the
  <em>
   World Of Darkness
  </em>
  , there are a lot of powerful beings, such as Vampires, Werewolves, and even the occasional Mage or Hunter (Changelings are tremendously hard to come by and thus, impossible to crossover with). However, unlike what the general audience might think, these are absolutely not indestructible beings. Though Vampires are some of the most powerful creatures in the world, alongside Werewolves, they are not truly immortal in a practical sense.

 <p>
  Sure, Vampires can take a few bullets to the chest (or head in certain cases) and still function normally. Werewolves, on the other hand, are much more resilient and require certain conditions to receive damage (aka. Silver) but still aren't unkillable. The Werewolf in
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines —
  </em>
  the one players had to run from for dear life — was part of a scripted scene, and even so, as a Vampire players should have a chance against a Lupine if they play their cards right. In other words, ideally there are no bullet-sponge enemies in the game. They're often ridiculous (more so if they are human), particularly when considering all the supernatural creatures that players could be challenged by instead.

 <p>
  One of the things that made
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines
  </em>
  players writhe in anguish were its "unwritten rules" related to Clan choice and the difficulty level scaling according to the players' choice in this regard. The most obvious example was picking the Nosferatu, a socially impaired Clan that is basically a walking "Masquerade-breaking machine." Of course, this means the player should focus their gameplay style around Stealth, but sadly, there were parts of the game that didn't incorporate this stealthy approach at all, and it ultimately resulted in a 90% chance of breaking The Masquerade with a Nosferatu character. This could be frustrating for players wanting to play a Nosferatu, as it is meant to be played while still having the chance to enjoy the full length of the game without encountering unfair death screens.

 <p>
  On the other hand, Toreador, Ventrue, and Tremere were clearly less physically focused, and that's great, but they were still powerful enough to get near 100% completion, and could still be stealthy enough to play in the same way a Nosferatu can, but without the socially impaired status. Malkavians, on the other hand, were so unpredictable in each dialogue (often spouting nonsense that turned out to be visions of the future) that they added a whole new layer of difficulty to the game. In other words, the game had levels of difficulty based on which Vampire Clan players chose, and that wasn't fun for every player build, or in every possible narrative outcome. Then again, this can be easily solved with "class" balance, or in this case, Clan balance. As far as we know, there will be only four Clans to pick from at the start of
  <em>
   Bloodlines 2
  </em>
  : Banu Haqim, Brujah, Tremere, and Ventrue. It seems like The Chinese Room definitely dodged a bullet with their choice, since most of those are balanced Clans (except Tremere, they're still going to be broken). What happens in the future? Will they add more Clans? And if so, will they allow players some freedom or force them to play "the Clan's way?" Only time will tell.

  is a complicated game to jump into. Not only does it combine mechanics from MOBAs and third-person shooters, it also has enough unique interactions and characters to stand out from the rest of its competitors and give new players a dizzying amount of information to learn.

 <p>
  At the beginning of each game, it can be tempting to use your transit rail speed boost to reach the lane early before your opponents do. But,
  <strong>
   that speed boost has a 340-second cooldown
  </strong>
  (over 5 and a half minutes), and even if you do reach the lane before your opponent, you're stuck waiting for minions to spawn anyway.

 <p>
  Don't waste your speed boost for such a small benefit, and
  <strong>
   save it for when you desperately need it.
  </strong>
  The transit rail speed boost is a fast way to leave and get back into your lane, so use it to help defend your Guardian, join a team fight in progress, or to quickly return to base and come back. Since the boost lasts 30 seconds, using the transit line and speed boost to recover health in the base, then returning to your lane, is the most efficient usage of this ability. Wasting it at the very beginning of the game provides little reward, and you're stuck waiting for it to come back for a long time.

   A Soul Urn will spawn next to either the Yellow or Purple lane at 10 minutes.
  </strong>
  It'll take 30 seconds for the Urn to land, and afterward, any player can pick it up and bring it to the opposite side of the map to secure it. Once the Urn is secured, the team that secures it gets bonus souls, and the person who did the securing gets 1 skill point and an additional 25% more souls on top of their share.

  Completing this objective will get your team consistently ahead in souls. If you notice a teammate is carrying the Soul Urn,
  <strong>
   give them cover
  </strong>
  until they reach their destination or until they leave your lane. Alternatively, if an enemy is carrying the Soul Urn, put some shots into them to help your team stop them. The map will also tell you where the Soul Urn must be taken to. A
  <strong>
   red square
  </strong>
  indicates where the enemy team must drop off the soul urn, while a
  <strong>
   green square
  </strong>
  indicates where your ally will have to drop it off.

   If you're losing your lane, stick close to your Guardian and just focus on farming as safely as possible.
  </strong>
  Building up items to drastically increase your damage (more commonly known as damage spikes because of how much they increase your damage) should be your focus, so you can eventually get more powerful than your opponent and push them right back.

  Alternatively, if you're unsure what to do at a given moment, then start farming mobs and keep building up to your next item. If you're waiting for waves to appear, head into a neutral camp and collect those souls as well to stay ahead of your opponent.

 <p>
  Focus on denying your opponent their souls where you can. When you're laning against someone, the easiest way to get souls is to last hit a minion. Once that happens, an orb will drift from their corpse. Whoever hits that orb first gets the souls from that minion kill.
  <strong>
   A denial happens when an opponent scores the last hit on your minion, but you shoot the orb first.
  </strong>
  If you're able to deny your opponent an entire minion wave, then you've practically achieved the same effect as sending them back to the respawn screen.

 <p>
  As a result,
  <strong>
   don't get too distracted by kills
  </strong>
  . Denying minions can be more advantageous, far easier to pull off, and if you get enough denies, you'll create a large lead in souls against your lane opponent.

 <p>
  The answer is to farm minions with your melee.
  <strong>
   Melee kills will automatically secure souls
  </strong>
  for you, but this comes at the cost of pushing yourself up dangerously close to your opponent. Smart opponents will save their crowd control abilities to lock you in place and get free damage where they can.

  Superior movement against your opponents will give you a strong advantage against your competition. Knowing how to
  <strong>
   cut your dash short with a slide
  </strong>
  so you can melee and secure the last hit on a wounded minion will make it impossible for your opponents to deny you souls. Alternatively, knowing how to move out of range of your opponents with efficient dash-jumps and slides will make you a difficult target to catch (unless your pursuers have also mastered their movement).

  Using special moves like jumping and dashing will require stamina, so choosing the best options for your situation is a skill you should work on developing. Most of the characters in the game will have 3 stamina bars — except Ivy at 4 bars and Vindicta/McGinnis at 2.
  <strong>
   Dash-Jumps
  </strong>
  will require two bars, but it'll also be the fastest way for you to seamlessly cover ground. You can also end this special movement with a slide-hop (where you land in a slide, then jump at the end to conserve your momentum) for more distance without using more stamina.

  <strong>
   Do not start the midboss if the enemy team is still alive
  </strong>
  . The midboss in
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  is fairly
  <strong>
   tanky and deals a significant amount of damage
  </strong>
  to its targets. It's going to take time to bring the boss down, and even worse, it's also going to take more time to claim the buff for slaying the boss. Additionally, when the boss reaches
  <strong>
   50% life
  </strong>
  , the enemy team will be alerted to your team's attempt at bringing the boss down.

 <p>
  When all of these factors are combined, it means your team should not start the midboss unless you've successfully wiped the enemy team. This way, you'll reduce the chances they can steal your buff or kill your tanks while they distract the boss. If you start it any sooner, then you risk the enemy team stealing your hard-earned buff or interfering with the boss fight itself.

  At 10 minutes, minions will no longer give souls and instead, the orbs that drift from their bodies will give all the souls the minion would have dropped. Additionally, souls dropped by minion orbs are now split between you and any teammates near the minion when its orb is secured. Before 10 minutes, if you secured the souls from a minion, it would have given you and your teammates in the lane the full amount of souls.
 </p>

 <p>
  With these mechanics in mind, once 10 minutes have elapsed in the game, roam around the map and look for kills or
  <strong>
   farm separately from your other allies
  </strong>
  . Invading the
  <strong>
   enemy's jungle
  </strong>
  , or finishing the
  <strong>
   neutral camps
  </strong>
  near your base, are great ways to get more souls without accidentally splitting souls with a teammate. Just make sure you join up with your team again when it's time for a team fight.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":10,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":10,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1071} -->

 <p>
  Much like the best movement shooters, mastery over efficient movement is key to balancing these two needs well. You'll need to move far enough away from your allies so you can each get as many souls as possible, but also be close enough to save your teammates if they get jumped by multiple enemies.

      <title>7 Indie Games With the Best Graphics</title>

  For a long time in gaming, graphical fidelity has been the domain of AAA gaming companies that can afford the expense of developing gorgeous landscapes, facial animations, cinematic lighting, and more.

  With the recent advancements in technology and tools like Unreal Engine 5, photorealistic graphics are now within the grasp of solo and indie developers looking to bring their vision to life. That said, photorealism is not all there is to great graphics, and indie games with the best graphics cannot be categorized simply by how closely the game emulates reality; art style matters, too.

   <em>
    No Rest for the Wicked
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a top-down Soulslike developed by Moon Studios, the same studio that brought players the breathtaking Ori games. Unlike the Ori adventures,
  <em>
   No Rest for the Wicked
  </em>
  is set in a grimdark world plagued by disease, monsters, and dangers around every corner. At first glance, this seems like the sort of game that would put graphics down at the very bottom of the priority list, but that is not the case at all.

 <p>
  The gloomy atmosphere doesn’t prevent the game from looking downright gorgeous. The island of Sacra drips with character and a twisted sort of beauty. Fire reflects off of surfaces, moonlight lights up the night, and leaves sway with the wind. As an Action RPG,
  <em>
   No Rest for the Wicked
  </em>
  places great importance on combat, and the excellent art direction is showcased here as well in the form of excellent weapon animations and unique enemy variety.

   <em>
    Hades 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an indie roguelike game developed by Supergiant Games, an indie studio known for producing games like
  <em>
   Bastion
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Transistor
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  , released in 2020, was already one of the prettiest indie games in existence, but
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  elevates the Greek depiction of the Underworld to new levels.

 <p>
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  ’s Underworld offers a more in-depth look at the Greek mythos, showing players new areas and locations to explore. Each area Melinoe explores has a distinct visual style and a different flavor, none more impressive than the home base where the protagonist spends most of her time. All of these things would allow
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  to stand out as a true successor to the original, but where Supergiant Games went above and beyond is in their depictions of the deities who give boons to Melinoe to aid in her journey. Each one is incredibly detailed, fully voiced with dozens of lines, and a treat to interact with.

    Indika,

  released on May 2, 2024, is one of the more recent additions to the indie space, impressing players with incredible visuals and a clear art direction that is unmistakable for anything else.
  <em>
   Indika

  is a third-person adventure game laced with horror elements, a combination quite unlike anything else out there.

 <p>
  The game follows
  <em>
   Indika
  </em>
  , a nun who can hear the devil inside her head, forced to listen to his commentary and dance to his whims whenever he feels like it. Most of the time,
  <em>
   Indika
  </em>
  traverses a dark, gloomy world, trying to navigate her version of reality, but whenever the devil wants, he can transport her to surreal places that don’t follow the laws of physics. The unique combination of real and unreal, dull and vibrant, glacial and fiery, is what Indika is all about.

   <em>
    Firewatch
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a first-person narrative-driven adventure game set in the Shoshone National Forest of Wyoming. A massive indie hit,
  <em>
   Firewatch
  </em>
  should be a name familiar to players interested in the genre, but for those who haven’t had the pleasure of experiencing the world through the eyes of Henry, it’s a must-try.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":206} -->
 <p>
  The players take up the role of a Fire Lookout stationed out in the forest, all alone. His only companion throughout the game is Delilah, a voice on the radio guiding him along the journey.
  <em>
   Firewatch
  </em>
  has a cohesive style from start to finish, unfolding the story slowly, in small chunks, so players take the time to walk in Henry’s shoes and appreciate the scenery. The forest feels like an actual forest, not a dozen trees slapped together in a clearing and called a forest like other games tend to do. Excellent use of lighting is used to highlight the important bits of the story, slow down the game’s pace, or add momentum when it is needed.

   <em>
    Ori and the Will of the Wisps
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the sequel to
  <em>
   Ori and the Blind Forest
  </em>
  , which takes the stunning visual art direction of the first game and brings it to new heights. Graduating from the 2D landscapes,
  <em>
   Ori and the Will of the Wisps
  </em>
  now features a fully rendered, multi-layered 3D environment for Ori to navigate. The game is still a Metroidvania platformer, but now with a depth to the world setting that wasn’t there before.

 <p>
  Ori explores new areas, not present in the first game, allowing players to explore new locations and make new discoveries. While visuals are definitely one of the main selling points for
  <em>
   Ori and the Will of the Wisps
  </em>
  , the game is the complete package. Graphics, character design, skills, and, most impressively, music surpass what Moon Studio was able to achieve with the original title. It doesn’t feel like a copy-paste of what came before but rather a worthy sequel to an all-time classic.

   <em>
    Kena, Bridge of Spirits
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a third-person ARPG set in a luscious world that is being slowly corrupted by monsters and pestilence. Kena, a girl with magical abilities, is the only one who can fight this growing plague and return the forest to its original state. Much of the gameplay revolves around trying to return a corrupted, diseased area to its former glory.

 <p>
  This puts the environment at the forefront, making it the core reason for players to do what they’re doing. And once the corruption is lifted, the sight of lush greenery returning to its rightful place is the reward. Ember Lab’s world is full of life, vibrant, and flushed with color at every step. The setting is spectacular and progressing to new areas is a prize all on its own.

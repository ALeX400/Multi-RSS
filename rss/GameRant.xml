  It is no secret that the community has long been hoping to get their hands on a Death Korps of Krieg armor set in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Helldivers 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , or at least something that closely resembles the attire and equipment used by the German armies in the First World War.

  While not exactly a
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  crossover with the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  franchise, developer Arrowhead Game Studios has pushed a
  <strong>
   new Death Korps of Krieg-like helmet
  </strong>
  that can be matched with other body armor to let you join the Astra Militarum regiment.

  AF-91 Field Chemist is one of two new armor sets added to the Superstore with the recent release of Chemical Agents. While its body armor could have been better, its helmet design is as close as you can come to joining the Death Korps of Krieg in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  .
  <strong>
   It costs 125 Super Credits
  </strong>
  , or 375 Super Credits if you want the body armor to complete the set.

  The best body armor that goes with the Field Chemist helmet, though, has to be
  <strong>
   CE-27 Ground Breaker
  </strong>
  , as seen in the image above. It is a medium armor set with the Engineering passive that can be unlocked through the Democratic Detonation Warbond. The ammunition pouches, the trench coat-like garb below the breastplate, and the inhaling tubes on the neck do their best to let you pull off a

  The AF-91 Field Chemist features the

   new Advanced Filtration armor passive

 <p>
  The Death Korps-like armor fits that theme because in
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  lore, the Astra Militarum nuked their own planet before fighting a 500-year war against their own people for being critics of their wrongdoings. Sounds familiar? In
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , Super Earth continues to throw away thousands of soldiers to win a Galactic War that they could have avoided by choosing peace. Not to mention that questioning their motives brands you a traitor.

  Many veteran gamers agree that vintage strategy games are among the best in the genre's catalog. Not only do they offer a feeling of nostalgia, but they also have great mechanics, especially for their time. The 90s and early 2000s saw the birth of many franchises that are still successful and releasing games to this day.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, many of these timeless classics now live only within players' memory, as they can no longer be bought through traditional means. No online outlet sells them, and while there are a few "free" sites where they can still be downloaded, they're not official and can be dangerous. Here are some
  <strong>
   strategy games you cannot buy anymore

 <p>
  This game was daring in many ways. It stepped out of the classic
  <em>
   Command &amp; Conquer
  </em>
  formula by only having multiplayer mode and incorporating a last-man-standing approach, similar to modern battle royales. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Command &amp; Conquer: Sole Survivor
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players take control of a single tank or soldier through different maps as they try to survive and defeat their competition.

  While the game presented players with a completely new experience, it wasn't very well received, as fans of the franchise were very comfortable with the old game mechanics. This led to poor sales and a limited fanbase, which quickly resulted in the title being discontinued. While the
  <em>
   Command &amp; Conquer
  </em>
  franchise continued to thrive,
  <em>
   Sole Survivor
  </em>
  could never be part of its success again.

    Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a futuristic real-time strategy game set on Gift 3, a war-torn planet where four factions (Scorps, Darkens, Mercs, and Humans) are in control of its valuable resources. Heavily based on resource gathering and management, as well as large-scale tactical combat, this game's storyline intertwines the perspectives of the four factions in their race towards controlling Gift 3's precious resources.

 <p>
  This title was also one of the few games that were already introducing 3D graphics into games of its genre, which made it visually impressive for its time. Unfortunately, when developer 7th Level closed down, the game was no longer available. These days, it can be purchased online through second-hand sellers, but new instances of the game are almost impossible to come by.

  is the remake of the original 1992 game,

  . Like other games of this genre,
  <em>
   Dune 2000
  </em>
  follows the story of three different factions (House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and House Ordos) as they fight over control of the precious spice planet Arrakis. This title will have players building bases, managing resources and leading large armies into tactical, real-time battles.

  Each faction in the game has unique abilities that help make the interesting storyline even more exciting.

  , and complete quests. Wanting to offer a unique perspective on this section of the game, EcstaticPSD made a gorgeous Photoshop painting depicting a view of the Wizard's Tower peeking out from behind the treeline of the Secret Woods.

  Fans were impressed by how recognizable the Secret Woods were despite the massive shift in POV in the artwork. Many complimented the easily overlooked details of the stone pillars and inclusion of the green slimes, while others praised the accurate reproduction of the Wizard's Tower from an unexpected angle. Some joked that they never could have imagined
  <em>

  with non-pixelated visuals, highlighting the creativity and talent behind the painting. While there are a number of mods for

  No doubt,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dota 2
   </em>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Castlevania
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the best dark fantasy/action franchises ever created, though many fans have constant debates about which of the games are good, and which of them are not fit to be part of the canon. Some titles have such a deep and powerful story that it would be a shame not to take advantage of their lore, their worldbuilding, and their characters.

 <p>
  That's precisely why this list summarizes the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  games that could be great to adapt into an anime. With so much raw potential ready to be taken by an enlightened producer, these titles are part of the Dracula versus Belmont mythos, and fans are eagerly awaiting a chance to see them displayed as an animation like
  <em>
   Castlevania the Series
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Castlevania: Nocturne
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   <em>
    Order of Ecclesia
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a great example of how the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  franchise has evolved over the years with a deep and powerful narrative. Set in a world where the Belmont lineage has disappeared from history, and thus, the responsibility of fighting against Dracula and his forces of darkness falls in the hands of the Order of Ecclesia, a group of vampire/demon hunters who use the powers of Glyphs to fight against evil in its many forms.

 <p>
  Shanoa is the main protagonist of the story and is a worthy heir to the franchise's vampire hunter hero mantle. After the success of
  <em>
   Dawn
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Aria of Sorrow
  </em>
  , this game positioned itself as a worthy heir to
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night
  </em>
  and has quite a thrilling main plot as well. It's definitely animated series material.

 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Lords of Shadow I &amp; II
   </strong>
  </em>
  are a total re-direction of the essence of the franchise, with a different tale to tell, and a more RPG/hack-and-slash gameplay style. It narrates the tale of how Dracula came to be, as none other than Gabriel Belmont, who turned into a monster after opposing God and being tricked into killing his own family. With a deep and gloomy worldbuilding, and a story that is not canon but a re-boot of the series, that sadly, didn't convince fans too much.

 <p>
  Nevertheless, the story of the game and its gameplay are undeniably good, and it is worth another sequel, if Konami allows it, of course. But perhaps
  <em>
   Lords of Shadow
  </em>
  's
  <em>
  </em>
  future might be more promising in an entirely different platform, and it would be nice if producers took advantage of an already constructed lore to create an animated series. The possibility of seeing how the screenplays would adapt Dracula's origin story is worth the effort.

  Of all the Belmont family members, perhaps none is more beloved than Juste Belmont, the protagonist of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Castlevania: Harmony Of Dissonance
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  Grandson of Simon Belmont, Juste is known to be one of the most powerful magicians and vampire hunters to ever thread the dark Transylvanian lands, hunting down Dracula's forces like a champ.

 <p>
  When Juste made its appearance in
  <em>
   Castlevania: Nocturne
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  fans must have felt a myriad of emotions. But since the image of the heroic, crafty, and sometimes snarky Juste was destroyed by his current status as a "failure" and "retired" vampire hunter, many
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  enthusiasts have been left with a question: What happened to him? This is partially revealed through a sluggish dialogue between him and a young Richter (another poorly depicted character) and as hardcore fans of the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  franchise might know, this is not nearly enough. Many want to see Juste Belmont as an animated character in his prime, so why not give him his own series? That would be the greatest idea producers could have.

  Simon Belmont, son of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, is the protagonist of the second iteration in the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  series, which made its debut on the NES systems in 1988. Some say this is the most challenging game of the whole franchise, and others have an entirely different opinion. In other words, it is quite a polarizing game. For reasons hard to understand,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest
   </strong>
  </em>
  is looked down upon among all pre-
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night
  </em>
  games, and of course, it is understandable that by modern standards, this is not the most perfect game ever made.

 <p>
  But it is also true that the story of Simon Belmont is both awe-inspiring and worthy of exploring, and the lore derived from his struggles to destroy Dracula once and for all while also dealing with a curse that was affecting him, is absolute series material. All of that is accompanied by a masterfully crafted soundtrack that is recognized among fans of the franchise as one of the best, especially "Bloody Tears," which ended up becoming the iconic part of the soundtrack for the rest of the franchise (and even made a cameo in the Netflix series). Perhaps his story, retold from the perspective of modern producers, will fill the gaps between the events of
  <em>
   Castlevania: The Series
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Castlevania: Nocturne
  </em>
  .

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Aria of Sorrow
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the series takes a twist as players accompany the protagonist Soma Cruz, who is none other than the reincarnation of Dracula. Living his second (third?) life as a normal student, Soma is suddenly assaulted by obscure visions and dark urges, as the forces of darkness rise once more to sow fear among the living. With a much more modern setting than the classic games, the story happens in current times, with the dark history of the Belmont clan and Dracula long gone, but his legacy still tortures mankind. Soma and Mina Hakuba (his dearest friend) were journeying through Japan when an eclipse-induced teleporting effect transported both of them to Dracula's Castle. Thus, the story begins with the main character, without knowing what he is doing, slowly discovering his supernatural abilities, and devouring the souls of slain monsters to become stronger.

  But as the story progresses, the plot takes a twist, and Soma is revealed to be the reincarnation of the ancient Dark Lord, and thus, fated to either destroy humanity or save it from his past life's legacy. As crazy as this might sound, the game is great, fun to play, and the Soul system alongside an arsenal of modernized weapons (and some old ones like Excalibur and Longinus) make it quite an interesting tale of adventure. Of course, to develop such a story into an anime, the budget should be appropriate. Fans wouldn't accept something made without love, either for

  </em>
  's timeline or for any other
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  animations made in the future.

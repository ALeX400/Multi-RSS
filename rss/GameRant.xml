  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead Island 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  brought the franchise back from the grave, as the long-awaited sequel's notorious development made its release seem impossible. However, Dambuster Studios made
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  a pretty solid follow-up, despite the development hell. The gore-filled romp through a zombie-infested Los Angeles brought some great action into the spotlight, but there was just one glaring problem with the game. There was no actual island.

 <p>
  Instead,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  chose a metaphorical island for its setting, allowing a quarantined Los Angeles to stretch the definition of what an island can be. Some players appreciated this difference, while others were disappointed in the absence of an actual island vibe. Because of this loose interpretation of what constitutes an island, the setting for
  <em>
   Dead Island 3
  </em>
  is filled with possibilities. While this could present exciting new avenues for the franchise to explore, it also runs the risk of losing sight of what made the series so special in the first place.

  Potentially Stepping Away From the Island Setting
 </h3>
 <p>
  Now that
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  is well over a year old, there has been speculation that the announcement of a third game is on the horizon. Thanks to
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  's recent Steam launch success and Dambuster Studios proving that the franchise could be salvaged, the future of the series feels a lot more hopeful than it did a few years ago. However, one of the biggest questions about a third game is what the setting will be.

 <p>
  If Los Angeles can qualify as an island, then almost any setting can. The
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  franchise could easily turn any environment or community into an "island" simply by claiming any community in isolation meets the titular criteria. Showcasing Los Angeles in
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  gave the game a chance to have fun with the formula, leaving the series room to branch out into unknown territory. From the city of Berlin to a town in rural Montana,
  <em>
   Dead Island 3
  </em>
  could turn any part of the world into an island.

 <p>
  However, this could also present
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  with a huge identity crisis. If
  <em>
   Dead Island 3
  </em>
  doesn't live up to its name, then is it even a
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  game at that point? There are plenty of other games in the zombie genre that do a great job of showcasing other types of communities ravaged by a mind-altering plague.
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  covers the horrors of a ravaged America, while
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  features the fictional Middle Eastern city of Harran, so
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  showcasing non-island areas may feel unnecessary.

 <p>
  What made the first
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  so unique is that there weren't really any zombie-focused stories taking place on an island resort. The entire premise of
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  from the beginning was emphasizing how important the actual setting was to the overall tone of the story. It's a compelling concept that
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  unfortunately seemed to drop the ball on. The sequel's combat and gory visuals were the shining point in the game, but the absence of an actual island can really be felt.
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  could have offered something to the zombie genre that no other game has, so it's strange that the sequel chose to feature one of the world's most commonly used cities.

 <p>
  Now that the sequel has received two post-launch DLCs, the future of
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  is up in the air. A third mainline game feels quite likely at this point, and there will hopefully be a return to form with its setting. If the
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  franchise wants to keep its identity intact, it can't risk straying too far away from the setting that made it stand out at the beginning.

  Updates over the years have worked towards turning
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  into a bastion of every fans' favorite gameplay mechanics and creatures from across the series. After Generation 8 brought with it some rather radical changes in the eyes of loyal players, namely the removal of the National Dex, many fans were wondering when they'd get to see their favorite pocket monsters again and frequently asked for Mega Evolution to be brought back to the casual and competitive
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  experience. However,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has yet to add everything, and some of its bigger omissions are rather ironic.

  It's been five years since the release of

  has a sizable gap in terms of what it offers in terms of Galar Pokemon and content. However, recent patches to the mobile AR game, as well as some work from dataminers, have seemed to find icons and other content that implies that Dynamax and Gigantamax are coming to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  - but it certainly shouldn't stop there.

 <p>
  Adding Gigantamax and Dynamax to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  presents a fantastic opportunity for the next few seasons of updates to bring everything the game is currently missing from Generation 8. While there are plenty of creatures to catch already in Niantic's popular mobile game, along with plenty of frequent events to play, the game has opted to skip over Galar's Pokedex to focus on Alola's and Paldea's for the last while. It's left fans of
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword and Shield
  </em>
  in the dark for quite a while now as there are multiple "must have" additions that are available for each region except Generation 8 - namely the very obvious omission of Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble when other starters already have their place in the game.

  Overall, only a handful of Galar Pokemon are currently in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , with the vast majority being from when
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shield
  </em>
  was being teased back when it was first released. This was done through the release of regional variants such as Galarian Weezing and Galarian Meowth, with only the exclusive Pokemon attached to those evolutionary lines being added alongside them by default. The last time a Galar Pokemon was added to the game was, once again, with regional variants through the Galarian legendary birds. With this in mind, content focusing on the critters from
  <em>
   Sword
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shield
  </em>
  is most certainly overdue.

  While
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  started as a drip feed of regions and catchable creatures for some time, there's an important driving factor behind the long-term decisions about the game - marketing. A fair number of the Pokemon that have been added to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  over the years have tied into marketing trends dealing with the mainline games with the inclusion of Galarian Meowth and Weezing being prime examples.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Z-A
  </em>
  is the next big
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  title that fans are excited about due to how it revisits the Kalos region and is even promising to bring back Mega Evolution, and with Kalos' inspirational roots in France giving it a connection to Galar's United Kingdom homage, the two could go hand-in-hand in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  with surprising effect. It kills two birds with one stone so that hardcore fans of Galar would get the creatures they've been waiting to see in the mobile AR game for five years, and
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends Z-A
  </em>
  could perhaps surprise even the most keen-eyed series fanatics with a few surprises from an unexpected region. Sadly, though, this is just speculation and Dynamax and Gigantamax might not bring seasons of Galar's own Pokemon with them when they reach players, and only time will tell when it comes to how
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  decides to tackle the region's Pokedex wholeheartedly.

      <title>"We Don't Talk About Bruno" - Lorcana Devs on Pixar, Designing Cards, and More</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  D23 recently hosted a panel focused on
  <em>
   <strong>
    Lorcana
   </strong>
  </em>
  's past, present, and future, hosted by Ravensburger, where devs shared new details about its success and its future. For example, the devs detailed how over 1 billion cards have been sold, while also revealing new details about
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  's sixth set in November 2024. On top of that, the devs confirmed that
  <em>
   The Black Cauldron
  </em>
  will be added in 2024,
  <em>
   Pocahantas
  </em>
  in 2026, and Pixar is being introduced into
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  . However, fans shouldn't expect details about Pixar until 2026 either.

  Game Rant sat down afterward with two of the panelists, co-designers Ryan Miller and Steve Warner, to discuss
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  's journey, the new additions to the TCG, and their various challenges since day one. Of course, we also had to ask about Pixar.

  <strong>
   Q: The panel focused on past, present, and future, so I wanted to start with how we got here. Two years ago, the game hadn't come out and there wasn't a full understanding of what you had. Now, it's different. What is it like to be at the one after that?

 <p>
  <strong>
   Miller
  </strong>
  : It's almost a homecoming because this is really where we started. We got such a great reception two years ago. It was one of those times when you really hope that it's going to do something big. You hope it's going to make a splash. You hope it's going to be exciting for people, but you never really know until there's something out there. Two years ago, I remember we had dinner at Morton's the night before. It was that Thursday night before the show, and both Steve and I were like, "I don't know how to feel right now," right? I was anxious.

 <p>
  No, I'm kidding. Well, no, because the thing is, most trading card games don't pass their third year, right? To me, I think year four is when I'll be like, 'Alright.' Now I believe very firmly that we're going to make it, but still. There was definitely a moment at that D23 when the lines got really packed, when we were down the hall, out the side. I was like, 'Okay, we've got something that people are very excited about."

  These are Disney fans too, right? This is not a gamer convention where we would have felt more comfortable at the beginning, right? To have Disney fans show up the way they did was very exciting, but we don't want to jinx it, right?

  <strong>
   Miller
  </strong>
  : We have a much better idea of what people like now. For example, before we launched, we had to decide how much paper to buy, right? And like, how do you know that? As a result, when we first launched last August, we had some problems, but what was amazing is how our production team and our production partners really came together. I would say, November or December that year, we were back in the running. Scarcity is just one of those things, so it was exciting to really, finally get all the cards into the players' hands, into collectors' hands, that sort of thing.

  : I don't think so. We have always had the same sort of mentality in what we do with design. We've always wanted to create things for each category of players because there's going to be crossover from each of them, and there's going to be things that each of them like. We've always tried to come at it from different perspectives of who wants to be very competitive, who wants to make a fun deck, who wants to make a theme deck, and who's just going to want to collect some cool things. That hasn't changed. We follow that very closely.

   Q: During the panel, the concept of "the dream killer" was brought up. I'm curious how much do you guys feel like you need to be the dream killers for fans versus, you know, if they say, 'Oh, it would be nice to do this.' How much do you lean into what they seemingly want versus telling them, 'No, here's what we think you want?'

  I don't like to tell people what we think they should want. When I say dream killer, it's obviously pretty tongue-in-cheek, right? That refers to this point in game design where you're very excited about your idea, but it hasn't been really thoroughly vetted yet. You get all excited, and then I'd showed it, you know? There are several games that I would show just full game designs of, and if I show it to Steve, he would just bust them in half. He's kind of like a surgeon, right?

  He could really quickly find the problems and point to them, and I always want him to do it before the fans because that balance is what leads to longevity. It's not about my opinion or telling them what they want. It's just, as Steve said, different people want different things, and the nice thing about trading card games is we can make cards for different people because there are so many cards. We can have cards that are just fun for the people who like big things happening, and for the really entrenched tournament player, we have cars for them. Of course, for the deep-cut fans, we have the Atlantis cards, we've got Treasure Planet cards, that sort of thing. It really comes down to not just franchise choice, but in game design, how we can make a set that is appealing to different groups for different reasons, right? That's what it comes down to.

   Warner:

  Oh, yeah, definitely more challenging. There's just so many more interactions. I mean, with 200 cards, you're looking at about 40,000 different interactions between cards. You add another 200 cards to that mix, and you're at 160,000, and it just gets completely wild: the level of complexity that you can get into and making sure that none of that gets to be too powerful, but still trying to make sure that things are fun and exciting for whichever fan gets that card.

   Warner:

  A lot of people refer to this as power creep, yeah. Obviously, there is a build-up in how the sets went, and there were no cards out beforehand. We've been very cautious about how we've released cards and what the power levels are so that we don't obsolete those old cards. A lot of the time, what we've done is made cards that may not have been as good before that, later on, will be sleepers.

  That's one of the best things about trading card games, I think, is that you can get those cards that maybe when they came out, they were just kind of decent cards. As more cards are released, they almost wake up all of a sudden. Now these are clutch cards, and it's just super fun because of this discovery. This exploration and discovery element, you're never really done with.

   Q: There's Lorcana, but there's now new introductory stuff, Gateway. It's very rare for a TCG to have something that explains the ins and outs; a lot of people just get thrown into the deep end. It seems like you guys wanted to have something where you could learn each step and then get familiar with it. Could you talk about the advantages of that?

  : We are getting a lot of Disney fans who have never played a trading card game. Our game is fairly welcoming and easy to pick up for typical TCG fans, but it's still a different type of game than most of those types of folks have played before, right? It's just very different. The idea of building your own deck can be kind of mind-blowing, right?

  I remember one time I was on one of the Disney cruises, and I had this great table full of grandmas. They were just the sweetest, most delightful ladies, and they really wanted to learn the game so they could play with their grandkids. I'm like, 'Okay, I am here for that.' I am going to help you guys do that, but the first thing that happened is this one lady--I always say, "draw seven cards, that's your opening hand"--and she immediately goes, "I've got four threes." I kind of went, 'Okay, well, that's great, but this is a game where what you get on the table matters and your hand doesn't matter as much."

 <p>
  It's one of those things we realized through teaching the game. We've been doing this a long time. Steve and I, we've probably taught games thousands of time, but for the Disney fan, it's just a different kind of game. We have to treat them a different way and take better care of them in some cases. Gateway is that care, right? You start out with 30-card decks, and it's three Actions and twenty-seven Characters, right? All with very simple abilities. As you go, you open these packs, and you unlock these packs that add new things to them. You don't have to learn about Items or Songs right off the bat. You fold those in as you play, so you build on that concept.

 <p>
  It's something I haven't seen a lot of in this space. It's kind of an unknown. We did some consumer testing, and we're continuing to get feedback on it. We're hoping this really helps people get into the game and ease them into it. If you're an existing trading card gamer, then single-player decks are the best way to start, right? If you already know TCGs and you've played some, then I totally recommend the single-player decks. You just pull it off the shelf, shuffle up, and learn how to play. But Gateway is great if you've never played a TCG, and it's also great if you have played but you have friends or family who haven't. It's a great tool for that.

  We call that a Bruno question, and we don't talk about Bruno, okay? Yeah, we don't talk about Bruno, unfortunately, but we are very proud of the world we've created. I think it's one of the things that was super important from the very beginning, because without the world of Lorcana, it's a bunch of characters from a bunch of franchises in a deck, right?

  That's not good enough. It's not good enough for our players. It's not good enough for Disney, it's not good enough for Ravensburger, right? So that was actually the first work we did. We didn't do any game design. It was all world-building because we wanted this world where it made sense as to why you have three Mickeys out, for example, or why you have a giant Tinker Bell, like, why? How does that work?

  Nerfing weapons in

 <p>
  On August 6, 2024,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  released a major update that introduced several enemies, mission objectives, a new difficulty, and several long-awaited bug fixes, known as the Escalation of Freedom update. However, despite all the good it did, this update also upset fans of the game by introducing nerfs to some of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ’s most popular weapons. This isn’t the first time that
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has faced controversy for nerfing popular weapons in the game, except this time, the situation is more complex and volatile than ever before.

 <p>
  Prior to the Escalation of Freedom update, tensions within the game’s community were already high. This is partly due to the PlayStation account linking fiasco still lingering unresolved. Then, not directly correlated to this,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  recently reached record-low player numbers. Not to mention, the particular weapon nerfs that have most contributed to the community’s backlash are both Fire damage weapons, and
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ’s new Freedom’s Flame premium Warbond just dropped some new Fire-themed armor and weaponry. Consequently, this new update to the game was an unfortunate victim of poor timing on multiple counts.

  This controversy has reignited a long-running debate among the game’s fans about the necessity of nerfs in a strictly PvE game. Some players enjoy the challenging dynamics of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ’s difficulty changes brought about by weapon nerfs, while other players are upset that some of their favorite weapons are suffering from spontaneous nerfs.

  Helldivers 2’s Developers Are Aware of Players Concerns About the Recent Weapon Nerfs
 </h3>
 <p>
  The latest nerfs have caused a big enough controversy on the game’s dedicated Subreddits and Discord servers, and this commotion immediately caught the attention of the development studio behind the game. In the short time since the update was released, Arrowhead Games Studio released a development blog post explaining the intentions behind the recent weapon nerfs, seemingly as a response to the criticism. Also, the CEO of Arrowhead Game Studios has responded to the criticism, mentioning that the responses have been overwhelming and that the studio is taking the community’s feedback into consideration.

  <em>
   Helldivers 2

  is being review-bombed on Steam due to backlash caused by a recent game update. Considering that this controversy is a bit more complex than any one small change lighting such a big fuse, it may be a while before this ongoing situation and its underlying symptoms ever get resolved.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the average Tarnished will come across many enemies in the Lands Between that can deal incredible amounts of Holy damage. Whether they serve Destined Death or have been blessed by the Erdtree itself, they have the power to kill many who would seek to strike down the demigods.

 <p>
  Thankfully, there are ways to get around enemies that fight with this particular form of elemental damage. The most important is being properly armored for the job. Found throughout the Lands Between, from Caelid to Leyndell, these armor sets and separate pieces are designed to protect Tarnished warriors from the strongest incantations wielded by gods and men alike.

  expansion introducing several powerful armor sets, as well as new deadly bosses that primarily use Holy damage, every Tarnished should equip the best Holy negation armor they can find. This list has been updated to include not only individual armor pieces with the highest Holy defense but also the best full armor sets to equip when facing Holy damage in the game.

   Crucible Axe Set
  </span>
  armor sets in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  are nearly identical, with only slight differences in helmet and chest armor details. These two sets are among the best in the game for facing enemies that deal high Holy damage. They offer the same resistances as the Tree Sentinel Set but with significantly less weight, making them essential for any melee build. This is especially true when venturing into the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , where many enemies rely heavily on Holy damage.

 <p>
  To obtain these sets, players need to progress further in the game, reaching either Deeproot Depths or Leyndell, Royal Capital. The full Crucible Axe Set is dropped by the Crucible Knight Ordovis boss at the end of the Auriza Hero's Grave. For the Crucible Tree Set, players must defeat the Crucible Knight Siluria boss in Deeproot Depths and search the chest he guards.

   Tree Sentinel Set
  </span>
  is a strong alternative to the Crucible armor sets. It offers the same high Holy damage negation (the highest in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ), along with better Physical defense and Poise, but at the cost of higher weight. The set's noble knight appearance will appeal to players who enjoy a melee build roleplay.

 <p>
  The Tree Sentinel Set is also located in the Auriza Hero's Grave in Leyndell, Royal Capital, where the Crucible Axe Set is found. However, instead of fighting a boss to acquire it, players must destroy all three Chariot traps inside the tomb. Fans can refer to our full guide to make obtaining this armor set easier.

   Godskin Apostle Set
  </span>
  is a lightweight armor that can be invaluable for builds that can't afford to wear heavy armor when facing enemies or bosses with strong Holy damage. Despite its off-putting appearance, featuring the face of a dead god on its back, this armor offers excellent Holy damage protection. It's a practical choice for these encounters, though many players may prefer to switch to something less repulsive once the job is done.

 <p>
  While several Godskin Apostle bosses appear in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , the full set can only be obtained by defeating the Godskin Apostle at the bottom of the Divine Tower of Caelid. To reach this area, players must carefully descend using small bridges and cliffs, requiring some precise platforming.

   Solitude Set
  </span>
  is the best armor added in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  expansion for Holy damage protection. Beyond that, it's an excellent armor set overall, offering outstanding protection against all types of damage in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , along with extremely high Poise and Physical defense. Naturally, this level of protection comes with significant weight, but given how far into the game players must progress to obtain it, this may no longer be an issue.

 <p>
  Players can acquire the full Solitude Set early in their exploration of the Shadow Realm. Shortly after reaching the first area, Gravesite Plain, players can discover the Western Nameless Mausoleum, where the Blackgaol Knight boss resides. Defeating this boss grants the entire armor set, which will be invaluable for the remainder of the journey.

   Godskin Noble Set
  </span>
  shares similarities with the Godskin Apostle Set, particularly in its high resistance to Holy damage due to its exotic material. However, the Noble Set is slightly heavier and gives one's character a rounded appearance, similar to other sets like the Fire Prelate armor. Despite its intimidating look, this armor set is somewhat disappointing in terms of Physical defense and Poise, and it offers lower Holy resistance than the lighter Apostle Set. The only advantage of using the Noble Set over the Apostle Set is that it can be obtained earlier in the game.

  The Godskin Noble Set is dropped by the Godskin Noble boss encountered on the bridge leading to the Divine Tower of Liurnia. Players must follow Ranni's questline to reach this area, which requires inverting the Carian Study Hall.

   Omen Set
  </span>
  , worn by Dung Eater, has long been regarded as one of the most powerful armor sets in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . This set excels at negating Holy damage, making it particularly useful against tough bosses like Erdtree Avatar, Maliketh the Black Blade, Morgott the Omen King, Radagon of the Golden Order, and the Elden Beast. However, its significant weight and distinctive appearance may make it difficult to match with other armor sets in the game.

  Players can obtain the Omen Set by defeating Dung Eater in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds beneath the Leyndell Royal Capital. Alternatively, if players choose to follow his questline, they can retrieve this armor from his body at the conclusion of his story.

  These extremely stylish gauntlets were worn by the Fire Monks and Fire Prelates to display their thunderous gravity on the battlefield. Defeating a Prelate is no easy task, but the player will thankfully only need to defeat one to gain the gauntlets and the rest of the armor set.

  This small piece of armor might seem like it offers little protection, but in actuality, it's armor that is made from branches of the Erdtree and worn by Goldmask, one of the best NPCs in the game. To get this armor, they will need to progress through and complete Brother Cohryn's questline.

  This hood might lower overall HP but no other headpiece matches its Holy damage defense. It also looks amazing on any Tarnished looking to defeat a God. Along with its amazing Holy defense, it also offers +2 to Intelligence and Faith, making it an excellent choice for sorcerer builds.

  It's well known within the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  community that one of the best Spirits to summon is the Mimic Tear. After all, what's better than one Tarnished? Two Tarnished. So, naturally, it would be a stylish choice to have a helm that matches one's favorite Spirit.

   Silver Tear Mask

  can be acquired when the Tarnished defeats the Mimic Tear boss in Nokron, Eternal City. This helmet has an excellent Holy damage negation. But be warned, while this helmet massively enhances the wearer's Arcane stat by 8, it will also reduce the Tarnished's Physical damage. Therefore, the Tarnished will probably want to give this one a pass if they are playing a Strength build.

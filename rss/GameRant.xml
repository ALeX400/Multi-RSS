  continues its great streak of having incredible secrets that will see players rewarded with loot and extra Perk-a-Colas. Terminus has yet another secret, this time in the form of island care, as players will need to take out a few gaseous spores and deal with a bug infestation to be rewarded with a free Perk-a-Cola guaranteed.

  Not only will players receive a Perk-a-Cola upon the completion of this short and sweet quest in
  <em>

  </em>
  , but they will also obtain a Refined Aetherium Crystal to Pack-a-Punch their weapon to Tier 2. If done correctly, this means that players can have a free Perk and a Tier 2 Pack-a-Punch weapon at round 6 at the earliest!

  To start, it’s best that players have a comfortable weapon for long-range shooting, as they are going to be dealing with pesky Parasites and popping some nasty zits located around a rock. Players will need to grab themselves a boat and head out to sea, orbiting the main Terminus Island as they
  <strong>
   look for a random rock that’s covered in spores.

  The image above is what players are looking for, but each player will have a random rock where spores have begun to sprout, so it will not be the same every game. All players need to do is shoot out every spore located around the rock, but doing so will cause a Parasite to spawn. The Parasites can be ignored or killed, but once every spore has been destroyed, a growl will occur, signaling that players have completed the step.

 <p>
  After destroying the first spore-infested rock, players then need to
  <strong>
   progress to another round

  , where they will then need to take a boat and look for the infestation. Upon finding it, do the same extermination protocol and destroy all of the spores. Then, players need to do it for a third and final time on a new round, meaning that they
  <strong>
   must destroy three spore islands in total
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  After players have successfully located and destroyed three islands filled with spores, it’s time to head back to the Sea Caves, located where Speed Cola is. Inside, players will see a spore on the ground, and upon shooting it, they can see that the Sea Caves are overrun with spores. Destroying all of them will spawn Parasites, but make short work of them and shoot the final spore. In doing so, an abundance of loot will drop, and players will also have a guaranteed Perk-a-Cola Power-Up, which will be a randomized perk.

 <p>
  This is a great secret to get done every game and in the early rounds for a good head start, especially since it’s very likely that players can get a Refined Aetherium Crystal, which when picked up, will instantly Pack-a-Punch the equipped weapon to Tier 2.

      <title>Black Ops 6 Zombies: How to Breathe Underwater Longer on Terminus</title>

  ’s Terminus map houses a plethora of secrets, and many are still to be discovered as players dive into the cold and dangerous waters surrounding this prison island. With so many chests to uncover when diving into the depths, some
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  players might wish they had a diving suit to keep a steady supply of oxygen to avoid the risk of drowning.

  Luckily for them, players can get their hands on that very thing, and it’s extremely easy to do. In every game, players can grab an oxygen tank in a secret spot that grants them the ability to breathe underwater in Terminus for over a minute straight, which makes exploring under the sea so much easier.

  To start this secret easter egg, players are going to need to bring along a piece of lethal equipment that they can throw underwater. For efficiency, it’s best to just bring the regular Frag. Now, it’s time to head down to the Bio Lab and make sure that all the AMP Generators are online so that power is on.

  Players can jump into the water in the Bio Lab and dive down, swimming to the area where they first activated the Pack-a-Punch. To the left of this area, there will be a rock with a slight glow to it. Players need to throw a grenade at this rock to blow it up and reveal an oxygen canister in its place. If players interact with the oxygen canister, they will refill their oxygen meter to stay underwater for longer. With the oxygen tank equipped, players can now passively breathe underwater for around 80 seconds without having to resurface for air.

  While it’s great to swim underwater for longer durations, the tentacle can still spawn a gas attack that will easily kill players if they are not on the surface. The tentacle will consistently spawn when players are in the water, and will not go away until they progress to a new round.

  paid DLC, The Storybook Vale, when it releases later in 2024. Since its release in September 2022,
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley

  Popular streamer Asmongold has revealed his plans to stream
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  now that his Twitch ban has ended. Considering that the game's global release is only days away, Asmongold may be trying out
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  on his Twitch channel sooner rather than later.

  Earlier in October, Zack "Asmongold" Hoyt was banned from Twitch for making offensive comments about Palestinians. Though he later issued an apology, Asmongold stepped away from OTK and Starforge Systems, two companies that he co-owns, and took a break from streaming altogether. There was speculation that his ban would last for 14 days. This time period turned out to be true as Asmongold’s Twitch channel went back online on October 29, and he held a lengthy livestream on the same day. The content creator now plans on streaming one of the most anticipated games of the year.

  On October 28, one of Asmongold’s Twitter followers asked him if he would stream
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  after his return to Twitch. “Absolutely,” responded the streamer. After 10 years of waiting, the hype for
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is immense among players. The game’s reviews ahead of its release were very positive overall. However, Asmongold shared his skepticism of the game’s quality in a previous YouTube video. Despite this, he still seems willing to play the RPG on his Twitch channel.

  During his time away from streaming, Asmongold decided to clean his house, which was well-known to be quite messy. His return to Twitch and streaming may take up more of his time, though, considering that
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  will take around 100 hours to complete, according to developer BioWare. The game is set for release on October 31, so fans might see Asmongold play it in the upcoming days. Aside from apologizing for his actions, the streamer also assured his community that he planned on becoming a better version of himself and creating more positive content.

  Like Asmongold, many gaming content creators have been looking forward to streaming
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . To experience the franchise's next adventure, players should consider that
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is a large game and will demand a lot of storage. There has been some criticism that the game is too "woke" for having pansexual companions. Asmongold has long proclaimed himself as part of the "anti-woke" movement, but bearing in mind his intentions to produce less negative content, perhaps he'll take a more positive approach to the game.

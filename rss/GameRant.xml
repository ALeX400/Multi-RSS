      Jigglypuff was almost replaced by Clefairy in Super Smash Bros. 64 but was chosen as a joke character by Masahiro Sakurai.

     <li>
      Clefairy was considered for the game due to its popularity, but Jigglypuff's similarity to Kirby won out.

      Jigglypuff went on to be a major competitor in Melee despite starting as a joke character, impacting its and Clefairy's popularity.

  let gamers play as Pikachu or Jigglypuff, but according to Masahiro Sakurai, Jigglypuff almost didn't make the cut. In the pink Pokemon's stead, a different pink Pokemon would have taken their
  <em>

  spot.

  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.

  has tons of Pokemon in it these days, with the games adding additional Pokemon starting with Melee. From the start, additional Pokemon have been present in the form of assists and stage hazards, but Pikachu and Jigglypuff were there from the get-go. Jigglypuff could be unlocked after playing the game and meeting certain requirements, and has been in the series ever since.

 <p>
  According to a recently rediscovered interview that was published in a Japanese magazine called 64Dream, history could have played out differently, with Pikachu and Clefairy being the two Pokemon featured in the original N64 game. In the May 1999 issue, the magazine published an interview with members of the development team behind the game. In it, Sakurai says that he was looking for popular characters he could add that would repurpose animation and fighting styles from an existing fighter, and it was initially a toss-up between Clefairy and Jigglypuff.

 <h2 id="why-did-sakurai-pick-jigglypuff-over-clefairy">
  Why Did Sakurai Pick Jigglypuff Over Clefairy?
 </h2>
 <p>
  According to the translation offered by Source Gaming, Sakurai chose Jigglypuff as something of a joke character. He was able to repurpose much of what made up Kirby's moveset and animations, but chose Jigglypuff because he considered it to be a weak Pokemon, but one with a gimmick, as it can put fighters to sleep. Clefairy became an assist, instead, and the rest is history.

 <p>
  Clefairy has been largely overshadowed by many Pokemon since its initial release in
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  . However, there's good reason to have considered it for the role. Clefairy was featured as Red's Pokemon in the first
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  manga ever. It was also considered for the spot as Ash's lead Pokemon in the anime, with this idea was eventually scrapped in favor of Pikachu. In terms of gameplay and appearance, Jigglypuff bears a stronger resemblance to Kirby. Although some depictions of Clefairy show it floating, and it can do unusual moves through Metronome, Jigglypuff has frequently been depicted as puffing up, similar to how Kirby inhales air.

  Although Jigglypuff may have been considered a joke character at first, it went on to be a major competitor in
  <em>
   Melee
  </em>
  . It's interesting to think of how history could have differed with this one change, and how it would have impacted the overall popularity of these two Pokemon as the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Smash
  </em>
  series continued.

 <p>
  Ever since Street Fighter first started appearing in arcades back in the late 80s, Capcom have been proclaimed by many to be the kings of the fighting game genre, and they're still releasing new entries in this beloved genre to this day. Because they managed to nail the core-gameplay of their fighting games very early on, they've been able to implement numerous interesting mechanics, systems, and modes over the years to build upon each game that came before.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle

  </em>
  expansion pack focuses on sustainable living, allowing Sims to build eco-friendly homes in any world, harvest their own food (which includes a new crop - soybeans), and reduce their neighborhood's environmental impact by voting on action plans. New Build &amp; Buy items include different solar panels, wind turbines, and rainwater collectors to help Sims lower their eco-footprint and the cost of their bills.

  <em>
   The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle
  </em>
  is a valuable expansion pack for players who enjoy off-the-grid storylines. With the two new traits introduced with the pack, Green Fiend and Recycle Disciple, Sims can enjoy a more sustainable way of living, which allows for unique, engaging gameplay, especially when it comes to gardening. There are also several
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  that can enhance a Simmer's gardening experience, but some are arguably better than others.

  Available in various bright swatches, the Mitey Mitey Home Insect Farm allows players to have their Sims farm, nurture, and feed grubs, bombardier beetles, or crickets. The Sims will then be able to collect different objects from the insect farm, including insect products and fertilizers, which can both be used on plants to help them evolve quickly.

 <p>
  Players can have their Sims upgrade their toilet so they get the option to compost after they use it - a great way to feed the bugs. It's always a good idea to keep insect farms close to gardens so Sims don't forget to feed and nurture them.

  Sims can also upgrade the object to allow it to water plants automatically and spray for bugs whenever they appear. And players can grow more than just plants in the A-OK-Bloomer Vertical Garden. Sims who follow the Green Technician Branch of the Civil Design Career will also unlock the ability to grow cruelty-free meat. After watering and massaging the meat wall for a few days, they can harvest faux-meat cubes to be used in cooking or sold for a few extra simoleons.

  For players who love the idea of building a garden but don't like designing outside buildings, the Tale Of A Living Pergola is a hidden treasure inside the
  <em>
   Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle
  </em>
  Expansion Pack. Sims can easily create a cozy green space for their insect farms, plants, and decorations under this object even though it does take up quite a few tiles.

  This object can be a little tricky to unlock without using cheats, as it does not appear in the regular Build &amp; Buy menu. Sims need to enter the Civil Design Career and choose the Green Technical Branch before they can unlock the option to craft the Hydroponic Planter in the Store No More Home Fabricator. This planter waters plants automatically, making it a must for Sims with large gardens (or the Lazy trait).

 <p>
  The fabricator is available in the Build &amp; Buy menu; however, it's also a career reward in the Civil Design Career. To start fabricating, Sims will need to acquire bits and pieces, either from using the Guntdach Home Recycler, sorting compostables in a dumpster, or from the Mitey Mitey Home Insect Farm, which gives Bits &amp; Pieces to the household when Sims compost from their toilet.

  For players who are tired of their Sims inventory getting jam-packed with random items, this object will help keep items so much more organized. Found under Storage in the Build &amp; Buy section, these boxes are the ideal way to keep fruit, vegetables, flowers, and rare seeds neatly arranged for a Sims household.

 <p>
  These boxes can be named, so players will know exactly what's inside each. Players can drop items from every member of the household's inventory into the boxes, too. The Sticker Storage Box is not affected by weather, so it can be used inside or outside and only requires one tile.

  Is it part of the garden or a semi-comfortable seating area for Sims? It's both. This wooden eco-style bench blends right into the greenery, and that's because it's growing. However, players don't need to worry about watering or caring for this foliage. No trimming is required either.

 <p>
  The Seat Of Cultivation is available in various color swatches and is ideal for the eco-warrior Sim who wants to show the neighbors that they're serious about saving the planet - even if it means they have to be a bit uncomfortable. Although it's made for the outside, players can also use this object inside their homes, too.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle
  </em>
  Expansion Pack introduced the Fabrication Skill, which allows Sims to create candles with wax that they harvest from Burtie's Bee Box (with the
  <em>
   Seasons
  </em>
  Expansion Pack), collect from the soy plant, or buy from the station, together with different colors of dye.

 <p>
  As Sims improve their candle-making skills, they unlock the ability to make more complex shapes and designs. These candles are a great way to bring a romantic vibe to any garden, and they save on the electricity bill, too. Sims just need to make sure to pop them into the Guntdach Home Recycler when they have burnt down.

  And while the Whatever You Want Cabinet only has one slot to snap small items, it comes ready decorated with some old boxes, pots, planters, a basket of leaves, and a ladder trellis. It's quite tall and only takes up two tiles, making it easy to fit into most garden spaces.

  Players who love adding tiny details to their garden builds won't want to miss out on the Little Birdhouse included in the
  <em>
   Sims 4: Eco-Lifestyle

  Expansion Pack. Nothing says eco-love quite like making space for the birds, and with all the different color swatches, there's a birdhouse for every garden.

 <p>
  While offering a safe and cozy haven for birds, this small decorative item is the ideal finishing touch for any garden. However, Sims cannot interact with it, unlike some of the other bird-related objects in other expansion packs, which allow Sims to feed and even chat with feathered friends.

  Other weapons can be dropped by enemies or found lying around enemy bases that can be picked up and used. You'll know if a weapon can be picked up and used as a white bar with the gun's icon will appear above the ground. Approaching the gun and interacting with it will pick it up, with Nix also able to retrieve weapons for you if it was dropped by an enemy out in the middle of a fight. Once a weapon is picked up, its
  <strong>
   ammo is limited and it will be automatically dropped once you run out
  </strong>
  . Its total ammo is displayed by the white bars around the reticle in the center of the screen.

  While you can dodge and sprint with a picked-up weapon,
  <strong>
   any animation that requires Kay to use her hands will drop the weapon
  </strong>
  , such as climbing a ladder, grabbing a cliff, or getting on your speeder. It is possible to use Nix to retrieve a dropped weapon when climbing, but this is not always possible and does limit the overall use of a picked-up weapon.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an open-world tactical shooter in which players must complete a range of missions across the sprawling map of the fictional Aurora Archipelago. Like many modern open-world games,
  <em>
   Ghost Recon Breakpoint
  </em>
  boasts an impressive map size, even exceeding the enormous Bolivia of
  <em>
   Ghost Recon Wildlands
  </em>
  . One key difference between the two games is that, unlike Bolivia, the Aurora Archipelago is made up of islands separated by sometimes vast bodies of water. As a result, players will likely find themselves using
  <strong>
   helicopters
  </strong>
  a lot more than in previous titles.

 <p>
  When it comes to helicopters in
  <em>
   Ghost Recon Breakpoint
  </em>
  , there are several different models for players to choose from, each with its own particular strengths and weaknesses. While some helicopters favor speed and agility, others have better armor and more firepower. It all depends on each player's personal preferences, as well as the particular mission they are trying to complete. Some helicopters may be better for transportation, while others are ideally suited to assaulting large enemy outposts.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Overseer
  </strong>
  is a small transport helicopter ideal for hopping between islands or over mountains. Despite its small size, it is surprisingly well armed, and comes with two gatling guns or twin rockets of either a light or heavy variety. As a result, it can be good for assaulting smaller enemy bases, and its maneuverability is certainly an advantage that makes up for its weaker armor.

 <p>
  A Mk 2 variant can also be found, with missiles that will lock onto targets. Typically this variant is acquired from enemy bases such as Raven's Rock outposts. Despite its many advantages, the Overseer remains one of the weaker helicopters in the game.

  The
  <strong>
   Blacklist
  </strong>
  is a specialist transport helicopter deployed by the 4th Echelon of the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  series as part of the
  <em>
   Deep State
  </em>
  crossover DLC. Designed with stealth in mind, the Blacklist can fly at low altitudes with few issues and also comes equipped with a solid arsenal of weapons, including missile launchers and a front gun.

 <p>
  The helicopter has decent armor and maneuverability, but the limitations of only being able to attack targets that are directly ahead puts it at a disadvantage when compared to some of the other assault-heavy gunships in the game. Overall, it is a powerful helicopter and worth checking out for players who are especially interested in the franchise crossover.

 <p>
  Inspired by designs such as the Black Hawk UH-60 and NH-90, the
  <strong>
   Gyps
  </strong>
  is primarily a transport helicopter, though it comes equipped with a powerful arsenal of rockets and miniguns, making it capable of taking on larger enemy settlements and outposts. While it is slower in both speed and maneuverability than many of its counterparts, its increased armor and firing output balance this out, almost giving the Gyps the feeling of a 'flying fortress.'

 <p>
  With a carrying capacity of up to six Ghosts, players can transport their entire team anywhere while still retaining their firepower from the back of the helicopter, unlike many other designs. If it had more agile handling, as well as a higher top speed, the Gyps would easily outclass every other helicopter in the game, but these limitations mean that it will not be to everyone's preference.

 <p>
  Inspired by the AH-1 SupaCobra of the Huey family, the
  <strong>
   Deinos
  </strong>
  is a fast-moving and highly agile attack helicopter. With its more retro-Cold War design, it is the rarest helicopter model in the game, and represents an older version of the technically superior Opheis. Nonetheless, the Deinos is a formidable aircraft with impressive firepower from both its mounted rockets and its main machine gun.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Deinos is ideal for taking on enemy convoys, and its balanced weight makes hovering while shooting targets especially easy. The helicopter is also capable of reaching some impressive speeds, and can also sustain a fair amount of damage, especially when compared with other aircraft of a similar size.

  The
  <strong>
   Opheis
  </strong>
  is the modern and improved version of the rarer Deinos, and as a result, it has a number of advantages over other helicopters in the game. In addition to its high armor, which is capable of sustaining significant damage, it also comes equipped with both twin rocket pods and a rotary cannon that can shoot enemies from any direction. On top of this, it is also one of the better handling helicopters in the game, and has a high top speed equaling those of the game's other fastest aircraft.

 <p>
  Several Mk 2 variants can also be found in the game. These contain increased armor plating along with four heavy missiles and a rotary cannon. The missiles, like other Mk 2 variants, will be able to lock on to enemy vehicles and aircraft. Overall, this is the best helicopter in the game when it comes to dealing out damage from above while remaining relatively well-defended, and is able to shoot from all sides without compromising speed and maneuverability.

  Iconic Marvel super hero Spider-Man might have a new name among
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans, thanks to an amusing glitch that saw the character's latest skin given an unusual and unrelated name. The skin debuted in the latest
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  update, which saw a crossover with Marvel heroes and villains alike arriving for a spot of battle royale action.

 <p>
  Marvel and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  are increasingly looking like a match made in heaven, judging by the number of times Marvel characters have appeared in the popular game for one crossover event or another. The latest crossover, called Absolute Doom, launched with
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Chapter 5 Season 4, and welcomed a number of new skins based on Marvel characters to the mix, including Gwenpool, Shuri, Emma Frost, Mysterio, and War Machine.

 <p>
  Absolute Doom also added the new Iron Spider
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skin, a version of Spider-Man's outfit decked out in Iron Man's iconic red and gold colors. But for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  player Britishbreadish, the Iron Spider skin arrived under a very different name: Middlesock. They shared the odd occurrence with the game's Reddit community in search of answers.

  Britishbreadish said they encountered the strange glitch while browsing the

As they were unfamiliar with the many names and costumes found in the Spider-Verse, Britishbreadish was unsure if Middlesock was some sort of canonical name for the Iron Spider, or if the issue was a result of some bug or oversight.

 <p>
  According to amused fellow
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  players, "Middlesock" was developer Epic Games' internal code name for the Iron Spider set. Its appearance on the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  store page suggests that the placeholder text was not replaced or somehow reverted in the Polish language display. The word itself has no connection to any particular
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  costume or character, but fans clarified that Epic Games typically uses unrelated or nonsense code names for skins in the game data to try to keep new skins from being revealed too early by data miners or leakers.

 <p>
  Given the level of anticipation that follows any information about new
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skins and other pop culture products like new movies and series, it's no surprise that creators go to some lengths to preserve the sense of surprise and secrecy around their productions. Even Hollywood films use misleading code names (or "working titles") for some films. Marvel Studios'
  <em>
   The Avengers
  </em>
  was code-named "Group Hug" during its filming, so it's almost appropriate that a
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  skin featuring a famous Marvel character would also have a similarly obscure code name.

      <title>5 Strategy Games With The Best Resource Systems</title>

  <strong>
   Resource Systems
  </strong>
  are what grant an identity to the strategy genre, and though not all Strategy games rely solely on their resources to give players a fully immersive experience, they are a feature that needs to be around most of the time in order to give shape to many other mechanics in this genre.

 <p>
  Unlike population systems that force players to keep close control of their unit budget, resources can come in various colors and shapes. From the classic food and gold to the incredibly scarce magic resources in a high fantasy strategy game. This list contains some of the best resource systems in strategy games.

  If we are talking about incredibly good resource systems, then
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dawn of Man
   </strong>
  </em>
  definitely places among the first games on the podium. With a wide range of resources to collect and even more to craft and produce, it has one of the biggest resource pools of all strategy games ever created.

 <p>
  From tools (stone, copper, bronze, iron) to tannin, cereals, and even cheese, villagers will need a little bit of everything to be able to survive the harsh winters in the vast wilderness. To add a little more depth, every resource is tradeable and has intrinsic value, so when traders arrive to trade with the player's settlement, they'll be able to offer a variety of things that players cannot obtain easily in exchange for the surplus in their own produce.
  <em>
   Dawn of Man
  </em>
  delivers a great resource system with lots of room for replayability.

  The all-time classic
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  renewed itself with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Age of Empires 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  with its iconic 4-main resource system (Food, Wood, Gold, andStone). It has come a long way from its early origins back in 1997. The fourth iteration of the franchise made a great revision of its core resource mechanics and added civilization-specific resources that depend on each of the chosen faction core mechanics.

  For example, the Rus civilization collects gold each time they hunt a wild animal, and that stacks into a passive that improves how their villagers gather and carry resources. The Dehli Sultanate can produce religious (Scholar) units that gather inspiration as a special resource and improve the research rate of the buildings. The Mongols cannot collect Stone directly, instead needing to build Ovos, places of worship that empower every building surrounding them and unlock special research using stone — plus, the Mongols are the only units that receive resources for pillaging enemy buildings. Then, you have the Byzantines, who can gather Olive Oil and use it to hire mercenaries and other special units.
  <em>
   Age of Empires 4
  </em>
  has gone far beyond its core resource system and greatly improved its features.

  </em>
  has an intricate resource system with its three basic resources and then plenty of special resources to gather, from Knowledge (that you can use to research new spells) to War Spoils, which are special resources that only certain factions can gather. Overall, the game has a pretty complex resource system, with some cool main mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to master.

 <p>
  In advanced gameplay, the game also offers some additional features, such as the Casting Points, which determines how many spells you can cast during the tactical and strategy turns. And then, you have a sort of reputation system that depends on your contributions called Imperium — the higher it is, the easier to take new cities, unlock new developments, and lower the rates of upkeep of advanced units. This intricate system can be a little bit painful at first, but as you go through the initial stages of gameplay, players will be presented with many opportunities to learn how to manage resources. Besides, each new playthrough is considerably extensive, since it can last up to 8 hours in total, so prepare for a long-term strategy play.

  is a complex strategy game with a powerful background message: only those who work together can survive. From its intricate management system to its even more complex resource gathering, players will need to prioritize the most valuable thing above all else: survivors. Gathering survivors will not be easy, since players need to create a beacon for their explorers to return to base — and cross fingers to see if their supply runs are successful or disastrous.

 <p>
  On the other hand, people working in facilities can get badly hurt, sometimes requiring prosthetics to regain the full use of their mechanical and operating abilities. Besides your usual food provision in the form of raw food and rations, players will also have to gather wood, mine coal, and search for steam cores and steel — which can be quite tricky to find while also being highly valuable in all stages of the game.

   <strong>
    Total War: Warhammer 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the epitome of 4x games, with an enormous number of mechanics to try out and several campaigns to play both in single-player and cooperative modes. But, what makes this game such a vast and complex title among the many strategy games currently available is its enormous resource system. For starters, every faction has its own uses for each of the available resources on the campaign map, and each resource requires a specific building to be allocated in their respective node to be collected.

 <p>
  Of course, there are the classic Gemstones, Iron, Gold, and Timber, but then there are also special resources like Dwarf Beer, Medicinal plants, Furs, Tusks, Exotic Animals, and more. Each of those resources grants different bonuses to each of the factions you control; for example, Wine can guarantee public order for Bretonians, while for the Warriors of Chaos, Wine increases the melee damage of their Marauder units. One of the greatest things about this game is that its campaigns are enormous, especially
  <em>
   Immortal Empires
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Realms of Chaos
  </em>
  .

  Mobile games have been some of the most played titles in the industry, leaving marks on the world for decades to come with remarkable interactive experiences at users' fingertips. From the invention of mobile games in 1994, to the 'boom' of mobile gaming since the invention of the smartphone, playing video games on mobile devices has become an entertainment juggernaut. In today's day and age, there have been plenty of wonderful mobile games that have cemented their names in society.

  As smartphones have become more sophisticated, mobile games have evolved to encompass a wide range of genres and experiences. From breathtaking role-playing adventures and strategy simulations to competitive multiplayer battles and narrative-driven experiences, mobile games started to offer something for everyone. And since the mobile gaming industry has had time to stew, some of the all time greats are no longer in a playable state for a variety of reasons. This list still includes those titles to pay homage to their contributions in pushing the industry forward.

   The world of mobile gaming is an ever-growing market that shows no sign of stopping or even slowing down anytime soon. The silent majority of gamers are on mobile, and that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. Despite its popularity, the mobile gaming platform doesn’t really lend itself to all-time classics quite as well as PC or consoles. Still, there are some true gems that have surfaced in the industry over the years. The list has been updated with two additional titles.

  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  is known worldwide as one of the oldest video games to kick off the gaming medium that had become so popular.
  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  has been a title among many different names, yet all with the same gameplay that brings fans of all ages. In
  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  , players have to strategically manipulate falling blocks of different shapes and sizes, known as "tetrominos," to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps.

  Clearing lines earns points and prevents the stack of blocks from reaching the top of the screen, requiring quick thinking and spatial awareness to achieve high scores. Nowadays,
  <em>
   Tetris
  </em>
  is mostly enjoyed through cellular devices, making it one of the greatest mobile games of all time.

  <em>
   Marvel Snap

  takes the faces of famous
  <em>
   Marvel
  </em>
  characters and slaps them onto cards, which withhold different Energy costs, Power, and abilities.

  Players must use these cards and play them in three different locations. Winning two of these locations wins players the game.
  <em>
   Marvel Snap's
  </em>
  matches usually last five minutes or less, making it a great way to pass time, as well as using a neat collection system that makes
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  uniquely addicting.

  Not many games become worldwide sensations overnight, especially when they're not directly part of a well-known franchise or series.
  <em>
   Candy Crush
  </em>
  has gone down in history as one of the most addictive games in history, as it had become known as one of the highest-grossing mobile games of its time (2013-2017).

  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  is a critically acclaimed 2D metroidvania roguelite game that was originally released on PC and consoles in 2018. In
  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  , players control a character that can use a multitude of weapons, all found during the course of a 'run' that drastically alter how combat works.
  <em>
   Dead Cells'
  </em>
  fluid animations - for both the player character and the enemies - ensure that combat feels dynamic and responsive, closer to a Soulslike than a platformer.

 <p>
  The game offers deep customization and replayability, giving players a ton of options in terms of weapons and their associated upgrades. Though it shares the core elements of a typical metroidvania, its dynamic approach to combat sets it apart. Discovering what makes
  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  beloved the world over is something a player can only experience once. It deserves its acclaim and more.

  <em>
   Alto's Adventure
  </em>
  and its sequel,
  <em>
   Alto's Odyssey
  </em>
  , are single-player skiing games that allow players to control a character skiing down snowy mountains, over sandy dunes, and through stone cities. Players earn points for doing stunts on the snowboard and keeping up combos, but it's not a requirement to play. Just enjoying the scenery that runs by in the background is just as enjoyable, if not more.

  <em>
   Alto's Adventure
  </em>
  is one of those games that knows it's a mobile game first and shows that's okay. It doesn't try to keep players' attention for more than a single session but also doesn't punish them for wanting to go for multiple rounds in a single sitting. Do not be fooled by the game's apparent simplicity; the games are extremely replayable. Players can unlock new characters through the in-game currency that complete

  What can be said about
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  that hasn’t already been said a million times over in a million different ways? A true open world sandbox game that lets players do what they want in an infinite world made up of infinite blocks.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  lets players build anything from a simple hut to the entire Earth using the exact same blocks that everything in the game is made of. Alternatively, Survival Mode gives a goal to strive towards, forcing the player to earn every item and block they place in the world, turning even the most humble of creations into a satisfying achievement.

  The Pocket Edition of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  was released on Android shortly after its PC debut in 2011. Owing to its relatively simple building blocks,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  on mobile is nearly as feature-complete as it is on PC, which is something very few games released on multiple platforms can boast.

   Subway Surfers

  is the most successful game within that genre and has become one of the most-played mobile games on Earth.

  2010 was an amazing year for mobile gaming, as many celebrated titles were released at the time. One such game was
  <em>
   Fruit Ninja
  </em>
  , a tablet and smartphone sensation that had fans sliding their fingers across their screens with a concentrated effort in slicing different fruits. In
  <em>
   Fruit Ninja
  </em>
  , as the title suggests, players are put into a room where random fruits (along with bombs and diverse upgrades) are thrown up into the air.

 <p>
  Gamers then have to swipe through the fruit to earn points. Letting any fruits fall to the ground untouched will give fans a strike.
  <em>
   Fruit Ninja
  </em>
  became well-known due to its addictive gameplay and simple mechanics.

  In
  <em>
   Angry Birds
  </em>
  , players used different types of bird characters to launch away with a large slingshot at constructed towers full of "green pigs" which are the birds' enemies. The goal of the game is to knock down the towers and take out all the green pigs. With an addictive foundation and a unique style,
  <em>
   Angry Birds

  quickly rose to popularity. Unfortunately, Rovio Enterntainment delisted the title from online stores on February 23, 2023.

  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  , launched in 2016, is a fast-paced, real-time strategy game where players collect and upgrade cards to build decks. The objective is to destroy the opponent's towers while defending your own, using a deck of eight cards. Players play these cards in an arena, spawning characters that auto-move toward the opponent's towers, forcing them to react with their own troops. It's a tug-of-war of who can outsmart the other player entirely based on skill and timing. Winning battles sees players rising in the ranks and facing better players with better cards.

  Players can earn cards and level them up by playing the game, unlocking chests, and winning tournaments.

  has a dedicated community, regular updates, new events, new cards to introduce meta changes, and a huge player base. Its competitive nature and strategic depth make it a favorite among mobile gamers.

  Though originally and officially released as a PC game back in 2006, the prevalent
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  eventually catered to mobile users in 2012. Since then,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  has built a large following of devoted fans and even focuses much of its online gaming toward children, making the game a safe place for younger gamers to play online multiplayer games.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  is capable of allocating so many genres of games to its players due to the games being created by the players themselves, the community is made up of many differing fans. It is because of the players themselves that
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  has become such a recognizable name in the entertainment world.

  <em>
   Flappy Bird

  is, debatably, the most well-known and famous mobile game in the history of video games. Developed by Dong Nguyen,
  <em>
   Flappy Bird
  </em>
  was an instant hit when it was released onto mobile app stores, bringing unexpected success to the game's developer. As the simple game garnered more and more attention and fame, Dong Nguyen progressively became overwhelmed.

  The past and the stories that derived from it have the potential to be entertaining and informative. Even casual consumption of something like an older story can give a person insight into the mentality of that time period. The potential to entertain derived from the past is not lost on video game developers.

 <p>
  Various series tend to pull heavily from history or the tales that were made from it. As a reference point, it is often re-written with an emphasis on entertainment. Regardless, this altered basis in factual events can be both a gateway into studying actual historical knowledge, or a fun easter egg for someone already more informed on the topic.

  If you have yet to pick up this beloved roguelite despite everyone talking about it, then take this article as a sign to do so. The game stars Zagreus, a son of the titular Hades, attempting to escape the Underworld. He does this with the literal blessings of his godly relatives, which additionally augment his abilities. He can utilize a variety of infernal arms, which he can unlock aspects from that are rooted in cultures other than Greece.

 <p>
  He additionally crosses paths with a number of mythological figures, such as the Minotaur, Charon, and his own pet dog, Cerberus. Zagreus can also build his relationships with various figures, some of them even having the propensity to turn romantic. Although Zagreus is able to briefly escape the Underworld, he always gets dragged back down. The adventure becomes more about developing connections with those within it, as well as augmenting your own individual abilities. This adds a ton of variety to what is, in essence, a game consisting only of four levels. Its sequel
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  , is currently available in an early access form on Steam.

  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  reframes history as a struggle between the Order of Assassins and the Knights Templar, the former preferring free will to the latter's desire for control, as a means of peace. The series uses stealth as a primary mechanic with RPG elements, though certain installments have been criticized for leaning too much into the RPG genre. The various installments take place throughout different points in time, ranging from Ptolmeiac Egypt to the present day. For the majority of the installments, characters from the present are made to relive the experiences of past characters, which they tend to utilize towards their various goals.

  The
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  series is an entertaining set of visual novels which revolve around lawyers uncovering murder mysteries to find the culprits, and more importantly, exonerate their clients. Phoenix Wright, the original star of the series, is one of the most accomplished in this regard, using his mystery solving prowess as well as his tendency to turn cases over, to determine the truth. However, some critics complain about what they view as the formulaic nature of the series, especially in its later stages.

  Perhaps as a retort,
  <em>
   The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles
  </em>
  proves the series format still has the potential to expand. This duology takes place at the turn of the century, in Victorian era London, as well as the Meiji period in Japan. During this era, a young university student in Japan was falsely accused of murdering a foreign professor. This student is Ryunosuke Naruhodo, an ancestor of Phoenix Wright. Naruhodo is shown to be a skilled debater, which convinces his friend Kazuma Asogi, himself a fledgling lawyer, to sneak him to England, where he will learn to become a defense attorney. Naruhodo is also aided by Susato Mikotoba, his more learned co-counsel, and Herlock Sholmes, a quirky English detective who uses anachronistic inventions and abductive reasoning to solve cases.

  This prequel period piece to the
  <em>
   Ace Attorney
  </em>
  series removes certain staples of the series whilst expanding on others, to give what is all in all, a relatively unique experience. It loosely adapts certain narrative beats from the Sherlock Holmes tales, and combines that with a historical look at the persecution the Japanese faced in England. It also features Japanese novelist and scholar, Sōseki Natsume, best known for writing
  <em>
   I Am a Cat
  </em>
  , as one of Naruhodo's defendants.

  <em>
   Romance of the Three Kingdoms
  </em>
  was a novel from the 14th century, which was itself based on
  <em>
   Records of the Three Kingdoms
  </em>
  from the 3rd century. Both of these works, the former a partially-fictional novel and the latter a historical document, revolved around the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in China. This centuries-long game of telephone continued into more modern times with Tecmo Koei's own adaptation of the novel as a turn-based strategy game. From there, it was adapted into the
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  series, a beat-em up where various figures from the Three Kingdoms period are playable, often claiming territories and taking on thousands of weaker foes all the while.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  also gained a sister series,
  <em>
   Samurai Warriors
  </em>
  , which was instead focused on the Warring States Period of Japan. Both of these games share a lot of DNA, playing it fast and loose with the historical accuracy aspect, which is largely sacrificed for entertainment. Examples of this include a greater diversity in weapons than what was present at the time, a greater role of women in combat, and more broad anachronisms such as certain warriors participating in historical battles they would not have been present for.

  The crossover series,
  <em>
   Warriors Orochi
  </em>
  , takes this to the extreme with warriors from these distinct time periods meeting one another, with an increased prevalence and emphasis on mythology from the eastern world. This expands with later games, including characters from other video game series (some of which are loosely adapted from history) and even Greek and Norse mythology into the franchise.

  Few could've foreseen the direction the straightforward puzzle-word game would take with its sequel. The original
  <em>
   Bookworm
  </em>
  is a pretty straightforward connective word game, where Lex continually matches adjacent letters to win. Certain tiles are more beneficial to spell with, whilst others are harmful if left unaccounted for.
  <em>
   Bookworm Adventures
  </em>
  takes this premise and implements it into a game with many more RPG-driven elements.

 <p>
  Here, Lex adventures through different subgenres of literature from the past, taking on various characters representative of it along the way. He does this by spelling words, using a predetermined set of letters from a grid. The larger a word, the more damaging it is to Lex's opponent. As a grid consists of 16 letters, this is the most that can be utilized at once in a given word. Beating each level leads to Lex gaining a new treasure, which can serve to benefit him in the journeys ahead. Additionally, Lex gains experience with every enemy he beats.

 <p>
  Levels are split by more specific categories, such as one subset of the Greek Mythology stage focused on enemies based at sea, such as Scylla, Charybdis, and the Kraken. The first Bookworm adventures focuses on Greek Mythology,
  <em>
   One Thousand and One Nights
  </em>
  , and Gothic Literature. Its sequel focuses on Western Fairytales (half of which are
  <em>
   Alice in Wonderland
  </em>
  ), Chinese Mythology, and Futuristic Literature. The sequel also adds companion characters who can aid Lex with beneficial abilities. Both games have an irreverent sense of humor which adds to their charm. Unfortunately, either game is quite difficult to obtain nowadays.

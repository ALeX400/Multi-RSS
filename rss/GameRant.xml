  Every superhero has its nemesis, and some of them might even be lucky enough to get a recurrent romantic interest. But
  <em>
   <strong>
    Black Cat

  </em>
  is all that and more for Spider-Man, which has led her to become one of the most popular Marvel Characters and fan-favorite shipping target for the wall-crawler.

  The Black Cat from this universe is technically the same as the one that appeared in the
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  animated series from the 90's, and as such, she and Peter Parker know each other all too well. This version of Felicia Hardy is the most "benign" and faithful to the original design, both in costume and character background. If we are talking about faithfulness to the original version of the character, then this Black Cat is definitely the most lore-accurate one.

 <p>
  She ignored her father's true identity as the original Black Cat until one fateful day, she was injected with a composite drug that altered her appearance and physical qualities. After Felicia was given the Super Soldier Serum, she dressed as the Black Cat and began a life of crime, often seen as Spider-Man's nemesis and occasional ally. She is in love with Peter Parker and knows his true identity as Spider-Man. In the game, this version of Black Cat is the first one recruited as one of Spider-Man's allies, and it is one of the occasions where this character is available as a companion.

  <em>
   Spider-Man Web Of Shadows
  </em>
  is one of the most interesting Spider-Man games ever released, and as such, it is only fair that the iconic Black Cat was on par with the game's high standards. The outfit design of the anti-heroic cat burglar was modernized for this version, leaving behind the classical one-piece spandex suit and replacing it with a two-piece leather armor with a jacket. The new character background design and the modernization of the suit are definitely plus points to make this version one of the best.

 <p>
  Overall, Felicia shows significant change and her attitude toward Spider-Man is a little bit different from usual. In this universe, Black Cat and Spider-Man dated in the past: Felicia and Peter try to leave their secret identities to the side and live a normal life. Of course, that didn't work well, and when players encounter her when chasing Kingping, she reveals that her feelings for Peter haven't changed, and accepts to cooperate with him to defeat the criminal. The game also explores a symbiote outbreak in which the decisions of the player affect the outcome of the story through a "morality system." It is also the only game where Black Cat is merged with a Symbiote, and in the "bad ending" she rules together with Black Suit Spider-Man as king and queen of a new species. This ending is, in fact, one of the few times where we see Felicia and Peter having a "happily ever after."

 <p>
  The Felicia Hardy from
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  is slightly different than the usual version of the character. She is trained in acrobatics and espionage and is more gadget-oriented than her alternate versions. In this universe, Felicia found out about Walter Hardy's true identity much earlier and against her father's will, she decided to follow his steps as a burglar, creating her own suit and gadgets. She is also a little bit older than Peter Parker (20 years old versus 18 years old) and much more mature than him. She doesn't know about Spider-Man's true identity (allegedly) and only appears in a series of side-missions known as the Black Cat Stakeouts. She would later appear as a main character in the
  <em>
   City That Never Sleeps
  </em>
  DLC.

 <p>
  In this universe, Black Cat tried to reform herself while also cooperating and being romantically involved with Spider-Man, but in the end, Spider-Man broke up with her when he discovered she was keeping the loot from the criminals they were taking down together. This version of Felicia Hardy's alter ego wasn't as well received as expected, mainly due to character background reasons, but it is still one of the best versions of the character both in design and fidelity to the original one. The main issue remains the changes in the character background design, where Black Cat somewhat diverts from her usual origin story related to the Super Soldier Serum and her father's past coming back to bite her tail.

  A more stylized, mature version of Felicia Hardy's alter ego, who is actually not the original but a Clone created by the Alchemax corporation using spliced DNA from the original Black Cat, the super-villain Tigra, The Vanisher, and actual Cat genetic material (yeah, absolutely bonkers). Undoubtedly, the most powerful (and dangerous) version of Black Cat ever seen by Spider-Man, she kept her memories of the original Felicia Hardy during the cloning process, so she knows about Peter, and has feelings for him.

  When encountering a time traveler Spider-Man out of his timeline (he is dead in her own reality) she decides to follow him, but when learning about the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane, she becomes enraged and obsessed and attempts to thwart Peter's plans to return to his reality. Alchemax used some interesting methods to keep her bound to the building as a prime security guard: they genetically imprinted Agoraphobia on her, so she is afraid of going outside, making her the perfect company pet. She is powerful, though, and when Spider-Man faces her, she displays not only the ability to teleport but greatly enhanced superhuman abilities, almost on par with him. Considered the most "R Rated" version of the character, this alternate universe Black Cat is a tough foe to beat, and her teleportation ability makes her even more annoying.

  In this reality, Felicia Hardy and Peter Parker barely had any kind of relationship previous to her graduation from high school, where she was one of the top cheerleaders, and had great academic results, while also living the ideal life surrounded by luxury and comfort. After she graduated, and due to mysterious reasons, she disappeared and went into secluded training, allegedly, to follow her father's footsteps. She trained to the point of perfection in her infiltration and acrobatic abilities, as well as stealth skills. When she reappeared years later, she did as the Black Cat, a notorious criminal and mercenary leader who Spider-Man faced after the Oscorp Cross-Species plague incident. This version of Black Cat is notoriously more cunning and tries to play Spidey for a fool on more than one occasion.

  She also becomes quite obsessed with Spider-Man, outsmarting him several times, and even managing to evade the law by being declared "mentally ill," and secluded to a mental health institute. This version also undergoes a series of experiments that grant her increased strength and speed (much like the original version of the Black Cat), and tries to face Spider-Man again but is defeated. During the chase for Kingpin, Black Cat turns to Spider-Man's side and confesses that she is actually "in love" with him and also reveals the villain's true identity: Wilson Fisk. In the end, she escapes once more, after begging Spider-Man to stay by her side and live far from the violence in NY City, but Spider-Man rejects her. She bids Spidey farewell, telling him to look after her when he wishes to get some "excitement" outside his regular superheroic activities. This version drifts away from the original character's design with a combat-suit-like costume, with some cool eyepieces that resemble anti-flashbang goggles, but that is what makes her even more appealing. A great version of the character.

 <p>
  In terms of popularity, the Black Cat from
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2 The Movie
  </em>
  game far exceeds all its alternate versions. Voiced over by the legendary Holly Fields, she has some of the most notoriously spicy dialogues with her universe's Spider-Man, which is none other than Tobey McGuire's version of the character. The story where she appears happens between the first and second movies and serves as a "connection" between the two stories.

 <p>
  This version of the character doesn't seem too fond of other criminals, as she openly collaborates with Spider-Man to beat Shocker and other minor villains. We could say that she shows a more "benign" side to Spider-Man, who she clearly tries to impress. In the comics located in the same universe, Black Cat also openly pursues Spider-Man as a romantic interest, and she is seen preparing a romantic dinner on the rooftops. Something that only two other versions of the character did: The one from Earth-71002 and the Earth-616 Black Cat, which are considered canon-accurate. It is a shame that we didn't get to witness this character debuting in an actual Spider-Man movie, since it would have been just what Tobey's Spider-Man needed to become complete.

  The maximum level cap in
  <strong>
   <em>
    7 Days To Die
   </em>
  </strong>
  is level 300. While some mods increase the level cap, reaching level 300 is still a huge challenge. While most actions will reward the player with some XP, they must work hard to generate enough XP to level up quickly.

 <p>
  Early on, players will level up relatively quickly. But after around level 50, the speed at which players level up dramatically decreases. However, players can do a few things to speed up the leveling-up process. While it will still be a rather time-consuming task, doing things efficiently can dramatically speed up the process.

  Upgrading blocks is something that every player will do. Whether the player is upgrading wood, cobblestone, or concrete,
  <strong>
   they receive a decent amount of XP just for upgrading blocks
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  The better the block, the more XP the player will get. So, if the player is upgrading concrete to steel, they will get more XP when compared to upgrading wood cubes to wood blocks. However, players will still get a fair amount of XP for upgrading the lowest-quality blocks.

 <p>
  If the player spends a day or so gathering resources, then they can spend the night placing and upgrading blocks. If the player gets hold of a nail gun, then they can upgrade blocks much faster, making the whole process more efficient.

  Once the player is in a position where they have some Dukes to spare, it's worth stocking up on Grandpa's Learnin' Elixir. This drink grants the player a 20% boost to their XP gain for 6 minutes. This beverage can be purchased from drinks vending machines that are located in trader settlements and inside various POIs.

  While it is fairly pricey, once the player has read a total of 80 Home Cooking Weekly magazines, they can craft this buff at their base. The cost of crafting Grandpa's Learnin' Elixir can be seen below:

  Every piece of armor has its special effect. Some pieces increase the amount of loot players find, reduce the damage taken from zombies, and more. One of the best armor pieces in
  <em>
   7 Days To Die
  </em>
  is Nerd Goggles. This funny-looking headpiece grants the player a boost to their XP gain. This boost lasts until the player takes off the goggles.

 <p>
  Depending on the level of the goggles,
  <strong>
   the XP boost ranges from 2% for level 1 goggles to 20% for level 6 goggles
  </strong>
  . Nerd Goggles can be used alongside other XP boosts like Grandpa's Learnin' Elixir, making it great for horde nights or when upgrading blocks.

 <p>
  Spikes are great for slowing down and even killing enemies. While they are powerful, there is one major drawback that comes with using them:
  <strong>
   players don't get XP for zombies killed by spikes
  </strong>
  . Instead of using spikes, players should try to set up turrets instead. Most turrets will award the player some XP for kills.

 <p>
  During the early stages, players will probably need to use spikes to prevent enemies from tearing down their base during horde night. But, as soon as the player has upgraded their walls, it is a good idea to replace spikes with turrets. Alternatively, the player could design a base that will funnel enemies through a narrow walkway, allowing the player to pick off zombies one by one.

  Doing missions for the traders is a big part of
  <em>
   7 Days To Die
  </em>
  .
  <em>
  </em>
  They are fun and lucrative and allow players to earn a decent amount of XP. While they are pretty good as standard, there is something that players can do to make missions even more profitable. Instead of activating a rally point to begin a mission, head straight inside the POI and clear it out. Then, once the building has been cleared and looted, head back outside and activate the rally point. This will cause the building and all of its contents to respawn, meaning that
  <strong>
   the player can clear the same place twice
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Not only is this great for getting double the amount of XP, but it is also ideal for those looking to increase their stockpile, as they will be able to loot the same building twice. It's worth noting that this isn't that useful for buried treasure missions. But for all missions that involve the player entering a POI, this method is fantastic for earning lots of extra XP.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  is by no means an easy game, especially for players without any
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  experience. Understanding all the mechanics, resources, actions, and more takes time. Certain classes or subclasses further complicate this with too much new stuff going on for beginners. Even leveling up can be difficult with all the choices to be made.

 <p>
  Thankfully, there are also a number of beginner-friendly subclasses in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  that use basic actions and attacks. These simpler subclasses often have passive effects, instead of giving players tonnes of action options that can be overwhelming. The
  <strong>
   best
   <em>
    BG3
   </em>
   subclasses for beginners
  </strong>
  also tend to be more tanky, making mistakes less punishing.

 <p>
  If players want to sit back and deal damage from safety with a bow or crossbow, then the Ranger class is certainly the best option. When it comes to
  <em>
   BG3's
  </em>
  Ranger subclasses, the Hunter is the simplest, making it perfect for a first playthrough. Instead of taming beasts or trying to figure out the stealth mechanics, a Hunter simply focuses on dealing more damage, typically with ranged attacks.

 <p>
  For example, at Level 3, they can select the Colossus Slayer passive, which makes their attacks deal more damage against any enemy who isn't at max HP. Level 7 provides passive bonuses to defense, and then, at Level 11, Hunters gain access to an incredibly fun Volley attack which is easy to use. It should also be noted that both Rangers and Hunter Rangers are still capable melee fighters, and by taking the Ranger Knight option at Levels 1, 6, or 10, players will be able to wear Heavy Armor to become harder to kill.

  Barbarians in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  are all about raging, brute force, and dealing as much damage as possible. For the most direct enhancement of this play style, players can choose the Berserker subclass at Level 3. This will grant them an extra weapon attack or throw as a bonus action, and if they are raging and have already used Reckless Attack, their additional attack is highly likely to hit.

 <p>
  At Level 6, a Berserker will no longer be able to be Charmed or Frightened while raging, meaning they can keep on attacking. In terms of the standard Barbarian features, players should always have plenty of health potions at the ready as Barbarians take almost as much damage as they dish out.

  Warlocks are said to be the easiest spellcasters to use in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , due to the fact that their spells refresh with every Short Rest. They also have access to one of the best Cantrips in BG3, Eldritch Blast, which can be used again and again for free.

 <p>
  When choosing a Warlock subclass at Level 1, the simplest option for new players is The Fiend. This is in part thanks to a nice little passive that rewards the player with Temporary HP after they slay an enemy. The additional spells acquired via The Fiend are also more straightforward to use, making it one of the easiest subclasses in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  ​​​​​​. At Level 10, Fiends gain Resistance to any damage type, and this can be changed on each Short Rest.

  As tanky supports, Clerics are consistently regarded as one of the most beginner-friendly classes in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  , and the Life Domain subclass, all about healing, is arguably the simplest. For example, from Level 1, every heal they perform will restore bonus health. At Level 2, Life Domain Clerics gain access to the Preserve Life action, which is a large AOE heal.

 <p>
  Furthermore, from Level 6 onwards, players will automatically heal themselves whenever healing an ally, meaning it's even easier to stay alive. This is in addition to being able to wear Heavy Armor, and Clerics often wielding the best shields in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  . Other bonuses of the Life Domain subclass include access to even more supportive spells that are easy to understand and use.

 <p>
  The entire Fighter class is designed for beginners, as well as those who simply love swinging a sword and dealing lots of damage. However, while all three of the Fighter subclasses are relatively simple, the Champion subclass takes the cake. The first bonus for Champions simply makes crits easier to hit, and it is passive effects like this that players can expect throughout.

 <p>
  In fact, players will find that when leveling up, they practically have no decisions to make, something which is true for most of the Fighter class. At Level 10, they will need to choose an additional fighting style, but the effects are once again passive, such as granting +2 to certain attacks. With all these bonuses, players will deal plenty of damage with their weapon of choice while being able to wear
  <em>
   BG3's
  </em>
  best Heavy Armor and having high health as a Fighter.

  </em>
  , usually abbreviated as
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  , is another game by
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  developer, HoYoverse. However, unlike
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  is set in a different universe outside the Honkaiverse.
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  storyline takes place in New Eridu, a futuristic metropolis where people live after surviving the apocalypse called the Hollows. This disaster generates anomalies in the dimensions and causes monsters called Ethereal to appear, creating an immense number of casualties within humanity.

  In
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , players are renowned Proxy under the code name
  <strong>
   Phaethon
  </strong>
  . However, due to unexpected circumstances, the protagonist must scrap all their hard work and rebuild their reputation under a new alias. A Proxy is someone who guides Hollow Raiders inside the Hollow. Phaethon does their job by syncing with a Bangboo and entering the Hollow, leading the Hollow Raiders from the safety of their headquarters.

 <p>
  Bangboo is an AI device originally made to help people evacuate from the Hollow apocalypse. However, after the residents established stability, Bangboo is now used for more diverse roles to help in daily life. In
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  , players can get Bangboo by "pulling" them from a banner, but unlike with characters, this act will not cost precious Polychromes. This means the resource can be used for better purposes, such as getting new Agents or refilling Battery (energy). Other than through daily missions and quests, players can also earn goodies from redeem codes. Therefore, this article will serve as a place where Proxies can check for new
  <strong>
   <em>
    ZZZ
   </em>
   codes
  </strong>
  whenever they become available.

   : ZZZ 1.1 brings three exciting characters from the NEPS faction; Qingyi, Jane Doe, and Seth. The three are in the same faction as Zhu Yuan, although only Qingyi truly synergizes with her. Meanwhile, Jane Doe and Seth have their niche, which is around Anomaly and Disorder. Unfortunately, despite the excitement within the Pubsec, not many ZZZ codes are available in version 1.1, so players must grind the game if they wish to get everyone.

 <p>
  For a game with the word "fantasy" in its name, it should be no surprise that the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy
   </em>
  </strong>
  series has featured some of the winged, fire-breathing beasts. In fantasy mythos, dragons are usually considered at the top of the food chain, master predators, and nigh-undefeatable, except perhaps by a team of plucky underdogs with a fabled sword of justice or magical stone of friendship.

 <p>
  Naturally, with such a long history of including powerful demi-gods and world-eating monsters, it stands to reason that there should be some sizable dragons flying about its multiverse. Whether it's to look upon the glory of a majestic tail and wingspans or to wonder how much of an explosion the fall of a gigantic wyrm would create upon being slain,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  has been home to some of the largest and most awe-inspiring dragons ever imagined.

  The last hunt side quest in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 12
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Yiazmat, is the most dangerous elite mark available on the board, in part due to his immense size, which grants him an unfathomably high vitality. He can be tracked down to a colosseum in the Ridorana Cataract, where Vaan, Balthier, Ashe, and the rest of the party will need to chip down through his armor and work their way through his 50 million hit points before it can be crossed off the bounty board.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 12
  </em>
  bestiary considers him one of the gods of dragons and even implies that he was big and powerful enough to kill his own creator. Yiazmat's claws are about the size of a hume, and were he not crazed, as the bestiary described, he could easily climb out of the colosseum to escape in the rare event of being faced with three level 60+ heroes equipt with god-tier gear and anti-Yiazmat gambits.

  Shinryu, along with Omega, is one of the most powerful entities in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 5
   </strong>
  </em>
  . The sizes of monsters and enemies in pixel-era
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games can be hard to establish given that the party is usually depicted in chibi form, some artistic license is taken with enemy models, and there is only so much space on the battle screen. However, one hint of this secret
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  super-boss' size (in addition to his reputation as the "ultimate dragon") is one of his stealable items: his whisker.

 <p>
  If the party can rip just one strand of his nostril hairs out, they lay claim to the most powerful whip in the game, and the party can steal any number of dragon's whiskers from him. If one of his hairs can make a full-sized weapon, then it is fairly easy to imagine the size of the beast it was taken from. Additionally, Shinryu's attacks have a "natural disaster" theme, including his most powerful, party-wiping "tidal wave" attack.

  With the exception of the second game in the series, Bahamut has been with
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  in every numbered game, and the fans have been with him. In
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  , this iconic mainstay had not one, not two, but three incarnations, each literally rising higher into the sky than the last. With its immense body and even larger wingspan, Bahamut ZERO is so large that it would likely not survive within the planet's gravity, especially given its long limbs.

 <p>
  As such, it delivers its devastating energy attack from outside the planet's atmosphere. Not only is Bahamut ZERO larger than its draconic brethren, but so is the item required to summon it: the Huge Blue Materia, a super-condensed form of regular summoning materia that grants its user immense power. As one of the largest summons in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  , it makes sense that its summoning materia would match its stature.

  The First Brood is a collection of dragons of varying sizes that include some of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </em>
  </strong>
  's most important dragons (names that have appeared throughout the series): Tiamat, Nidhogg, Hraesvelgr, Vrtra, Azdaja, and before their demises, Ratatoskr and the true Bahamut (but not his twisted Primal imitation). The gigantic siblings were sired by Midgardsormr, a legendary being as long as he is large (at least to hume-sized creatures). Any one of his children could flatten a small city by rolling over. However, Midgardsormr has them beaten on length alone.

 <p>
  Although Midgardsormr is long enough to choke even the Garlean Empire's largest and most powerful airship, his true size is difficult to ascertain, especially given he (and his brood) shift in size depending on the amount of aether they have stored in their body (and the fact that Midgardsormr can shrink and grow at will). At full strength, it is possible that the father of dragons could outsize the usherer of the 7th Umbral Era, Primal Bahamut, even at the height of his power (and not just in a stretching contest).

  Bahamut's appearance (while fully alive and whole) in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  was brief but incredibly impactful. Moments before being caged and defeated by Louisoix Leveilleur's binding light, the elder primal shattered his orbital prison, the one that the whole of Eorzia had believed to be a minor moon, and used his Teraflare attack to carve out Eorzia's new face, ushering in a calamity and the seventh age (and patch 2.0, "A Realm Reborn").

  The Bahamut that remade the world in blasts of fire is larger than any previously seen, and in "Heavansward," it is revealed that this Bahamut is a dark and vengeful primal incarnation of a more benevolent dragon called Bahamut, the Dawn Wyrm. It is later revealed that this Primal Bahamut survived, albeit in a severed state, in the Binding Coil of Bahamut, in which his massive torn wing and claw can be found. A miniaturized form of Bahamut, Prime, still large and looming, can be fought and beaten within.

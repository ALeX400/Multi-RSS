      <title>Grand Theft Auto 6's Music Controversy with Heaven 17 Explained</title>

  Music has always been a core part of the Grand Theft Auto experience. From the iconic 80s tracks in Vice City to the diverse radio stations in each new release, licensed songs help shape the atmosphere of the game. Players often spend hours driving through GTA's vast worlds, and the real-world music playing on the in-game radio adds to the immersion. For Grand Theft Auto 6, fans are eagerly anticipating another rich catalog of songs, but controversy has now emerged around how Rockstar compensates artists for their contributions.

      <title>Hades 2’s Story Approach Could Come Back to Bite It</title>

  <em>

  's early access launched earlier in 2024. The early access gives players access to dozens of hours of content, giving a glimpse of a
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  game that is far bigger than its predecessor. While this is an incredible amount of growth,
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  's early access runs the risk of showing too much of its story within its EA itself, rather than leaving the best parts of it to its full release.

  Early access typically leaves much of the game's story unavailable to players, so that it can be experienced by everyone for the first time once the game has its full release. For example,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's early access only included Act One, leaving the events of the rest of the game a mystery. In comparison, unless there is a major story twist,
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  's early access has only excluded one final boss fight. While this strategy plays a role in building hype for
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  's full release, it also removes much of the anticipation and surprises it would have had for players if they had remained a mystery.

  <em>
   Hades

  also went through a period of early access before its full launch but left much of its storyline as a mystery that could only be experienced in the full release of the game.
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  follows Melinoe through two different narrative paths, with the first being the Underworld path to Chronos, the Titan of Time, and the second on the surface, towards Mount Olympus. The Underworld storyline includes a complete final boss fight with Chronos, the final antagonist of
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  , while the surface path's final boss has yet to be revealed in early access.

 <p>
  While the surface path's final boss hasn't been revealed yet, the main problem with Hades 2's early access is the premature reveal of the Underworld's final boss. While
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  's marketing and early story make it clear that Chronos is Melinoe's greatest enemy, and is likely her final obstacle, Chronos' appearance in early access may mean that Supergiant Games showed its hand too soon. Instead, if Melinoe's path had ended when she enters Tartarus, leaving the final bosses for both the surface and Underworld a mystery, players would be left guessing as to where Chronos would appear.

 <p>
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  's early access shows that it's a much bigger game than
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  , with dozens of hours of content even if it excluded all of Tartarus' content and subsequent conversations regarding it from early access.
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  takes the best gameplay mechanics, story tropes and themes, and art of
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  , and expands upon them all to make them arguably better than its predecessor, all while creating some great new mechanics of its own.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1092} -->

 <p>
  This approach to
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  means that even early access has a longer runtime than
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  . Melinoe and the NPCs she encounters have more lines, there are far more unique NPC encounters in
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  than Zagreus encounters in the previous game, and having two separate paths for Melinoe to take essentially doubles the amount of content.

 <p>
  Leaving out Chronos wouldn't have hobbled
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  's early access because it already has so much content for players to explore. As the final battle with Chronos has been revealed, there may not be much left to reveal for the full release of
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  , unless Supergiant Games has a surprise in store for players. Chronos may be a red herring, either with another, worse, villain waiting in the wings to be discovered on the surface path, or Chronos may become redeemable, with a significant amount of post-story content for
  <em>
   Hades 2
  </em>
  that brings back Melinoe's family and the familiar cast of characters from
  <em>
   Hades

  .

      <title>Legacy Characters Potentially Returning in Resident Evil 9 Opens the Door to One Obvious Opportunity</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 9
   </em>
  </strong>
  is on the horizon with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  director Koshi Nakanishi returning to helm the project. Since so few details have been made public about this upcoming entry, the rumor mill has been churning. Besides
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  supposedly shifting to an open-world structure for the first time in the series, another highly speculated aspect of the game has been its protagonist.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  wrapping up Ethan Winters' narrative in a fairly definitive manner,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  will almost certainly move on to a different protagonist — but not necessarily a new one. Many players are theorizing that this upcoming entry could see multiple fan favorite characters coming back into the fold. Alongside demand for characters like Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield to return to the series, one supposed leak suggested that Leon Kennedy is a playable protagonist in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  . A comeback for these iconic characters could provide the perfect opportunity for a popular feature from two of the franchise's more unpopular games to also return: co-op.

  Though the franchise has tried to produce fully multiplayer experiences with 2016's
  <em>
   Umbrella Corps
  </em>
  and 2022's
  <em>
   Resident Evil RE:Verse
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  has proven time and time again that narrative campaigns are both a strength and a necessity for this series. However,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  — despite being critically unpopular — proved that an engaging middle ground could exist. Both games were buoyed by story modes that could be played entirely solo or as a two-player cooperative experience. Having multiple returning characters in the next mainline entry might give this co-op functionality a satisfying venue for redemption.

 <h3 id="why-co-op-is-a-valid-route-for-resident-evil-9">
  Why Co-op is a Valid Route for Resident Evil 9
 </h3>
 <p>
  A campaign with co-op integration could absolutely work for
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  from a gameplay perspective. A slower, more atmospheric game like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  might not make as much sense for a social experience. However, the faster pacing and combat mechanics of
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  remake are incorporated in such a way that would allow for a second player to be thrown into the mix without being disruptive.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1081} -->

 <p>
  Even when taking the inherent horror of these games into consideration,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  proved that two players fighting for their lives against infected hordes can certainly rack up some tension. As was the case with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  's co-op campaign, single-player would still be an option for those looking for a more immersive experience. The other co-op character could become a companion NPC. Though
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  struggled with its companion AI, the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  remake proved Capcom could successfully implement sidekick followers like Ashley and Luis.

  How Returning RE Characters Could Benefit From Co-op
 </h3>
 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  does indeed bring back multiple fan favorite characters, a cooperative campaign would be an engaging way to do so. Seeing two previous protagonists team up for a new story lays the groundwork for some excellent fan service. Having characters like Leon and Jill working together, for example — not just in a cutscene but across an entire narrative — could provide unique character interactions, fun banter, and higher stakes for the plot. It also opens the door for a deeper exploration of previous games by allowing two characters with traumatic connections to the Raccoon City saga to dredge up and compare their experiences.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1213} -->

 <p>
  Additionally, by having the game be co-op, it ensures that fans get a satisfying and equitable amount of screentime for both characters. Not only that, but fans would then get to share in this experience by playing with each other. As a culmination of both the newest entries and the recent wave of remakes,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 9
   </em>
  </strong>
  has the chance to give players that
  <em>
   Infinity War
  </em>
  -esque crossover that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  attempted but failed to provide.

  Apart from the main Campaign missions,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

  currently has six bonus PvE missions that challenge players in new ways and reward them generously. The first PvE Operation is
  <strong>
   Inferno,
  </strong>
  which introduces you to
  <em>

  In Inferno, you team up with two other Astartes and set out on a mission to detonate bombs in the Promethium Refinery and then face off against a Tyranid swarm. This guide will walk you through the steps and help you complete the Inferno mission in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2

 <p>
  Inferno’s first objective is to reach the Astra Militarum Camp somewhere in the jungle. To reach this camp, you'll need to fight through small groups of Tyranids. The best approach would be to engage the Tyranid Warriors at melee range and parry their attacks to create windows for gun strikes.

  When you reach the narrow bridge area, take down the Tyranids there but prevent them from calling for reinforcements. If the Tyranids manage to call for backup, you’ll have to eliminate dozens of enemies and a Zoanthrope duo. In this case, just use a Finisher move to instantly kill nearby Hormagaunts.

  The next main objective in Inferno is to get to the Promethium Refinery. The fight towards the Promethium Refinery can be challenging, especially when playing solo or on higher difficulty settings. Make sure your team is fully equipped, reloaded, and in good health before taking on any Tyranids.

 <p>
  A neat trick to eliminating most of the Hormagaunts instantly is to focus on defeating the Hive Warrior. As you get closer to the refinery, be prepared for an ambush by additional Tyranid Warriors and
  <strong>

  Once inside the facility, your team's objective is to protect a set of generators from waves of Tyranid attacks. Most of the enemies in the first wave will be Hormagaunts and Warriors, which are rather easy to eliminate. After clearing this wave, an Extremis enemy will appear in the refinery.

  By this point, the bomb should have been deployed. You can leave this facility and enter the next room. Inside, you'll find more Tyranids, including one that will try to summon reinforcements. Eliminate these Tyranids and take the elevator at the end of the path to get to the detonation controls outside.

  A small group of Tyranids will break off from the main swarm and attack your squad by climbing the walls in front of the refinery. Use grenades and Chainswords to eliminate these Hormagaunts. Make sure to eliminate the ranged Tyranid Warriors first, as they are the most dangerous to your squad.

      <title>Astro Bot is Selling Very Well</title>

    Key Takeaways
   </h3>
   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      Astro Bot's week one sales in the US were very strong, as the PlayStation platformer ranked second in unit sales across physical and digital formats.
     </li>
     <li>
      Over in the UK, Astro Bot's launch sales were 21% higher than Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart's debut, and it became the second fastest-selling platformer after Mario in the last 10 years.
     </li>
     <li>
      Since Astro Bot was developed in three years by a smaller team, its budget and profitability threshold are most likely lower than PlayStation's more expensive AAA first-party titles.
     </li>
    </ul>

  Some recently published data shows that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Astro Bot
   </em>
  </strong>
  has recorded very impressive sales during its first week in the US and UK. Although
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  accrued glowing reviews across the board, its commercial performance has been hard to judge as PlayStation hasn't released any official sales numbers for the Team Asobi platformer yet.

  Fans were alarmed a few days ago when Japanese sales data suggested a soft launch for
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , with the game only selling 12,700 physical copies at retail. Many assumed that the recent PS5 price hike in Japan was the reason behind
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's somewhat muted commercial reception, as the console also took a nosedive on the sales charts. However, since this number doesn't include digital sales, it isn't indicative of broader sales trends for
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  .

  Now, newly published sales data from US tracking firm Circana's executive director, Mat Piscatella, shows that
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's week one sales are much better than some may have expected. Piscatella revealed in a recent Bluesky post that for the week ending September 7,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  ranked second in unit sales across both physical and digital formats. The top spot was claimed by
  <em>
   NBA 2K25
  </em>
  , but considering how popular sports games are among the more casual players,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's sales performance is very strong. Interestingly, the
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  DualSense controller was also the top-selling accessory during the same timeframe.

  However, the good news doesn't end there, as GamesIndustry.biz's Christopher Dring remarked on Twitter that
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  managed a "solid" launch in the UK as well. Not only did
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's sales track 21% ahead of 2021's
  <em>
   Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  , but Dring also confirmed in a follow-up tweet that
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  is the fastest-selling original platformer IP outside of
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  in the last decade, beating the likes of iconic names like
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  , and more. Overall,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  was only toppled by
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's sales performance in the UK, which is quite respectable.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  was made by a 65-person team and took three years to develop, its budget is almost certainly nowhere near the hundreds of millions that many other PlayStation first-party games cost. Therefore,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's bar for profitability should also be much lower. Hopefully, Sony is pleased internally with how
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  's sales are holding up globally and considers investing in more small and creatively dense games like it. An
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  sequel may have also been confirmed, but only time will tell what Team Asobi has planned.

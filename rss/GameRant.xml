  Smilegate, the publisher behind games such as
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  , has joined hands with
  <strong>
   Absurd Ventures
  </strong>
  to publish Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser's upcoming AAA game. Established in 2021, Absurd Ventures is a multimedia firm founded by Houser after leaving Rockstar Games in 2020.

  Having spent around three decades in the gaming industry, Houser is a bona fide veteran who boasts an impressive portfolio, mainly thanks to his work at Rockstar Games. At his former organization, he contributed as one of the key creative minds behind mega-hits such as
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  . Back in May 2024, the first signs of Absurd Ventures working on an open-world action-adventure game emerged, signaling Houser's return to game development. During the same year, Smilegate's investment in the studio's projects was also announced.

  Smilegate to Publish Upcoming Absurd Ventures Game
 </h2>
 <p>
  Now, over a year later, Smilegate revealed that it was publishing a AAA game set in Absurd Ventures' A Better Paradise universe. The project was described as an open-world, sci-fi, action-adventure title that was in "early development." Notably, Dan Houser is writing for the game while also serving as its creative director. The ex-
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  lead is collaborating with Lazlow Jones and Michael Unsworth, two important figures from his Rockstar Games days, on this project. Moreover, it was shared that the game's senior developers comprised of former employees of renowned studios, including Bungie, Treyarch, Insomniac Games, and more. Reflecting on the nature of the game, Houser said that it was "an opportunity to go somewhere entirely different" and could be an "entirely new adventure" for players. The forthcoming game is the third project announced in the A Better Paradise universe, alongside 2024's audio series titled
  <em>
   A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath
  </em>
  and its novel adaptation coming out later in 2025.

  Smilegate's partnership with Absurd Ventures appears to be an encouraging sign for the in-development game, given the South Korean publisher's experience with handling popular titles such as
  <em>
   Crossfire
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  . Moreover, the involvement of Unsworth, together with whom Houser wrote the award-winning
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , could certainly be seen as a major boost. Keeping in mind that Absurd Ventures is concurrently working on a few different projects, including an action-comedy game teased in January, it may be some time before more updates about the aforementioned project are revealed.

  Earlier this year, another game backed by an ex-Rockstar Games lead, called
  <em>
   MindsEye
  </em>
  , rolled out and instantly bombed. Having seen such a disastrous launch unfold, fans of Houser's work would hope that Absurd Ventures learns from
  <em>
   MindsEye
  </em>
  's mistakes and avoids making the same. However, only time will tell if that will be enough to replicate some of the success experienced by Houser during his stint at his previous company.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Battlefield 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  will use bots to fill match lobbies when there aren't enough human players, EA devs have confirmed. The upcoming shooter has promised many changes to right the wrongs of its disappointing previous release, but it's not changing everything, and some returning elements may not be what all fans want to hear. The return of bots to
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  could be one such move.

  So far, fans have seemed largely excited about the direction in which the franchise is going. Despite not even being out yet,
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  is already topping sales charts on both Steam and PS5, and many early impressions refer to it as a return to the former glory of
  <em>
   Battlefield 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4.
  </em>
  Still, there are some elements of the game that players may not want to see return.

 <h2 id="battlefield-6-will-use-bots-to-fill-multiplayer-matches">
  Battlefield 6 Will Use Bots to Fill Multiplayer Matches
 </h2>
 <p>
  In a Q&amp;A session reported by GNN,
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  Development Director Anna Narrevik explained that when multiplayer servers aren't full, AI will fill the gap. That's nothing new for first-person shooters, or even the
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  series, as
  <em>
   2042
  </em>
  used bots this same way. However, it is a largely unpopular way to manage matchmaking, despite how prevalent it is across the genre. Numerous
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  fans criticized
  <em>
   Warzone Mobile
  </em>
  's use of bots after it introduced them, saying matches contained far too many AI players, leading to lopsided and unfulfilling victories for teams with more humans.

  Gameplay Designer Jac Carlsson followed up by explaining that new players can use custom modes in the game's Portal mode to improve, making AI less of a necessity to lower the barrier for entry. That comment makes it sound like
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  won't rely on bots too heavily, but it's difficult to say for sure without more specifics on how the system works. Narrevik said the main goal of the game's matchmaking is to allow as many players as possible to play at once, which may be less of a hurdle with
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  's rumored return to 64-player matches than
  <em>
   2042
  </em>
  's 128-player rounds, but bots still pop up in smaller matches in other games.

 <p>
  If EA manages to hit its goal of 100 million
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  players, there may be enough people on its servers, and bots may not be as frequent an appearance as they are in other titles. Still, their inclusion is not a popular move. How that will affect people's perception of the game going forward will only become clear once the game is out in full.

      <title>Original Guitar Hero Developer is Making a Comeback After 15 Years</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/guitar-hero-developer-redoctane-games-comeback/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The studio responsible for the original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Guitar Hero
   </em>
  </strong>
  , RedOctane Games, has recently announced its comeback after 15 years. With over 25 million units sold, the
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  franchise was arguably one of the most popular rhythm series ever made, and many veteran gamers will likely be happy to see the return of the studio that started it.

  Originally focused on creating game accessories for popular rhythm games, RedOctane Games was started by Kai and Charles Huang in 1999. The company gained prominence in 2005 with the release of the first
  <em>
   Guitar
  </em>
  <em>
   Hero
  </em>
  , which became a huge hit. Soon after the release of
  <em>
   Guitar Hero 2
  </em>
  in 2006, RedOctane was acquired by Activision, where it collaborated with Neversoft on the franchise. In 2010, Activision shut down RedOctane.

  Guitar Hero Developer HighOctane Returns After 15 Years
 </h2>
 <p>
  Now, RedOctane has been revived after 15 years, with Simon Ebejer as the studio’s head. Ebejer has previously worked on
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  while at Neversoft, and founders Kai and Charles Huang are said to be on the “special advisory board” of the company. It has been confirmed in a blog post, however, that RedOctane’s next game will not be
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  , but “something new,” which makes sense considering the studio does not own the IP.

 </div>
 <p>
  Not much is officially known about the upcoming game, however, except that it will be a rhythm game likely inspired by
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  . Peripherals are not guaranteed, but considering RedOctane’s expertise with them, it would not be surprising to see the game employing them. The title also does not have an official release date, so gamers should wait for more information before getting too excited.

 <p>
  Despite
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  not having an official mainline game in a decade after the release of
  <em>
   Guitar Hero Live
  </em>
  in 2015, it’s fair to say that the series is still very popular. Earlier this year, for example, the franchise was in the spotlight after a Twitch streamer passed out while playing Through the Fire and Flames on Guitar
  <em>
   Hero
  </em>
  during a 200% speed challenge.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few months ago, the
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  franchise also appeared in the middle of a controversy, as a
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  mobile ad made with AI enraged some gamers. However, it was soon revealed that the game teased by the ads did not exist, and it was only part of a market research campaign by Activision to test the franchise’s popularity. Hopefully, RedOctane will be able to deliver a proper game that will help long-time fans scratch the itch for a
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  -inspired title.

      <title>Battlefield 6's Beta Server Issues Are Already Sounding the Alarm</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/battlefield-6-beta-early-access-server-issues-long-wait-time/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Anticipation is really starting to build for the upcoming beta of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Battlefield 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  , with the event having the potential to be a real watershed moment for the franchise. The title has received a lot of positive feedback through its wide-spanning and ambitious BF Labs playtesting system, creating even more of a positive buzz around its expanded open beta. The recent campaign and multiplayer gameplay reveals for the game were equally well-received, creating a perfect storm that DICE understandably wants to capitalize on.

  The potential success and popularity of
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  's open beta is already being evidenced, with tens of thousands of players already loading the game up despite the beta's early access not starting until August 7. There are already widespread reports of huge player queues as a result of this, creating some worry over how the beta's servers might handle the massive influx of players that
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  will soon see. It is not unusual for massively anticipated titles to face disheartening server issues like this, and DICE needs to ensure that things run as smoothly as possible throughout the beta to really make the most of the opportunity.

  is not set to launch until August 9, marking the first of two consecutive weekends of open beta access. Having said that, many players will have early access to the beta, starting on August 7 until August 8. This is directly tied to players who unlocked early access through Twitch drops, EA Play Pro subscriptions, or Battlefield Labs participation. Despite this early access period facilitating a smaller pool of players compared to the full open beta, a huge level of player engagement is already being seen.

  's beta has already amassed a Steam concurrent player count of around 25,000, with this just consisting of players who are likely getting their in-game settings ready for the upcoming experience. Additionally, players are now starting to report major server queues across most platforms, with queues as high as 50,000 being reported by some fans. This is an excellent indicator of how popular
  <em>

  's beta is going to be, and these playership numbers are only likely to increase dramatically over the coming days.

  The number of players engaging with
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  during its open beta weekends is going to be significantly higher than the upcoming brief early access period, and it would be a real shame for this excitement to be drowned out by matchmaking issues like massive server queues. It seems likely that DICE will be monitoring these recent developments quite closely, with it potentially always being planned to bolster the server availability once the live beta period is active. Regardless, with early access starting so soon, it is understandable that some fans are worried.

  The relationship between DICE and the
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  community has been under a fair amount of strain in recent years. Entries like
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  indicated a real disconnect between the fanbase and the franchise's creative direction, though
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  has marked a real positive turning point in this regard. DICE has already made good on its commitment to taking into account player-generated feedback with
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  , and avoidable server congestion would only damage the positivity that has otherwise surrounded the IP in recent months.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course,
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  is also in a prime position to compete directly against the upcoming
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
  </em>
  , potentially marking a huge turning point in the longstanding rivalry between both franchises. This places even more importance on the
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  beta running smoothly and without serious issue, and a robust server infrastructure is arguably more important than anything else in this regard. It remains to be seen whether the recently reported server issues will extend into the
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  open beta or early access, yet these reports will hopefully be a direct sign for DICE in terms of just how populated the game's servers might be over the coming days.

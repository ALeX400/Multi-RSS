  While it is a relatively cozy crafting and survival game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Towers of Aghasba
   </em>
  </strong>
  separates itself from the genre slightly on account of its challenging combat elements. While players are gathering resources, planting Colossal seeds, and creating ecosystems, they will have to deal with the occasional attack at the hands of the game's Withered creatures.

  While they can be a nuisance, Withered creatures actually hold the key to surviving the hostile regions of Aghasba, which will give you a far better chance of freeing the mainland from the iron grip of the evil forces. If you're looking to expand the game's map and explore all it has to offer, then a knowledge of
  <strong>
   how to get Withered Tar in
   <em>
    Towers of Aghasba
   </em>
  </strong>
  will make the task far easier.

  <strong>
   Withered Tar is a byproduct of Withered enemies
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Towers of Aghasba,
  </em>
  so the key to farming this resource is to seek out and hunt the dark creatures. It is worth noting that Withered Tar will not be dropped by Withered Razi, which look like small spiders, but most of the other Withered beasts will offer it as a reward for slaying them.

  The best way to farm this resource is to
  <strong>
   seek out Withered Zones
  </strong>
  , as this is where Withered are at their most abundant. It can be difficult to hunt them at length, however, as you only have a limited amount of time that you can survive in the zone, unless you harvest the Clear Sky plants or take Withered Antidotes. Regardless of whether you're in the Withered Zones or not, you can acquire Withered Tar from the following creatures, although it is not limited to them :

  Once you have downed each enemy, they will drop a bag, which may contain the Tar. Loot is randomly generated and based on luck, so, while you'll get it most of the time, it may not be available for every enemy you hunt.

 <p>
  While Withered Tar may not be as versatile as more common resources like Kelp or Thatch, it does have a very important primary use. Withered Tar is an essential component, along with Mushroom Caps and Reapershrooms, to Simple Withered Antitodes and Greater Withered Antidotes, respectively. Having these on hand will go a long way to increasing your longevity in hostile Withered Zones.

 <p>
  It is worth noting that you won't be able to make these elixirs until you have built an Alchemy, which will be available in the Midhaven village once you have rebuilt and crossed the Lutoro Bridge. Thankfully, you won't need the potion until you're at this point, as Withered Zones are not accessible until you leave Amani Island and settle in the mainland.

  The enemies get harder with each Stage you complete. For the first two levels, the enemies will move in a specific direction. However, later on, you’ll encounter enemies who will also chase you at high speed. Some levels will also have flying enemies that drop bombs that can kill you or even kill the walking enemies for you.

  Some stages will require you to also unlock several doors to reach the Portal using colored keys found by destroying the stone tiles. You’ll have to use the keys in the correct order to unlock the Portal. For these levels, you don’t have to kill any enemies. However, killing all the enemies will cause the stone tiles with the Keys and Power-Ups to start glowing. So you’ll have an easier time tracking them down.

  The scoring system uses both the time it takes to clear the Stage and the number of enemies killed into account. So, while killing enemies is always fun, it’s best to try and beat the level quickly to get the highest score.

  You get three chances or three Lives in this game mode. Getting hit by an enemy or Bomb will cause you to lose one life. The Power-Ups you’ve picked up so far will spread out all over the Stage, and you’ll have to pick them all up individually.

       The Normal Guards don’t pose much of a challenge in this game mode. They move slowly in a single direction. You can trap them in a corner with a bomb to take them out easily. On later levels, they will drop a bomb occasionally, which you’ll have to avoid.

      <p>
       The next enemy type you’ll encounter will be the Black Guards with two red horns on their helmet. They also have a slow movement speed. However, if you get into their line of sight, they will dash toward you. If you move out of the way, they will keep dashing until they hit a wall and get stunned for a short duration. You can drop a bomb and they will get stunned after dashing into it.

       Yellow Guards are similar to Black Guards in how they chase you. They will also get stunned if you drop a bomb. However, they will also push the bomb forward a tile. Yellow Guards have a higher movement speed compared to the Black Guards.

  While the premise of Spoon Man encounter is simple enough to understand, beating it requires careful timing and strategy. Since you can get hit by your own Bombs, you need to be extra careful when you’re using them. Here are a few tips to help you beat this encounter easily in
  <em>
   Dota 2
  </em>
  :

 <ul>
  <li>
   Learn the enemy movement patterns. Some enemies only move at a straight path while others chase you down aggressively. Use this knowledge to your advantage to set a trap for the enemies.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pick up as many Power-Ups as possible. Since the Power-Ups don’t go away forever, make sure you collect them all if you get hit.
  </li>
  <li>
   Movement speed is your best friend in this game mode. Each Stage will have at least one movement speed boost that you can pick up. So make sure you look for it actively.
  </li>
  <li>
   Be extra careful in stages with the flying enemies. The bombs they drop can also kill other enemies. So, if you manage to stay alive, you can let your enemies take care of each other.
  </li>
  <li>
   In stages with colored Kyes
  </li>
  <li>
   Clear the Stage as fast as possible to rack up the best score. After defeating the enemies, plan your route so that you can collect all Power-Ups and get to the Portal without moving unnecessarily.
  </li>
 </ul>

  The Spoon Man encounter can’t be avoided if you want to play the Crownfall Act 4 to the end. It drops the Spoon Man Token, which is necessary to unlock the Palace section of the map. But that’s not all; achieving a high score in this encounter also nets you other rewards.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Halo
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise has experienced a lot of changes to its core identity and expected content over the years, with the IP perhaps predictably struggling to maintain the huge success and industry presence that it originally carved out through its first few mainline releases. Many of these changes came purely from a desire to innovate and improve on aspects of the franchise's core framework, with other alterations coming from huge shake-ups like the IP's transfer from Bungie to 343 Industries in 2012.

 <p>
  The 343 Industry era of
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  has been divisive to say the least, although some recently released details regarding
  <em>
   Halo 4
  </em>
  suggest that the controversy surrounding the studio's takeover of the franchise could have been significantly worse. Other longstanding franchises have caused uproar through bold creative decisions over the years, such as the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  franchise's decision to recast the voice of Snake, and this same fate was narrowly avoided for Steve Downes' iconic portrayal of
  <em>
   Halo's
  </em>
  Master Chief.

  As the undeniable face of the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise, it is clear to see why so many players rank Master Chief among the most iconic video game protagonists of all time. The Spartan super-soldier has been at the core of the vast majority of
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  releases, being a stoic one-man army in the human race's battle against the Covenant and beyond. Often acting as the major protagonist of most
  <em>

  titles, fans have become deeply familiar with the Chief since his first appearance in 2001's

  Aside from his massive physical size and combat proficiency, a huge part of Master Chief's appeal and longevity can be attributed to his voice, which is used sparingly to offer captivating insights into the Spartan's frame of mind. Master Chief has been voiced by Steve Downes throughout all the character's mainline
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  appearances, with the character now being completely tied to the unforgettable performances that Downes has provided the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise over the years.

  The recasting of any major character is always a point of extreme controversy and division for any fanbase, with the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  IP infamously choosing to move away from David Hayter as the voice of Snake in 2015. With Hayter having been the voice of Snake since 1998, this predictably caused huge amounts of uproar within the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  community, with scrutiny inevitably falling on any future Snake performances due to how inseparable Hayter was with the character in the eyes of many fans.

 <p>
  News recently surfaced that 343 Industries almost began its custody of the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise with what would have been a ground-breaking decision, with the studio very nearly recasting Steve Downes as Master Chief as well as Jen Taylor as Cortana. Jen Taylor also first appeared in the series in 2001 as Master Chief's witty AI companion, and the recasting of Taylor, as well as Downes, would have been an extremely controversial double whammy for the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  community.

 <p>
  Reportedly, the earliest builds of
  <em>
   Halo 4
  </em>
  included recast performances for Master Chief and Cortana, with these roles only being reverted to their original voice actors after significant feedback and confusion from playtesters. The development shift from Bungie to 343 has always been marked as a divisive change for the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  franchise, and this controversy would have been significantly amplified if it came alongside recasts for Master Chief and Cortana as originally intended. Thankfully, the series narrowly avoided the same drama and negative sentiment that the likes of
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  received due to its own high-profile recasts.

      <title>Haunted Chocolatier's Combat Plans Demand One Big Upgrade Over Stardew Valley</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Haunted Chocolatier
   </strong>
  </em>
  's announced focus on combat may warrant one upgrade to the system that was not featured in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's combat system worked fine for that game, the demands of
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  will require a few tweaks to be made. The previous game's combat system is a fine starting point to build off of, with plenty of room to grow. Among the new improvements that could be made, one in particular could expand the combat system in several directions.
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  players could end up having a whole new outlet for creativity with such a change.

 <p>
  The new focus on combat in
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  is sure to shake up the formula that players coming over from
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  would expect. While
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  had combat, most parts of the game did not involve it at all. Unless the player went mining for ore or exploring the Skull Cavern, most of their days would be free of battle. Their other skills, such as farming, foraging, and fishing, were more likely to see extensive use from day to day in-game.
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  sounds like it will shake up that formula, although to what extent will not be known without further information.

  Stardew Valley's Combat Gave Players a Few Options
 </h3>
 <p>
  When it comes to the combat system in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , the game isn't completely bare-bones. There are a couple of different weapon types, including swords, daggers, and clubs. In addition, there are certain enchantments applied to certain weapons and equipment that provide buffs, such as increased speed or defense. Even with that in mind, the combat itself is still quite simple, with each weapon having one basic attack and one special ability. Considering the kind of game that
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  is, it didn't need the deepest combat system. However,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  is likely going to need to make a few significant changes.

 <p>
  A new approach to equipment could be an excellent new customization feature in
  <em>
   H aunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  . In addition to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's enchantments, weapons and armor could have a whole new set of effects. For example, some weapons could come with additional damage types, like fire, ice, or poison. Likewise, some gear could resist those same elements. The game could even include some more fantastical effects on some of its gear, specifically rare gear or gear received as rewards, such as a cursed sword that increases damage both taken and given. With combat becoming more important,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  would benefit heavily from more varied and creative weapons.

  Haunted Chocolatier Can Encourage Many Potential Character Builds

 <p>
  With so many new options at their disposal, players could use
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  's new weapons and armor to create a wide variety of builds. Players could mix and match abilities to devise their own fighting style or go all in on a specific trait. For example, a player could stack enchantments to make a fast hit-and-run fighting style that does low damage, but is extremely evasive. Likewise, they could layer multiple fire resistances to make themselves nearly impervious to burning enemies. Whether it's a setup that they use for the entire game or one made for specific circumstances,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  could give players the tools for many powerful builds.

 <p>
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier

  's combat would be nicely complimented by more intricate gear to use. The supernatural influence of
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  nicely lends itself to the idea of enchanted gear, and the game can make full use of that. If
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  's protagonist is going to be more active in fights, then they will not only need proper gear, but there will need to be enough variety to keep combat exciting. Hopefully,
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  's approach to its combat will give players many opportunities to experiment with all of their options.

  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , players might stumble across a few terrifying secrets that other players might not have known about, or, the thrill seekers out there might want to explore it for themselves.

 <p>
  With so many creepy aspects to the world of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , it’s a good time to take a look at some of the most terrifying components of this Old West world and see just how Arthur Morgan and John Marston stayed so bold in their boots about what they saw.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Most players who have stumbled upon a mangled corpse over by the railroad of Valentine might have found the piece to a map that details the location of the killer, but not many players would have found all the map pieces scattered around the different states. However, those who do can venture into New Hanover, where South of Valentine they can find a burned cabin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, it’s not Lucky’s Cabin itself that players are interested in, but the locked cellar. Inside, players will find an assortment of mutilated victims of the serial killer, along with missing person posters and torturous weapons, all belonging to the deranged Edmund Lowry Jr.

 <p>
  For those brave enough to venture into the Bayou Nwa of Lemoyne, they might find a small curl in the Kamassa River that leads to Bayall Edge, a dainty and derelict little cabin that might seem rotted and discarded on the outside, but the interior is extremely pristine and well kept. In the center is an unfinished painting that proves that someone does indeed live here, and subsequent visits will progress the painting until its final form.
 </p>
 <p>
  The painting is of the Strange Man who John Marston encounters in a supernatural Strangers mission in the original
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  , and if players come here to the finished painting, not only will they see the Strange Man in the mirror, but they will also make a note of the poems etched into the walls that detail Arthur Morgan’s journey.

 <p>
  Head to the abandoned house just West of Van Horn Trading Post in New Hanover and climb through the open window on the second floor to discover a disturbing sight that might have some players quickly leaving the way they came and attempting to burn this place to the ground. Inside the house is the Manmade Mutant, a horrifying creature that was created from a mixture of bears, vultures, pigs, and man.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Manmade Mutant could indeed just be a reference to South Park’s ManBearPig, the implication that a mad scientist is somewhere in New Hanover finding body parts to create a Frankenstein monster-type creature is extremely disturbing, and luckily, this thing remains dead.

  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  It’s best not to venture through the swamps of Lemoyne at night, for when the sun goes down, the Night Folk come out to play. The areas of the Bayou Nwa and Bluewater Marsh are filled with the terrors of the Night Folk, which are essentially cannibals and killers who will roam the swamps in search of lost victims that they can terrorize and mutilate.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s a terrifying thing to be in the swamps at night, and most sane players wouldn’t dare to take a trip out to the swamp so late into the night as to see these monsters at work. However, those who do might want to bring a gun or two, as plenty of traps will be set up to try and make Arthur their latest victim. From hung bodies, screaming victims, and the false cries of weeping women, the Night Folk are not to be encountered alone, or without a decent gun.

 <p>
  Ghosts are an actual thing in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , and players can see one for themselves and even note it in Arthur’s journal upon seeing the apparition of Agnes Dowd in the Bluewater Marsh in foggy weather from 9 PM to 3 AM. While Agnes Dowd won’t harm the player, she will disappear if they get too close, and so players will just have to silently watch her mournful cries and grieving wails for a lover that will never come.
 </p>
 <p>
  Agnes Dowd’s story is truly tragic, as it was a young woman who fell in love with a married man and had his child, all for him to go back to his wife and ignore the poor and young girl, leading to a drop of her sanity and the death of them all from her own murderous hands. Agnes now haunts Bluewater Marsh as punishment, unable to move on from life or grief, and only witnessed by players brave enough to venture through the swamps of Lemoyne at night.

  Saint Denis is a bastion of civilization in

Yet, even in a city such as this, creeps and strangers can be found in abundance, and one such stranger is a literal vampire that stalks the night and leaves ominous writings etched into the walls where his latest victims lay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finding all 5 mysterious writings around Saint Denis will form a pentagram to allow players to find the central spot for the next victim, where players who arrive at midnight will discover a vampire, sucking the blood of his latest victim. Whether this is really a vampire or not is up to interpretation, but the sharp teeth, curled fingers, and pointed ears, indicate that this supernatural being should be shot twice, just to make sure he stays dead.

  The Braithwaite family are a sad lot of old fools stuck in the past, and their feud with the Grays extends to their status as good folk, as Catherine Braithwaite, the lady of the house, has hidden away her youngest daughter in an outhouse behind the Braithwaite Manor so that nobody can see that she has a daughter who is disfigured and mentally ill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Venturing to the outhouse, players can peek inside to see Gertrude for themselves, and even hear her cackling and muttering to herself on repeat. While it’s expected that this is just a poor and unwell girl in a cruel world, some believe that Gertrude is actually possessed and that her sunken skin and ghastly complexion are a result of demonic entities, since the numbers she repeats could allude to the pentagrams of Butcher Creek.

 <p>
  Just North of Emerald Ranch in New Hanover, players can find an abandoned shack, Hani’s Bethel. Inside, players aren’t going to find much in terms of loot but will find a wealth of disturbing bodies, for this appeared to hold a cult. The details of the cult reveal that they have all killed themselves so that their souls can hitch a ride on a spaceship to venture through the stars.
 </p>
 <p>
  While at first, Arthur Morgan can read this and see it as just a bunch of nonsense from a cult, staying inside the cabin at 2 AM will reveal a UFO that appears overhead, shining an ominous green glow from above. If players try to get a good look at the UFO, it will leave, but it’s rather unsettling to know that either the cult was right, or that we are not alone in the universe.

  While the entirety of Class Zero plays the role of heroes in this tale, Ace qualifies as the protagonist because of his importance compared to his classmates. He teams up with his friends to take on several missions against tough opponents, where only the bravest combatants will survive.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the game, Ace and the rest of Class Zero make a brave sacrifice and fight to their very last breath against the Rursan Arbiter. With their phantoma destroyed, Ace takes the responsibility of calming the rest of his classmates as they share a bittersweet farewell before passing on.

  Most people label Vaan as one of the most irritating protagonists of all time. His zeal to become a Sky Pirate can become overbearing after a point, but there's no denying that this headstrong hero is brave in the face of overwhelming opposition every single time.
 </p>
 <p>
  He embodies the classic shonen hero archetype of being brave and standing up to the toughest enemies around without breaking a sweat. While other characters may play a bigger role in the overarching, Vaan still makes an impact as a protagonist by showing his bravery more often than not.

  Unlike the other members of his party, Bartz doesn't have any reason to fight for the world. He's just a wanderer who gets wrapped up in events out of his control, but he decides to embark on this grand adventure anyway without a second thought.
 </p>
 <p>
  This establishes his brave and unyielding personality that eventually wins over Gilgamesh, who boldly declares him as his rival. Bartz becomes the trustworthy leader of the group as the Warriors of Light band together to defeat Exdeath once and for all.

  The first
  <em>

  game was a classic adventure that fans can't get enough of to this day. The four Warriors of Light raise no questions and embark on a grand adventure to save the world without any complaints.
 </p>
 <p>
  They take on tough Elemental Archfiends before traveling back in time to defeat Chaos. It's a series of wild events that most people would shy away from, but the brave Warriors of Light impress everyone with their relentlessness as they succeed in their noble quest after a bold adventure.

  Yuna is one of the bravest characters in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10.
  </em>
  Her willingness to sacrifice herself for a noble cause makes it clear that this summoner wouldn't be fazed by her morbid fate. However, with Tidus offering his support, she and the rest of the gang decided to take on Sin itself and break the cycle of destruction trapping Spira.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even after achieving this goal, Yuna has no problems embarking on another adventure when she finds out that Tidus could be alive. She teams up with Rikku and Paine to take on tough foes once again, and Yuna shows her mettle as a brave protagonist in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10-2
  </em>

  The bravest
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  characters don't just fight the monsters threatening to destroy the world. In Cecil's case, he had to fight the devil within himself and turn into a Paladin before he could focus on the threat of Golbez and the Lunarians.
 </p>
 <p>
  This self-reflection took a valiant effort from Cecil, who conquered the trials of Mt. Ordeals and eventually went to the moon and beat Zemus. His bravery and leadership willed the rest of the heroes to believe in themselves during a climactic final fight where they threw everything at Zeromus to attain victory.

  By all accounts, Tidus had no reason to join Yuna and the group, with his only motivation being to square up with his dad. However, as the story evolves, Tidus realizes the gravity of the threat plaguing Spira and decides to aid Yuna in her cause, only to find out that she was willingly embarking on a pilgrimage that would end with her death.
 </p>
 <p>
  He refuses to accept this fate and convinces the rest of the party to fight against Sin instead of appeasing him with this sacrifice. Even after finding out that he was a dream of the Fayth who had already died at Zanarkand, he refuses to let this cloud his beliefs. He makes a brave stand against Sin, culminating in a tearful goodbye before he leaves Yuna and his friends.

  has officially revealed two new weapons that will arrive in the upcoming update 5.4. Weapons play a major role in every character's build in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  , and just like their users, they can have different levels of rarity, with five-star weapons usually being the most powerful.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every

  banner cycle features a limited weapon banner that runs alongside the character banner. The weapon banner usually includes two signature weapons that belong to the five-star characters featured on the character banner. This means that with each new character release,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  also introduces a new five-star weapon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The recent Special Program event confirmed that Version 5.4 will introduce a new five-star
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  character named Yumizuki Mizuki, who is scheduled to appear in the first banner cycle. This implies that a new five-star catalyst will be offered in the first part of the update.
  <em>

  </em>
  's official social media accounts have revealed more information about two new weapons arriving in the next update. The first weapon is named Sunny Morning Sleep-In, and it will serve as Mizuki's signature weapon, providing a significant amount of Elemental Mastery. The second weapon, Tamayuratei no Ohanashi, is a new four-star polearm that will be offered for free.

  Overall, fans seem to be satisfied with both of these weapons, claiming that they are very flexible and can be used by many different characters in the roster. Even though Mizuki has a couple of unique mechanics, HoYoverse did not make her catalyst niche, and the weapon can be a great choice for many catalyst users in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans have also noticed that HoYoverse intentionally featured Xiangling in the weapon showcase for the new polearm, as it will be a great choice for this Pyro character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . Despite having a lower four-star rarity and being one of the oldest characters in the roster, Xiangling is still the go-to choice for many players who need strong Pyro application on the field.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has confirmed that in order to obtain this polearm and its enhancement materials, players will have to participate in the upcoming event Enchanted Tales of the Mikawa Festival.

 <p>
  After many months of complaints from both game developers and
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5
  </strong>
  owners, Sony has seemingly begun delisting some of the low-effort spam games that have been infesting the PlayStation Store. While plenty of "bad" PlayStation 5 games appear on the PS Store regularly, these spam games are often low-effort with very little content and churned out much more frequently than other titles. This has resulted in the PS Store being overrun with low-quality games, which has become bad news for both developers and players.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the use of AI continues to be a worrying trend in gaming, more and more studios are attempting to use the tool to aid in the development of larger triple-a titles. Developers like Treyarch Studios have been accused of using AI tools to create loading screens for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , and although this is only a small cog in a much larger machine, it didn't go down well with fans. However, there are much more sinister individuals using AI to assist them in churning out low-effort games as quickly as possible and putting them on storefronts such as Steam, the Nintendo eShop, the PlayStation Store, and more. IGN recently spoke to a handful of legitimate developers who expressed their frustrations with this trend and now it looks like Sony could be listening.

  Sony Removes PS5 Spam Games From the PlayStation Store
 </h2>
 <p>
  For players, the frustrating thing about these low-effort titles being everywhere is the inability to find some of the best PS5 games. However, it looks like that could be about to change. As spotted by fans on PSNProfiles (via TrueTrophies), Sony has taken down almost all of RandomSpinGames' titles from the PlayStation Store. The developer was known for contributing to the poor quality games on the Store, with titles
  <em>
   Bodycam Shooter, Backrooms Brotherhood,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Supermarket Simulator Pro
  </em>
  . Throughout 2024, RandomSpinGames released 19 titles, which simply wouldn't be possible for most indie developers or triple-a studios producing high-quality games.

 <p>
  Sadly, there are still plenty more of these "spam" games on the PlayStation Store, but with Sony finally starting to clean up its storefront, there's hope that more and more of these titles will be removed in the coming days, weeks, and months. It's also not just PlayStation being affected by the issue, as Nintendo (among many others) has also seen scam games appear on the Nintendo eShop. An anonymous developer recently told IGN that Nintendo "is probably the easiest to scam," before stating that once they were "in the door" with Nintendo, they could make "Fart Fart Boobie Fart: The Game" and "maybe it would eventually get taken down."
 </p>
 <p>
  While these types of low-effort games are seriously affecting players' ability to discover new titles, they also prevent legitimate indie developers from breaking through and finding success with their games. Thankfully, there are still ways for PlayStation users to find high-quality indie games on the Store, such as by visiting the PlayStation Indies tab, which shows numerous titles
  <em>
   Gang Beasts, Cult of The Lamb, Sifu, Hollow Knight
  </em>
  , and more. There is also currently a big sale on the PlayStation Store for February 2025, with both triple-a and indie titles on offer until February 19.

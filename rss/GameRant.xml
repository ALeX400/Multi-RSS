      <title>Bugsnax Gets Surprise New Update for November 2024</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/bugsnax-vr-update-november-steam/</link>

 <p>
  A new update for the Windows version of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Bugsnax
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released on November 12, 2024, and it adds SteamVR support to the game. This
  <em>
   Bugsnax
  </em>
  VR update went live exactly four years after the game's initial release, and it is freely available to anyone that owns the title through Steam.

  developer Young Horses indicates that the game's VR mode began as a "fun side project" that was being pursued by one of its programmers. The evolution of that project was made available on the Steam release's beta branch in October 2024, giving players their first chance to experience
  <em>
   Bugsnax
  </em>
  in VR. It seems that not much player testing was required, though, as the VR update was pushed to the retail branch only one month after the beta was released.

 <p>
  Indeed, the
  <em>
   Bugsnax
  </em>
  VR update is now available to all Steam players, making it possible for them to enjoy the game on SteamVR. Notably, the developer states that the game's VR mode was tested with Meta Quest 2 and 3, Valve Index, and PSVR2, and fans who are using one of those headsets should thus expect a smooth experience (provided that they have a "high-end Windows gaming desktop PC with an NVIDIA 3000 series graphics card"). Additionally, the developer has confirmed that the mode has gamepad support, which will please players who prefer to play without motion controls.

 <p>
  Young Horses has also provided some information about the possibility of
  <em>
   Bugsnax
  </em>
  VR coming to other platforms. Specifically, the developer indicates that there are currently no plans to bring the mode to any other platforms, be it PSVR2, Meta Quest standalone, or Apple Vision Pro. However, there are plans to bring SteamVR support to the Windows version of the game on the Epic Games Store, which will make it easier for players who primarily use that launcher to enjoy the update.

 <p>
  With respect to why
  <em>
   Bugsnax
  </em>
  VR is not planned for non-SteamVR platforms, the developer states that the game was created with a custom engine that makes full porting prohibitively time-consuming. While this may be disappointing to players who own the game on other platforms, like PlayStation 5, there is an opportunity to pick it up at a discount on Steam at the time of writing. Indeed,
  <em>
   Bugsnax
  </em>
  is currently marked down by 60% on Steam, in celebration of the game's four-year anniversary, and fans who are interested in the VR mode may want to take advantage of this promotion before it ends.

 <p>
  The VR update and Steam promotion are not the only ways that Young Horses is celebrating the game's anniversary, as it has also announced the launch of an online store where fans can purchase
  <em>
   Bugsnax: The Card Game
  </em>
  . For the uninitiated, this physical card game was funded through Kickstarter in April 2024, and the new store will give players who did not pledge to that campaign the opportunity to bring some card-sized Bugsnax into their homes.

      <title>Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree Still Has a Lingering FromSoftware Problem</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a testament to the pride, ambition, and bold creative vision of FromSoftware as a studio—for better and for worse. By examining
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  , one is able to gain valuable insight into the design ideals of not just
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , but FromSoftware’s broader portfolio of work.

 <p>
  Brutal difficulty, obtuse storytelling, and inspired art design—these things a FromSoftware game maketh—and
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  is no different in this regard. And that’s the best and worst part about the expansion: it’s more
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , bringing with it all the strengths and weaknesses of its progenitor. Ever-raging debate over difficulty aside,
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  excels at bombastic boss battles, satisfying progression, powerful world building, and jaw-dropping vistas, but flounders when it comes to delivering on its high fantasy plot.

  The Difference Between Great Lore and Great Stories
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are plenty of great endings in FromSoftware games: becoming a newborn Great One at the end of
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  (circumstances permitting), linking the first flame in
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , and sighting the pathetic true form of Old King Allant at the end of
  <em>
   Demon’s Souls
  </em>
  are all iconic moments in gaming narrative history. But these finales are effective more as a result of FromSoftware’s great world-building than due to the emotional strength of their presentation or setup.

 <p>
  It’s fascinating and disturbing that the player-character can transcend humanity in
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , and it’s a fitting twist that
  <em>
   Demon’s Souls
  </em>
  ’ power-hungry king is really a grotesque lump of flesh, but these are intellectual interests, not emotional ones. It can be hard to be emotionally invested when, for example, the protagonist has no background, or when the gravity of the situation is defined more by events that happened prior to the events of the game itself.

 <p>
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  has such issues with its ending. Upon defeating Miquella and Radahn, players will be treated to a brief cutscene that does little more than confirm Radahn's role as Miquella's consort—something that players will already have ascertained during the Promised Consort Radahn boss fight. After going through hell and back to complete the DLC, learning about the history of The Land of Shadow and characters like Messmer, it can feel somewhat underwhelming to get little more than a short cutscene expounding on what players already know, rather than one that yields new information or drives the story home with some sort of dramatic flair.

  Future FromSoftware Endings Could Benefit From an Injection of Drama

 <p>
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  has many endings, but most of them are differentiated more by their lore context than by their actual content: four of the base game's six endings are just the player sitting on the throne and becoming Elden Lord, with a few minor distinctions. Endings like Lord of the Frenzied Flame and Age of Stars are certainly more interesting, but these too are quite brief and, in many ways, devoid of feeling.

 <p>
  In future games, it would be nice to see FromSoftware experiment with more emotionally impactful endings, perhaps incorporating more traditional narrative or filmmaking techniques to improve pacing and presentation. After all, players can easily spend dozens of hours in these game worlds, learning the lore and characters, so the more aloof and emotionally distant nature of many of FromSoftware's endings can make them somewhat lackluster. These games shouldn't exactly be
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  —FromSoftware's aesthetic and tone are still captivating—but some more gravitas and panache would certainly be welcome.

  Apart from enhancing the appearance of yourself and the Village, there are Upgrades you can purchase that help in Combat throughout the game. Some of these upgrades may not seem enticing initially, but unlocking a Rare Weapon and Gadget from the start and gaining additional XP during missions are essential.

  Studs in every
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  game are easy to find. From the first mission, you will start finding Studs placed along the path. Bronze Studs indicate the main path, while Silver Studs mark side areas. These side areas are often small and primarily contain chests that can be interacted with.

 <p>
  The chests hold a random amount of Studs and may also drop a Gadget or Rare Weapon. In these side areas, players will also find structures that can be built, usually yielding around 200 Studs. The building process takes a few seconds, but it is worth the wait.

      <title>God Of War Ragnarok: The Best Leviathan Axe Attachments, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  As Kratos emerged triumphantly in a new mythology, and on a new generation of consoles, he brought forth a brand-new weapon. Players said goodbye to the Blades of Chaos, and readied for war with the Leviathan Axe, a weapon that returns with the best Leviathan Axe attachments in
  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War: Ragnarok
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The Leviathan Axe is beautifully made, in its physical design and combat abilities. It plays much like Thor’s hammer, as it can be thrown and recalled instantly, with a satisfying hold each time. However, the Leviathan Axe needs style and power, which is something
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  achieves with the
  <strong>
   many Leviathan Axe attachments
  </strong>
  .

    Updated on November 13, 2024, by Jake Fillery:
   </strong>
   God of War Ragnarok continues to impress with its anniversary, and the beloved rougelite free DLC God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla. Within such impressive features, players can build out the perfect Kratos for some furious vengeance and reflection against the Aesir gods, and to aid in that quest, the best Leviathan Axe attachments will certainly provide subtle combat enhancements to conquer even the hardest of difficulties.

  The original handle to the Leviathan Axe is unlocked at the beginning of
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  . As the original knob to the Leviathan Axe, it does not have its perk, other than the fact that it is sturdy and reliable, as described in the official adventure game.

 <p>
  Advancing the levels for the Wooden Knob grants 17 in Runic, Vitality, Cooldown, and Luck, with 29 in Strength. It’s wise to just ignore the Wooden Knob, as there are plenty of other handles for the Leviathan Axe that grant better stats and perks.

  The Grip of Sparta is special for just one reason, and that's the fact that it's a gift for entering into New Game Plus after having conquered Kratos' journey in
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla
  </em>
  . There isn't much to the Grip of Sparta other than that, and much like the Wooden Knob, it's purely cosmetics with no further effects.

  The Grip of Sparta won't exactly see a mastery over the best Relics like some other attachments, but it's worth having purely for bragging rights and to further solidify the look with Kratos' Ghost of Sparta cosmetics.

 <p>
  Whilst Kratos is usually known for his intense rage, and his savage beatings with his bare hands, these bare-handed attacks don't usually provide great advantages against a sharp weapon unless Kratos is using Spartan Rage, so Banahogg Knob can be a tad useless in the grand scheme of best axe pommels.

 <p>
  The fact that players need to combine precision throws with the axe and then run in with some bare-handed attacks for extended damage, adds a somewhat unnecessary combo style, as the axe just feels better and stronger than the fast strikes of Kratos' knuckles.

 <p>
  Send enemies to Valhalla with the Grip of Radiant Reflection, a Leviathan Axe attachment that provides permafrost to ranged axe attacks. Even better still, a precision throw means even more permafrost. Permafrost is a great addition to Kratos' arsenal, and activating it will see him dish out deadly swings with the axe, creating more damage and even swinging frost to enemies.

 <p>
  Those who like gaining Permafrost should definitely have this one on their list, as it's a perfect gauge to fill, but being hit will lose progress on the gauge, which is why keeping distance and throwing the axe to build the charge grants safety and damage.

  There's nothing too great about the Runic Hailstone Knob that makes it worthwhile, but it's still worth adding to the inventory. With this attachment, players are focusing solely on luck and the addition of runic and strength skills per upgrades. Yet, the main desire comes from the perk, which can provide luck on each hit to a frosted enemy.

 <p>
  Firstly, players will need to freeze enemies to get them the affliction needed, which can be a burden when there are hordes of enemies, stopping players from embracing the effects that can bless them, so it's sometimes not the best attachment to wield.

  The knob for this Leviathan Axe can be found in a
  <strong>
   Legendary Chest
  </strong>
  in
  <strong>
   Svartalfheim
  </strong>
  . It’s entirely cold to the touch, even in the warmest of climates. This knob has the
  <strong>
   Frost Resolve
  </strong>
  perk, which allows players to activate Frost Awaken by holding Triangle. In doing so, they will have increased defense stats, and stagger resistance, perfect for defending Atreus.

 <p>
  It’s always rather effective to use Frost Awaken, as it does not take long to activate and enables a better strike. By having such with the Fortified Frost Knob, they will tolerate more damage, but holding Triangle may not be a top priority in combat. A moderate stat bonus in Strength and Cooldown is also great.

  If players want the Grip of the Fallen Alchemist perk to be effective, they will need to also use the Serpent’s Snare skill. The perk itself is the
  <strong>
   Serpent’s Health Burst
  </strong>
  , which is a fairly decent perk that allows a high Luck chance to give players a Health Burst on a successful hit with the Serpent’s Snare skill. Health is important, considering the combat in this game can be fairly challenging.

  This handle is crafted at the Huldra Brother’s workshop after the return to Freyr’s Camp at the end of The Reckoning quest. This handle has a lightweight grip and is perfect for the battle ahead. Its perk is
  <strong>
   Seized Refresh
  </strong>

 <p>
  Stun grabbing is effective on its own, but the powerful blessing of Cooldown means that players can use their light and heavy runic attacks quicker with less of a cooldown. There’s also a bonus for Strength and Runic, but cooldowns aren’t necessary to overcome if there aren’t enemies to stun grab.

  Towards the end of The Reckoning questline, players will be able to craft the Stonecutter’s Knob for their Leviathan Axe in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  . This knob has an interesting piece of lore, as it was crafted by a legendary Light Elf, who used it for deadly slices. This carries over to Kratos, as the knob features heavily in a good amount of Strength and Defense.

 <p>
  Not only does this axe have good stats, but it also has the
  <strong>
   Slicing Finish
  </strong>
  perk, which adds a concussive wave to the end of an R1 axe combo. This means that players can add stun, and prevent fierce damage from opponents.

   Marksman’s Stun
  </strong>
  , players will have a moderate Luck chance for a successful precision throw to create a Stun Blast.

 <p>
  A Stun Blast is beneficial to the player because it allows for a quicker build-up of an R3 attack. Not only does this knob grant a moderate bonus to Strength and Luck, but it can be created from the beginning of The Reckoning quest at the Huldra Brother’s workshop.

  ​​​​​​​This grip for the Leviathan Axe is unlocked during the mandatory mission in
  <strong>
   Helheim
  </strong>
  , Reunion. This grip is perfect for those who are confident in their combat ability, as it will heal the user but lower their defense, meaning they need to be careful with their shields and evades, much like Blades of Chaos users.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>

  perk grants restoration in health if players hit enemies with a filled Permafrost skill gauge. However, the increase in incoming damage means that they should use this knob if they are skilled in

 <p>
  This attachment, the Furious Maul, craves battle like the Draupnir Spear, and as such, presents players with
  <strong>
   Slayer’s Strength
  </strong>
  . What this perk does is allow players to have a High Luck chance in granting a Gift of Strength when it comes to killing an enemy with the Leviathan axe.

 <p>
  The Gift of Strength allows for higher damage for a certain amount of time. Players that prioritize hard-hitting swings should use the Furious Maul, as at Level 9, it will have 63 Strength, lacking versatility, but being a professional in strength.

 <p>
  Combine this with the best Leviathan Axe runic attacks, and players will have a truly powerful attachment that can conquer all. The Grip of the Nine Realms is perfect for players who either need a breather during a fight or want to maximize their damage, as the fact that they can activate a Realm Shift by using a Glacial Permafrost makes for a violent addition to Kratos' arsenal.

 <p>
  Realm Shifts can be rather overpowered when crafting a great build, so this grip is worth grabbing for players who enjoy freezing time and wailing on their enemies with furious attacks before they can even react to the damage being provided.

      <title>Assassin's Creed's Gameplay May Actually Make a Fall Guys-Like Spin-Off a Perfect Fit</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed Invictus
   </strong>
  </em>
  was first announced back in September 2022, right alongside projects like
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Hexe
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Red
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mirage
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Jade
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Mirage
  </em>
  dropped last year, and
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  (formerly known as
  <em>
   Red
  </em>
  ) is on the way,
  <em>
   Hexe
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Jade
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  have all been kept under wraps. But with games of this scale, leaks are inevitable, and one recent
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Invictus
  </em>
  rumor has sent shockwaves through the community.

 <p>
  According to Twitter leaker j0nathan,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Invictus
  </em>
  will be a
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  -like multiplayer game in which 16 players compete in several rounds of minigame challenges. Many fans' knee-jerk reaction was to loudly condemn this rumored direction online. But while the image of fan-favorite characters like Ezio and Cesare Borgia duking it out in arcadey minigames is admittedly silly,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  's gameplay might be better suited to the
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  formula than some may think.

  If recent rumors are true and

  will indeed contain a handful of minigames, then the first on that list should be a cat-and-mouse game. Inspired by

  minigame would see players attempt to track down their target while also needing to avoid the hunter on their own tail. Players would need to use disguises and interactable parts of the scenery to blend in with the NPC crowds and remain hidden, and the last player standing would achieve the win.

  Another obvious pick for an
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Fall Guys
  </em>
  -like minigame would be some kind of parkour challenge. Parkour is arguably just as important as stealth to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  gameplay formula, and it lends itself well to a fast-paced minigame. Much like in the Street Races found in classic titles like
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 2
  </em>
  , these multiplayer parkour challenges could see players make their way through a series of checkpoints, with the goal being to reach the final gate faster than the rest of the lobby.

  A Messy Free-For-All Brawl
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another core part of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  's gameplay formula is combat, and while it might be a little more tricky to adapt those mechanics compared to the series' stealth and parkour, it deserves a minigame of its own in this rumored
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  -like multiplayer spinoff. The smartest choice would be pairing players and having them participate in a 1-on-1 duel, with the victor moving on to the next round. But a much more fun idea is some kind of messy free-for-all street brawl, where up to 16 players have to battle at the same time, parrying one another to secure a bloody victory by any means.

  A Quick Bout of Naval Warfare
 </h3>
 <p>
  Despite remaining a consistent feature of the franchise since
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  's release in 2012, naval combat isn't often what springs to mind when fans think of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  's gameplay loop. But naval combat could pave the way for a very unique multiplayer minigame. Players could take control of a
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  -era galleon and be given temporary crew roles. The captain needs to pilot the ship while the rest of the crew manages repairs and fires the cannons/swivel turrets.

  While
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Invictus
  </em>
  may be rumored to be
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  -like in structure, that doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be bad. The hypothetical minigames mentioned here would allow
  <em>
   Invictus
  </em>
  to have its cake and eat it too, offering bite-sized challenges while still capturing the essence of the franchise through similar gameplay mechanics.

  With the release of the updated 2024 Player's Handbook, many players are likely to soon test out builds developed in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  within the tabletop format. The landmark success of the Larian Studios game can in part be attributed to the level of freedom offered by its many build options, and several of them stand out as unconventional in the ways they take advantage of
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  's different ruleset. One of these is a build centered around thrown weapons facilitated by the Tavern Brawler Feat, which has never been as viable in
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  , but could find new life following key rule changes in the
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  2024
  <em>
   Player's Handbook
  </em>
  update.

 <p>
  Hurling various objects and even other characters is an enjoyable and effective playstyle in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , acting as one of the game's more humorous uses of its open-ended rules. Now that
  <em>
   DnD

  's update introduces a new system that benefits these kinds of alternative builds on top of other rule changes, it could be more viable than ever to commit to throwing weapons instead of wielding them traditionally as a martial class.

  The Thrown Weapon Fighting Style offers a modified effect which benefits Extra Attack using throwing weapons with the Light property, making the added damage from the player's Ability modifier more consistent. This pairs well with the updated Tavern Brawler Feat that matches
  <em>

  's implementation more closely, benefiting unarmed strikes now in a way which can affect thrown weapon attacks if they are ruled to fall under improvised weapons.

  Embracing the Chaotic Benefits of Multiclassing
 </h3>
 <p>
  The most effective way to replicate the diverse nature of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's thrown weapon builds in
  <em>
   DnD
  </em>
  is to multiclass for stacked features. Combining Fighter and Barbarian while building for high Strength along with Weapon Mastery can lead to reliable damage or other effects from throwing. When paired with the versatility of the Fighter's Extra Attack, even options like Rogue can make for a blend of stealth and range through thrown weapon attacks. With a stack of bonuses applied, even a simple dagger wielded at early to mid-level, when thrown, can take its initial 1d4 damage up to around 11 points on average. When this kind of build gets its hands on Light weapons with higher damage rolls along with Extra Attack, the output per turn can become considerable for a ranged martial character.

  Game Master Rulings Can Make or Break Throwing Builds
 </h3>
 <p>
  If allowed, Tavern Brawler can offer a considerable increase in damage output for Strength-based throwing characters. Depending on how the rules are interpreted, there's even the potential for added subclasses like the Path of the Giant of 2023's
  <em>
   Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants
  </em>
  to throw massive objects for significant damage in the right context. The limit in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  comes from how many improvised weapons the player can find to throw successively, but in the more open format of tabletop after the 2024 update, there's no telling how sustainable a thrown weapon build can be made.

  Every day,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  looks more and more like an immensely ambitious game and its release date is still at least several months away, so Capcom could still have more in store for fans that it hasn't revealed yet. This particular installment in the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise is bringing some big innovations to the table, breaking traditions and implementing significant quality-of-life enhancements that will make gameplay for returning players smoother than ever while simultaneously increasing its accessibility for a new audience. One of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' biggest additions sees players now bringing up to two weapons on a hunt, since the new Seikret mount comes with a weapon sling.

  While on the Seikret in
  <em>

  , players will be able to swap between two weapons, allowing for an instantaneous variety of approaches to each hunt without needing to head back to the hub first to change loadouts. This game-changing new feature is already a significant upgrade for players who prefer more variety in their gameplay, but it may shine even more when it comes to certain weapons. More specifically, should players choose to bring the Switch Axe or Charge Blade with them on the hunt, there's potential for it to "break" the game.

  Monster Hunter's Switch Axe and Charge Blade Are Each Essentially Two Weapons
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Switch Axe and Charge Blade are unlike most weapons in the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise, in that they are each essentially two weapons due to their ability to take on two unique forms. The Switch Axe, for instance, can swap between Sword mode and Axe mode, making it one of the series' most versatile weapons. Its Axe mode functions similarly to the Long Sword, in that it can reach long distances and can dish out a great deal of damage.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1034} -->

 <p>
  The Switch Axe's Sword mode, on the other hand, while it may look like a traditional Great Sword, is actually much faster and less powerful. Where the Switch Axe benefits from its Sword mode is in the use of Phials, which, when imbued into the Switch Axe, can grant it unique benefits. The Power Phial, for example, increases the raw damage of the Switch Axe's Sword mode and is therefore more widely used than others.

 <p>
  The Charge Blade is similar to the Switch Axe in its ability to swap between two unique forms. However, whereas the Switch Axe has a Sword and Axe form, the Charge Blade has a Sword and Shield form, as well as an Axe form. Additionally, while the default mode of the Switch Axe is its Axe form, the Charge Blade's default mode is its Sword and Shield form. As its name suggests, the Charge Blade's Sword and Shield form is used for charging up energy. Once the weapon charges enough energy, the Axe form can then deal powerful, explosive attacks to the enemy.

 <p>
  Given the versatility of the Switch Axe and Charge Blade,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  ' weapon-swapping could benefit them more than any other weapon in the game. Of course, the two modes of the Switch Axe and Charge Blade are designed to be symbiotic and not separate from one another, but the idea of being able to take a Sword and Shield, an Axe, and an entirely different weapon on an expedition in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  sounds like a game-breaking mechanic. At least the Switch Axe and Charge Blade are intended for more experienced players, so players taking advantage of

  ' weapon-swapping with each weapon may not be as widespread as it seems it could be.

  For 950 V-Bucks, gamers can get a lot of content out of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  Battle Pass. It includes dozens of pages of exclusive items, and as they progress throughout the season, they'll be able to unlock even more cosmetic rewards. The Quest Rewards page grants players who work on the Weekly Quests to unlock unique rewards, such as brand-new items and additional alternative styles for their Battle Pass cosmetics.

  There are several tabs in the Battle Pass for all sorts of quests and rewards. For example, once gamers complete the Battle Pass, they'll gain access to the Bonus Rewards page, which includes new styles for already unlocked cosmetics. There is also an entirely different rewards tab filled with free goodies for fans who complete Weekly Quests throughout Chapter 5 Season 4 - this is the Quest Reward tab.

  The latest PlayStation 5 console update is causing some unexpected crashes and graphical issues for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 16
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The newest mainline entry in Square Enix’s legendary JRPG series took
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  back to a medieval setting for a gritter story set in the war-torn land of Valisthea, where feuding kingdoms battle each other using the power of mystical summons known as Eikons. As the fallen noble Clive Rosfield, players journey through the world of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  to avenge the apparent death of his younger brother and defeat the evil at the heart of Valisthea’s conflict.

 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  launched on the PlayStation 5 to mostly positive reviews last summer, with Square Enix promising to eventually port it to PC. After a lengthy development cycle,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  is finally launching on PC this week, complete with new graphical updates and the two previously released
  <em>
   Echoes of the Fallen
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Rising Tide
  </em>
  DLC expansions. However, while eager fans are getting ready to pick up the PC version of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  on Steam and the Epic Games Store, those who already bought the game on its native PS5 are experiencing some unexpected headaches from a seemingly unrelated hardware update.

 <p>
  Ever since the September 2024 PlayStation 5 firmware update went live a few days ago,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  players have been reporting sudden game crashes and graphics-related issues. The official
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  Twitter account recently addressed these reports, assuring those affected that the development team is checking out the situation and apologizing for any inconvenience it might have caused.

  Sony’s most recent PS5 update added several new features, including a Welcome hub that displays the remaining battery life for connected PS5 peripherals like controllers, available storage space, and online friends among other useful information. Other new additions include personalized 3D audio profiles that are optimized for each user, per-profile Remote Play settings, and the ability to share party access links with players who wish to join an online play session.

  <strong>
   Horror
  </strong>
  is one of the most beloved genres in storytelling. One of the biggest reasons the genre is so popular is due to the diversity it allows in its concepts and themes. Horror can be based around nearly any idea. From a slow-burn psychological thriller, like
  <em>
   Longlegs
  </em>
  , to the more grotesque and horrifying, like
  <em>
   Alien: Romulus
  </em>
  , the flexibility of horror continues to draw people in.

 <p>
  One of the best places for horror to be explored is through video games. These stories are just as versatile, if not more so, than their film or television counterparts. From
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Resident Evil,
  </em>
  the landscape of horror in gaming is incredibly vast. Occasionally, parallel ideas will arrive around the same time, which can often create trends to form. Two upcoming horror releases seem primed and ready to do just that. Between
  <em>
   Zoochosis
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  , it looks like the horror genre is getting ready to evolve body horror in a more animal-centric fashion.

  Subverting Body Horror Expectations
 </h3>
 <p>
  When it comes to body horror, it's usually focused on humans who have come to a horrible fate. Games like
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  experiment with what horrible transformations can be done to the human body. Through the years, body horror has become quite common in the genre, simply because it is so versatile.
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  ' cordyceps-infected humans and the mutilated residents of
  <em>
   Outlast
  </em>
  's Mount Massive Asylum showcase unique ways humans can become horribly deformed.

 <p>
  Now, animals are getting the brunt of body horror experimentation.
  <em>
   Zoochosis
  </em>
  kickstarted this new body horror approach, as it was first announced at the beginning of the year. The bodycam horror game requires players to protect zoo animals from a mysterious ailment that is morphing them into grotesque monsters. A game that is half zoo management, half body horror showcase doesn't seem like it would be a good fit at first, but early footage of the game proves otherwise.

 <p>
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  is equally exciting, as it's the first game from Tarsier Studios since
  <em>
   Little Nightmare 2
  </em>
  . The artwork and aesthetic of
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  is practically identical to the
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  franchise, but the main difference is that this upcoming title seems to be diving a lot deeper with its horror elements. Although the trailer for
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  shows plenty of the grotesque human-like characters that
  <em>
   Little Nightmares
  </em>
  boasted, this spiritual successor also showcases an array of spin-chilling animal hybrids that look like they have stepped straight out of a nightmare.

  It may not be possible to predict an outright surge in creepy animal body horror, but if both
  <em>
   Zoochosis
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  prove to be successes, it would be surprising if there wasn't an influx of titles following in their footsteps. Where
  <em>
   Zoochosis
  </em>
  seems to offer the jump scares,
  <em>
   Reanimal
  </em>
  aims to crawl under the player's skin. This is another demonstration of just how versatile horror and its many subgenres can be. Both titles revolve around animal body horror, but they go about it in completely different ways. It seems as though animal-focused body horror is a rich untapped resource that could provide years of inspiration for other developers to experiment with.

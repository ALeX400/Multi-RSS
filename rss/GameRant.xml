  <em>
   <strong>
    Sonic X Shadow Generations
   </strong>
  </em>
  has given fans a possible tease towards another playable character in the
  <em>
   Shadow Generations
  </em>
  campaign.
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  is an updated re-release of the original 2011 anniversary title. Not only is the original game getting a graphical and 60 FPS enhancement, but additional gameplay features like Chao rescue missions are being added. The biggest talking point surrounding the game, however, is the second half of this re-release: a brand-new single-player campaign starring Sonic's anti-hero rival, Shadow the Hedgehog.

 <p>
  <em>
   Shadow Generations
  </em>
  takes place from Shadow's own perspective, where he finds himself thrown into the past thanks to Black Doom, making an appearance after his first and only game appearance,
  <em>
   Shadow the Hedgehog
  </em>
  . Shadow's gameplay is much more distinct from Sonic's, where he gains access to his iconic Chaos Control and new powers seemingly stemming from his Black Arms DNA. While Shadow originally appeared to be the only playable character for this story mode, there's the possibility that
  <em>
   Shadow Generations
  </em>
  might be including a second playable character alongside the black-and-red hedgehog.

 <p>
  On the Japanese website of
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  , there's a new character profiles section for the game's playable characters. Modern Sonic and Classic Sonic have their own profiles, which briefly explain how they get involved with the events of
  <em>
   Generations
  </em>
  . However, the Shadow section of the site lists not only Shadow, but a blanked-out profile picture that says "Coming Soon" to boot. While it makes sense both Sonics are on the page, considering they are both playable, Shadow being by himself alongside this graphic possibly indicates that another playable character alongside Shadow could potentially be in the game.

 <p>
  Fans have begun speculating what possible characters could be playable alongside Shadow in his campaign. One likely option would be a "Classic" variant of Shadow, similar to the younger-looking Genesis-era-styled characters. Others have theorized that Shadow could have a rival character that would end up being playable that could share Shadow's move set, similar to Eclipse the Darkling, a foil to Shadow the Hedgehog that shared the same Black Arms lineage as him, who originated from the Archie Comics. Metal Sonic was also a possible candidate for a possible playable character.

 <p>
  Some fans are keeping their expectations in check, noting it will likely be filled out with some of the secondary characters from the game. This is evident by how characters like Tails, Knuckles, or even
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  ' main villain, the Time Eater, aren't listed on this page. As such, it's possible the "Coming Soon" graphic could be hinting at character profiles for some of Shadow's allies and rogues gallery, like Rouge the Bat, Maria Robotnik, and Black Doom. As such, fans should wait till Sega provides more official information.

  One thing that the DLC adds is more Site of Grace locations, 104 to be exact. These areas are vital to players, and so finding them is crucial to any playthrough. Here's a guide to finding them all in the Abyssal Woods region of the Realm of Shadow.

  The Site of Grace locations are used for a ton of different things, making them some of the best places in the game. They are where players will go if they want to level up, fast travel somewhere in the game (players can fast travel to any Site of Grace), upgrade Realm of Shadow Blessings, change their gear (such as garments and Ashes of War), pass the time, sort their chest, and change spells. Players can also change their Flask loadout and mix up their Wondorous Physick Flask. Since so much is constantly going on at these Site of Grace locations, players will want to find them all in the game; that way, they constantly have places to change these things and level up when needed. They will also have a whole host of areas to fast travel to if they have these areas already unlocked. Here's a guide to finding all the Site of Grace locations that the Abyssal Woods have to offer.

Through Link's Ultrahand ability, players can build just about anything they can think of by combining objects found all over the world. This has led to players building incredibly fine-tuned, powerful, or fast vehicles, but also some weird things, too.

  vehicle designer kmarkow has shared their latest creation, this time making a modified caterpillar bike. They uploaded a brief video of Link driving the vehicle around, which they say handles terribly, but they did their best to control it and make it look natural. The individual segments of the caterpillar can move somewhat independently thanks to some cooking pots, which add to the realism of it being a bug, but probably takes away from the ease of use.

Several are calling for the creator to make more bug-based vehicles, and they've responded that they're already collecting parts to make more "buggies." Another compared it to a Wiggler from
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  , which it does bear a strong resemblance to.

  This particular fan is no stranger to building
  <em>
   Zelda

  vehicles, as they've made several in the past. The fan has come up with everything from practical to fantastical designs, likely leading to them having the skill and understanding of the Ultrahand system to make a vehicle like this one.

  A prequel to the first game in the series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Yakuza 0
   </em>
  </strong>
  innovated on the combat systems of the previous
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  games, letting players swap between fighting styles on the fly to chain together elaborate attacks. The game makes storylines and mission chains into interesting plots.

 <p>
  It develops on nearly everything that makes the later games amazing while letting fans see the origins of Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima as they try to make their names in Japan. The open world is filled with side activities and businesses that the player can purchase and indulge in, making the feeling of establishing themselves become a focus of the game that separates it from the rest of the series.

  The final game in the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  series to be developed by
  <em>
   Bungie
  </em>
  , and a direct prequel to the first game in the series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Halo: Reach
   </em>
  </strong>
  is often commended as one of the best games on the Xbox 360. The campaign features dogfights, new weapons and a story set defending a planet to the last breath — and it can even be played co-op.

 <p>
  With a moving story, an expansive multiplayer, and a level editor,
  <em>
   Reach
  </em>
  expands on the previous entries in almost every way, while staying true to the first game's style and everything
  <em>
   Halo

  fans loved.

  The third
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  title is set in 1964, 31 years before the original title, and sees Naked Snake infiltrating the USSR in the middle of the Cold War. Using the same intricate stealth systems from the previous games (but dialed up to eleven),
  <strong>
   <em>
    Snake Eater
   </em>
  </strong>
  builds on the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  formula in a whole host of ways.

 <p>
  Snake has to eat to maintain his stamina, his clothing determines how well camouflaged he will be, and his injuries are maintained and have unique effects based on where and what they are. All of this is wrapped up in an exciting story that provides detail about the legacy of the Big Boss title, and it's rounded out by an incredible soundtrack.
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
  </em>
  is rightly lauded as one of the best games of all time.

  Despite being a
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Yoshi's Island
   </em>
  </strong>
  deviates from the
  <em>
   Nintendo
  </em>
  norm by making the players into Yoshi themselves. This game established the green dinosaur as a hero in their own right, giving them new abilities like the flutter jump, eggs to throw, and a tongue that can grab enemies to seal them away in more eggs.

 <p>
  Yoshi's adventure is largely concerned with the title character, Mario, who is only a helpless baby in this game. When Yoshi gets hit, Mario will fall away from them, and the player will have to scrabble to save the platforming hero before it is too late. With tight controls, a vibrant crayon-style, and a playful attitude towards the
  <em>
   Nintendo
  </em>
  mascot,
  <em>
   Yoshi's Island
  </em>
  is the best prequel story that Mario could ask for.

  Unsurprisingly,
  <em>
   Rockstar
  </em>
  's magnum opus,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </strong>
   ,
  </em>
  takes the crown as the best prequel game of all time. After fans explored John Marston's story in the original
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  , many were left with questions about the connections between the bitter rivals and whatever happened to Dutch Van Der Linde's gang that had brought them all together.

 <p>
  With stronger characterization, the game injects more context into the already powerful narrative of the first game, giving players more time and more compassion for Dutch, Javier, Bill, and everyone else. New characters, especially Arthur Morgan himself, are lovingly crafted into real people who feel and doubt and hurt. The Old West never felt so new.

      <title>5 Best Puzzle Boss Fights In Games</title>

 <p>
  Not all boss fights need to be a display of power and spectacle. While it's true that these encounters are meant to push players to their limits and utilize all their abilities to whittle down a boss' health bar, it's also important for certain boss fights to stimulate the player mentally in other ways. Instead of a traditional boss fight, certain fights can feature brain teasers that force players to think differently.

 <p>
  Some boss fights go all-in on this design, compelling players to treat these encounters as puzzles of their own with the solution being the gameplay mechanics that players have used. If executed correctly, these battles can do a great job of freshening up the gameplay and injecting more energy into a player.

  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  is one of the best superhero games ever made, with the improvements from
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  being palpable for everyone to see. The exciting open-world design, improved combat, and fun boss fights were a treat to engage with. However, this game didn't rest on its laurels and pulled out something magical when players had to face off against Mr. Freeze.

 <p>
  No Predator encounter has reached the heights of this stealth-focused boss fight, with players having to use takedowns to take out this boss. The catch is that Mr. Freeze sets up a safeguard after being taken by surprise once, meaning that players won't be able to repeat the same kind of takedown again. It's a simple and engaging way for the game to force players into exploring the breadth of the stealth gameplay and figure out new and ingenious ways to get the drop on this sinister villain.

  Every boss fight in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Colossus
  </em>
  can be viewed as a puzzle, with players having to figure out a route of attack and latching themselves to a Colossus before climbing towards its weak spot and dishing out as much damage as they can before repeating the process. It's a quirky way to take out these behemoths, and players must reach these weak points if they want to dish out substantial damage.

 <p>
  The most cinematic encounter of the lot is the thirteenth Colossus that comes at the tail end of this adventure. The developer pulled out all the stops for players to enjoy a cinematic battle as they hit the Colossus' air sacs to bring it down before chasing it down with Agro and grabbing onto one of its wings. Players soar through the air and try not to fall as they reach a weak point and stab it multiple times before this amazing encounter is over and done with.

  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  is full to the brim with several nightmarish encounters, but nothing comes close to the Hunter. This Regenerator hounds the player and forces them to incapacitate this enemy to get some breathing room as they run away. However, after a point, Isaac has no more room to run and must find an unconventional way to take out this powerful necromorph. This essentially turns this boss into a puzzle encounter with a simple and elegant solution.

 <p>
  Players have to reach a room with a shuttle and lure this foe near the thrusters. After dismembering or using Stasis to slow down the Hunter, they can permanently kill this foe by activating the thrusters and burning the Regenerator to a crisp. It's a satisfying way to take out this necromorph and requires some brainwork to figure out.

  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  is a legendary FPS that needs no introduction. The shooting gameplay is great, but Valve knew way back then that switching things up from time to time would help the game's pacing. So, to hammer in just how threatening the Xen are, Freeman comes face-to-face with a seemingly unbeatable trio of tentacles that hit like a truck and use noise to track where their prey is. This makes for a tense encounter as players sneak around and use distractions to clear the way from them as they figure out a way to take out this foe.

 <p>
  Eventually, as one would expect, the only way to take out these tentacles is to use the thrusters of a rocket to burn it down. It's a great way for players to alleviate the tension, especially if these spiky tentacles have already hacked them down for making a mistake a few times before.

  When
  <em>
   The Orange Box
  </em>
  came out, no one expected
  <em>
   Portal
  </em>
  to be a highlight of this package. This puzzle game introduced players to the Aperture Science Laboratory and Glados, with the final fight against this AI tyrant being a blast to engage with. So, it was clear that
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  needed to do something magical to exceed expectations, and they certainly achieved this. Chell faces off against Glados again and defeats her with Wheatley's help, but this quirky AI reveals a power-hungry side in no time that makes him the game's true antagonist.

 <p>
  After an uneasy alliance with Glados, Chell makes her way back to Wheatley and uses corrupted cores to mess with him. However, Wheatley refuses to give up, forcing the players to shoot a portal at the moon to send this robot into space and help Glados reestablish control once again in a bombastic ending.

  entry has been announced and is now coming up to its release day, ten years after the last game. It's been a long-time coming for fans, and their patience has been awarded with several trailers showcasing just some of these things the game has on offer, though BioWare is keeping several things under wraps for fans to find out for themselves.

  One of the first nuggets of news was the announcement of the new companions players would be fighting alongside, and though the fans received these characters well (with some already picking out their favorites), there were hopes of legacy characters returning, and BioWare did not disappoint.

 <p>
  Thus far, there is confirmation of Lace Harding, Varric Tethras, Morrigan, and Maevaris Tilani returning in
  <em>
   Veilguard.
  </em>
  The former three are from previous games,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Inquistion
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    2
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Origins
   </em>
  </strong>
  respectively, and Maevaris is a celebrated character from spin-off works such as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Those Who Speak
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It is unknown if other fan-favorite characters will return, but it is likely that there will be mentions of the previous heroes and their chosen beaus at the very least. Time will only tell if BioWare has sneaked more cameos in behind gamers' backs.

  Some lucky journalists got their hands on exclusive
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  demos, and what was shown were some truly impressive hair physics and a breathtakingly beautiful Rook.
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  has a rather sordid past with character customization, specifically with the hair options (or rather, the lack thereof). Many can forgive
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  due to the age of the game, as customization back then was a unicorn.
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  showed some improvements, but most chose the default Hawke, as they looked better than what anyone could come up with outside of mods.
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  remains a sore spot for many fans still.

 <p>
  Fans' prayers have finally been answered, however, and things are finally looking up for character customization enthusiasts. Though there haven't been any in-depth reveals, fans have seen the impressive hair physics showcasing some decent hairstyles finally. Now, players can finally make a salon-fresh character in a
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game, whose perfect hair could likely only be put down to magic use. Whatever the reason, the mere possibility of decent customization options is incredibly exciting.

  Thus far, players have had quite a tour of Thedas, from Fereldan to Kirkwall and then to numerous different places in
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  , such as The Hinterlands, which fans will likely remember the most. There were wonders about where the new game would take place, with BioWare confirming the main location to be Tevinter when the game was still titled
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
  </em>
  . Though the name of the game has changed, the location has not, and the Imperium is still the main location.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1089} -->

 <p>
  There is plenty of rich lore surrounding this location, which will certainly have some interesting implications for Rook and co, as well as the plot at large. Though Tevinter has featured in other
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  works, this will still be the first chance players have of walking through this region themselves, which will be a very exciting prospect for long-time fans of the franchise.

  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  kicked the series off with a mere four romances, and two of those four were locked to the opposite gender, stealing many players' dream paramour.
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  evened the playing field, featuring only one character who was gender-locked, which fans highlighted as one of the game's strengths.

  took a step back, and though it had more romance options overall, not everyone was content with the choices available to them.

  BioWare seems to have finally learned their lesson, as every single one of the possible romance choices are pansexual, assuaging the fears players had that the one they wanted was off the table. Though there are arguments to be made about the lack of representation within an all-pansexual cast, there is nothing stopping companions who are not romanced by the Rook to find love with one another or for there to be more diverse sexualities among the NPCs. But either way, this was still the best move to be made, as now, everyone can rest assured the companion of their dreams is 100% romanceable.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  has seen several gameplay shifts throughout the series.
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  took a more turn-based approach,
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  embraced hack-and-slash elements, and
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  tried to find a balance between the two, but most players would have defaulted to button-mashing. BioWare has overhauled the combat system for their next outing, reducing the party size for a more involved experience and doing away with the tactical camera to force players to think quickly and remain on their toes.

 <p>
  Classes are returning in the form of warrior, mage, and rogue, and players can spec into a subclass with fairly in-depth skill trees, so now, one type of character feels the same to play. There has also been the new addition of being able to boot an enemy off a ledge
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  -style, which could result in some hilarious premature boss executions. Combat is rarely ever the highlight of a
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game, but from everything revealed so far,
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  looks like it might just be changing that.

  The
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series always remains faithful to three classes: Warrior, Mage and Rogue, each with its own playstyle and specializations to choose from, encouraging gamers to consider a second playthrough so that they can experience combat from a different point of view. These traditional classes continue with
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  , but brand-new specializations have been introduced specific for the upcoming title, with some even involving the eponymous veil.

  </strong>
  players venture into Natlan, they will encounter various opportunities to obtain rewards and achievements. Natlan is jam packed with hidden achievements for
  <em>

  In Natlan, daily commissions can be unlocked after completing the main Archon Quest, 'Chapter V Flowers Resplendent on a Sun-Scorched Sojourn,' as well as the side quest, 'Red Hot Adventure!' After speaking to Kathryne and waiting for the daily reset, all players need to do is wait for the Sharpshooter on Hand commission.

  This

  commission tasks players with speaking to Zicheng over at the Stadium of Sacred Flames and helping him with some pictures. He’s looking for some inspiration in three places, and if players
  <strong>
   complete the main AND side task

  , only then will they receive the hidden achievement. The main task is already given, but the side task isn’t.

  Each of the three places is randomly generated and purely depends on the players. The locations can be found in the Scions of the Canopy tribe, Children of Echoes tribe, and the People of the Springs tribe. Depending on what Zicheng says, head to the indicated location and
  <strong>
   first take a picture of the main task
  </strong>
  in the allocated time. Afterward, head to the
  <strong>
   side task indicated below
  </strong>
  and take a picture as well.

  VEA Games and Knights Peak have revealed that the upcoming action-adventure platformer
  <em>
   Nikoderiko: The Magical World
  </em>
  will be making its way to consoles on October 15, with future plans for release on PC.
  <em>
   Nikoderiko
  </em>
  will feature familiar gameplay to classic platformers like
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Banjo-Kazooie
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  , with a mix of both 3D and 2D mechanics. Players will guide anthropomorphic protagonists Niko and Luna on a magical journey through a vibrant world of expansive areas with diverse gameplay themes such as minecart sections, chase sequences, and underwater exploration. In addition to the similar gameplay premise, British composer David Wise, who worked on the soundtrack for the original
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  trilogy, arranged all the music for
  <em>
   Nikoderiko: The Magical World
  </em>
  .

  <strong>
   Rockstar North
  </strong>
  is probably the most famous branch of the monster developer that has been taking the gaming world by storm for over two decades now. Located in Edinburgh, Scotland, this behemoth has released games including, but not limited to,
  <strong>
   <em>
    GTA 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    GTA: Vice City
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    GTA: San Andreas
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    GTA 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   <em>
    GTA 5

 <p>
  With a reported 650 employees in 2018, Rockstar North is the largest branch of Rockstar Games and is likely the one with the most funding. It was acquired in 1999 and has served a pivotal role in the company's franchises and projects since then.

  Back in the olden days of

   GTA 3
  </em>
  , titles like
  <em>
   GTA: Liberty City Stories

   GTA: Vice City Stories
  </em>
  served as amazing prequels that helped set the foundation of future games and answer many of the games' questions. None of this would have been possible without the efforts of the
  <strong>
   Rockstar Leeds

  While this branch isn't credited with developing any full games on its own, they are credited with being one of the largest collaborators across a wide range of Rockstar Games' projects. This branch is significantly newer than others on the list, as it was established in 2016. It's estimated to have between 700–1000 employees.

  The latest Dapper Delights Star Path has brought many new riddles for saviors to complete in Gameloft’s 2022 life sim
  <strong>
   <em>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley.
   </em>
  </strong>
  Some of them ask you to feed critters, and give gifts to villagers, while others require you to collect certain items. One of these duties is to ‘Pick Berries From the Beach.’
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":325} -->

 <p>
  There are different berries in the game, like Strawberries, Raspberries, Blueberries, and Cactoberries, which might make it hard to figure out which ones count for this Star Path duty. For now, we know that these special berries are native to the beach. Keep reading this guide to find out how to complete the ‘Pick Berries From the Beach’ duty in
  <em>
   DDV.

  So the
  <strong>
   beach area is Dazzle Beach and the berries you are looking for Blueberries
  </strong>
  . These are the only berries that spawn on Dazzle Beach, along with other fruits like banana and coconut. To complete this Star Path duty, you'll need to collect 40 Blueberries from Dazzle Beach.

  First, Dreamers need to enter the Dazzle Beach biome. This area costs 1,000 Dreamlight to unlock, which you can use to clear the Night Thorns blocking the way. Completing Dreamlight Duties is a great way to earn this currency.

 <p>
  After unlocking Dazzle Beach, go in and find blueberry bushes. These bushes are dark green with blue berries hanging on them. Just interact with the bushes to pick the berries.
  <strong>
   Players will get three blueberries with each harvest. The bushes will need 25 minutes to grow back
  </strong>
  , and like other bushes in the valley, you don’t need to water them.

 <p>
  A quick heads-up:
  <strong>
   Dazzle Beach only has three blueberry bushes, which means you can only pick up to 9 blueberries in one go
  </strong>
  . To increase the chances of gathering more berries, players should bring a villager friend with the foraging role.

 <p>
  Players can also find blueberries in the Forest of Valor, but only the ones from Dazzle Beach count for this Star Path Duty. Once you have picked 40 blueberries from Dazzle Beach, you’ll complete this task and earn
  <strong>
   10 Lily Pad Tokens
  </strong>
  . Dreamers can use these tokens to unlock premium rewards from the Dapper Delights event.

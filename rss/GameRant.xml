      <title>Despite the Delay, Assassin's Creed Shadows Can Still End 2024 with a Bang</title>

  Ubisoft’s
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin’s Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  recently faced a significant delay, pushing its release from November 2024 to February 2025. While this news might have dampened some of the excitement surrounding the title, there is a potential silver lining that could reinvigorate the hype.

  Rumors of a co-op mode, codenamed LEAGUE, could give the game a much-needed boost, helping it to close out 2024 on a high note. This rumored addition has yet to be officially confirmed by Ubisoft, but sources indicate that this feature was in development long before the delay was announced, suggesting that it wasn’t a reaction to the postponement but a long-planned component of the game.

  The rumored co-op mode in
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  has the potential to bridge a gap between different player bases and drive post-launch engagement well into 2025. The LEAGUE mode would see two key characters, Naoe and Yasuke, team up to tackle enemies together.

 <p>
  While Ubisoft hasn’t provided specific details on how the co-op system will work, speculation suggests that each character could bring their unique combat abilities into play, offering diverse approaches to stealth and action. This mechanic, if well-implemented, could appeal to both long-time fans who miss the more traditional stealth elements of the series and newer players who joined with the RPG-heavy direction seen in
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  .

  Assassin's Creed Shadows' Delay Could Benefit Ubisoft’s Vision
 </h3>
 <p>
  The delay of
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  has stirred controversy, with some speculating that Ubisoft is working to refine cultural and historical accuracy, particularly given the game's Japanese setting. However, the official reason given was to “polish and refine the experience.” The company has also pointed to lessons learned from
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  as a driving factor behind the delay. While fans may feel disheartened by the pushback, the extra development time could prove beneficial, allowing Ubisoft to perfect the core game and the rumored co-op mode without rushing to meet a strict deadline.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1071} -->

 <p>
  Incorporating LEAGUE post-launch would enable Ubisoft to extend the life cycle of the game, creating waves of excitement as more features roll out. This staggered release strategy could help
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  maintain relevance well into 2025. In an increasingly competitive gaming market, keeping the conversation going is critical to a game’s long-term success, and a well-received co-op mode could help achieve that goal.

  Potential Co-op Mode Could Satisfy Both Fan Bases
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the biggest challenges
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  faces is satisfying the two primary factions within the series’ fanbase: the original players who crave stealth-oriented gameplay and those who joined with the more RPG-like systems introduced in
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Mirage
  </em>
  however did include classic stealth elements that gave fans of the older style a reprieve. The co-op mode, if done well, could unite these different groups. A traditionalist might gravitate toward Naoe’s stealthier abilities, while players who enjoy the newer, more action-heavy gameplay could prefer Yasuke. Together, the two could complement each other’s playstyles, enhancing the cooperative experience.

  This feature would also bring friends who might have otherwise had different preferences together in an experience that they can enjoy together, even if their gameplay priorities differ. The opportunity for word-of-mouth promotion is significant here; players discussing the co-op mode and inviting friends to play could drive more attention and hype for
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  long after its release, creating a ripple effect that extends beyond the core fanbase.

 <p>
  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  still has the potential to close out 2024 with a bang despite its delay. While there are still many questions surrounding the game, particularly in regard to the rumored LEAGUE mode, the possibility of co-op offers a compelling reason for fans to stay engaged with the game as its launch date approaches.

      <title>Poison Ivy Has a Big Part Yet to Play in Batman’s Arkhamverse</title>

  Unless the Arkhamverse continues long after the events of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
   </em>
  </strong>
  in the franchise’s present-day or future, it seems fair to assume that players have seen most of the high-profile, colorful villains Batman goes toe-to-toe with. Many established antagonists are unaccounted for throughout the series while still being mentioned or referenced via Easter eggs or a throwaway dialogue line when eavesdropping. There are years in Batman’s career left blank before
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  , too, but like
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  they may be more concerned with laying brickwork for significant origin stories.

  Rocksteady has been keen on hardly depicting any origin stories, though, and for inexplicable reasons. There’s yet to be a game portraying how any Robin came to be, let alone Batgirl, and there are so few years left where games set during that time could actually illustrate events before
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  . Likewise, villains as well-known and omnipotent as Poison Ivy can’t simply sprout up out of the soil. Indeed, if anyone deserves an origin story with the lead role as an antagonist in an
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  game, Poison Ivy is long overdue for nourishing sunlight.

  gave Poison Ivy a noble death as she sacrificed herself to dissipate Scarecrow’s city-wide blanket of fear toxin. Now, thanks to

  She’ll possibly have the age or appearance of a young adult if the Arkhamverse continues onward from here, and yet it would be fascinating to see how Pamela Isley initially became Poison Ivy. The earliest chronological mention of Isley in-game is via
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  ’ Cold, Cold Heart DLC, where a visitor/guest ID badge with her name on it can be found at GothCorp.

 <p>
  Her story bio in
  <em>
   Asylum
  </em>
  doesn’t go into her lore any deeper than stating that “Botanist Pamela Isley was transformed by a science experiment gone wrong into a plant-human hybrid.” Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Asylum
  </em>
  ’s patient interview tapes do discuss how Dr. Jason Woodrue poisoned her.

 <p>
  There’s a lot of rich history the Arkhamverse hasn’t dove into quite yet in-game and witnessing in gameplay how Isley blossomed into Ivy would be exciting to see, especially if they result in the deaths of hundreds of Gothamites. This mayhem may well be an incident more spectacular than anything the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games have depicted thus far, even if
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  ’s alien invasion of Metropolis and multiversal casualties have it beat in sheer bombast.

  ’s Poison Ivy boss fight also depicts her ability to cast a wave of thorns and hoist herself within a massive monster-like plant. It’s an outstanding boss fight spectacle, though unfortunately the only boss fight of Ivy’s that players have had the pleasure of enjoying in the Arkhamverse. Moreover,
  <em>
   Asylum
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Assault on Arkham
  </em>
  tease an enemy faction of hers composed of anyone vulnerable to her pheromones as enslaved by her will, depicted by glowing green eyes and the body language of groaning zombies.

  only touches on the potential of pheromone-controlled enemies sparingly, and it’d be a letdown if no
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  game ever gets to explore it—let alone Poison Ivy in general—fully. There’s no telling whether Rocksteady or any other studio is currently developing a new
  <em>
   Arkham

  game, much less if it would feature Poison Ivy in a lead villain role, but few antagonist choices may be as thrilling in the Arkhamverse who haven’t already had a game’s narrative dedicated to them.

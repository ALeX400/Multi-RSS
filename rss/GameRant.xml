 <p>
  When players think about RPGs, they think about freedom of choice. Whether that's decisions about how their character acts, customizing how they look, or tailoring what they can do in combat. Some RPGs choose to focus on one of these aspects over all others, while some offer more limited choices in each area.

 <p>
  While they all have other strengths, the RPGs here all choose to put character-building in the hands of the player. The skill trees and skill systems in these games are a joy to behold, and each one allows players a wide range of branching choices to customize how they play their characters. These are the RPGs with gaming's most flexible skill trees.

  </strong>
  's Perk system has always been a skill tree of sorts. It wasn't laid out graphically like that until
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , but even before this, it was a branching system based on players' stat and skill investments. One of the best examples of its variety is in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout: New Vegas.

  ' iteration of this perk tree has a wide variety of choices, both useful and wacky, that can make fresh playthroughs feel vastly different. It's not flexible in the sense that characters can change on the fly, but it is flexible enough to help players carve distinct stories with each new character.

  's skill trees might be the best example of a flexible skill tree in the series. They strike a balance between the action-oriented skills of
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  and the more intricate and customizable skill trees of
  <em>
   Diablo 2.
  </em>
  Skill points can be spent freely and refunded easily, making experimentation easy.

 <p>
  Players get a huge variety of choices in how to build a character, able to take moves from each category in the tree, or focus on one attack move and load up with defensive skills, for example. How players choose to invest in passive skills and moves makes a big difference to character builds, even though gear also plays an important part.

  might seem like an odd choice since it doesn't include traditional skill trees. Skills are unlocked by progressing characters in their chosen Jobs. Yet, the addition to this system of mixing and matching moves a character has learned when they swap Jobs means players have just as much freedom in character building as if each character had their own branching paths.

 <p>
  Jobs can seem confusing at first, given their unique nature, but players will soon find that they roughly fit into either support, healer, magic damage, or physical damage-focused roles. That means that hybrids can be powerful, like hard physical hitters that can also buff attacks and crits.

 <p>
  Alternatively, players can create magic characters that can hit any enemy weakness, or jack-of-all-trades builds that can throw out heals or damage as needed. The only downside is the time investment needed for leveling up various Jobs.

  's skill trees are burnt into the minds of many gamers, the mere mention of it conjuring to mind the image of the Auroral sky behind constellation-like skill trees. The "level up what you use" approach to skill building means that players can make their chosen build viable with enough time investment.

  Admittedly, players have a habit of falling back on their go-to-builds like the Stealth Archer, but that doesn't mean that the variety isn't there. There aren't too many other games that let players fully spec into being a blacksmithing alchemist, after all.

  The massive skill tree of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Salt &amp; Sanctuary
   </em>
  </strong>
  is both intricate and interesting. It essentially takes the level requirement system from its Soulslike inspiration and translates that into skill tree form. This is how players level their weapon skills, how they get more healing, and how they specialize in magic if they choose.

 <p>
  This makes leveling up feel inherently valuable in

  , as the skill tree ends up defining how a character is built. There are tough choices to make, and no hope of filling out the hundreds of nodes available. Pre-planning skill investments are vital to making characters that stay viable throughout the game. Re-specing is possible, but characteristically tough.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  has inspired so many games' character classes and skill sheets that it's tough to keep count. Few games have translated the tabletop ethos of flexible character building into video game form as well as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  , though.

 <p>
  While character building in the game can be a little intimidating for newcomers,
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  enthusiasts will welcome the ability to dip into other classes when leveling, creating multi-class hybrids. Not every feature from the tabletop ruleset is recreated, characters are capped at level 12 and there are a few subclasses that missed out. Even so, it's still by far the best interpretation of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  skill trees in a game.

  Despite making great strides in adding readability and fun factor over the first
  <em>
   Nioh
  </em>
  game, many aspects of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Nioh 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  can still feel a little obtuse. The skill trees are a prime example of this, but what seems complex and dense at first can be a very versatile system once players get to grips with it.

 <p>
  There are trees for each weapon type, trees for the characters' core skills, and trees for both Ninjutsu (techniques) and Onmyo (Magic). Players earn points for each category of tree separately, too. Yes, it's a confusing system, but it's also one that lets players hone in on their preferred playstyle and augment it as they go.

  Most games don't get a second chance at creating a truly enjoyable skill tree or progression system. Still, that's exactly what
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 12
   </em>
  </strong>
  did with its re-release,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Zodiac Age.
   </em>
  </strong>
  Aimed almost entirely at addressing players' criticisms over the job board and license system,
  <em>
   The Zodiac Age
  </em>
  completely reworked how building characters and obtaining skills functioned.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":9,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":9,"nbrPlacementsScanned":9,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":340} -->
 <p>
  The result was a much more flexible system that gives players a lot of freedom over how they want to build a character while streamlining the process of actually acquiring skills. The fact that the game does this while still maintaining the tight, tactical, nature of the hybrid turn-based combat is a testament to
  <em>
   The Zodiac Age
  </em>
  being a fantastic remake.

 <p>
  Rarely in an ARPG has multi-classing felt as satisfying and viable as in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Grim Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  . That's mostly thanks to some expertly carved skill trees that offer a huge number of class combinations and numerous synergies to be discovered.
 </p>

 <p>
  The game signposts the multi-classing option from the get-go and makes it clear to the player that this is something to be encouraged and experimented with. The skill points system, which makes players choose between investing in core class stats or boosting skills with each point, leads to some interesting decision-making in character building.

  Even though it can be intimidating, it offers unparalleled flexibility. All characters start at different points of the same grid, so all nodes are theoretically available to build towards.

  On top of all the usual stat increases, players can also use the bath on the Gauntlet Runner to bath in bath salts to also increase any stat. The bath cask is found on the back deck of the Gauntlet Runner and can be done any night while at camp. Here's where to get every bath salt in the game, and what they do.

  Aside from the obvious choice of the Rainbow Bathblossom, players should head to Silento as soon as possible and
  <strong>
   stock up on either Uncle Electreux's Wondersalts or Niflheim Plunge
  </strong>
  , depending on if you're doing a physical or magic build. Buy as many of whichever works best for your build and only use those Bath Salts whenever you choose to spend free time on a bath to maximize the total damage you can do, as a Bath Salt is worth two levels.

  You'll want a healthy balance of also ranking up Royal Virtues at night, but players are given more than enough free time to max out all Virtues and still have many nights to further level up their stats to reach the max level.

  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  user recently posted a large Steam Points balance of 108,426 on a popular online forum, sparking ample debate around the considerable number and prompting other internet users to share their own balances. Steam is the world's largest platform for purchasing PC games, which means that millions of users log into their accounts every day, and even more sign up every year.

 <p>
  In the last few months, Steam has been under a ton of scrutiny for various reasons, including policy updates and new developer requirements. Earlier this year, Steam announced that the games purchased on the platform were only licenses, sparking outrage among many of the platform's users and triggering various online discussions about players' right of ownership.

  In a recent Reddit post by nutella_Bar69, the Redditor shared their father's large Steam Points balance, standing at a formidable 108,426. This started a considerable discussion among other Redditors, with hundreds of them sharing their views on the points system and posting their own balances. Such a massive reaction around a topic related to the platform isn't surprising, as earlier this year, Steam passed an incredible player milestone, reaching an outstanding 38,367,277 online users on a Sunday morning.

 <p>
  Along with discussing their own balance, the post shared by nutella_Bar69's prompted Redditors to raise a few great questions surrounding the use of Steam Points and whether they're worth anything. With Valve frequently making improvements to the Steam Market and adding new features here and there, it's not far-fetched to think that, at some point, Steam Points might be useful for more things aside from unlocking avatars, profile items, and purchasing backgrounds. This would be great news for users like nutella_Bar69 and other players who even reported to have upwards of 700,000 points in their Steam accounts.

 <p>
  At the moment, many Steam users reportedly agree that while having many points is certainly not a bad thing, their purpose and usability are somewhat limited. That said, with Steam releasing new updates for the Steam Deck and constantly innovating in other areas, it's hard to tell what the future holds for the company and its users.

  Although Steam remains at the forefront of everything that's related to PC gaming and the purchasing of AAA, AA, and Indie titles, the platform has faced a few rough spots over the year. This has mainly been due to various policy updates, including the one released on October 30th, in which Steam required developers to show a kernel-level anti-cheat software disclaimer on their storefronts if their games had one implemented. This might be good news for players who take their privacy seriously, but not so much so for developers whose sales might be affected by the disclaimer and players' widespread distrust of kernel-level anti-cheat software.

  Former Microsoft executive Sajid Farooq and prior
  <em>
   <strong>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  dev James Rackliffe have partnered with AAA game veterans to create ILHAM, a new game studio. The gaming industry has seen plenty of changes throughout the past couple of years, and some of the developers who have spent time shaping the landscape of the industry through AAA hits like Rockstar's
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  are making plans for newer projects using those skills.

 <p>
  There are plenty of factors that may have led creators to want to take a bit more control of the game development process that they have been an integral part of for a long time. Developers that have years of knowledge to share with rising talent appear to be putting more effort toward the creation of fresh IPs produced by new companies, such as Stig Asmussen's new studio Giant Skull, which is working on a new single-player action game with some of the talent behind the
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi
  </em>
  games. Another studio has been created with a new game on the way.

  Former Microsoft executive Dr. Sajid Farooq and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  developer James Rackliffe have founded ILHAM, a studio focused on producing titles with perspectives from Middle Eastern and Indian Subcontinental cultures. Farooq, a former DirectX lead, believes that gamers are craving fresh ideas, and he has partnered with Rackliffe, who has experience as an EA director and with technical QA work on modern gaming classic
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , to help prove that.

  The first game by ILHAM is described as an AA open-world survival title for PC and consoles, and the developers are intent on pushing "the limits of both the genre and the players themselves," signaling that the experience will not only contain plenty of depth, but challenges for experienced gamers to get something new out of. Although strong narrative-led games like
  <em>
   The Last of Us and Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  are highly-praised entries in the survival gaming genre, neither offers a glimpse into the slice of culture that ILHAM plans to offer with its new title.

 <p>
  Creating a survival title that boasts a compelling narrative along with complex and fulfilling gameplay mechanics is a difficult task, but many veteran developers appear to be banding together to form new studios with these goals. Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser created Absurd Ventures, which is intent on providing gamers with another fresh story-driven adventure IP. With ILHAM, James Rackliffe has expressed a desire to explore Middle Eastern lore and mysticism in a way that current games rarely explore. ILHAM's upcoming game could push gamers and developers alike into new territory.

    <ul>
     <li>
      Some items in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, like food and carvings, are not worth purchasing due to their lack of value.
     </li>
     <li>
      Common items like Clinging Morsel and Robust Loaf are better looted for free instead of being bought for gold.
     </li>
     <li>
      Players can save gold by avoiding purchasing valuables like Cheater's Deck and Rivani Moonshine, which can easily be found while exploring.

 <p>
  Plenty of handy and valuable items can be bought and sold in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  . When purchasing from merchants, players can find better armor, weapons, and even valuables that offer a boon when consumed, such as increased damage. All the items purchased in the game can be sold for some extra gold and to earn Strength points among the various Factions. That being said, certain items just aren’t worth the gold needed for that initial purchase in the first place.

 <p>
  If something doesn't have a specific purpose - such as the valuables that have buffs -, they likely aren’t worth buying, except for those desperate to earn some quick gold or Faction points. Here are some of the most
  <strong>
   notable items that players should avoid purchasing from merchants in

 <p>
  Despite food seeming like a useful item to have in a role-playing game, most of the food items picked up in
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  can’t be consumed. Just like the majority of the valuables in the game, the only use for them is to sell them to merchants to make some gold and earn some favor with one of the Factions.

 <p>
  The Specialty Provisions set players back 29 gold, but they don’t offer much of a reward in terms of Faction points or gold when you sell them. They can be found scattered around the world of Thedas, too, so there isn’t much point in purchasing them from merchants.

 <p>
  The Robust Loaf has the same problem as the Speciality Provisions in that it costs 29 gold but doesn’t give the player much in return when it is sold to a vendor. The only benefit that players might find with the loaf is that it is an uncommon item.

 <p>
  This means it will sell for a little more than common items and can earn a few additional action points here and there, especially from a Faction that has the most use for it. All that considered, the Robust Loaf still isn’t particularly worth the investment, as it is also an item that can be found when exploring.

  The Clinging Morsel is another common valuable that can easily be looted while playing
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . One thing to note here is that any and all breakable items in the game can contain valuables, as well as gold and upgrade materials. Different areas have more of a certain valuable scattered about in crates to collect once broken.

  There isn’t much of a point in purchasing items like the Clinging Morsel when a bunch of them can be obtained for free simply by getting a bit destructive during exploration.

  Smoked Sausages are similar to the Robust Loaf in that they aren’t as easy to find while out exploring. However, it isn’t impossible to happen upon them while looting. Because of this, it's not the best item to purchase from merchants.

 <p>
  33 gold might not seem like a lot, but it all adds up, and it just doesn’t make sense to purchase these tasty treats when players can loot them for free. However, if gamers are trying to impress the Faction that enjoys this item, it could be worth grabbing some from a vendor if they haven’t been able to find them lying around.

  The next few items might be a little controversial, as they offer some good Faction points when sold, such as this adorable wood carving of the hairless Nug critters from the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  world. These carvings will net players some extra Faction points with the woodland dwelling Veil Jumpers, but they can be found while exploring Arlathan Forest, which is where the Veil Jumpers reside anyway.

  It’s a common item, too, which means that there is much more of a chance of looting it while exploring. Players should save some gold and start breaking some crates to find some Nug Carvings rather than resorting to buying them.

  As with the Nug Carving, Dragon Carvings are also a pricier shop item that can be looted while out and about. However, these carvings are a little harder to find than the Nug ones, as they are uncommon.

  That being said, they still aren’t particularly rare. At 67 gold, there are much better ways to spend money with a merchant, especially when players can find a few of these carvings for themselves while looting and exploring.

  While the Cheater's Deck is noted to be uncommon, there are plenty of them hanging around the world in different locations, from Dock Town to Treviso. They cost a hefty 79 gold when purchasing them from merchants, and while they do offer a fair amount of Faction points, it’s not worth giving up hard-earned (and looted) gold to acquire them.

 <p>
  As with the other valuables here, players should simply do a bit of looting, destroying crates and breakables in the process, and these cards will pop up sooner or later.

 <p>
  Last but not least is the Rivani Moonshine valuable, which costs 87 gold when purchasing it from a merchant. As this is a rare item, it’s the least likely to be found out of all the valuables discussed so far. However, it isn’t impossible to find, especially when exploring the Rivani Coast or the Hall of Valor in Rivain.

 <p>
  This is an item that goes down particularly well when sold to the Faction merchant for the Lords of Fortune, which isn’t too surprising seeing as they are based in Rivain and are partial to a drink or two. However, for players who aren’t desperate to level up their reputation with the Lords of Fortune, there is no reason to spend almost 100 gold on this item.

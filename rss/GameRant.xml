 <p>
	The world of
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is quite vast in terms of exploration and lore. Players have over 10 sub-regions to explore and, despite having the opportunity to unlock the areas by themselves, there are some which can only be explored through quests. These kinds of quests are called exploration quests, and they give players extra rewards, in-game tools, and background into the lore of the regions.

 <p>
	The
	<strong>
	 Stygian Lacrimosa quest
	</strong>
	in
	<em>
	 Wuthering Waves
	</em>
	is the main quest chain that unlocks Fallen Grave. The area is inexplorable before the quest as there is a massive sandstorm that covers the whole region. Because of this, the quest is rather lengthy and will require players to cleanse the area to break the storm. There is also a boss fight towards the end, which can be a little difficult, so follow this guide to successfully finish the mission.

 <p>
	After triggering the Stygian Lacrimosa quest, follow the navigation until you meet a researcher named Jiuyue. He’s the one who will follow the Rover on their quest to remove the sandstorm. To kick-start the removal of the sandstorm, you will first need to find his backpack, which will be hidden in front of a rock. Just head to the navigation location and look for a gray rock parallel to a tree.

	Once you have equipped the new device, you can begin to use it to cleanse the enemies of the buffs they gain from the mud. It will be hard to defeat all the Tacet Discords (TDs) as you make your way to the suppressors. The mud acts as a shield, so it’s a must to remove them, which you can do by clicking the button in the direction of the enemies. This will release a water vortex and destroy all enemies in the area.

	Activate And Guard The Suppressors
 </h3>
 <p>
	There are three Suppressor Devices that players need to be activated as you come to the end of the quest, and the devices need to reach a 100% activation rate for the challenge to be completed. During the challenge, players will be faced with hoards of TDs that will be attracted to the energy of the device. You need to actively be prepared whenever an enemy spawns as you have to kill it instantly. Taking too long will reset the challenge, and you’ll have to start over.

 <p>
	In addition to the enemies that will spawn, blobs of mud will also be thrown around the field. You will need to use
	<strong>
	 the Water Vortex from the Ultrasonic Pulse Chip
	</strong>
	to
	<strong>
	 cleanse that as well
	</strong>
	. There will be instances where multiple puddles of mud will be thrown; you will need to angle your vortex attacks to
	<strong>
	 hit all of them at once
	</strong>
	since it takes too long for the tool to cooldown and clear them one by one.

	As you follow the navigation after completing the previous mission, remember to cleanse the mud along the way. You’ll then enter a cave and see a broken mural that needs to be restored. The pieces will be scattered in various orders for each player, so refer to the above image for clarification on what it should look like.

 <p>
	The Mourning Aix is an Avian TD, which means it uses its ability to fly as an advantage and if you take too long to kill it, or get caught up in its vortex, it can deal an ultimate move that could oneshot your character. Players should always dodge the minute it raises its wings - this is an indicator of a three-move attack that will deal significant damage to your resonator.

 <p>
	Rovers should also carry a healer in their party just to be safe. Sometime during the fight, the Rover will transform into an Avian TD as well and fly beside the Mourning Aix Boss. You’ll need to aim and shoot bullets at it to bring it down to finish the fight and bring the quest to an end.

	One of the most surprising launches that acclaimed game developer, Bethesda, did in 2024 was the mobile game
	<strong>
	 <em>
		The Elder Scrolls: Castles
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. This spin-off title’s core gameplay is overseeing a castle in Tamriel, ensuring one’s subjects are satisfied, heirs are up to snuff, and one’s warriors are well-equipped for their battles.
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls: Castles
	</em>
	is essentially a management simulator with combat elements, and it shares some DNA with another mobile Bethesda title:
	<em>
	 Fallout Shelter
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	This game isn’t
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls
	</em>
	franchise’s first foray into smartphone gaming. It released
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls Legends
	</em>
	, a collectible card game, and
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls: Blades
	</em>
	, a linear action RPG with roguelike elements. These games have seen moderate success so far, but it seems like Bethesda wants this beloved console and PC franchise to become even more successful in the mobile market. As such, it took a page from
	<em>
	 Fallout Shelter
	</em>
	, one of its more popular games for the format, to create
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls: Castles
	</em>
	.

	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls: Castles
	</em>
	shares a core gameplay mechanic with
	<em>
	 Fallout Shelter
	</em>
	, which is management simulation. In
	<em>
	 Fallout Shelter
	</em>
	, the player is the vault overseer who ensures that their growing number of vault dwellers get enough power, food, and water. They can upgrade their vault by adding new rooms with different functions.
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls: Castles
	</em>
	works similarly. The player is a ruler of a kingdom in Tamriel and they’re tasked to keep their subjects well-fed, productive, and happy.

 <p>
	The player can also build new rooms with different purposes. Some Work Stations create resources, like Oil Presses and Mills. Others improve happiness, like art studios and bookcases. There are also ones that unlock certain features, like the War Table, which lets the player send their adventurers off on epic missions. Apart from base building,
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls: Castles
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Fallout Shelter
	</em>
	have a bunch of other similarities.

 <p>
	At their core,
	<em>
	 The Elder Scrolls: Castles

	and
	<em>
	 Fallout Shelter
	</em>
	are all about keeping their constituents alive and well. Each subject and dweller has unique traits and stats that one can optimize for different roles. For
	<em>
	 Fallout Shelter
	</em>
	, their capabilities are determined by their SPECIAL (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) stats, while the subjects in
	<em>

	have health, armor, and combat stats. They have separate traits, which further define their role in the castle.

The combat in this game is also more in-depth, letting the player have more control over their characters in battle compared to

	. However, only time will tell if this game will reach the heights of its highly successful peer.

			<title>Intercept Games Begins Layoffs Despite Take-Two Comments</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	Earlier this month, Take-Two’s CEO Strauss Zelnick responded to rumors that the company was shuttering OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games amid cost-cutting measures. Internal documentation from Bloomberg showed that Take Two was proposing to shutter Roll7 but did not mention Intercept Games. Zelnick said the company did not shutter its studios but instead rolled out a cost-reduction plan to save $165 million “in existing and future costs” by cutting spending, canceling projects, and laying off 5% of its staff.

 <p>
	Though details surrounding
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Silent Hill: Townfall
	 </em>
	</strong>
	are still shrouded in mystery, its teaser trailer could hold clues for a long-standing series trope making its return with a new twist. Announced alongside
	<em>
	 Silent Hill Ascension
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Silent Hill F
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	seemed to be another shift in design and style for the franchise with rumors suggesting the upcoming game would be an episodic anthology. So, while developer No Code has teased
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	news for later this year, fans have been left in the dark about what to expect from
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	, such as its story, characters, and gameplay.

 <p>
	However,
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	’s teaser trailer might have hinted at one possible gameplay mechanic inspired by various games throughout the franchise that could feature in this anthology. With the long-running use of radio static, best known in games like
	<em>
	 Silent Hill 2
	</em>
	and its upcoming remake, the television radio and mysterious transmissions from the trailer could indicate this feature will return in
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	. Combined with more recent games’ interpretations of
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	’s radios, such as
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Homecoming
	</em>
	’s two-way radio transceiver or
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Shattered Memories
	</em>
	smartphone,
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	could be teasing a new creative take on this series’ trope.

	Understanding the Evolving Legacy of Silent Hill’s Radio
 </h3>
 <p>
	While even the first
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	included a radio as a key item, it is best remembered from
	<em>
	 Silent Hill 2
	</em>
	as a gameplay mechanic to alert players via radio static to nearby enemies. Since then, radios have appeared in virtually all
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	games, though with some slight variations, ranging from
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Downpour
	</em>
	swapping radio static for police dispatch messages to
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Shattered Memories
	</em>
	’ immersive use of the Wii Remote’s built-in speaker. Yet despite these minor gameplay differences,
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	’s radio continues to play an important role in fleshing out each game’s eerie, surreal, and otherworldly atmosphere.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":444} -->
 <p>
	But the radio's evolution across recent
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	games has potentially proven that it could help enhance the player’s experience beyond unsettling them or warning them about enemies. For example, one of
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Shattered Memories
	</em>
	' features replaced the radio with a phone which let players dial in-game numbers, listen to voicemails, or even contact other characters, the last of which was also possible with
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Homecoming
	</em>
	's and
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Downpour
	</em>
	's walkie-talkies. Moreover,
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Downpour
	</em>
	and the short-lived
	<em>
	 PT
	</em>
	included traditional radio broadcasts as another means of world-building through news stories, song requests, and strange messages.

 <p>
	Based on these recent games and the evolving use of radios throughout the
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	franchise, it seems likely that No Code will follow this trend, especially when
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	’s trailer was full of secrets with a television radio as its focus. In addition to the likeliest return of radio static as per most other
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	games, the additional functionality of a television radio could provide new ideas for
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	to explore. Inspired by earlier
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	games and other horror series, the list below outlines several approaches
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	could take with its television radio.

	<li>
	 Receive news broadcasts, similar to

	<li>
	 Talk to characters or listen to their messages, similar to
	 <em>
		Silent Hill: Shattered Memories
	 </em>
	 and
	 <em>
		Silent Hill: Homecoming
	 </em>
	 .
	</li>
	<li>
	 "Sightjack" enemies alongside hearing radio static, inspired by a similar mechanic in the
	 <em>

 <p>
	Beyond these possibilities, however, should its anthology rumors turn out to be true, these options could be easily reworked to connect
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	's potential stories and characters. For instance,
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	could allow characters from across the game to either directly contact one another or indirectly learn about key events or plot points via news stories and recordings. As a result, with No Code's previous games,
	<em>
	 Observation
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Stories Untold
	</em>
	, showcasing its potential for horror-like, subversive narratives and challenging puzzles, the growing potential behind
	<em>
	 Silent Hill
	</em>
	's radio could finally shine through in
	<em>
	 Silent Hill: Townfall
	</em>
	.

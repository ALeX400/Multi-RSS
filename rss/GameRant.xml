      <title>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra’s Ensemble Cast is a Gamble That Could Pay Dividends</title>

 <p>
  On paper, a single-player Avengers ensemble game with Captain America, Thor, and Hulk would be all that die-hard fans desire since it’d mean they get to play as their favorite characters and indulge in fantastic powers. There’d be obvious balancing requirements to ensure that each character that players swap to is unique and fun to play as, but the unmistakable draw would certainly be how iconic each character is—a route

  It’s still unclear precisely how gameplay will take shape in
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  , though it reportedly being a single-player ensemble game with four playable characters is beyond exciting to fathom design-wise.
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  has enough to ponder about without any further marketing if Skydance chose to lay low for a while, but seeing gameplay will be wholly illuminating regarding what players can actually expect. Regardless, if
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  ’s choice of playable characters works well in its favor, it could open the door to many previously preposterous ensemble combinations in future Marvel games.

  bumping Mary Jane Watson up to a deuteragonist rather than a character with a couple of playable sequences might’ve received an adverse reaction, but it also might’ve allowed MJ to blossom as her own character further if players spent as much time with her as they did a wall-crawler.
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  will presumably dodge this pitfall by having Gabriel and Nanali be essential in gameplay and in doing so it will be impossible to refute their importance in the story.

     In fact, Gabriel Jones wielding a rifle could suggest that his gameplay may turn
     <em>
      Marvel 1943
     </em>
     into a full-blown WW2-era shooter when it comes time to play as him, while playing as Nanali could logically turn the game into a stealth-based adventure title not unlike
     <em>
      Assassin’s Creed
     </em>
     .
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Speaking of Ubisoft’s history-leaping stealth-adventure series,
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Shadows
  </em>
  has players swapping back and forth between Naoe and Yasuke—even if the ability to do so isn’t unlocked until ~10 hours into the game—and a comparable approach in
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  might allow players to adopt the specific playstyle they prefer between Steve Rogers’ Captain America, Azzuri’s Black Panther, Gabriel Jones, and Nanali. However, unless Skydance has something truly emergent planned, it would be difficult to imagine anyone choosing Gabriel or Nanali over either Captain America or Black Panther when given the chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s why, against all odds,
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  needs to commit to its divisive choice and sell players on gameplay between four characters who couldn’t be more different when it comes to their loadouts and abilities. Nanali is perhaps the biggest wild card at the moment since she’s only seen with a lone retractable baton, but as a Wakandan spy she’ll naturally have stealth capabilities that could pair her well with Black Panther while Gabriel arming himself with a firearm may make him a natural fit with Captain America in action-packed set-piece sequences.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as they’re all distinct enough from one another,
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  could be tremendously meaningful for how it thrusts characters who are niche or less mechanically appealing into the same echelon as Marvel’s most revered and ubiquitous heroes. Future ensemble Marvel games have the potential to be phenomenal with all of their playable characters being incredibly high-profile and well-known, but
  <em>
   Marvel 1943
  </em>
  has a rare opportunity to tell an authentic story and elevate Gabriel and Nanali to the level of Captain America and Black Panther.

  The

 <p>
  The minimum
  <em>

  Friendship level to use the Lucky Trinket is Great Friends. There is also no way to use the Lucky Trinket on an in-game Friend with whom you already share the Lucky Friend status. You still have to fulfill the distance requirement of 100 meters with your Friend.

      <title>Troy Baker Shouldn’t Be the Only Last of Us Alum to Join Naughty Dog’s New Game</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/intergalactic-last-of-us-troy-baker-ashley-johnson-naughty-dog-new-game/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  In no small part of the studio itself, Naughty Dog’s upcoming slate is difficult to nail down.
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  have been Naughty Dog’s bread and butter for quite a while with complementary remasters, remakes, and ports releasing thereafter, and with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
   </em>
  </strong>
  now revealed it will be interesting to see if either
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is kept around in the meantime. Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann has been asked often about what to expect from
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  as of late with answers that are neither reassuring nor condemning, but it would seem as if there may be at least one or two games in development at Naughty Dog that haven’t been revealed yet,
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  not included.

 <p>
  Before
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  was announced, it was confirmed that Troy Baker would be playing a role in a “Druckmann’s new project at Naughty Dog.” Now, it would seem plain that Baker has earned a role in
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  and not a yet-to-be-announced Naughty Dog game as Druckmann is writer and director on the upcoming sci-fi game. Either way, while his casting is sure to be inspired, it would be equally exciting if
  <em>
   Last of Us
  </em>
  co-star Ashley Johnson joined him.

 <p>
  Unlike Troy Baker, who adopts a gravelly tone for Joel, Ashley Johnson is synonymous with Ellie.
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  may center around Joel predominantly, but even the original game has Ellie be a focal point that the story naturally adheres to as it progresses.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  ’ harrowing sequel is obviously where Ellie is able to stretch her limbs, but the performances in both games are remarkably similar in their depth of emotion, which is especially outstanding considering that Johnson plays a character who is 14 in
  <em>
   Part 1
  </em>
  and 19 in
  <em>
   Part 2
  </em>
  . Because there may not be another
  <em>
   Last of Us
  </em>
  game to follow Ellie’s journey further, Naughty Dog not casting Johnson for a role in
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  or another upcoming game would be a travesty.

     Plus, even if there will inevitably be a
     <em>
      Part 3
     </em>
     , it’s incredibly likely that a third
     <em>
      Last of Us
     </em>
     game would be the franchise’s last with how much ambiguity surrounds it.

 <p>
  A
  <em>
   Last of Us Part 3
  </em>
  would surely conclude open-endedly if Druckmann has his way, and yet the series seems as if it’s already on borrowed time with regard to how little certainty there is that it could continue in any capacity beyond HBO’s television adaptation. Rather, Naughty Dog might be prepared to invest itself fully into
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  and whatever Shaun Escayg may or may not be helming—assuming the recent rumors are true—and in doing so it will hopefully have a part in mind for Johnson to play.

  It’s perfectly possible that Troy Baker could eventually reprise his role as Samuel Drake in an upcoming
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  game, especially with fresh rumors of a new
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  installment being helmed by
  <em>
   The Lost Legacy
  </em>
  ’s Shaun Escayg, while a
  <em>
   Last of Us
  </em>
  prequel focusing on Joel and Tommy’s early outbreak days seems less likely due to the franchise’s ambiguous longevity. That said, there’s also merit in
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  at least largely debuting a cast of characters whose actors are all new to Naughty Dog games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jordan A. Mun’s Tati Gabrielle is certainly no stranger to Naughty Dog after having starred in Sony’s
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  movie as well as the second season of HBO’s
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , to be fair. But, having her play the lead in
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  will give the game the novelty it needs to cleave cleanly from the iconic portrayals and performances that Naughty Dog has fostered in previous games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless she plays a wildly different character or assumes an unnatural voice, it’s possible that casting Ashley Johnson again so soon after
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  would only lend itself to players hearing Ellie’s voice and not someone new. Regardless, Johnson absolutely deserves to have as many roles as Naughty Dog can provide her with, and it’ll be exciting to see if she does end up playing a character in
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  alongside Baker if
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  truly is the Naughty Dog game he’ll appear in next.

      <title>Destiny 2 Weekly Reset: New Nightfall, Challenges, and Rewards</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Updated April 1, 2025:
   </em>
  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset.
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Guardian Games has officially come to a close, cementing Titans as the big winner for this year. However, for most players, the biggest news is that Act 3 has finally begun.

 <p>
  Unlike previous episodic content, there isn't any downtime between Acts 2 and 3, so players can jump right in and experience the battle for the Echo of Navigation. As many saw in an accidental sneak preview of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Rite of the Nine, the newest activity launches during this act and likely no longer drops unfinished weapons with unintentional perk combinations. Interestingly enough, Bungie is also adding a new PvP mode called Heavy Metal, which adds Drakes and Brigs vehicles to add a bit of chaos to matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's plenty to do this week alongside the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  weekly reset, which brings with it the usual refreshed content, activities, and rewards for players to chase over the next week. For a complete look at all the new content available for the week of April 1, including Nightfalls, Crucible modes, and challenges, here is everything players need to know.

  Saint-14 and the Trails of Osiris offer players a high-end PvP activity in exchange for powerful rewards. Starting with Episode Heresy, Bungie made getting to the Lighthouse easier, while still offering top-tier rewards for those who can achieve a winning streak. Similar to most vendors in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , Saint-14 has a reputation system that rewards players for ranking up through playing and completing bounties.

  Before the April 2
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  Direct broadcast, Nintendo stated that two Nintendo Treehouse: Live events would be held on April 3 and 4, starting at 10:00 AM Eastern. The Nintendo Treehouse broadcasts will feature hands-on gameplay of some Switch 2 games, but what those are remains a mystery at the time of this writing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The news of the Nintendo Treehouse events is the latest entry in a busy week for the company. On March 31, the Nintendo Today app revealed another look at the Switch 2's console and controller layouts, which showed how the system could be played in Handheld, Tabletop, and Docked modes. The image posted by Nintendo Today also showed one of the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers lying on the side, which could reference the controller's assumed mouse-mode functionality. Further details about the Switch 2 console, including a potential release date and pricing, will be publicized during an April 2 Nintendo Direct.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the hours leading up to the highly anticipated Switch 2 Nintendo Direct episode, Nintendo confirmed that more events for the console will happen this week. On social media, Nintendo of America stated that two Nintendo Treehouse: Live broadcasts will air on April 3 and 4, starting each day at 10:00 AM Eastern. The Treehouse streams will share hands-on gameplay of some Switch 2 games, but what those games are remains a mystery. Nintendo did not state how long each Nintendo Treehouse broadcast would last, but past episodes have ranged from 30 to 90 minutes across the years. The April 4 episode of Nintendo Treehouse: Live will happen on the same day as the first Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in-person event in New York City, held at the Center415 venue in Manhattan.

  Nintendo Treehouse: Live Is Coming Back On April 3 and 4
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Two Nintendo Treehouse: Live events will be held on April 3 and 4, starting at 10:00 AM Eastern.
  </li>
  <li>
   The Treehouse will focus on Switch 2 hands-on gameplay of various games, but further details remain elusive.
  </li>
  <li>
   The latter Treehouse will coincide with the Switch 2's first in-person event in New York City.
  </li>
  <li>
   Nintendo will reveal more Switch 2 information during the April 2 Nintendo Direct.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Given that a new
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  game for the Switch 2 was confirmed during the January teaser video, it stands to reason that it may be shown off during the Nintendo Treehouse event. Though the original Switch will still see the release of games like
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4: Beyond
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , it remains to be seen if the Nintendo Treehouse broadcasts will show any backward-compatible Switch games running on Switch 2 or if exclusive titles will be the only focus.

  Leo (Leon) Kamiyama is one of the Phantom Idols that players can pick from the Gacha Banners in
  <em>
   Persona 5: The Phantom X.
  </em>
  Leon is a Nuclear Strategist, who can switch from causing damage to buffing and generating shields for his party. Players can identify this meta character for his Super Sentai-style design, and for being part of most of the recommended builds in the game. And there's a good reason why Leon is always present in the most powerful team compositions: His buffs are the best for an offensive strategy.

 <p>
  However, building him can be pretty tricky, since his priority stats and skills are a little difficult to max out. That's why players should take a look at this guide, which summarizes all Leon's main skills, passives, Awareness Rank perks, as well as recommended weapons, revelation cards, and Team Compositions. First, let's take a look at how Leon's kit will help players during combat, and his Persona's main passive.

 <p>
  Leon is an S-Tier Strategist in
  <em>
   Persona 5: The Phantom X
  </em>
  , which means he specializes in buffing the party and attacking when necessary. His main passive is '
  <strong>
   Hyper Hero Time!
  </strong>
  ' an aura buff that activates 'Power of Friendship' when party members drop below 75% of their HP. It can stack up to 2 times, and it will increase the total attack power of a party member based on Leon's own attack. Leon also specializes in raising the Party's critical chance and power, by using multiple skills and his Highlight.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's an overview of Leon's abilities, passives, and Awareness perks in
  <em>
   Persona 5: The Phantom X:
  </em>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Atomic Smash
   </strong>
   : Deals Nuclear damage to 1 foe equal to 112.0% of Leon's Attack. For each stack of Power of Friendship the party has, its damage increases by 10%.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Ultima Booster
   </strong>
   : Increases 1 ally's Attack by 12.8% for 2 turns (other than Kamiyama). For each stack of Power of Friendship the target has, it increases the party member's Attack by 20% of Kamiyama's Attack up to 994.6 (the cap increases with the skill level).
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Justice Barrier
   </strong>
   : Drains 30% of an ally's remaining HP to grant them a shield equal to 80% of HP spent + 20.7% of Kamiyama's Attack + 67 for 2 turns. It also grants 1 Power of Friendship stack. (Total amount of generated shield increases with Kamiyama's Persona Skill levels).
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Thief Tactics
   </strong>
   : Leon's
   <strong>
    Highlight
   </strong>
   is a party buff that grants the maximum number of Power of Friendship stacks to Kamiyama and another ally for 2 turns. If the target's HP is below 60%, it restores HP up to 60% (up to 200% of Kamiyama's Attack). It also increases Attack by 15% of Kamiyama's Attack up to 384.0 for 2 turns (the cap increases with Thief Tactics Level).
   <strong>
    1 More
   </strong>
   : Deals Nuclear damage to 1 foe
   <strong>
    Melee Attack
   </strong>
   : Deals Physical damage to 1 foe.
   <strong>
    Ranged Attack
   </strong>
   : Deals Gun damage to 1 foe and can be shot until out of ammo.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Energy Recharge
   </strong>
   : When the Justice Barrier effect ends, it restores HP equal to 33.3% of the remaining shield (66% at skill level 2, 100% at skill level 3).
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Full Power: Start!
   </strong>
   - Increase allies' critical damage by 15.0% when they have 2 Power of Friendship stacks. (Increases to 20% at skill level 2, and 25% at skill level 3).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip" data-nosnippet="">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_8">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>
     Kamiyama's Justice Barrier consumes the target's HP in exchange for a shield. The tradeoff is approximately 1.4 times the amount of HP taken, which increases to 1.6, and finally 1.8 as Leon reaches the Attack power cap admitted by the skill. It's a prime ability to buff characters like Mont (Kotone Montagne) since her Assassin kit is based on extremely effective single-target nukes that can be released at full power when she reaches a certain amount of Ice Crystal charges. She can benefit from getting 2 stacks of Power of Friendship early and the 15% increased Critical Damage that comes with this buff being at max stacks.

  Players should prioritize leveling Ultima Booster and Justice Barrier to the maximum possible, then Thief Tactics. Leave Atomic Smash for last, as Leon's priority is to buff the party, not being an attacker. Leon becomes more powerful the stronger his allies are, and a combination of Leon and Mont, or Leon and Skull, are two deadly duos that can wipe out enemies in only a few turns.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Final Buster
  </strong>
  : Is the most coveted weapon for Leon in P5X, and being a 5-Star draw from the Weapon Gacha, it brings the best stats and passives to the table. This spear increases Leon's Attack by 30.0%. After using a skill on an ally, the target will receive one of the following buffs: Increased Attack by 16.0% (1 turn). Increased critical damage by 16.0% (1 turn). If the target has 2 or more Power of Friendship stacks, it grants both buffs and increases the shield effects Kamiyama grants by 10.0% more for 1 turn. From all the available 5-Star weapons Phantom Idols can equip, Final Buster is one of the most broken, changing considerably how effective Leon's buffs are.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Justice Lance
  </strong>
  : Is the second-best option for players who haven't had the luck of drawing a 5-Star just yet (or for those who prioritized other 5-Star weapons when they received their free 5-Star Weapon box). This weapon can be obtained by spending 10 Gecko Coins in the Airsoft Shop at Shibuya Central Street. It increases Leon's shields by 8.8%. After using a skill on an ally, it increases Leon's Attack by 9.0% for 1 turn. For every 20% HP the target loses, Kamiyama's Attack increases by 20%. It's a decent weapon, though not as good as Final Buster, but still, it will suffice for an optimized Strategist build.

     All weapon Perks increase in power when the Forge levels increase. Forge levels can be ranked up by spending a unit of the same weapon, or a similar quality weapon. In some cases, further levels can be improved with a weapon of a lesser grade (for example, a 4-star weapon can be leveled to Forge 2 by using a 3-star weapon, but in the next level, it will need another 4-star weapon to rank up).

  <strong>
   Power &amp; Growth
  </strong>
  is the perfect set of Revelation Cards for Leon in P5X, since it greatly enhances his Attack %, and grants a solid 12% base Attack increase, plus an extra 10% every 6 turns of battle. This means that Leon's barriers and buffs will grow stronger and stronger the longer the battle lasts, and for bosses like Shadow Miyazawa, this strategy is the best. Power Cards greatly increase Attack, Speed, and even SP recovery, all good stats to have with Leon, while the Growth Mind card grants Base HP and Increased Health %, which will make Leon more durable.

  <strong>
   Skull and Leon
  </strong>
  make a great pair, since Ryuji's Persona skill Wounded Glory will increase his damage the more HP he is missing. Using Justice Barrier on Skull will chip away his HP, until he is nearly at 10 %, and has a lot of barrier to compensate for it. Players can concentrate in dealing a ton of damage with their skills until the Justice Barrier timer runs out, and he is healed. Then, begin the rotation again, with Power &amp; Growth Revelation Cards active in both characters; the longer the battle lasts, the more damage this duo will cause. Adding Riddle (Haruna) to the party can help Leon and Skull reach maximum Attack %, which increases their synergy even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the definitive Power Couple in
  <em>
   Persona 5: The Phantom X
  </em>
  are Kotone Montagne and Leo Kamamiya. Leon's buffs greatly empower Kotone's decisive Nuke (Parhelion + Durandal of Ice combo) by increasing her critical damage and damage output by a whopping 50% (calculated based on the Power of Friendship buff at max stacks at Leon's skill level 3). Starting the battle with Leon as the first in line will secure a first buff of Kotone with Justice Barrier, then in the next round, Ultima Booster will prime her for a powerful follow-up. Meanwhile, players can Stack Ice Crystals and attain Parhelion, just in time for unleashing a Durandal of Ice at max power, thanks to Leon's buffs.

  Suburbia will be unlocked once players have passed getting Rio. Collecting the S-K-A-T-E icons first is a great way to understand how to traverse a map and learn where its various points are. At the very start of the level, players will notice an ice cream truck. There will also be a ramp in the middle of the cul-de-sac, and directly ahead of that ramp, another ramp with the S icon in view. The S icon is not floating above it but instead will be sitting above a fence with some planks players can grind to get to it.
 </p>
 <p>
  After players get the S icon, they will see an empty pool after clearing the fence. Turn left to see a house with a ramp up against it. Go around this house to find an incline you can skate up. Follow this route to the roof of the house, and you will find a ramp on the right-hand side with the K icon in the middle of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking from this ramp will give a clear view of some structures, many ramps, and some Halloween decorations. There is also the A icon on the far side sitting at the top of a table that has been flipped on its side.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the bottom of the ramp below the A icon, there is a white arrow. Head to the house this arrow points towards. The T icon is along the front gate of this house. Grunt along the rail below this icon and follow it down and back onto the street. Head in a straight line where this rail ends to go straight to a ramp with the E icon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having to go high and low to collect all these icons is reminiscent of the SKATE collectible from the Canada level.

  Follow the pathway opened by the thin man. This will lead players over to a ramp. Ramp up and over to the right to enter another area of the map. Players will see there is a window up in the house.
 </p>
 <p>
  Build up momentum by ramping up the opposite side of the house and then up into the house through this window. Break out the window on the other side and grind the flagpole to get the Secret Tape on the other end. Be sure to land the grind, as you will need to land 500 of them for a trophy/achievement.

  Stat Points were an important element for the PS2 title, and they still are for the remaster. Players may already have 2 of the Stat Points already just by following this guide. Here is a rundown of each of them:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   One will be collected while following the secret pathway to get the Secret Tape. Specifically in using the ramp.
  </li>
  <li>
   The second is sitting on the top of a rail near the axe icon. Players can get onto this ramp by heading to the E icon from the manor.
  </li>
  <li>
   The last Stat Point is visible when starting the level. Head over to the house it is floating in front of and ramp up the side of this building’s archway up to it.
  </li>
 </ul>

  There are also 4 money icons players can grab. Again, players can use the challenges above to easily locate their locations.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The first can be obtained by heading to the axe icon and using the ramp in front of it, then jumping and grinding the fence to get the money icon.
  </li>
  <li>
   The second can be obtained by heading to the cables to restore power to the dish and jumping over to it as you ride the cables.
  </li>
  <li>
   Go through the Thin Man’s passageway, and you will find the third money icon by using the ramp in the corner.
  </li>
  <li>
   The last one can be seen from the roof while getting the K icon. Players will need to hit a ramp towards the front of the plane to get to it.
  </li>
 </ul>

  From the start of the level, ride along the street so that you are under the K icon. There is a pumpkin sitting below this icon on the street. Ride over it to smash it. Head to the ramps with the Halloween decorations and grind from the first ramp used in the earlier challenge to smash the second pumpkin along the way. The third pumpkin is sitting to the left of the front door of the manor, just past the T icon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Head to the pool behind the house with the K icon to find a pumpkin on the ramp before the corner ramp. Head up the ramp to the K icon and grind the rails to the house with the dish on top. Skate along the wall to find the final pumpkin.

  Just like with Foundry, players will need to unlock the secret area and then ride to the highest point to get the Logo icon. The Logo icon can be seen at the top of the manor. Use the secret passage, and as you leave it, use the ramp opposite you to get to a higher platform. Repeat this climb up to the roof to get the Logo icon.

  There are numerous Pro Goals for the most skilled of players to aim for. This includes the arduous Platinum Score. This is a score that goes beyond the usual challenges and will need plenty of combos to chain together. This is not something that can simply be explained.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will need to put in the time and effort to develop the skills and sense of awareness required first. There are 2 great areas for some ramp tricks, namely the ramps by the Halloween decorations and through the garage where the final pumpkin is. Luckily, Suburbia is a great Free Skate location in the game.

 </p>
 <h3 id="manual-around-the-sac">
  Manual Around the Sac

 <p>
  To successfully manual around the cul-de-sac will require skill and patience. Players may need to change characters to have enough stats to pull this off.
 </p>
 <h3 id="impress-the-skaters">
  Impress the Skaters
 </h3>
 <p>
  Skaters can be found in the following locations. Head to them and impress each of them:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   By the ramps near the final pumpkin.
  </li>
  <li>
   To the left of the A icon.
  </li>
  <li>
   On the construction site near the axe icon.
  </li>
  <li>
   Through the secret passage to the ramps, you need to get to the Secret Tape.
  </li>
  <li>
   On the roof of the manor.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="pizza-guy-in-the-abyss">
  Pizza Guy in the Abyss
 </h3>
 <p>
  This can be obtained by heading to the front door of the manor and jumping in when it swings open enough. Players will need to be quick. While this concludes Suburbia’s challenges, there are still many more levels ahead.

 <p>
  Simmers will be able to explore Innisigreen after obtaining
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  Enchanted by Nature expansion pack. It's a world full of Fairies, where players can choose to live in one of the
  <strong>
   10 Residential Lots
  </strong>
  with unique and natural designs. Innisigreen also has
  <strong>
   four Public Lots
  </strong>
  : a Lounge, a Museum, a Bar, and a Park. The Lots are scattered around three main areas: Coast of Adhmor, Sprucedeery Grove, and Everdew.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Lot Trait will also be available within the Lot’s description, which is the
  <strong>
   Fairy Passage
  </strong>
  . Applying the Trait makes any Lot a frequent visit point for Fairies, which can help players with completing the Fairy Aspirations in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  .

  Thanks to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  Enchanted by Nature expansion pack, Simmers can become Fairies and explore a uniquely designed world. The mystical creatures offer one-of-a-kind CAS additions, where players’ Sims can stand out from other townies, whether it is the head accessories, the glowing tattoos, or the wings in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The addition of wings is a turning point, bringing back
  <em>
   The Sims 3
  </em>
  color wheel control. The Wing Paint Mode will allow players to express their creative streaks, transforming it into their own canvas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being in perfect sync with nature, Fairies will enhance Simmers' Gardening skills by offering various unique ways to tend to their Gardens, especially when they focus on upgrading the Nature section of their Ability. These enhancements can be done by accessing the Fairy’s Ability tree and spending Ability Points.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fairies are sensitive creatures that survive on their Emotional Force needs. If players fail to keep it in check, Fairies can die from an Emotional Overload in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The Balance and Imbalance system introduces how a Sims’ mood can affect their lifestyle as they grow up. A child with more frequent good moods will lean towards a Balanced status, while a child with frequent mood shifts and a bad temper will lean towards Imbalance, and in severe cases, it will peak at Very Imbalanced.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can fix the Imbalance status to a Balanced one if they work on their Sims’ moods and needs, since Imbalanced Sims will be hard to deal with, requiring more attention and care in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  .

  Luck is one of many systems introduced in the Enchanted by Nature EP. Sims who are lucky are generally more inclined to succeed in any of their endeavors, like careers, Foraging items, Gnomes' approval, and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlucky Sims, on the other hand, are the complete opposite and will constantly face failure in any activity and encounter many hazards.

  Fables are special requests only available in the Innisigreen world. Simmers need to speak with one of the six available Fabulists and choose to Acquire a Fable to start the request. You can find out more about Fabulists by reading the Fable Board.
 </p>
 <p>
  These Fables are like riddles where you need to solve them to earn various rewards. It’s very similar to Cottage Living’s errands system if you're familiar with it.

  Having fresh ways to embrace Mother Nature will expose Sims to all kinds of Fairies’ illnesses in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . The Enchanted by Nature expansion pack adds the following Ailments:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Burning Passion
  </li>
  <li>
   Simoleon Fever
  </li>
  <li>
   Creation Impulse
  </li>
  <li>
   Emotional Void
  </li>
  <li>
   Greenie Meanie
  </li>
  <li>
   Luck Magnet
  </li>
  <li>
   Gnome Lure
  </li>
  <li>
   Sonic Sinuses
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Curing all Ailments requires using the Apothecary skill in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Simmers can buy the
  <strong>
   Leafy Ledge Apothecary Table
  </strong>
  and craft cures after purchasing or foraging for the ingredients.

  Two skills will unlock after acquiring
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  Enchanted by Nature EP, which are
  <strong>
   Natural Living
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Apothecary
  </strong>
  . Natural Living will allow Simmers to embrace all nature has to offer, from showering in anything with water in it and foraging for items anywhere to sleeping on any flat surface, even dirt.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Apothecary skill lets players transform all their harvested foraged items into Apothecary Elixirs that cure all Fairy Ailments. Leveling up both skills can be done by researching on a computer or reading books, among other ways.

  The
  <strong>
   Naturopath
  </strong>
  Career in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  will be available for Simmers to experience after getting the Enchanted by Nature expansion pack. During the job, players are tasked with curing a client with an Ailment after identifying the cause. A series of questions, inquiries, and tests will reveal the cure, and then players can hand out the right Apothecary Elixir to their client.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Naturopath Career can be fully experienced in person after reaching level 2, during which players can choose to have their clients at their house. The job requires Simmers to level up their Apothecary and Natural Living skills, then it breaks into two branches:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Apothe-curest:
   </strong>
   In-house Forager (focused on the Apothecary skills).
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Lifestyle Coaching:
   </strong>
   Skill Class Coordinator (Focused on the Natural Living skills).

   Enchanted by Nature expansion pack adds 146 items to the Build Mode

  , where players can create their own Fairy house and live the mystical dream. Fairies' needs differ from those of normal Sims and other Occults, which makes some items limited to their lifestyle.
 </p>
 <p>
  In detail, the Enchanted by Nature expansion pack includes beds, closets, decorations, wallpapers, toiletries, doors, windows, railings, stairs, and many more. Simmers can filter their option to view and examine each available item.

  In
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  Enchanted by Nature gameplay, two decoration items can be manually crafted by players in Live Mode.
  <strong>
   Nature Press
  </strong>
  allows Simmers to press any of their harvested or bought crops into a frame. The pressed plant can be used to hang and decorate the house walls in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The Tabletop Plant Pots &amp; Houseplants is another decorative item Simmers can craft or purchase from Buy Mode. Players can place the Ceramic Pots on any surface, even shelves, to give their house an ambiance. The Pots can also be adorned with purchased live plants in exchange for some Simoleons in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>

  Fairies, like several other occult species in
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , have their own set of abilities and perks. As fairy Sims perform fairy-related activities and interactions in their everyday life, they will earn fairy experience that increases their rank and grants them ability points that can be exchanged for Fairy Abilities.

  There are four categories of Fairy Abilities in
  <em>
   The Sims 4

  , each with its own type of abilities. Even if players reach the maximum Fairy Rank (Radiant), they can continue to earn XP and receive more Ability Points, which means that at some point, they can unlock all Fairy Abilities at once. Below, players can check out what is within their reach:

  The Fairy Ability Refund Potion is a potion crafted by Mother Nature in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . In order to refund their Fairy Abilities, Sims must get this potion from Mother Nature in exchange for 20 Piles of Fairy Dust.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   To purchase the Fairy Ability Refund Potion in
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
   , players must get together with Mother Nature, either by summoning him with a Fairy Seedling or, if they have access to her in the Relationship Panel, by inviting her over to the current lot. Then, once she's nearby, they must interact with her, select the Fairy pie menu, and then the Acquire Fairy Ability Refund Potion interaction
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  If players are having trouble acquiring enough Fairy Dust to make the trade, they can farm it by asking fairies for some, shaking off their own dust or the dust in Fairy Homes, wooHoo'ing with in the sky, and even by visiting the Mossveil Fairy Hub and collecting their daily Fairy Dust ration.
 </p>
 <p>
  The video below shows players how to summon Mother Nature, acquire the Fairy Ability Refund Potion, and refund all Fairy Ability potions as a Radiant Rank fairy:

      <title>Ridiculously Dedicated Pokemon GO Player Has Just Hit 1 Billion Stardust</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/pokemon-go-player-1-billion-stardust/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  An incredibly dedicated
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  player that's well-known to the community has done it again, this time pulling off an astounding accomplishment by earning 1 billion Stardust in the game. Fellow
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  fans are marveling at the feat, and some wonder what this player will accomplish next.
 </p>

  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  released in 2016, immediately achieving massive success, with players all over the world diving in to catch Pokemon in real life. While much of the initial craze has died down, some dedicated fans are still playing that have been there since day one, and have some impressive
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  achievements to prove it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, Kyarorina, a player known for impressive feats in the game has shared a new one, hitting one billion Stardust in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . That's not all, as the player has also caught around 6.3 million Pokemon. A shared screenshot from their account shows that the billion Stardust are breaking the way the game is supposed to display metrics, with the 1,000,000,000 forcing the Stardust icon off the edge of the visible screen. Some other stats revealed by the image indicate that the player has nearly 400,000 Eevee candy, and over 30,000 Eevee XL candy, plus a Shiny Sylveon that's the focus of the image.

  Pokemon GO Player Really Wants to Catch 'Em All
 </h2>
 <p>
  Fans in the comments have been stunned by this achievement, and are trying to break down the math. It's been estimated that the player catches around 1,900 Pokemon per day, assuming they've caught Pokemon every single day since the game originally launched in 2016. Numerous players have suggested that they might be using a
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  auto-catcher, but even with one, this feat would require an incredible amount of time and effort to achieve. Others have suggested that the account might be shared by multiple players who take turns, but even if that's the case, the sheer dedication to the game is mind-boggling.

 <p>
  Some might be suspicious of the player, but in reality, this isn't the first time they've made waves for their achievements. Kyarorina previously impressed the game community way back in 2019, when they reached a million Pokemon caught in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Back then, it was estimated that Kyarorina was catching about 800 Pokemon per day to reach that number in three years, so it seems that they've actually stepped up their efforts since. With
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  approaching its 10th anniversary, it remains to be seen if Kyarorina continues amassing Pokemon and Stardust like this.

      <title>Now is the Perfect Time for a Cult Horror Crossover in Dead by Daylight</title>

  One cult horror franchise may have the perfect opportunity to be the next to cross over into
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dead by Daylight
   </em>
  </strong>
  . With its collection of licensed characters,
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  can be considered a
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  equivalent for the horror genre. Even with how many IPs are already featured in the game, there is still room for more. In particular, one franchise that has yet to join the game has a good argument for being the next in line. In fact, it may be its best opportunity yet for a crossover with
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight.

 <p>
  The many crossovers of
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  have been incredibly important to the game. They have the obvious advantage of drawing more attention, especially from fans of the IPs in question. Not to mention, every new Killer added to the game offers a brand new playstyle, while Survivors and Killers alike grant new perks to potentially change the meta.
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  itself is a solid game in terms of its mechanics and design. After all, it wouldn't be able to attract such high-profile crossovers otherwise. At the same time, incorporating these crossovers has undoubtedly been one of the best moves that the developers have made.

  Dead Rising's Remaster is Bringing the Series Back to Relevance
 </h3>
 <p>
  For fans, the reveal of
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  was a pleasant surprise. After
  <em>
   Dead Rising 4
  </em>
  's release in 2016, the series' momentum came to a halt, with no new games releasing for the next eight years.
  <em>
   Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster
  </em>
  is a chance to not only bring back the fans, but put the first game back into the spotlight. If the game is a success, it could revive the franchise, or at least lead to remasters of the other games.
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  's return in September also makes it a prime candidate for a timely
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  crossover.

  <em>

  's Frank West would be a perfect candidate to join Alan Wake and Lara Croft in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  as yet another video game representative. He's the recognizable face of the franchise, making him a natural choice. In addition, the series has at least two locations with incredible potential as maps in Willamette Mall and Fortune City. As for a killer, Adam MacIntyre is probably the most recognizable boss from the series. However, since
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  already has a clown, the developers might instead choose primary antagonists like Brock Mason or TK.
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  can certainly provide quality content for
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  .

  Capcom and Behaviour Previously Collaborated For the Resident Evil Crossovers
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are other reasons why a
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  collaboration would make sense as well.
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  crossed over with
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  twice, in addition to adding extra cosmetics. Not only is
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  another Capcom IP, but it's a far bigger franchise than
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  . Since Capcom has already allowed
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  to be the star of two different chapters, it's clearly open to working with Behaviour. With
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  set for a potential comeback, it could follow in those footsteps. It's not definitive proof, but it's a decent argument for a
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  chapter in the future.

  crossovers that haven't happened yet,
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  feels like it could be a shoo-in for a chapter of its own. It has solid survivor, map, and killer options, and the timing window would be perfect if it came out in or near September to coincide with the release of the remaster. There may be no better time for a
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  crossover in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  .

      <title>Best RPGs On PlayStation Plus, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Rising out of PS Now's ashes, Sony's new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  rolled out in 2022, and it has been a reasonable success by all accounts. Split into three tiers, the service's Extra and Premium subscriptions grant users access to hundreds of games covering a wide spectrum of genres. Yearning for a fright? PS Plus has plenty of horror delights. Want to play with a friend? Local co-op options are not lacking.

  Unsurprisingly, role-playing games are not an exception, and that includes Western and Japanese projects. PS Plus has action, turn-based, shooter, open-world, and tactical RPGs, so there should be something for just about everyone. As the service's library is so vast, here is a rundown of the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus RPGs
  </strong>
  , along with a few genre classics that are available as part of the Premium tier.

     Crisis Core – Final Fantasy 7 – Reunion

    – A prequel that ties directly into Square Enix's remake trilogy, Crisis Core is a must-play to fully understand Zack's character and to receive some background on Sephiroth. It is also just a fun action JRPG, despite a few somewhat broken systems.

    <strong>
     Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord
    </strong>
    – In terms of large-scale warfare, this might be the

     best RPG on PlayStation Plus

    . Bannerlord is not the most accessible game out there, but the learning curve is worth mastering.

  <li>
   <em>
    <strong>
     Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

    <strong>
     Jeanne d'Arc

  While
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  is better known in North America,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  is undoubtedly the king of RPGs in Japan. After a long stretch away from Western home consoles, the franchise made its international comeback with
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11
  </em>
  , a glorious throwback to early JRPGs that proves the formula is not broken.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11 S
  </em>
  adds a handful of quality-of-life improvements to the base game, along with a few neat additions such as a 16-bit mode. Offering a lengthy campaign, beautiful visuals, endearing characters, and straightforward but enjoyable turn-based combat, this Square Enix project might be the
  <strong>
   best JRPG on PS Plus Extra
  </strong>
  , especially when it comes to traditional entries.

  Putting aside a few spin-offs,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  has always prided itself on sticking very close to its original blueprint in nearly every area. Consequently, this entry tells a fairly basic good vs evil story set in a prototypical fantasy world filled with archetype monsters, characters, and towns. Even the turn-based combat shows little evolution from earlier entries like
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 8
  </em>
  . All of that can be regarded as a negative depending on somebody's point of view; however, this formula has been retained because it simply works.
  <em>
   DQ11
  </em>
  is timeless.

  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is a dark fantasy RPG inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Bram Stoker, and other classical horror authors of the early 20th century. It is developed by FromSoftware, the same studio behind the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  franchise and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  was released as a PlayStation exclusive, though, and is included with PS Plus Premium and Extra. It's one of the most challenging RPGs ever made, and its uniquely disturbing visuals paired with incredibly fine-tuned gameplay make it a classic every PlayStation owner should try at some point.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is very much a Soulslike, which is basically a separate genre by this point. However, the vast majority of these releases are, ultimately, action RPGs that combine build variety, customization, deep progression systems, and loot. Compared to
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  does not emphasize weapon drops all that much, instead opting for a smaller pool of viable options that each have multiple forms and play very differently from each other.

  More importantly, this Victorian Gothic masterpiece delivers an immersive setting, challenging but fair combat, epic boss fights, and fantastic lore (that can be ignored if a player simply does not care).

  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  is unlike pretty much any other
  <strong>
   PS Plus RPG
  </strong>
  , and this uniqueness might put off some people if they go in completely blind. However, the latter will result in a better experience since this is one adventure that should not be spoiled as much as possible. Basically, ZA/UM created a game that revolves heavily around dialogue, which acts as a replacement for a combat system.

  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series has remained somewhat stagnant since the release of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  almost eight years ago. Fans hold out for the eventual sequel to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , though, thanks to the everlasting playability of the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  franchise.
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  is the game that popularized
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  series before
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  made it a household name.

  While the graphics may feel dated nowadays,
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  's story, gameplay, and overall atmosphere are still as impressive as they were on release. The music of the game is regularly praised as the best in the series, and the environments of Cyrodiil are as lush as they are teeming with secrets. If someone has only ever played
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , they will like its predecessor too.

  Even if it does not have
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  's name recognition,
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  is a huge deal in the Japanese RPG world, particularly when it comes to real-time combat. Except for maybe
  <em>
   Star Ocean
  </em>
  , Bandai Namco's series is the definitive action JRPG franchise, a reputation forged from decades of solid releases. While everyone has their favorites (
  <em>
   Tales of Graces f
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Abyss
  </em>
  are fantastic in certain areas),
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  represent
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  ' peak(s), and they are quite different experiences in their own right. Fortunately, all three titles are available on PS Plus Premium, with
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  also being part of the Extra tier. Although probably the most "classic" entry in the series,
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  shows its age in many places, and the remastered version barely tries to remedy that. Just to be clear, the game is still worth playing, but someone's mileage will likely vary.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":9,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":9,"nbrPlacementsScanned":9,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1146} -->

  Despite originally launching in 2008,
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  is far more accessible in this day and age, and the Definitive Edition lives up to its title. This project came out at a time when the franchise was transitioning to a full 3D battle system, and while simple compared to subsequent entries,
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  's combat is still fun for the most part. The story is slow to get going but transforms into something fantastic once it picks up momentum.

 <p>
  Finally, there is
  <em>
   Tales of Arise
  </em>
  , the most modern release in the series (not counting remasters). Complete newcomers who are not sure which game to start with should pick
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  as it is the most well-rounded option on PS Plus, delivering good combat, visuals, characters, and storytelling. That said,
  <em>
   Arise
  </em>
  does not support co-op, which is otherwise considered a staple of the franchise. Therefore,
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  would be better options for a group of players.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  was a landmark release for the RPG genre, and the 1997 game holds up after all these years. That classic is without question one of the
  <strong>
   best JRPGs on PS Plus
  </strong>
  , however, the same claim can also be made regarding its remake. Square Enix has opted to retell this iconic story through a modern lens, one that provides a lot more than just a graphical upgrade. Utilizing an action-based battle system with a couple of turn-based options,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade
  </em>
  delivers fast-paced and addictive combat across a plethora of playable characters.

  <em>
   Intergrade

  is the PS5 version that includes Yuffie's "Intermission" DLC, and it is a substantial addition that features unique bosses and mechanics. The PS4 vanilla version of the game is also on PS Plus Premium and Extra, so a subscriber does not need Sony's latest console to play this title. As Square Enix has announced that

  Garnering near-universal praise,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  is a throwback to yesteryear's JRPGs that can stand alongside the genre's greatest all-time offerings. Launching directly on PS Plus Extra, Sabotage Studio's title follows a duo of heroes as they go on an adventure within their island, which proves to be far bigger and more diverse than initially might seem apparent. Naturally, they make a few friends along the way who are more than happy to fight alongside them, and they will need all the help they can get.

 <p>
  Even though 16-bit pixel graphics games have been done to death, particularly when it comes to RPGs,
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  nevertheless manages to impress with its art style and visuals. Sabotage's indie project might not have realistic AAA graphics, but it is still one of 2023's most gorgeous releases. The turn-based combat system is fine-tuned to encourage fast and strategic play, and it goes out of its way to ensure that every character feels important.

  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus
  </em>
  was a pleasant surprise as the JRPG genre does not frequently produce new IPs with relatively big budgets, particularly ones that garner a positive reception. Bandai's game takes place in an alternate reality where empowered humans are tasked with fighting off threats known as the Others. Players can pick from two protagonists, both of whom have different combat styles and storylines. While there is a fair amount of overlap, two playthroughs are required to experience the full story.

 <p>
  The action JRPG plays out like a hack and slash game akin to something like the
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  series, although players cannot swap between their party members. The combat system is fast-paced, flashy, and surprisingly deep, even if it takes a while to unveil all of its mechanics. Narratively,
  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus
  </em>
  is also a success, and the game leaves enough room for a potential sequel. While it might not have the name recognition of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Scarlet Nexus

  <em>
   Deus Ex
  </em>
  is among the most important RPG franchises of all time, largely thanks to the brilliant original game that helped set the standard for immersive sims. The sequels are all over the place in terms of quality, but
  <em>
   Human Revolution
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mankind Divided
  </em>
  are at least good enough to proudly carry the license's name. The latter finds Adam Jensen infiltrating a secret organization responsible for a string of terrorist attacks. Narratively,
  <em>
   Mankind Divided
  </em>
  hits the mark and delivers a captivating tale with interesting and relevant themes.

  <em>
   Deux Ex
  </em>
  is synonymous with player choice, something reflected by the 2016 release. Adam can approach scenarios in a variety of ways; players can opt for stealth or blast every enemy in sight. Although the game does somewhat advise players to try and keep a low profile, it does not significantly punish those who prefer to treat the campaign like a first-person shooter. Choices also impact the progression of missions, which means players will want to at least play through the story twice to get the full experience.

  Although not as well known as
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  , Capcom's
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  has a loud and passionate fanbase that eventually justified the creation of a sequel. While it ended up taking more than a decade,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  is pretty good.

  For complete newcomers who are unfamiliar with Capcom's franchise, they should try out
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
  </em>
  while it is available on PS Plus Extra. Except for perhaps the PC version, the PS4 remaster is probably the best way to experience this modern cult classic, and many of its ideas will likely be explored further in the upcoming sequel. Now, the game is rough around the edges and has a fairly weak opening few hours, so expectations should be tempered slightly to avoid disappointment. The story is nothing more than fine, and the open-world can be frustrating until players reach the first major city.

 <p>
  For all its flaws,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  generally improves as the campaign progresses, and the game really hits its stride once players start to come to grips with the combat system. The latter has a lot of depth and flexibility, which also means it comes with a pretty steep learning curve. The same can be said for the world's approachability, which can seem unforgiving at the start but becomes quite easy later on.

  <strong>
   PS Plus RPGs
  </strong>
  received a decent boost in July 2024 thanks to the arrival of
  <em>
   Crisis Core – Final Fantasy 7 – Reunion
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Jeanne d'Arc
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Summoner
  </em>
  . All those titles are worth playing depending on someone's preferences, but the month's biggest addition was undoubtedly
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  , Gunfire's 2023 entry in the Soulslike subgenre. While these types of games are almost regarded as separate entities from RPGs, they are still ultimately part of the genre and include nearly all the fundamentals associated with it.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  offers a range of classes (aka Archetypes), build variety, quests, exploration, fairly deep lore, and a serviceable story to follow. Anyone familiar with
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  should know what to expect from the sequel, albeit with most of its ideas expanded and improved.

  Focusing on third-person shooter gunplay and mostly limiting melee to a secondary option,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  grants players quite a few options in how they want to approach the action. While initially only presenting a few Archetypes, new ones are unlocked throughout the campaign, and they all have different perks, skills, and traits that set them apart. Beyond this element, equipment like mods and mutators provide quite a bit of flexibility, and the same can be said for weapons (although they are not extremely plentiful or frequent drops). As a single-player experience,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  gets the job done; however, the game is clearly designed with co-op in mind.

  Firaxis'
  <em>
   X-COM
  </em>
  games represent the tactical RPG genre at its best, and that franchise has a good presence on PS Plus. As awesome as those titles are, they can feel inaccessible to beginners who are not accustomed to these types of games. Consequently,
  <em>
   Marvel's Midnight Suns
  </em>
  should serve as a better entry point into the genre, and that goes beyond the license's name recognition. While they could have easily done
  <em>
   X-COM
  </em>
  with superheroes, Firaxis opted to create a fresh combat system built around cards, a decision that paid off brilliantly.

  <em>
   Midnight Suns
  </em>
  is an absolute blast to play, and the deck-building element creates an addictive gameplay loop that rewards customization and tinkering. It also injects an element of randomness without utilizing standard RNG mechanics. The 2022 game shines the brightest when focusing on combat, which thankfully is not a rare treat. The main story is also decent, and it casts players as a new character who finds themselves teaming up with a plethora of familiar heroes. Outside of missions, players can mingle with the heroes, fostering friendships along the way. This part of the package is a bit hit-and-miss, although fun can be had as well.

  A cult PS1 classic,
  <em>
   The Legend of Dragoon
  </em>
  debuted late in the console's lifespan, limiting its reach and potential. Nowadays, this JRPG is rather difficult to find, especially since the project was never ported to any other systems. Consequently, its addition to PS Plus Premium is a big deal since it marks the first time in a long while that this fan-favorite is widely accessible.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Legend of Dragoon
  </em>
  is similar to other 3D JRPGs released during the late-'90s such as Square's
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  entries. The game features turn-based combat, random enemy encounters, and a lengthy storyline. Although not far removed from its contemporaries,
  <em>
   Legend of Dragoon
  </em>
  introduced a range of unique ideas, including input prompts during battle.

  Although
  <em>
   Drakengard
  </em>
  and 2010's
  <em>
   NieR
  </em>
  garnered a cult following, this universe really exploded in popularity with the release of
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  . The latter proved to be such a resounding success, Square Enix opted to remaster its loosely-tied predecessor, focusing on the PS3 and Japanese version called
  <em>
   NieR Replicant
  </em>
  . Although this features a different protagonist than the 2010 Western release,
  <em>
   Replicant
  </em>
  still, for the most part, delivers the same experience, and it is an easy recommendation for fans of
  <em>
   Automata
  </em>
  .

  Newcomers should be aware that
  <em>
   NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...
  </em>
  's combat system is not quite as satisfying as
  <em>
   Automata
  </em>
  's. That said, they are both RPGs that feature fast-paced hack and slash action, so they are not worlds apart either.
  <em>
   Replicant
  </em>
  's action is just considerably more straightforward, and it can get repetitive after a while.

 <p>
  Ultimately, a

  game's selling point is its storytelling, and

   Replicant

  knocks it out of the park in this area. A slow-burner at first, the campaign eventually evolves into something truly special as it explores mature themes alongside a healthy dose of weirdness.

  A PlayStation 2 classic,
  <em>
   Dark Cloud 2
  </em>
  is a charming JRPG that has aged beautifully over the last two decades. As Max and Monica, players explore dungeons in search of items that allow them and their village to grow. Rather than leveling up the protagonists,
  <em>
   Dark Cloud 2
  </em>
  ties progression to weapons; the more a sword or gun is used, the stronger it becomes.

  <em>
   Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin
  </em>
  deserves an honorable mention as its polarizing reputation might inspire people to skip it, particularly if they are not big fans of the original
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  or Square Enix's franchise. However, Team Ninja's hack and slash RPG has many positives that justify a recommendation for both die-hard fans and folks who have never touched a
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game. Split into fairly linear levels,
  <em>
   Stranger of Paradise
  </em>
  prioritizes its action above everything else, and the campaign tries to avoid throwing out too many distractions outside some unintentionally (or intentionally, it can be hard to tell) hilarious cutscenes. Unsurprisingly, considering the developer behind the spin-off/prequel, the combat is fast-paced, deep, and stylish.

  <em>

  's decorated Jobs system. Jack unlocks a plethora of professions throughout the campaign, and he upgrades them by actively using them. He can have two Jobs equipped at a time, and they significantly change the combat's rhythm. With 28 Jobs (or classes), the gameplay offers plenty of variety and replayability, even if the stages are a bit unspectacular.

  RPGs come in many styles and flavors, and the same holds true for JRPGs. Ranging from old-school turn-based classics to fast-paced action epics, PS Plus Extra and Premium highlight the genre's diversity. Compared to other classifications, tactical JRPGs are less common since they are a bit more niche. That said, PS Plus covers this area with
  <em>
   Disgaea
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Disgaea 5

   Disgaea 6

  . The grid-based combat is accessible but also deep, mainly due to the game's awesome class system.

  Even though the selection isn't extensive, PS Plus Premium's Classics Catalog has a number of old favorites from across PlayStation's history.
  <em>
   Wild Arms
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Wild Arms 3
  </em>
  are both available as part of the subscription, and these JRPGs are considered classics for a reason. The original entry in the franchise has aged pretty well and is likely to hit the mark for fans of PS1-era RPGs; however,
  <em>
   Wild Arms 3
  </em>
  is arguably the superior game of the two.

 <p>
  Visually and narratively, Media.Vision's title is just as impressive nowadays as it was in the early 2000s. While conventional in many ways, the combat system is great for the most part and requires enough strategic thought to remain engaging throughout the majority of the campaign.

  Nihon Falcom's

  has been a staple of the action JRPG scene for decades, particularly on PCs. Although not the first entry to garner attention in Western countries,

   Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana

  helped expand the franchise's visibility since it features graphics that did not look as dated as its predecessors' visuals. More importantly, the action JRPG has a fast-paced and awesome combat system that is accessible but also hides a fair amount of depth.

  Developed by Nexon subsidiary Mintrocket,
  <em>
   Dave the Daver
  </em>
  combines action-adventure gameplay with management sim elements by tasking players to explore undersea environments during the day while running a sushi restaurant at night. It was originally released for PC and the Nintendo Switch in June and October 2023, respectively, before making its way to PlayStation consoles in April 2024. Many critics praised
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  for its captivating gameplay loop and engaging exploration, helping propel it to the title of one of the highest-rated games of 2023. That immense level of renown is reflected in its OpenCritic aggregate score of 90, as well as its perfect 100% reviewer recommendation rate.

  Dave the Diver Could Come To Xbox Game Pass in July 2024

 <p>
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  may now be on its way to Microsoft's subscription service, with Spanish YouTuber eXtas1s speculating that the game could reach Xbox Game Pass in the second half of July 2024. That's quite a bold prediction, not least because the game hasn't even been announced for Xbox consoles yet. While
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  could possibly be a PC Game Pass-only release, the leaker with a long track record of verified Xbox scoops doesn't necessarily believe that would be the case, having suggested as much in his latest video.

  The YouTuber's newest rumor roundup also saw him add more credence to a recent Insider Gaming report claiming
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  is coming to Xbox Game Pass soon. According to eXtas1s, that information is indeed accurate, with the game itself being slated to reach Microsoft's subscription service in late July 2024, together with one other title that was previously released on PlayStation consoles and PC. While he believes that other game to be
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  , he framed its purported XGP release as a prediction rather than a leak.

  The recent announcement of the second wave of July 2024 additions to Xbox Game Pass came as a slight disappointment to some subscribers, not least because the confirmed release batch ended up including just three titles:
  <em>
   Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dungeons of Hinterberg
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess
  </em>
  . eXtas1s claims that's because Microsoft wanted to give the trio some time to shine rather than risking overshadowing it with
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  .

  The YouTuber reports that the arrival of
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  and another mysterious game that might be
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  will most likely be announced by the end of the fourth week of July. Since Microsoft rarely shares major Xbox Game Pass news during weekends, the insider's claim implies that the remaining monthly additions to the service will be confirmed no later than next Friday, July 26.

  Microsoft has revealed the last round of price reductions for games available on the digital
  <strong>
   Xbox 360
  </strong>
  store. The Xbox 360 marketplace will be shutting down on July 29, 2024, and the company has done three waves of price drops. This latest update added seven more titles to the list of discounted games, bringing the total to over 150.

  These past couple of years have been bittersweet for many long-time gamers. In addition to the Xbox 360 store going offline soon, online services for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U were shut down in April. On top of that, the Japanese company also recently revealed that it has run out of the parts necessary to repair broken Wii U devices. And online services for several games have been cut in recent years, including multiple
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  games on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

  In preparation for the upcoming shutdown of the Xbox 360 marketplace and the resulting permanent loss of easy accessibility to a huge number of classic games, Microsoft has given many Xbox 360 titles a major discount, many by as much as 90%. On July 16,
  <em>
   Big League Sports, Blood Drive, Gun, Legend of Spyro, Prototype, Prototype 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Singularity
  </em>
  were added to the list. Physical versions of many of these games have also become difficult to find. Granted, many of the games are also available on other platforms, but for preservation and nostalgia, it’s a good idea to check out the discounted titles and grab any whose absence might be regretted in the future.

  Microsoft has stated that these seven games are the last to be discounted before the store goes permanently offline on July 29. As a tribute to the console, considered by many to represent one of the best eras in video games, the company has also brought the Xbox 360 Heritage Collection back to the Gear Shop, and a dynamic background inspired by the Xbox 360 Blades dashboard was released for use on the Xbox Series X/S.

 <p>
  Additionally, seven backward compatible Xbox 360 games —
  <em>
   Aegis Wing, Doritos Crash Course, Crackdown, Crackdown 2, Harms Way, Hexic HD, and Too Human
  </em>
  — were recently made available to download for free. At the time of writing, only
  <em>
   Aegis Wing
  </em>
  seems to no longer be available, though some users have reported issues claiming the others from xbox.com. The solution seems to be accessing the storefront via console and grabbing the games from there.

  When it comes to the various side missions available in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ)
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players will mostly be able to acquire them with the help of Officer Mewmew. Each area in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero

  will have their designated Officer Mewmew, and for Sixth Street, he will be located behind the newsstand.

  Players can unlock him after completing Chapter 1 of the Main Story and get started on the missions. One of such missions is the “
  <strong>
   Timely Assistance Medal IV
  </strong>
  ”. Officer Mewmew will require you to investigate a ‘ suspicious shadow’ near
  <strong>
   Waterfall Soup shop at night
  </strong>
  . There is no specific information given on the nighttime option, so players can follow this guide to figure out how to get this medal.

  The point of this quest is to actually find a Bangboo near Waterfall Soup. The Bangboo is the ‘
  <strong>
   suspicious shadow
  </strong>
  ’ and it can only be found
  <strong>
   in the evening
  </strong>
  . Since
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  has two night-time options, it can be a little confusing when trying to spot the ‘suspicious shadow’. The only way to change the time in the game is by using your battery charge at the HIA Club combat events, completing commissions, or resting on the sofa. However, resting on the sofa doesn’t always work, so it is much safer to wait it out by doing commissions.

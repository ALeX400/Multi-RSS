      The art is charming, showing Venture being given a moon rock from their new friend Juno, with funny faces and poses featured in the drawings.

  A talented
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has created fan art showing a potential interaction for when Juno and Venture meet for the first time. In the comments section, other
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players praised the OP's work, commenting on how adorable their fan art is and how it would make great sprays to add to Blizzard's shooter.

  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  has a variety of heroes for players to choose from when making their team compositions. With 40 playable heroes currently, the most recent addition to the roster is Venture, a damage character. Armed with their drill, Venture can move underground, deal damage, and surprise opponents. Juno, meanwhile, was one of the biggest announcements made by Blizzard this year, finally revealing the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  character formerly known as "Space Ranger." Juno and Venture at first glance have no connection, but a new
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  fan art has created a wholesome interaction between the two.

 <p>
  Reddit user Un_Gordo shared a sequence of fan art imagining the first meeting between Juno and Venture in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  . With an adorable chibi look, Venture shows Juno what they say is a piece of the pyramid, leaving her impressed. Juno, meanwhile, talks about space and shows Venture a piece of moon rock. They get very excited and pick up the rock to take a closer look, making a funny face. The interaction is made all the more funny by the fact that Dorado, the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  map where Juno's ship landed, appears in the background of the fan art.

  Venture, whose real name is Sloan Cameron, is
  <em>

  </em>
  's first non-binary hero and an enthusiastic archaeologist. They travel the world using their tools to excavate artifacts and protect archaeological sites from thieves and criminal organizations. Further details about Juno's origin story are not yet known, but is confirmed that she hails from a Mars colony and is associated with Mei. In her announcement trailer, Juno is depicted making her journey from Mars to Earth, and there's a viral moment where she is shown kicking Venture.

  Players wishing to play as Venture will find that they are a solid pick within the current

  meta, as they function as a good option for disrupting the enemy backline. Juno, meanwhile, recently had a test period in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , with players exploring the potential of her kit and drawing comparisons to Ana and LÃºcio. The character will be joining Blizzard's hero shooter soon, with the launch of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 12 on August 20.

   <em>
    7 Days To Die
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an action-packed game that is filled with bears, wolves, and zombies that are seeking to chow down on the player at the first possible opportunity. Selecting the right perks early on can help the player survive the first few days and come out the other side relatively unscathed.

 <p>
  There are many different directions that players can go in when it comes to perk selection. Some are good for ranged weapons, others for looting, and some help the players in ways that aren't clear at first glance. Skill points can be hard to come by, so it's important to spend them wisely.

  Investing a point in Parkour can be a real lifesaver.
  <strong>
   The first level of this perk reduces the cost of jumping by 10%
  </strong>
  . This can be particularly useful when trying to jump out of reach of a horde of aggressive zombies.

  It also increases the distance the player can fall before taking damage. This can save the player from some sticky situations. In

  there are lots of buildings that aren't exactly structurally sound. Should the floor give way while the player is exploring an abandoned building, then they could end up with a nasty injury that could slow them down.

  For some reason, day 1 characters are incredibly unfit. They are barely able to run a few feet without needing to take a rest. In the early stages, players won't have a mode of transport, so they will need to go everywhere on foot.

  The first level of Cardio
  <strong>
   increases the player's stamina regeneration speed by 10% when sprinting
  </strong>
  . What this means is sprinting will cost less stamina, so the player will be able to run for longer without getting out of breath. This makes Cardio a must-have perk.

  Gathering resources early on can be a bit of a challenge. Players will need to work quickly to gather enough materials to put together a base that can handle the first Blood Moon. Because efficiency is key, Mother Lode is great for making mining a little bit more profitable.

  The first level of this perk will allow players to

   harvest 20% more ore when mining

  . Provided the player is using an axe, pick, shovel, chainsaw, or auger, players will gather more materials. This also applies to trees, so players with this perk will be able to harvest 20% more wood than normal.

 <p>
  The first level of Lucky Looter will add 5% to the player's loot bonus, and it
  <strong>
   allows players to loot things 10% faster
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  The 5% bonus doesn't really do a lot in the early stages. The reason why this perk is a good choice in the early stage is its bonus to loot speed.
 </p>

  Players will open up countless storage containers and search inside numerous vehicles every day. Being able to loot 10% faster can not only help with quick getaways when there are nearby zombies, but it will also help increase the player's efficiency. In
  <em>
   7 Days To Die
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  good time management is a crucial part of the player's day-to-day life.

  Most players will have a certain weapon type that works best for them. In
  <em>
   7 Days To Die
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  there's at least one perk for each of the game's weapon types. So, after killing a few zombies with each type of beginner weapon,
  <strong>
   players should try to pick which weapon suits their playstyle
  </strong>
  and invest a perk point in that skill. The perks for each of the base weapons that the player is likely to have access to are shown below:

  Completing missions for traders is a great way of earning XP in the early stages of the game. It's also great for earning rewards that can help players improve their skills. The first level of Daring Adventurer will
  <strong>
   increase the amount of Dukes the player earns for completing a mission by 5%

  Also, it will increase the quality of products that traders stock. So, not only will the player gain extra rewards for completing a mission, but they can also spend their extra Dukes on better quality items sold by the trader.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Hollow Knight: Silksong
   </strong>
  </em>
  is geared to be known for the challenge it presents. Any good 2D Soulslike Metroidvania platformer will have difficult moments, especially during boss battles. The bosses of
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  's predecessor, were known to offer tough fights to those who encountered them. One of the reasons why they were so difficult is because some had more than one phase to take on. The sequel will likely have just as many or even more bosses with multiple phases, but having them can either make or break the game.

  E3 2019's Nintendo Treehouse gave players a glimpse of what they could expect from
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  . The world of Pharloom looks large with many new areas consisting of interesting environments, characters, and enemies. The demo only showed two bosses, with only a single phase to their fights, but they proved to be quite a challenge to anyone who faced them. This makes some wonder if the full release will have bosses with multiple phases that will ramp up the difficulty further. While it can improve the sequel's gameplay, it also has the potential to ruin the experience if not executed properly.

  Some of

  <em>
   Silksong

  could have just as many or more multiphase bosses, but how well they're designed is up for speculation. They could benefit the sequel for a few reasons:

   Bosses with more than one phase can test a player's skills, ensuring that they have a good understanding of the game's mechanics

  <li>
   They allow the developers to get creative with how they transition to each phase, giving the players a spectacle to witness during combat

  <em>

  could top the original if it manages to have multiphase bosses with the right amount of challenge. The advantages they bring can help the sequel become just as highly regarded as its predecessor or even more so, but that's only if Team Cherry does them right. With the developer working on the game for over five years, there's cause for optimism that this might be the case.

  While many love the challenge a multiphase boss brings, some see it as more of a hindrance that could ruin the experience. There's no doubt that the kingdom of Pharloom will have numerous challenges to test players' skills, but ones that could potentially become serious roadblocks can push people away from playing the game instead of bringing them in. Bosses with multiple phases could become such an issue for a few reasons:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Extra phases in a fight could turn specific fights into tests of endurance instead of difficult but enjoyable engagements
  </li>
  <li>
   Difficulty spikes could make it nigh-impossible for some players to clear certain bosses, preventing them from progressing further
  </li>
  <li>
   Players might focus more on the difficulty rather than the boss as a whole, making them less appreciative of the time and effort placed into their design

 <p>
  The known bosses of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Silksong
   </strong>
  </em>
  showcase the potential of what players could go up against, but their final design remains a mystery until the game's full release. Multiple phases can turn them into memorable experiences, but that could either be for better or worse. If Team Cherry plans to introduce many of them in the sequel, then the developer must consider how to minimize the cons to ensure players fully enjoy the sequel.

  Naughty Dog's hugely popular

  </em>
  series first debuted in 2007, with the opening title in the series,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Uncharted: Drake's Fortune

  </em>
  . Since then, the
  <em>
   Indiana Jones

  , starring Chloe Frazer, was released. The PlayStation series remains a fan favorite, with just about every game still accessible on modern consoles, with the latest two games in the franchise having received a PlayStation 5 remaster back in 2022 with the

  One of the more forgotten
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   Fight for Fortune
  </em>
  is a spin-off that largely came and went when it debuted on the PS Vita. While mainly sold on its multiplayer, the card game came with a single-player campaign as well, which mostly served to teach the mechanics while keeping players engaged for a few hours.

 <p>
  <em>
   Fight for Fortune
  </em>
  is not a must-play game for
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  fans as its narrative does not bring much to the overall franchise, while the multiplayer is no longer available and was never extremely popular. Still, it was not terrible by any means, and the card system could scratch a similar itch to something like
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  . Even if they are not for everyone, these spin-offs were fun and should make a comeback.

  Another mostly forgotten
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  game,
  <em>
   Fortune Hunter
  </em>
  saw the series make its mobile debut, delivering a decent isometric puzzle-platformer in the process. Basically, stages consist of tiles that must be cleared to reveal the treasure. While not the most original system out there, it worked well enough, providing a decent challenge in the process.

 <p>
  Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Fortune Hunter
  </em>
  is no longer available to download on Android or iOS, making it impossible to play legally. Although not too far removed from the series, this spin-off barely connected to the main continuity, so fans are not missing much beyond a decent game.

 <p>
  The latest entry in the series, and to some people, it's considered to be the best introduction to the series.
  <em>
   <strong>
   </strong>
   Uncharted: The Lost Legacy
  </em>
  was originally planned as story DLC, similar to what the
  <em>
   Left Behind
  </em>
  expansion was to
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , but as development on the title progressed, the title was changed to be a standalone title.

 <p>
  Though some people may find the thought of a DLC expansion turned feature-length title to be an off-putting prospect, the final game is an absolute blast to play. Due to its shorter run time, the game's pacing is tighter, and the story feels concise and compact while still delivering the
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  staples of ancient puzzles, bombastic firefights, and standout action sequences. The game also stars Chloe Frazer instead of series regular Nathan Drake, but Chloe's charisma and personal investment still make for a fantastic gaming experience.

  The very first title in Naughty Dog's treasure-hunting series may not be the longest, but when it was released back in 2007.
  <em>
   Uncharted: Drake's Fortune
  </em>
  showcased the best of the PlayStation 3, with stellar graphics, responsive gunplay, and a well-told adventure story that didn't overstay its welcome.

 <p>
  Much like
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Last of Us Part 1
   </strong>
  </em>
  , many gamers fans also hope the PlayStation 3 title gets a much-deserved PlayStation 5 remake soon. The game introduced so many gamers to the charming rogue Nathan Drake and other fan favorites, with reporter Elena Fisher and mentor Sully. It's not the globe-trotting adventure the series would go on to be, but it's a well-rounded island adventure, complete with an engrossing treasure-hunting tale and appropriately twisted treasure.

  <em>

  had enormous shoes to fill. Following the exceptional
  <em>
   <strong>
    Uncharted 2: Among Thieves
   </strong>
  </em>
  , which was a hit with game critics and gamers alike, Naughty Dog had the pressure on to deliver another top-tier adventure to appease the series' excited fans. Although the story might not match the previous entries, it delivered some of the series' biggest and most exciting set-piece sequences.

 <p>
  The third entry in the series seems to cut back on the overall run time, but to offset the shortened run time, the game was packed with great gun fights, a story that began to explore Nathan Drake's past, but most notably put gamers through their paces with Hollywood blockbuster action, including dangling Nathan Drake on some cargo crates, suspended hundreds of miles in the air, in what is easily one of the best video game levels set on a plane.

  Developed by Bend Studios (of

  fame),
  <em>
   <strong>
    Uncharted: Golden Abyss

  is the only feature-length game in the series to not be developed by the series home studio, Naughty Dog. But that didn't stop Bend Studio from delivering a great portable adventure.

  Despite being a handheld title,
  <em>
   Uncharted: Golden Abyss
  </em>
  still clocks at a respectable 10-hour completion time, more than some of the home console entries. The handheld entry certainly deserves more attention and is comfortably one of the defining titles of the PlayStation VITA, making great use of most of the handheld's bells and whistles. The game featured another solid story for players to experience, but what really made the game great was the strong handheld gameplay and interactive collectibles that let players rub charcoal sketches and piece together segmented maps in the palm of their hands.

  To many fans of the series,
  <em>
   Uncharted 2: Among Thieves
  </em>
  is regarded as the best entry in the series. That's thanks to its tremendous story, filled with exciting new characters, including
  <em>
   Uncharted: The Lost Legac
  </em>
  y star Chloe Frazer. The game one-upped everything great about its predecessor and, in turn, delivered not only a phenomenal adventure title but also one of the PlayStation 3's best games ever.

 <p>
  The game still features one of gaming's best opening sequences (an injured Natahn Drake, suspended off a snowy cliff inside a crumbling train carriage). From the very opening, the game never lets up, delivering a perfectly paced adventure game, complete with frantic firefights, standout set-piece duels, and a villain that gives the very best Indiana Jones-styled villains a run for their money.

  The closing chapter in Nathan Drake's adventure was a fitting farewell to a hero who found his way into the hearts of so many people over the years. There's a reason
  <em>
   A Thief's End
  </em>
  has the longest run time out of all the entries: it takes time to flesh out the characters more so than ever before. Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Uncharted 4
  </em>
  showcases the power the PlayStation 4 could give to games at the time.

 <p>
  There's a reason the title was one of the best PlayStation 4 titles to release over the console's lifetime. The game features dazzling graphics and introduces players to even more great characters, including Nathan Drake's long-lost brother, Sam Drake. The title may feature a few too many box puzzles, but it also features a variety of great locales, stunning action, and the most refined gameplay the series has had to date. It takes time to tell its story, but as a result, it delivers a great adventure that fans of the series and newcomers alike shouldn't miss.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has recently discovered an ocean in an airless moon after playing the open-world game for over 300 hours.
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  has over 1,000 planets, including hundreds that can be landed on by players, so this is a unique discovery that most gamers wonât find.

  Released in 2023,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  is Bethesdaâs most recent open-world RPG. Not only did
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  gain positive reviews from most critics when it was released, achieving an average score of 85 on Open Critic, but the game sold many copies despite being available on Game Pass day one. While many players were not fond of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  âs sprawling, somewhat empty universe, others like to take their time exploring, spending hundreds of hours to see all of its marvels.

  Now, a
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  player called Expensive_Spread1986 shared a picture of a unique ocean on an airless moon that they had discovered after playing the game for over 300 hours. The setting for this beautiful picture is the moon of Cragg, which orbits the planet Fenn in the Cheyenne star system. Staying true to
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  âs hard science fiction stance, some gamers discussed the location in the comments, wondering about the properties of the mysterious ocean. Some people believed that the ocean could be made of mercury, ionic salt, or even methane, like with the real-world moon of Titan. The argument, however, ended up without a definitive answer.

  This is not the first time a
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  player has found something unique after playing the game for a long time. Earlier this week, for example, another fan discovered a party ship in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  after playing for almost 300 hours. This ship was found randomly on a settled star system, was decorated with flags, and had a captain who welcomed the main character to the party.

  Starfield is filled with many quirky events and places that make its exploration worthwhile. For instance, a player recently discovered a Todd Howard lookalike on their
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  ship. While this was likely not intended as an easter egg, as the NPC was a nameless citizen, it still prompted many jokes within the community.

 <p>
  In another recent story, a
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  player discovered a sign pointing to a non-existent hotel in New Atlantis. The sign was located in the cityâs spaceport, and the gamer passed through it multiple times before noticing that the sign led nowhere. The most likely reason for this mistake is that the sign was a holdover from the gameâs early development and that the hotel was eventually removed from
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  . Ultimately, finds such as these - and the ocean on an airless moon - suggest that interesting Starfield discoveries will be made for years to come.

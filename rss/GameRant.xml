  Each farm map in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  comes with a unique layout and has its own pros and cons. The Meadowlands Farm is
  <strong>
   designed as a livestock-oriented farm
  </strong>
  and is perfect for players who prefer focusing on raising animals rather than crops. This guide covers everything you need to know about Meadowlands Farm in detail and will help you decide if it's the right one for you.

  <em>
   : The Meadowlands Farm is a new farm map in Stardew Valley, introduced in the 1.6 update. It’s the perfect farm type for players who enjoy raising animals and even comes with a pre-built coop and two chickens, saving you time and money. The farm has a more intricate layout with ponds and forest patches, and many players have found that the farmable area land is smaller compared to the other farm types. If you're a player who enjoys pastoral life and wants to focus on raising animals, the Meadowlands Farm is an excellent choice.

 <p>
  Like other farm maps in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , the Meadowlands farm comes with a
  <strong>
   Farmhouse, an abandoned Greenhouse, a body of water, and the Farm Cave
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  If you start walking to the left of the farmhouse, you will find a
  <strong>
   Coop
  </strong>
  , which comes built-in with the Meadowlands Farm. You can find the ruined Greenhouse near the bottom left fence of the Coop and the Farm Cave directly south of the farmhouse.

 <p>
  To use the Greenhouse, you will first have to repair it by completing the Community Center bundles. On the other hand, the Farm Cave is a small underground location where you can choose to have fruit bats or mushrooms. There are also two intersecting rivers around the farm, where you can go fishing.

 <h3 id="grandpa-rsquo-s-shrine-location">
  Grandpa’s Shrine Location

 <p>
  Even though it’s a bit hidden, the Meadowlands Farm would be incomplete without Grandpa’s Shrine. To get to Grandpa’s Shrine, you will need to
  <strong>
   cross the plank bridge that is hidden behind a tree near the greenhouse
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1095} -->

 <p>
  Once you cross the bridge, you’ll be in the upper portion of the farm. Here, you can find Grandpa’s Shrine behind another tree. The Shrine is the same as usual, with four candles that light up after you
  <strong>
   complete Grandpa’s Evaluation

 <h3 id="warp-totem-location">
  Warp Totem Location
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Warp Totem on Meadowlands Farm is located on the northern side of the map, behind the farmhouse. If you can’t see it right away, you may need to clear away some obstructing trees and foliage. Once activated, this magical device will allow you to instantly teleport between your farm and other locations, saving you precious time and energy.

  , but things are a bit different with the Meadowlands Farm. This time, you will start your new farm with
  <strong>
   15 pieces of Hay and a Coop
  </strong>
  .

  Another unique starting resource at the Meadowlands Farm is the

  Blue Grass naturally sprouts and replenishes during
  <strong>
   Spring, Summer, and Fall
  </strong>
  . However, if you want to grow more of it, you will need to craft
  <strong>
   Blue Grass Starters
  </strong>
  . The crafting recipe for the Blue Grass Starters can be purchased from
  <strong>
   Mr. Qi’s Walnut Room on Ginger Island

 <p>
  After you place a Blue Grass Starter on the farm, it will instantly grow into a patch of Blue Grass. Over time, this patch will

   gradually spread to the surrounding tiles

  across the farm.

 <p>
  Since the tillable area in front of the farmhouse is pretty small, you’ll need to
  <strong>
   walk through the forest nearby until you reach another big farming zone.
  </strong>
  The forest is filled with lots of trees and stumps, perfect for collecting Sap and leveling up your Foraging skills quickly.

 <p>
  Beyond the forest is a large area filled with tillable soil where you can plant a variety of crops. This farming zone makes up the majority of the farmable land on the Meadowlands Farm. You can also frequently
  <strong>
   refill your watering can at one of the ponds
  </strong>
  if you’re not ready to invest in building a well yet. However, the ponds and forest patches can make it challenging to efficiently plan and manage your crops.

 <p>
  Even though it comes with exciting perks, the Meadowlands farm has its challenges. For starters,
  <strong>
   animal farms require more labor and effort to maintain
  </strong>
  , unlike crop farms where you just need to plant seeds and water your crops.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the Meadowlands farm
  <strong>
   isn’t the best farm for growing crops
  </strong>
  . This is mainly due to two reasons:
  <strong>
   less tillable land and limited water access
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1020} -->

 <h3 id="farmland-availability">
  Farmland Availability
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Meadowlands Farm comes with
  <strong>
   approximately 2050 tillable tiles
  </strong>
  , which is quite less compared to other maps, like the Standard Farm (3427 tillable tiles) or the Four Corners Farm (2952 tillable tiles). While not as vast as other farms, there are still suitable areas for planting crops. For instance,
  <strong>
   the space right below your house
  </strong>
  provides enough room to set up a basic farm.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":380} -->
 <h3 id="water-access">
  Water Access
 </h3>
 <p>
  Besides limited farmland, watering crops in the Meadowlands is quite troublesome. Although there are three ponds scattered across the farm that provide easy access to water, it is time-consuming to run back and forth to them each time you need to refill your watering can.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  For this reason, it’s recommended that you
  <strong>
   set up a well near your crops
  </strong>
  . A well can be purchased from Robin the Carpenter for
  <strong>
   1,000 gold
  </strong>
  . It requires
  <strong>
   75 stones
  </strong>
  and takes two days to be constructed.

  As the fifth installment in the series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  will officially be released on December 5, 2024. Players looking to enjoy a cozy open-world game that incorporates fashion will surely enjoy meeting Nikki and Momo in Miraland. The game primarily functions as a dress-up game, but it also incorporates popular elements that many gacha games, like
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , have. You can explore, solve puzzles, collect rewards, and enjoy the gacha facility, which has a variety of outfits available.

  series was primarily only available on mobile, but it will now be shifting to new platforms and will also be available to play globally. If players wish to know more about
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  ’s plans for cross-platform compatibility, this guide provides a detailed rundown.

  According to the game’s open-beta, it has been confirmed that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
   will have a cross-save option
  </strong>
  . It seems like cross-progression is a core feature that is available from launch, and players do not have to worry about losing their data when switching between devices/platforms.

 <p>
  Of course, this article will be updated depending on the official release of
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  should developers make any changes regarding cross-progression. But until then,
  <em>

  players do not need to fret over losing their progress.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, not much has been said or confirmed regarding
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  becoming a multiplayer game. The developers, Papergames, are known for their other works in the
  <em>
   Nikki
  </em>
  series, as well as a popular otome game called
  <em>
   Mr. Love: Queen’s Choice
  </em>
  . Most of these games do not have multiplayer options and only allow players to add friends across the same server. Since the
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  beta did not show any development in that scope, players will just have to wait and see.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Hopefully, in the future, the developers may change their minds and decide to make
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  multiplayer and allow gamers to play in their friends' worlds. This would be similar to other open-world gacha games like
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , where, with just the click of a button, players can enter their friends' or random worlds and help out with any quests or puzzles.

 <p>
  Furthermore, since
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  seems to mix both genres of a life sim and RPG, there is a certain amount of combat that players will have to engage in. The combat mechanics look similar to the rising otome game
  <em>
   Love and Deepspace
  </em>
  , which might be helpful to those who are already familiar with the playstyle.

  Until then, you can refer back to this article on the game's multiplayer availability. However, don't let that stop you from diving into the world of Miraland with Nikki and Momo, as the game has so much more to offer than one might expect.

  The upcoming
  <strong>

   </em>
  </strong>
  multiplayer fighting game has been canceled, according to its publisher, Maximum Entertainment. While the project was not the only
  <em>

  game in development, it's still a blow to fans of the franchise who've been looking forward to new content.

 <p>
  Maximum Entertainment first announced its
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  fighting game in February 2024. The publisher didn't reveal much about the title beyond that, but it was aiming for an early access release sometime in 2025, suggesting it was at least nearing a playable state in development. Now, just shy of 2025, Maximum has released the unfortunate news that the game will never reach that point.

 <p>
  The news of the cancelation comes from Maximum Entertainment's latest quarterly report, where the publisher listed three canned projects:
  <em>
   Mudfest
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Project Velos
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  . Why the company decided to stop working on the title is unclear. It may not have received enough positive feedback to suggest it would perform well, or development could have hit a few snags. Whatever the reasoning, Maximum apparently felt the need to use the resources it was pouring into the game elsewhere, so
  <em>

  </em>
  fans hoping for a fighting game will have to play as Zuko or Korra in
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
  </em>
  or wait for another company to come out with one.

  Netflix's live-action adaptation of

  s second season on Netflix will right some of those wrongs, but a fresh take is likely what the franchise really needs to restore its former glory. A new story in the Saber RPG will have a chance to do just that. There could always be additional

  With
  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War Ragnarok

  </strong>
  , Santa Monica Studio delivered a poignant exploration of family, loss, and redemption through the lens of Norse mythology. While Kratos and Atreus served as the narrative's backbone, Freya emerged as a standout character, showcasing remarkable growth and resilience. From a grieving mother to a warrior reclaiming her autonomy, Freya's journey offers fertile ground for further exploration, making her the perfect candidate to lead a spin-off.

  Freya’s story in
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  encapsulates many of the series' overarching themes, particularly the enduring struggle to overcome familial trauma inflicted by the All-Father. Odin’s manipulations left her physically and emotionally bound, her wings both a literal and symbolic representation of lost freedom. By the end of
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  , she not only breaks free of Odin’s control but also reclaims her identity and purpose. A game centered on Freya could delve deeper into her rediscovery of self and her evolving relationships, creating a refreshing perspective for the series while introducing a compelling female protagonist.

  Freya’s transformation throughout
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  is a testament to her strength and complexity. She begins the game as a vengeful force, consumed by grief over the death of her son, Baldur. However, through her interactions with Kratos and Atreus, she finds a path toward healing and reconciliation. Her choice to ally with Kratos, despite their tumultuous past, highlights her capacity for growth and her commitment to a greater cause.

 <p>
  Moreover, her struggle is uniquely family-centric, making her arc one of the most emotionally resonant in the series. The loss of Baldur and her brother Freyr underscores the theme of found family, a concept she embraces by the game’s conclusion. Freya’s dialogue in the
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  finale, where she reflects on forging new bonds with Kratos and Atreus, underscores her potential to be a leading protagonist in her own right.

 <h3 id="exploring-freya-rsquo-s-life-after-ragnarok">
  Exploring Freya’s Life After Ragnarok
 </h3>
 <p>
  A Freya-focused spin-off could serve as a narrative continuation of
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  , taking place after the events of the more recent Valhalla DLC. The story might explore Freya’s journey as she seeks to rebuild her identity and forge new family bonds. Having lost nearly everything—her son, her brother, and her home—Freya could embark on a quest of self-discovery that delves into themes of healing and hope.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1145} -->

 <p>
  Such a narrative would also provide an opportunity to expand on her complex relationships with Kratos and Atreus. As she forms a new family dynamic with them, the game could explore how she navigates these connections while grappling with her lingering grief and trauma. A spin-off centered on Freya would allow the series to explore fresh emotional depths while staying true to its core themes of familial conflict and reconciliation.

  Freya’s spin-off could also bring unique gameplay elements to the
  <em>

  formula. As a former Valkyrie queen, her combat style could blend graceful, aerial maneuvers with devastating magical attacks. Her iconic sword and bow could serve as primary weapons, complemented by her mastery of Seiðr magic for crowd control and strategic gameplay.

  Freya Versus Atreus as a Protagonist

 <p>
  While many fans have speculated that Atreus might star in his own game, Freya’s story arguably holds just as much narrative weight. A prequel detailing her life before
  <em>
   God of War (2018)
  </em>
  would be intriguing, but a post-
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  adventure offers more potential for growth and evolution. The series thrives on exploring how its characters confront and overcome their past, and Freya’s future is ripe with possibilities.

 <p>
  Moreover, Danielle Bisutti, who brought Freya to life in the recent games, has expressed interest in reprising the role for a standalone title. With her nuanced performance and the strong narrative groundwork already laid, a Freya-focused game would not only satisfy long-time fans but also attract new audiences eager for a strong female protagonist in the

  universe.

 <p>
  As
  <em>

  With its history of compelling storytelling and character-driven narratives, Santa Monica Studio has the opportunity to breathe new life into the franchise with a Freya-focused title.

     <li>
      Manhwa series feature smart protagonists who use their minds as weapons, not brute force.

  <strong>
   Manhwa
  </strong>
  Main Characters who prefer to use
  <strong>
   smarts over brawn
  </strong>
  are hard to come by. Since most of the series currently ongoing are focused on Shonen demographics, there's plenty of "battle Manhwa" out there, and in these series, protagonists are all about scales of power and brutal martial prowess.

  Nagyun from The Ember Knight is the perfect example of a main character whose sole power is high intelligence, but that doesn't make it less dangerous than any of the superpowers that roam the world. From powerful Empire Generals, to rebel Dragon Descendants, even the strongest Knights have recognized Nagyun (known to them as Najin) for his capacity to use his mind as a weapon.

  The Sweet Life Of The Reincarnation Pro is one of the prime examples of a Manhwa series with a protagonist who lives a lazy and laidback life and prefers others to do the dirty work for him.

  He knows a lot of roundabout ways to make others respect him, and amassess a large fortune using the past knowledge from his 101 past lives. In terms of Smart over Brawl, he is a true pro, who uses brute force as a last resort.

  The Lout of the Count's Family has one of the smartest protagonists of all Isekai Manhwa, Cain Henituse. A person who is solely dedicated to gathering allies and protecting his family from future events, thanks to his knowledge of the novel where he got reincarnated.

  As such, he not only avoids fights at all costs but has an army of magical creatures (which include the Black Dragon Cub Raon) to fight for him. Quite a smart fellow.

  Of all the genius female leads I've ever seen in Manhwa, Doctor Elise, the Lady with the Lamplight is probably the smartest. She avoids all confrontations by masterfully dominating the art of deception and outplaying her enemies by appearing weak and kind, but being cunning and a powerful player in the shadows.

  This series is one of the most popular that is still ongoing, and it even has its own anime adaptation, which varies a little bit in both art and storyline but it's still good to watch.

  Resetting Lady is one of the few series that hooked me right from the beginning. It has beautiful art, a thrilling story, and overall: one of the best female leads capable of some of the smartest powerplays in the drama genre.

  It's too bad that this Manhwa has yet to receive an official English translation, but for those who do not read Korean, there's a translated official version of the web novel out there. Sadly, it only has 3 volumes.

 <p>
  Aaron Steelguard is a cunning and powerful reincarnated noble, who mostly enjoys accumulating wealth, knowledge, and martial art techniques. He could definitely take over the world if he wanted to do so, but he is mostly focused on getting his revenge on those who betrayed him in his past life.

 <p>
  Rarely uses his strength to do so, though, as he prefers to toy with his targets, ruining them financially and exposing their sins to the world. In the only instance where he decided to personally kill one of those who betrayed him, things got way too complicated for him. So he has maintained a low profile and manipulated everything from the shadows, fighting only when necessary.

 <p>
  Talent Swallowing Magician is all about smarts over brawl, with an intense plot, a deep worldbuilding that is intertwined with the narrative in a seamless way, and most importantly: a main character who uses his privileged mind to outsmart his rivals.

 <p>
  And though at first, he wasn't as powerful and talented as he is right now, Elric Melvinger was always more of a cunning type of character. He prefers to avoid fights whenever he can, but he is also ready to accept the challenge if any rival spellcaster dares to ridicule the Melvinger family name.

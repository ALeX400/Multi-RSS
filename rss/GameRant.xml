 <p>
  12 more characters have just been confirmed for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  , ranging from classic fan favorites like Mr. Satan to newer
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  characters like Goku Black. Fans had been waiting almost two decades for a new entry in the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  series when Bandai Namco announced
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  during The Game Awards 2023 back in December. Since then, more details about the upcoming sequel have slowly been unveiled ahead of its release on October 24.

 <p>
  One of the biggest draws of the
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  (or
  <em>
   Sparking
  </em>
  , as it is known in Japan) series is getting to play from a large roster of
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  characters, and
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  looks to continue that tradition by drawing from the original
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  anime. While much of the game’s marketing has naturally been focused around Goku and Vegeta,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  has shown gameplay for a wide variety of heroes and villains already, including fusion characters like Gotenks and Gogeta.

 <p>
  The already packed
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  roster has just gotten a little bigger, as a new trailer confirms no less than 12 more playable characters. Most of these new additions are from the more recent
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Super
  </em>
  anime, such as Jiren, Future Trunks, Roasie, Ribrianne, Anilaza, Super Ultra Instinct Sign Goku, and Super Sayan Rose Goku Black. There are also a few classic characters confirmed, like Super Vegito, Yajirobe, Spopovich, Dabura, and Mr. Satan.

  A jam-packed roster isn’t the only drawing point in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  , as it was recently confirmed that the offline multiplayer that helped make the older
  <em>
   Dragon Ball:
  </em>
  <em>
   Budokai Tenkaichi
  </em>
  games so popular will indeed be returning - though it will only be available for the Hyperbolic Time Chamber stage. On a brighter note, players will be able to create their own dream scenarios for battles in
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  with the new Choose Your Own Adventure Mode, in which the story is shaped by narrative choices that could radically deviate from the established
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  lore.

   <strong>
    Gran Turismo 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  developer Polyphony Digital has confirmed that the game's next content update will be announced on July 6 during a big in-person event. While Polyphony has added new content to
  <em>
   Gran Turismo 7
  </em>
  almost every month since its launch, fans speculate that the upcoming update's more grandiose announcement could hint to it being more ambitious than anticipated.

 <p>
  A standard
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  content update usually comprises a collection of new cars alongside new World Circuit missions, GT Café menus, Scapes locations, etc. Polyphony occasionally introduces a new track or more layouts for existing circuits in the game, but this has been quite far and few between for players, with no discernible cadence to expect them either. The studio has explained that modeling assets for
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  takes a long time, but with only four unique tracks being added to the game in over two years, many fans desire more clarity.

 <p>
  Thankfully, after a somewhat lengthy spell of smaller content updates, it appears the next
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  update might be the one players have been waiting for. Over on its official Twitter account, Polyphony Digital recently announced that it will reveal update 1.49 for
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  at the opening round of the Gran Turismo World Series 2024, which will supposedly be a huge in-person esports event held in Montreal, Canada on July 6. Considering prior
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  content updates were always announced on Twitter a few days before release, update 1.49 may be packing a lot more content for it to warrant such a grand announcement.

 <p>
  The last big content addition for
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  was its SPEC 2 update in November 2023, which introduced seven new cars, the Lake Louise track with three layouts, the Gran Turismo Sophy AI Driver Agent, an updated main menu, four-player split-screen functionality, 50 new License challenges, and much more. Polyphony hasn't hinted towards the scope of update 1.49 for
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  yet, but many fans wonder if it could be even more ambitious than SPEC 2, bearing in mind the eight-month release gap between them.

  It's too early to assume how big the next
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  update will be, and there's also the remote possibility of it just being a regular-sized update that Polyphony may have wanted to advertise at its Gran Turismo World Series event. However, the studio has been quite careful with managing expectations so far, and the uncharacteristic week-in-advance announcement likely alludes to update 1.49 being special in some way.
  <em>
   GT7
  </em>
  is already regarded as one of the best racing games on PS5, and its next update is set to make it even better.

 <p>
  FromSoftware's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  is perhaps the most highly anticipated DLC expansion to a AAA release ever made. Not only does
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  sit as yet another entry in FromSoftware's long tradition of producing thoughtfully crafted and meaningful expansions to its games, but it also stands as perhaps one of the most punishingly difficult DLCs in the studio's history. In terms of its size, its expansions to
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's lore and characters, and its place as a quality enhancement over the base game, Shadow of the Erdtree shares a lot in common with
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's Phantom Liberty expansion.

 <p>
  The Phantom Liberty expansion to
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  arrived at a time when the title was in the full swing of a complete turnaround in terms of player perception, accompanied by the huge Update 2.0 that saw
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  finally becoming the game that players had anticipated years prior. Most importantly, Phantom Liberty brought with it a brand new and intricately designed location in Dogtown, along with a captivating narrative that made the base game's story even better in retrospect. Combined with how both DLCs set a new standard of quality for post-launch expansions, Phantom Liberty and Shadow of the Erdtree are charting similar territory.

  Aside from both expansions being standout experiences that each exist on their own merits and enhance the base games they add on to, Shadow of the Erdtree and Phantom Liberty both make meaningful additions to
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's setting, characters, and conflict, respectively. Players learn bits and pieces about Miquella and the rest of the Empyreans in the main story of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , as well as come face-to-face with both his former protector in Malenia and his kidnapper in Mohg. As a result, Shadow of the Erdtree fills in important gaps in one of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's most interesting plot threads involving some of its most compelling characters.

 <p>
  Similarly, Phantom Liberty gives players much more in-depth insight into the geopolitical realities of the world of
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  and sheds light on aspects of government that are only hinted at in the main game. The cumulative effect of the important narrative enhancements both expansions make on top of what's already present in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's main narratives makes the main stories of each game arguably better in retrospect. On top of what both DLCs provide in their gameplay, they also add contextual knowledge that makes their worlds feel more immersive.

  Both FromSoftware and CD Projekt RED (CDPR) are studios known for crafting large expansions to their games that build on an already impressive foundation. Rather than releasing smaller chunks of DLC that cynically feel like pieces cut from a whole to be offered to gamers at a later date, the expansions to games like
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  have all enhanced the core experience of playing those games, changing each title for the better and providing more content to enrich what's already a highly-regarded title. In effect, both studios have now set a new standard for what a large-scale DLC for a AAA title should strive for.

 <p>
  Phantom Liberty and Shadow of the Erdtree brought spiked player counts to their base games, invigorating interest in years-old titles through content-rich and exciting expansions that go beyond just offering more of what players loved in the full release. A fully-fledged
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  sequel is in development, and where FromSoftware goes from here now that
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is complete is anyone's best guess. For now, the expansions to both games are quality expansions and enhancements that act as pseudo-sequels and earn their place as necessary parts of a single, congruent experience.

  <strong>
   <em>
    MultiVersus
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings some of the most iconic characters from Warner Bros. IP and pits them head-to-head in an all-out brawl. The action-packed fighting title that takes inspiration from the likes of
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros
  </em>
  . features a variety of familiar faces. From Arya Stark from
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  to Bugs Bunny,
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  brings some great characters to the stage. However, when it comes to the Iron Giant, the character has shown to be divisive among players.

 <p>
  The Iron Giant is a beloved and underrated character from the Warner Bros. roster. This character is a giant robot from the 1999 animated film
  <em>
   Iron Giant
  </em>
  . Although the addition of the character was an exciting prospect at first, there have been some major gameplay issues that have plagued the character, which has ultimately left many players frustrated. This isn't the first time the Iron Giant has had controversy in
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  , but this time it affects some players' ability to enjoy the game.

  Claims of the Iron Giant Being Overpowered
 </h3>
 <p>
  The biggest criticism of the character is that the Iron Giant is far too powerful when fighting in matches. Some have even claimed that it's practically impossible to defeat him. The most notable issue with the character comes with four "touch of death" combos that are fairly simple to pull off. These attacks begin at 0% damage and eventually end with the Iron Giant knocking the opponent out of bounds, which has understandably left many dreading going head-to-head with the character. These combos have proven to be so bothersome that it has even led
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  to temporarily diable the Iron Giant in order to rebalance him.

  Due to his towering size, it makes perfect sense that the Iron Giant plays the role of a tank character in the game. However, the aforementioned size has proven to be another problem for some players. The Iron Giant's size also makes it incredibly easy for the character to knock players out of bounds in a match. As the largest character in the game, his stature can sometimes take up nearly half of the stage.

  When it comes to character brawlers,
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  has managed to set itself apart from other titles in the genre, and one special aspect is in the aerial-focused combat. Although the emphasis on fighting in the air is fun, it can also make the Iron Giant a nightmare to face when he can easily push players off the map.

  Despite the criticism from some, there are other
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  players who love the character and think that complaints about him feeling unbeatable are overblown. Since he's a tank character, there could be an argument made that the Iron Giant is supposed to feel cumbersome and difficult to face. As
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  continues to change, only time will tell if the Iron Giant will reach a state that makes him a far less divisive character. So far, developer Player First Games has managed to craft a unique character brawler, but the issue with the Iron Giant demonstrates that the game has some growing pains to still get through.

 <p>
  There are hopes that
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  will add some iconic characters that have yet to be seen in the game, but until then, the game's roster is still a great lineup of faces. The Iron Giant is a wonderful character that many were excited to see brought to life in the game, so it's a shame to see such divided opinions on his mechanics. As time goes on, Player First Games will hopefully find the sweet spot for the Iron Giant.

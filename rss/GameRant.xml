  <em>
   <strong>
    The Long Dark
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a thrilling single-player survival-exploration game released in 2017 by Hinterland Studio. In this game, players find themselves trapped in the brutal Canadian wilderness following a cataclysmic magnetic storm that has cut them off from society. They are stranded on an island with no hopes of rescue. Explore, scavenge, and craft your way through this beautiful frozen island. Mother Nature is as much your friend as she is your enemy, and death is the only way this story ends.

 <p>
  Hunting items are among the most important items in the game, providing players with reliable means through which to secure food, protection, and crafting materials. Guns and bows will even allow players to fell the largest beasts of the wilderness.

  As the only craftable ranged hunting weapon in
  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  , the Survival Bow is an invaluable asset to any long-term survivor. Long after rifles have broken, and revolver bullets are spent, the Survival Bow still remains as a usable and efficient means through which to kill animals â€” both predator and prey. Like other bows, the Survival Bow features craftable ammo that can be retrieved when it misses, further bolstering its long-term viability when compared to guns.

  The humble stone is a surprisingly efficient means through which new players can reliably hunt small prey such as rabbits and ptarmigans. A single well-aimed hit to either of these animals will stun them, allowing players to easily pick up and kill them. Access to reliable meat sources can be the difference between life and death during the difficult beginning hours of a new playthrough, giving players a much-needed grace period during which they can gather resources and get better acquainted with the region they find themselves in.

  Stones can also be used in a last ditch attempt to stop charging wolves. If players manage to strike a wolf's head, it will stop charging and flee.

  A versatile ranged weapon, the Distress Pistol is valuable both offensively and defensively. With the fastest bleed out timer of any weapon and the ability to land critical hits, shots by this pistol have a very high mortality rate. Like with other ranged weapons, shots that strike the heads of deer and wolves will always instantly kill them, while bears shot in the head will take a mere 30 minutes to bleed out. The Distress Pistol can also be used defensively to scare away wolves and bears.

  Once placed in an ice hole, the Fishing Tip-Up will catch fish passively for the player, allowing them to attend to other tasks. This hunting item is a fantastic means through which players can ensure a steady food supply, as the trap can catch very large fish. With relatively simple crafting requirements, this trap can be easily made by beginners and long-term survivalists alike, and is even a viable means to acquire food on harder difficulties.

  The Warden's Revolver is the lightest revolver with the fastest draw speed in the game. In a wilderness where deadly predators could be lurking around every corner, this revolver's fast draw speed can be the difference between life and death. Doubly so, given that even charging wolves can be scared away by the mere sound of gunshots.

  The lighter weight of this revolver also allows players to carry just that bit more without encumbering themselves. Given that survival in
  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  is all about having the right resources in the right place at the right time, even a small increase to players' carrying capacities is a significant boon. Doubly so for players who favor a more nomadic survival style.

  The rabbit equivalent to the Fishing Tip-Up, Snares allow players to catch rabbits passively over time. Snares require less resources to craft and less maintenance time than Fishing Tip-Ups, making them an even more beginner-friendly means of keeping your food status bar high. Snares are renewable, as Cured Rabbit Guts can be acquired readily from the rabbits caught within it. Reclaimed Wood can also be obtained by breaking down a broken trap.

  It's worth noting, however, that snares must be placed in areas where rabbits spawn for rabbits to be caught within the Snare. Placing Snares outside these spawn areas will result in nothing being caught.

 <p>
  The strongest and most lightweight rifle in
  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  , Vaughn's Rifle is a truly deadly gun that will have players feeling like apex predators themselves. This gun provides players with the ability to hunt and procure a wide array of essential crafting materials. The lighter weight of this rifle also makes carrying a rifle and revolver at the same time more viable, maximizing players' defensive and offensive capabilities.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":952} -->

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the rifle's greater strength and lower weight comes at the cost of lower durability, which can be a significant issue on harder difficulties. Vaughn's Rifle is only found in the Mystery Lake region, making obtaining this item treacherous for those who spawn or live in distant regions.

  The lighter, more durable counterpart to the Survival Bow, the Sport Bow is an all-round better alternative when it comes to hunting abilities, sporting no trade-offs for its better stats. If players intend to hunt animals, both big and small, by bow, this is the one to use. Like the Survival Bow, the Sport Bow also has easily craftable and retrievable ammo.

  Unfortunately, the Sport Bow is not available on Interloper difficulties, and it isn't a reliable long-term hunting weapon since it can't be repaired or crafted. This bow is also only found in a handful of dangerous locations, making it a risky but rewarding weapon to procure.

 <p>
  There are so many open-world games across the market nowadays, but unfortunately for fans, these sweeping, epic adventures take a lot of time to make. Franchises like
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Elder Scrolls
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto
   </strong>
  </em>
  have been proving just how long it can take to build the next generation-defining game in a series, but fortunately these games are also great at building hundreds of hours of content beyond the main campaign into their worlds.
 </p>

 <p>
  While modding communities and online options can keep players entertained almost endlessly, it is great to see a game that builds in a huge amount of content outside the main game. This leaves players wondering what they can do next when they finish the game, as opposed to feeling left at a dead end and immediately moving on. Easter Eggs, random encounters, side quests and even other campaigns can be hugely influential in keeping a game relevant for longer, and these games did that right.

  Few games have so much material to work with when it comes to side quests. Though
  <em>
   <strong>
    Batman: Arkham City
   </strong>
  </em>
  was created in 2011, it managed to capture the scope of modern open-world games with a truly vast volume of extra content. The
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  mythos had been built since 1940 and that meant there were continuous Easter Eggs, side villains and other stories to be told outside the main quest line for developers willing to put the effort in.

 <p>
  Rocksteady nailed this game, from Batcomputer simulation training to side quests involving a tonnage of Batman villains. Everyone from the Mad Hatter and Deadshot to Hush and Bane appear in this game. The sheer mass of side quests and collectables to be taken on make for one of gamingâ€™s great experiences, particularly for those familiar with the
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  mythos.

  From purchasing land in Hylian Homeowner to Hunt For The Giant Horse, the side quests are varied and wildly entertaining in this game. Players can hunt for the Thunder Helm or Sand Boots and various other items that arenâ€™t necessary but sure are cool and useful to have. If players want more challenges beyond the normal story, they can even search for side quests like Stranded On Eventide for a real head-scratcher in this massive, content-filled game.

  When an open-world
  <em>

  game arrived that allowed players to swing freely through a huge map of New York City, it was going to be a success no matter what.

  From fights with Taskmaster and huge construction sites filled with waves of enemies to tracking down different missions from Harry Osborn and collecting photos of landmarks,
  <em>

  is a fantastic, vibrant open-world game which is complete with a nearly never-ending mass of content that players should make sure to check out on their next playthrough.

  The Continent has been expanded upon in books, games and on Netflix, but nothing has ever captured the feel of it as well as
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Witcher 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  . This game was massive, set across the Continent, from the notable city of Novigrad to the no-manâ€™s land of Velen, and features the main quest to find Ciri and deal with the Wild Hunt, but also many other notable side stories and events.

  Geralt is a witcher, which means many monster hunts are available throughout the game. But various choices made affect romances, Ciriâ€™s survival, and the war between Nilfgaard and the Northern Kingdoms. Side quests in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  are numerous and incredible, and it is noted as a game that players can adventure through for years without ever finishing the main story.

  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2

  is one of the biggest games ever and the kind of world it builds makes it easy to forget how much extra content is just hiding out there.

  one of the most revisited open-world games ever.

  Defending Bitter Springs against Legionnaires, hunting the creatures of the Wasteland for their eggs and the hilarious quest about freeing Raul are some particular highlights from this filled world.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto 5

  did bring an expansive world to life and filled it to the brim with activities, quests and filler. A truly fantastic game which can easily be considered one of the best of all time, players get to experience the life of a criminal as they try to complete jobs and heists, rack up huge volumes of money, and purchase all sorts of great items and weapons.

  Normally, players can freely explore a game and look at everything there is to see without too much fear, as their character will level quickly enough to be able to handle most enemies. In a game like
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  , this simply isnâ€™t the case, as every enemy can be deadly, and every extra set of ruins could contain a huge maze that will frustrate players endlessly.

 <p>
  The challenges in even the filler content of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  are what makes it so memorable, so rewarding to get through, and so interesting to replay even, because players will normally sprint for the finish after dying so many times to individual bosses. This means most players, even those that have finished the game, havenâ€™t seen most of the other terrifying bosses and side material that this bleak world is filled with.

  Even huge games like
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  donâ€™t come with a huge number of different campaigns.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Skyrim
   </strong>
  </em>
  has a main campaign, which focuses on the Dragonborn taking on and defeating Alduin, the ancient dragon. However, it also contains several other campaigns that are essentially wonderful filler content, like the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood and Civil War.

 <p>
  Beyond even these,
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  has side quests, miscellaneous quests, random encounters, repeatable quests, Daedric Quests, and more. There is no end to what players can do, and to see everything within the game of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  takes hundreds of hours spent venturing around the massive open world, particularly with the DLCs and anniversary edition content added in. This all makes for a hugely enjoyable mass volume of filler.

  Augments are the main source of progression in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies
   </em>
  </strong>
  alongside weapon leveling, and they're game-changers. From Weapons Mods, Field Upgrades, and Perks, Augments not only give straight up benefits during gameplay, but open up a wide variety of different playstyles within the game's existing abilities.

 <p>
  Armor sees a return in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies
  </em>
  , and the Major Augment Reactive Armor boosts its efficacy. With this Augment equipped, whenever an armor plate is broken, nearby zombies are stunned as if hit with a Concussion Grenade.

 <p>
  This is super useful against the Super Sprinters that spawn in later rounds, making it so that the ones that catch up to you and break your armor don't get the chance to combo you, and are temporarily taken out of the fight. This works on earlier rounds as well, stunning zombies making it harder to get trapped and providing more time to react after taking damage.

  Elemetal Pop plays off the game's Ammo Mods: elemental mods that assign a specific damage type to your weapon as well as giving them a bonus interaction against the enemies faced. Each of these Ammo mods is useful in their own way, and the different special enemies are weak to differing elements. Default, the perk will proc a random mod, but with the Major Augment "Citrus Focus" it will only proc the Weapon Mod slotted to the gun.

 <p>
  This allows for players to better focus on specific damage types, increasing the chance that they proc certain elements. This makes it perfect for getting weapons dedicated to getting rid of Manglers, Amalgamations, and Abominations, as you can focus the elements they are weak to, allowing for significantly more damage against these enemies.

  PHD Flopper's primary use is preventing players from damaging themselves with their own explosives, with the side benefit of it dealing damage in a radius when diving from heights. Dr Ram, however, adds a third interaction that is one of the most noticeable upgrades in the game: the ability to shoulder zombies away while tac-sprinting. Similar to the shoulder charge "Tackle" ability in Dying Light, Dr Rams allows players to body zombies directly in front of them, moving them out of the way without sacrificing speed and momentum.

 <p>
  This is perfect for those times when things don't go according to plan, and players are forced into more claustrophobic areas of the map. While narrow corridors would typically spell death, this perk can make these areas of the map significantly less dangerous.

 <p>
  Dead Break is a Minor Augment, but that doesn't make it any less useful. This is because at higher rounds armored enemies become much more common, as well as Manglers, which are innately armored. Manglers in particular are incredibly dangerous, especially on higher rounds, and can spawn very frequently up to a maximum of six on the map at one time.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1037} -->

 <p>
  Dead Break helps keep these Manglers and armored zombies manageable for longer, while also synergizing well with other methods of getting rid of armor like explosive damage, as it doesn't require any more or less skill to capitalize on. It's free damage, and stacks with Ammo Mods as well as the Major Augment Dead Head, which further increases headshot damage, allowing to better punish enemies once their armor is stripped.

  Hot Foot is a Minor Augment that makes it so that when you get a kill with your Lethal or Tactical, you gain significantly increased movement speed. This speed boost is significantly faster than any enemy in the game and allows you to gain distance and create breathing room.

  This is useful for full-map training and allows players to reset enemies if needed by overriding their distance threshold. An easy way to take constant advantage of this is to use Combat Axes, as they can be used over and over again, and can be you can hold more of them than most lethals. Using each at precise locations on your train route can make it so there is always a Combat Axe just a few steps away.

  Equivalent Exchange on Quick Revive brings the Second Wind mechanic from Borderlands into
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies
  </em>
  allowing players to revive themselves while down so long as they can get a kill. This self-reviving can normally only be done with a Self-Revive Kit, but Equivalent Exchange allows for another method for prolonging runs.

 <p>
  Since revive kits can only be crafted up to three times per run, this gives players an additional three chances during their run so long as they can secure a kill while down. This perk pairs well with weapons like the Ray Gun and Sally and Forth, as they can be used while down, and their explosive damage makes them very forgiving.

  Each new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty
   </em>
  </strong>
  release brings an opportunity for players to maximize their progress, and one of the best ways to do this is by using
  <strong>
   Double XP Tokens
  </strong>
  . These tokens help accelerate your advancement through the Battle Pass, weapon levels, and player ranks, giving you access to better gear for combat.

 <p>
  After the controversy surrounding the Season 1 update, where Double XP Tokens briefly appeared in the Multiplayer menu before being removed in a later patch, many players are eager to redeem these tokens to save time in Treyarch's title. If youâ€™ve earned a ton of Double XP Tokens during
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  , hereâ€™s how to use them in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  .

  Players can still use their Double XP Tokens earned during
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  â€™s Multiplayer and Zombies modes. However, due to a post-Season 1 patch, these tokens were removed from the

   BO6

  Multiplayer menu. Now, a new method is required for those hoping to activate them.

  Part of what makes many FPS multiplayer games so appealing and popular is how they manage to provide a fast-paced and thrilling gameplay experience that other genres struggle to replicate. Jumping into a match, scoring a few kills, and reaping the rewards once the chaos is over is an easy way to pump our brains full of serotonin, but not every FPS game allows for this, since there are many that will keep their matches going on for quite a while, forcing players to fight until the bitter end.

 <p>
  On the other hand though, there are also plenty of online FPS titles entirely centered around getting players in and out of the action as quickly as possible, while also giving them enough time to enjoy the core gameplay experience. Anyone who prefers firing up a shooter that can be played in small but satisfying bursts ought to consider checking out these titles listed below.

  Admittedly, the time it takes to play an average match in
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  will depend on the mode you choose, but it's certainly possible to hop into a game for no more than 10 minutes when opting for one of the smaller-sized options. For example, Arena Slayer and Capture the Flag only rarely pass the 10 minute mark, providing enough time for players to have a competitive all-out brawl before the final scoreboard shows up.

 <p>
  Additionally,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  also has a rotation system where new cosmetic items are added every few weeks, including in the battle passes, meaning even a short match can contribute to earning these kinds of unique goodies. It may have received a lot of flak upon release, but
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  has come a very long way since then and is now a perfect game to play for those looking for quick and snappy online matches.

  Players have two options to choose from when booting up
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  ; ranked or unranked. While the former will drop them into longer tug-of-war style matches, the former is a much more casual alternative where the matches are much quicker, due to there being fewer rounds, and very often, more chaotic gunfights where people aren't as worried about dying.

  Luckily,
  <em>

  plentiful selection of heroes, who can all be switched between mid-game, make each and every match feel different from the last, while Blizzard's frequent patches ensure the game never becomes too unbalanced or frustrating to play. These small tweaks and amendments to the characters can also encourage players to jump in every now and again, even if it's just for a few minutes, in order to get a feel for what's changed since their last play session.

  <em>
   Titanfall 2
  </em>
  is often considered to be an underrated gem of the FPS genre by those who have played it, but in recent years, it's made a massive comeback. In 2023, it was announced that, after much demand,
  <em>
   Titanfall 2's
  </em>
  servers would be restored, allowing players to once again dive into this parkor-mech hybrid FPS title once again.

 <p>
  Though the online matches in
  <em>
   Titanfall 2
  </em>
  tend to be pretty short, what makes the game such a blast to play is how much explosive action is crammed into each and every game. As players sprint around the map, picking off enemies as they go using hyper-futuristic weapons, they'll eventually have the chance to pilot a mech where they can partake in robotic-kaiju battles with the enemy, resulting in an epic climax to a hard fought battle.

  <em>
   Splitgate
  </em>
  is a free-to-play online FPS shooter which is largely characterized by two things; it's vibrant art style, and it's adrenaline-pumping gameplay. This is a game where players need to be on their A game at all times to stand a chance of taking down the enemy, but they will also need to make good use of the 'Portals' to navigate the maps and flank around the opposing team.

 <p>
  All of this means players are able to come face to face with one another in no time at all, resulting in short but sweet matches that never feel like they outstay their welcome. While it may be easy to play, the Portal mechanic makes
  <em>
   Splitgate
  </em>
  a tricky game to fully master, incentivizing players to jump in again and again to try and find new ways to fool their opponents.

  While ziplines are one common method of traversal, where

  really shines is in its environment, and more specifically, how easily they can be torn down.

  , the free upgrade to the immensely popular

One of these is Wingman, a 2v2 mode where only one bomb site is placed on the map, resulting in an intense scramble to see which team can either plant or defuse, or simply pick off their opponents to score the win.

  There's also Deathmatch, a much more traditional mode longtime FPS fans will be very familiar with. The aim is simple; acquire as many kills as possible to win the game, making it ideal for testing out new weapons and gear. Some of

  competitive matches can also be on the shorter side if they end up being largely one-sided, but this isn't always guaranteed.

  It may have taken a little while, but it feels as though
  <em>
   Call of Duty's
  </em>
  developers have finally managed to perfect the arcade-style twitch-trigger gameplay that they've been building upon for so many years with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . The introduction of omni-movement, paired with the quick time-to-kill makes each and every match fast, fun, and exciting to be a part of.

 <p>
  In classic
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  fashion, each game will net the player EXP to level up and unlock new guns and equipment, no matter how short or long they are. What's more is, in an effort to keep players hooked on the game, Treyarch is always dropping double XP promotions, meaning even a 5-minute match can go a long way as part of the grind.

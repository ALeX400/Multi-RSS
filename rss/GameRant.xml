      <title>Even Though It Never Happened, Bendâ€™s Rumored Uncharted Game is a Good Sign For The Future</title>

  Out of all the first-party developers at PlayStation,
  <strong>
   Bend Studio
  </strong>
  is arguably the one company that doesn't get as much recognition as it deserves. The Oregon-based firm has been around for 32 years, even longer than the PlayStation brand itself, and yet its portfolio of games isn't really regarded that highly compared to studios like Sucker Punch, Naughty Dog, and Insomniac. Bend Studio originally got its start making puzzle video games for the Apple Newton, but during the PS1 generation, it branched out and worked on other projects, such as the
  <em>
   Syphon Filter
  </em>
  series. Nowadays, the company is better known for developing the 2019 zombie-slaying game
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  , which was divisive among critics but received positively by fans.

  If recent rumors are to be believed, Bend Studio's next game is going to be a military multiplayer third-person shooter that potentially has GAAS elements. This unannounced title is apparently going to be a part of a new intellectual property, and won't be a follow-up to
  <em>
   Syphon Filter
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   SOCOM
  </em>
  , or any of PlayStation's other legacy series. The decision to work on a new IP instead of an established franchise after
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  may not have always been Bend Studio's intention, however. The company was reportedly working on an
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  game at one time, which might not be in development anymore.

  Bend Studio Was Working on New Uncharted and Days Gone Games, But Both Were Scrapped
 </h3>
 <p>
  Back in April 2021, rumors were swirling around that a sequel to
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  had internally been shelved due to the poor critical reception and strenuous development cycle of its predecessor. At the time, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that one of the teams at Bend Studio that was working on
  <em>
   Days Gone 2
  </em>
  had shifted its focus to developing a new
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  game instead. Although Schreier didn't report on any specifics about this game, he did reveal that it was still in the planning stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Schreier's claims were further corroborated by leaked documents from the 2023 Insomniac hack, which revealed that Bend Studio was, at one point, planning to pursue a
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  sequel and an
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  game. These particular documents were from 2020, and even though four years have passed since then, this mysterious
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  project has yet to be announced. According to Schreier, this is because it was likely canceled. Since many of the staff at Bend Studio were more interested in creating a new IP instead of a follow-up to
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  , the game never saw the light of day.
 </p>
 <h3 id="bend-studio-has-experience-with-the-uncharted-franchise">
  Bend Studio Has Experience With the Uncharted Franchise
 </h3>
 <p>
  If Bend Studio had created a new
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  game, it wouldn't have been the companies' first time working on the famous action-adventure franchise. The developer has collaborated with fellow Sony subsidiary Naughty Dog on several occasions and created various
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  spin-offs over the years, such as
  <em>
   Uncharted: Golden Abyss
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Uncharted: Fight for Fortune
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Uncharted: Drake's Trail
  </em>
  . It's typically uncommon for Sony to hand off its tentpole first-party IPs to other developers under the PlayStation umbrella, but Bend Studio was an exception.
 </p>
 <h3 id="sony-may-be-willing-to-let-other-studios-work-on-their-legacy-franchises-in-the-future">
  Sony May Be Willing to Let Other Studios Work On their Legacy Franchises In the Future
 </h3>
 <p>
  Perhaps it would benefit Sony to allow more of its internal developers to work on the franchises created by their sister studios. It'd be great, for example, if Insomniac was able to work on a new mainline
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  game, or if Polyphony Digital was given permission to work on a sixth entry in the
  <em>
   MotorStorm
  </em>
  series.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's hard to say if hypothetical games like these will ever come to fruition, or if the developers under Sony are even interested in working on franchises they didn't create. With that said, the fact that Sony is even willing to let a company like Bend Studio work on a flagship Naughty Dog IP shows that the firm is still open to the idea of bringing back franchises without their original creators at the helm. That, at the very least, may give some fans hope that Sony will consider reviving its dormant IPs in the same way that it was supposedly going to do for
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  .

      <title>Every Nintendo Switch 2 Accessory Leaked So Far</title>

 <p>
  This year has been rife with gaming rumors and leaks, and the
  <strong>
   Switch 2
  </strong>
  has been front and center. Coming up on its eight-year anniversary, Nintendo's current console has had an impressive lifespan, but the imminent announcement of the Switch 2 has kept many gamers eagerly waiting in the wings. Just this week, another potential accessory for the Switch 2 was leaked, adding to the excitement.

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  The leak in question claims to have revealed a Switch 2 controller attachment that turns it into a wheel. While it's possible that this Joy-Con design is accurate, the leak must be taken with a grain of salt until Nintendo officially confirms anything. A skeptical approach should be taken in regard to every Switch 2 leak, but until Nintendo makes its first announcement about the upcoming console, there is a long list of rumored accessories that may be expected.

  Magnetic Joy-Cons and Wheel Attachment
 </h3>
 <p>
  As it stands, none of these accessories have been confirmed by Nintendo, so they could end up being false claims. However, if they do happen to be accurate, then the Switch 2 could bring some fun launch accessories to gamers. In regard to magnetic Joy-Cons, a user on the Chinese video sharing platform BilliBilli posted a clip showcasing them removing Joy-Cons from the console, implying a new magnetic approach. Furthermore, the newly leaked wheel attachment immediately ignited speculation that
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  could be planned as a Switch 2 launch title. This is very much a possibility, but only time will tell.

 <h3 id="pro-controller-and-u-shaped-kickstand">
  Pro Controller and U-Shaped Kickstand
 </h3>
 <p>
  A leak from Centro Leaks recently made claims of a Switch 2 Pro Controller that closely resembles the original console's Pro Controller. This specific leak was found via an online forum, so it's hard to say if the claims are accurate. Meanwhile, leaks detailing a possible U-shaped kickstand have also made the rounds on the internet as well. While the original console featured something similar, the supposed photos showcase a stronger, sturdier design.

 <p>
  These types of accessories are to be expected for the Switch 2, but the details of these leaked items actually provide more insight than one might think. Based on the sizes detailed in an online listing on e-commerce site 1688.com that claimed to be for a case and screen protector, the Switch 2 could be considerably larger than its predecessor. This size difference has yet to be set in stone, but it will be a compelling change, if true.

     The original Switch's measurements are 239 x 102 x 13.9mm, while the leaked Switch 2 case claims its measurements are around 290 x 135 x 45mm. It's unlikely that the Switch 2 is 45mm thick; this dimension is likely for cushioning inside the case.

  Despite these various accessory leaks being pure speculation at the moment, fans at least have a general timeline to look forward to for the Switch 2's official announcement. Nintendo has confirmed that the next-gen console will be announced before the end of the company's fiscal year, which ends March 2025. Although a reveal could happen any day between now and March, the latter is likely, since the original console was released during that month. As the wait continues, more leaks and rumors are bound to pop up, and it will be fascinating to see which accessories turn out to be true.

  The future of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts
   </em>
  </strong>
  is currently a mystery, as the wait for the fourth mainline game in the series continues. Through the years,
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  has established itself as an incredibly unique IP, thanks to its ties to Disney. A blend of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  and Disney franchises makes
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  a combination that works surprisingly well. Now that
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4

  is on the horizon, many are wondering which recent Disney properties will get their moment in the spotlight.

  <em>
   Moana 2
  </em>
  . With the first film releasing back in 2016,
  <em>
   Moana
  </em>
  was nowhere to be seen in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3

  Since the first movie,

  boasts all the trademarks of what makes a specific world in
  <em>

  Moana's Ocean Focus Can Take the Reins From Pirates of the Caribbean
 </h3>
 <p>
  When it comes to ocean-based worlds in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  franchise brought forth beloved locations. Beginning with Port Royal in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 2
  </em>
  and then expanding into the more exploration-friendly Caribbean in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  , Disney's long-running pirate series has brought some of the best worlds to
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  . However, the chances of a
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  world returning may be dwindling, since there hasn't been a new
  <em>
   Pirates
  </em>
  movie in several years. While this is just speculation,
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  may be eyeing more modern franchises to showcase in the next chapter, and
  <em>
   Moana
  </em>
  could easily fill that space.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Moana
  </em>
  is perfect for an ocean-based map, and it has the benefit of bringing magic to such a setting. Between the titular heroine Moana and Maui, there are plenty of great character traits to work with, and while not having
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  would be a huge loss,
  <em>
   Moana
  </em>
  is the best successor to fill such a possible void. However, there is another way to get the best of both worlds.
 </p>
 <h3 id="expanding-kingdom-hearts-4-39-s-ocean-based-world-beyond-one-franchise">
  Expanding Kingdom Hearts 4's Ocean-Based World Beyond One Franchise
 </h3>
 <p>
  There is also the possibility for
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Moana
  </em>
  to come together in one overarching world. The Caribbean in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  was a big hit among players. One compelling route is an open ocean-focused world that allows players to explore even more, which could lead to Moana's coastal village. Of course, this could just be wishful thinking, but it would be a way to showcase a new franchise without setting
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  aside, even if the real-life Caribbean and Polynesia are nowhere close to each other. Also, since a new
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  movie is rumored to be in its early stages, excitement for the franchise may be reignited after all.

  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  leaks are suggesting that one of the game's earliest S-Rank characters will be receiving their own Agent Story, with Ellen set to star. Throughout the nearly six months since the HoYoverse urban action RPG burst onto the scene, the game has welcomed a diverse and memorable cast of characters. From the lovable group of the Cunning Hares to the game's unique animal-like "Thiren" characters like Lycaon and Ben, multiple members of the game's roster have quickly become fan-favorites. Now, one of the RPG's most beloved characters is set to feature in its next update.
 </p>
 <p>
  S-Rank Ice Attack character Ellen serves a notable role in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's roster as one of the game's most popular cast members. Ellen was the first limited S-Rank character to be added to the game's roster on release, highlighting
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's launch in July. Ellen has also been a prominent staple within the game's meta, serving as one of
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's strongest DPS characters throughout its initial updates. While Ellen appeared in the Victoria Housekeeping segment of
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's main story, she is now set to receive her own special spotlight in Version 1.5.

  A new update shared to the

  leaks subreddit is teasing one of the next Agent Stories coming in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's Version 1.5. According to the leak, Ellen will be receiving her own Agent Story during
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's next update, putting the spotlight on the shark Thiren for a set of special missions. Fans will reportedly be able to play Ellen's Agent Story by reaching Inter-Knot Level 15, after unlocking the Video Archive in Random Play. The Agent Story is also rumored to come alongside an event, likely granting extra rewards for completion.

  Ellen's Agent Story in Version 1.5 may serve to corroborate previous rumors about a potential return for the Victoria Housekeeping unit. Recent leaks have suggested that Ellen may soon star on
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's first rerun banner, expected to arrive in the near future. The Ellen rerun was initially expected to appear in Version 1.4, though the potential Agent Story suggests it was pushed back to coincide with her starring role. Version 1.5 is currently scheduled to release on January 22.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ellen's return to the spotlight in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  will likely serve to pave the way for future Agent Stories in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  . New Eridu Public Security's Zhu Yuan debuted during the second half of Version 1.0 following Ellen's release, with the Special Response Team leader also lacking her own Agent Story. HoYoverse has typically added one new Agent Story with each update, with several prominent five-star characters like Jane Doe and Caesar lacking their own focused stories. Fans of
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  's cast should look to have plenty more character stories on the way.

      <title>Best PlayStation Plus Games (July 2024)</title>

 <p>
  On June 13, 2022, Sony launched its new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  in North America. Split into three tiers, this model combines the previous version of PS Plus with PS Now; depending on which level someone subscribes to, they will gain access to certain services and games.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Essential ($9.99/month):
   </strong>
   This tier is the equivalent of the old PS Plus. A subscription includes online access, monthly free games, and discounts.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Extra ($14.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential tier benefits, Extra provides access to hundreds of PS4 and PS5 games.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Premium ($17.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential and Extra tier benefits, Premium includes a library of classic games (PS3, PS2, PSP, and PS1), trials, and cloud streaming in certain regions.

 <p>
  <strong>
   PS Plus Premium
  </strong>
  has over 700 games covering more than two decades of PlayStation history. Such a huge collection can be overwhelming, and the PS Plus app does not make it very easy to browse through the library; as such, it can be useful to know this tier's highlights before investing in a subscription. Each month, Sony adds a handful of new games. While most of these are PS5 and PS4 releases, they are occasionally accompanied by a few classic titles.

 <p>
  PS Plus has more than a few Soulslike games, reflecting the genre's explosion in popularity over the last couple of years. In most cases, people's first exposure will be a FromSoftware project, be it
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  . These are all great places to start, but if the introductory game fails to hit the mark with a new player, they might conclude that Soulslikes are just not for them and ignore any releases by other developers. While most titles take heavy inspiration from the
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  games, the genre has enough variety to offer genuine alternatives that do their own thing. Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  games serve as prime examples of Soulslikes with unique identities that set them apart from their contemporaries. The first game is not available on PS Plus, but Sony's subscription service has the (arguably) superior sequel.

  Starting with the most "obvious" distinction,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is predominantly a third-person shooter, although melee weapons are available as secondary options. Players steadily gain access to a respectable selection of hand and long guns, with the latter generally acting as a loadout's main option. While most guns are purchased rather than looted, enemies regularly drop mods and mutators that can be used to modify builds on the fly, providing customization without flooding the inventory.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  's class system is also fantastic.

 <p>
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is at its best when played in 3-player co-op, to the point that many of the archetypes (classes) and bosses feel tailor-made for parties rather than solo runners. The latter can pick a class that includes a dog companion, so they have an option; however, they might find the campaign to be quite difficult, even on the lowest challenge level. Still, the gameplay is fun, the build variety is solid, and the world-hopping structure is pretty awesome. The bosses are also awesome, including a few that have an impressive sense of scale.

  Rockstar's portfolio is not over-represented by PS Plus, but the developer's biggest names are on Sony's service. Added back in May 2024 after already being removed once,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is still a big deal, despite the game being more than 5 years old by this point. An ambitious prequel to 2010's decorated Western,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  brings to life a unique period in American history: the end of the Frontier. The Van der Linde gang represents the dying Wild West, and Arthur Morgan specifically finds himself ripped out of time and in an era that no longer wants his type.

 <p>
  Offering a 50+ hour campaign,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  is an open-world game that emphasizes character-driven storytelling, both in its main quests and also the optional content found across the map. The latter missions tell personal and often emotional stories, and they play a part in shaping Arthur Morgan's personality and (ultimately) destiny. The writing is superb, but that means nothing in the face of unenjoyable gameplay, and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is a peculiar case. Rockstar prioritizes authenticity, delivering an immersive gameplay loop that highlights the tedium that makes up an outlaw's ordinary everyday existence. This decision can be somewhat polarizing, but it does make for a unique experience.

  While the PlayStation 3 had a somewhat slow start to life, the console bowed out in style. Naughty Dog's
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is a haunting action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with infected creatures. The narrative follows the grizzled Joel and the immune Ellie as they travel across the United States in search of a group rumored to be able to craft a cure.

 <p>
  The journey is tough, brutal, and unforgettable. Both of the main characters undergo a great deal of development, particularly Joel, while
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  raises questions of morality through its ambiguous narrative. Even though PS Plus does not have the PS5 remake, the PS4 remaster of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  holds up well and offers a fantastic means to experience an industry-defining gaming story.

  FromSoftware has cornered the hard-hitting action RPG genre through its immaculate
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy, and that looks set to continue with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Out of all the studio's many great games,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  might just be FromSoftware's magnum opus.

 <p>
  Boasting a Gothic aesthetic and reflex-based combat that demands aggression from players,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  delivers a kinetic experience that delights on a visual, auditory, and gameplay level. Naturally,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is not an easy game, but it is one of the most rewarding PS4 exclusives. Consequently, it is easily among the best games on PS Plus.

  Paradox's
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  is rightfully recognized as one of the best grand strategy games of all time, particularly due to its character-driven presentation that puts players in charge of a family tree rather than just a general nation. These types of projects have historically been PC exclusives, and while developers have started to create console ports in recent years, the transition is not always smooth. On PS5,
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  works well enough to be playable, even if it comes with occasionally frustrating controls that naturally stem from Paradox's attempt to squeeze a keyboard-worth of inputs onto a gamepad. Nevertheless, the console version is a fine way to experience this fantastic title.

  Now, even if played in its optimal setting,
  <em>
   CK3
  </em>
  can be overwhelming, and newcomers must be prepared to go through some growing pains before they settle down into a satisfying rhythm. While not completely obtuse, the tutorial is fairly rough and inaccessible; however, the game is great enough to be worth sitting through a couple of unenjoyable early hours. Along with grand strategy gameplay,
  <em>
   CK3
  </em>
  also falls within the RPG genre, with its characters having well-defined traits that not only impact their personalities but also influence their stress concerning the player's choices. While part of the equation, war is not emphasized in the game, with the focus being on interpersonal relationships, politics, and social management.

   PS Plus games
  </strong>
  that everyone with an account should play, and 2018's
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  should be at the top of that list. This "reboot" of the series sees Kratos living in a different part of the world, far from the Greecian roots players are used to seeing him in.

  Kratos' move to Midgard gave developers a chance to shine a spotlight on some different gods, tapping into the deep Scandinavian folklore surrounding the Norse Gods and their mythology. With RPG elements, an incredible story, breathtaking visuals, and some awesome combat mechanics,

   God of War

  While not unheard of, Day 1 PS Plus arrivals are rare, with most months not featuring this type of release. Consequently, whenever an exception materializes, it is always a cause for celebration; more importantly,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is an exceptional exception. Technically, Mintrocket's indie darling has been around since 2023, but it had to wait until April 16, 2024, to make its PlayStation debut, so it still counts as a Day 1 addition. When this year comes to an end,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  will almost certainly be remembered as one of the best PS Plus newcomers.

 <p>
  Combining restaurant management with fishing, Mintrocket created a package that feels oddly unique, despite sharing similarities with many other projects. As Dave, players have two general responsibilities: catch and serve fish. The former takes up the protagonist's days, forcing him to constantly make trips into an evolving ocean in search of materials that can be used to create sushi at his restaurant. Naturally, the nights are spent running the establishment, making sure that customers are satisfied. While the management aspect is not as deep as some other titles on the market,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  gives players more than enough control to make these segments engaging. However, the fishing element is the game's highlight and adds the most replay value.

  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  is without question the most famous horror franchise in gaming, and it is eternally linked to the PlayStation brand. Premium subscribers can play through a healthy selection of entries from Capcom's license, including classics such as
  <em>
   Resident Evil Code: Veronica X
  </em>
  , polarizing sequels like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  , and HD remasters of masterpieces like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  . The Extra tier does not have quite as robust of a catalog, although it includes two notable projects in 2019's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake and its sequel. When the main entries successfully shifted to a first-person perspective with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  , some fans might have feared that could spell an end for classic third-person releases; fortunately, Capcom relaxed those anxieties with a couple of stellar remakes.

 <p>
  2020's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  is the weakest of Capcom's modern remakes, although it is still a solid action-horror game that does justice to the classic PS1 original. However,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is considerably more complete and satisfying, delivering a robust two-protagonist campaign that is consistently intense and terrifying. The controls are immaculate, the visuals are stunning, and the sound design is among the best in the genre – an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is almost the perfect horror game.

  One of the
  <strong>
   best PlayStation Plus games
  </strong>
  to launch on Day 1,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is an inspired Metroidvania with simple but effective controls. For the most part, the game sticks very close to the genre's standard formula of unbound exploration, puzzles, platforming, and the gradual reveal of new items that provide access to different areas; however, Shared Memory succeeded in stitching these well-worn pieces together to create something that feels at least somewhat fresh. A big part of this comes down to
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  's haunting aesthetic and ambient music, which combine to create a campaign oozing in atmosphere and style, making up for a lack of a conventional story.

 <p>
  Although fun, the platforming sections are quite easy, with most of the jumps providing players with plenty of room for error. However,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is still pretty darn difficult due to its puzzles, very open nature, and clever boss fights. The game's brainteasers often require lateral thinking (and clever use of a slink), while the latter could cause players to feel lost on occasion. That said, the in-game map is detailed and useful.

  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  is among the most high-profile PS5 games available on PS Plus Extra. As a console exclusive, this reveal seemed destined to transpire sooner or later, although almost two years from the game's debut had to pass for this moment to arrive.
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  might very well still be the most beautiful PS5 title on the market, a testament to Insomniac's mastery of technology and talent for creating vibrant and stunning worlds that would not look out of place in a Pixar movie.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  backs up its good looks with fantastic gameplay and an enjoyable story that allows its lovable characters to shine. Although Ratchet and his robotic companion take center stage, they are accompanied by a new playable Lombax in the form of Rivet, who also comes with her own partner. In combat, the characters largely control the same; however, the game does a great job of establishing Rivet's own identity through her personality.

  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank
  </em>
  lives and dies on the strength of its gameplay, and
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  is right up there with the franchise's best efforts. Ratchet and Rivet have access to a wide assortment of fun weapons, all of which serve a purpose within the campaign.

  Housemarque is well represented by PS Plus Premium, with games like
  <em>
   Resogun
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  being included in the service. As great as those releases are, the studio's crowning achievement is
  <em>
   Returnal
  </em>
  , a sci-fi PS5 roguelike that delves into horror territory. The third-person shooter centers around Selene, a pilot who becomes stuck on a planet and within a time loop.

  The 2010s was the decade of indie games, so much so that it is near impossible to select the independent scene's crowning achievement for that period. That said,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is undoubtedly one of the top contenders. Inspired by the
  <em>
   Mother
  </em>
  series, Toby Fox's RPG follows a child as they explore the Underground, a seemingly typical monster-filled setting for the genre. Obviously, players can decide to adhere to RPG tradition and massacre everything that moves, but they do not have to do that.
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  does not force anyone to play a certain way, and players can follow a few different routes.

 <p>
  Blending meta-commentary with nuanced world-building and a strong narrative,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is the full package. Anyone remotely interested in RPGs or just gaming in general should give this seminal project a try, and the game's player-driven structure means multiple playthroughs are encouraged.

  Quite a few Vanillaware games are on PS Plus, and they are all worth playing.
  <em>
   13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim
  </em>
  is unlike anything else available on the streaming service, even if it does take ideas from a few different genres. Basically, this anime-inspired mecha title largely plays out like a visual novel, albeit with an integrated combat system to provide more interactivity than typical for this type of project. Narratively, the game revolves around teenagers who pilot robots to take on huge beasts, which is a description that makes the story sound more generic than it actually is.
  <em>
   13 Sentinels
  </em>
  does an impressive job of exploring its characters, shining a light on each of its 13 pilots. The campaign is long, well-written, and ambitious.

 <p>
  The turn-based strategy combat works well without being too demanding or complicated. Even though it prioritizes storytelling, the game's battle system is not an afterthought either, and a satisfying progression system helps keep things moving along well.
  <em>
   13 Sentinels
  </em>
  could be considered an acquired taste since it combines two niche genres in visual novels and strategy games. Still, all PS Plus subscribers should try the project since it provides such a singular experience.

  AA games have become fairly uncommon in recent years, but when they do show up, they tend to be quite special.
  <em>
   Kena: Bridge of Spirits
  </em>
  is gorgeous considering a relatively small team developed it, and pretty graphics are far from the only thing this game gets right. The story follows a spirit guide who must free souls in order to stop the spread of corruption, which is slowly corroding a peaceful and beautiful village. As far as premises are concerned,
  <em>
   Kena
  </em>
  is nothing too unusual; however, the game creates a world overflowing with personality, both in terms of environmental detail and NPCs.

 <p>
  Following a classic action-adventure formula,
  <em>
   Kena
  </em>
  incorporates exploration, combat, platforming, and puzzles. While not bringing anything substantially new to any of these elements, Ember Labs generally does an admirable job in each area. The gameplay does suffer from the occasional difficulty spike when it comes to the story's bosses, but the fights themselves are largely enjoyable.

  While no longer exclusive to PlayStation consoles,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  will always be associated with Sony's brand to an extent. In recent years, Capcom has tried to lower the barrier of entry for the franchise, crafting projects that are more accessible in their opening hours, all the while retaining most of the earlier entries' depth.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  is the most beginner-friendly project in the series, and it comes with a short "campaign" that should teach the basics in roughly 10 hours. Just to be clear to people not familiar with
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  , finishing
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  's village quests and rolling the credits only means they have completed the tutorial. Now, they can focus on working through the Gathering Hub missions as they collect resources to craft better equipment, allowing them to take on harder quests that will reward higher-tier resources. Repeat the cycle until the end of time (or until it becomes dull).

 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  has a fairly simple formula, but it is expected to perfection. Lasting less than an hour at most (and usually considerably shorter), quests drop players in open but not massive maps which will have a few major monsters, including that mission's specific target. Players will then have to track down the enemy and slowly whack away at their health, all the while utilizing the tools at their disposal. Eventually, the fun comes in the preparation for each hunt, crafting a loadout designed to fully target a monster's weaknesses while elevating the hunter's strengths.
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  has a robust selection of weapon types as well, and they all control differently.

  PS Plus Extra has all four modern
  <em>
   Wolfenstein
  </em>
  games, and the best one is arguably
  <em>
   The New Colossus
  </em>
  ​​​​​​. Building nicely on
  <em>
   The New Order
  </em>
  's strong foundations, the sequel is bigger and generally better. Featuring an all-time great villain and an appreciation for scale and spectacle,
  <em>
   The New Colossus
  </em>
  is an action-packed blockbuster that looks, controls, and sounds great.

  PS Plus does not have an overabundance of brilliant first-person shooters, but MachineGames' mainline
  <em>
   Wolfenstein
  </em>
  trilogy is now available in its entirety to Extra and Premium subscribers. When taken as a whole, these games are arguably the genre's best representatives on the service. William "B.J." Blazkowicz's journey is one filled with visceral action, gore, stealth kills, satisfying weapons, and glorious set pieces that put many Hollywood productions to shame. For the most part, these games tell entertaining stories that usually have just the right amount of cheese without coming across as try-hard.

  Roguelikes have grown exponentially in popularity over the last few years, and
  <em>
   Rogue Legacy
  </em>
  played a role in amplifying the genre's exposure. The sequel builds nicely on its predecessor's ideas, offering a more fine-tuned experience while not deviating too far from the beaten path.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rogue Legacy 2
  </em>
  follows a knight as they try to power through an array of dungeons in pursuit of treasure. Naturally, they will eventually die, forcing players to start from scratch. The twist is that, rather than playing with the same character, players jump to the next generation, a process that is repeated whenever death comes knocking.
  <em>
   Rogue Legacy 2
  </em>
  also slips into roguelite territory by incorporating permeant upgrades and abilities, so a new run is not a completely fresh start. While perhaps not the absolute biggest addition, this addictive roguelike was among the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus games
  </strong>
  of 2023.

  Before March 2023, PS Plus Extra subscribers could already play the PS4's
  <em>
   Uncharted 4: A Thief's End
  </em>
  and its spin-off,
  <em>
   The Lost Legacy
  </em>
  ; however, the
  <em>
   Legacy of Thieves Collection
  </em>
  presents PS5 owners with the ultimate versions of Naughty Dog's beloved action-adventure games. Now, to be clear, this package does not remaster the titles in many significant ways, at least when it comes to the graphics.

 <p>
  The main reason PS5 owners should play these iterations is due to their performance options, as they allow the games to run at a higher frame rate. Ultimately, if someone has already played through the entirety of
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  , they might not find much of a reason to return for the
  <em>
   Legacy of Thieves Collection
  </em>
  .

  The High Tech Barrelsmith build combines the powerful gadgets of the Engineer with the tremendous weapon damage and fire rate boosts of the Gunslinger, transforming a full barrage of your Vulcan Machine Gun Turret into a spray of lethal bullets that can chip down the health of any boss in a matter of seconds. Its primary perk is High Tech, which allows you to overload every Engineer skill, granting it infinite ammo, fire rate, and damage for a limited duration.

 <p>
  If you combine this with the Bulletstorm ability from the Gunslinger, you get a tremendously powerful burst of bullets capable of destroying anything and anyone. To optimize this build, pick Amulets and Rings that provide Weakspot Damage, Fire Rate, And Weapon Damage.

 <p>
  The Die Hard Conservator build can be acquired by combining the Challenger's resilience and the Alchemist archetype's area buffs. This build will make you functionally immortal — if you play it right, that is. Its main skills are Juggernaut and Vial: Elixir of Life. Juggernaut grants great melee damage and turns you into an unstoppable bruiser, while Vial: Elixir of Life creates a circle of healing where you are literally unable to take lethal damage. If you happen to run out of this buff, don't worry, as the Die Hard primary perk will activate, granting you immunity to lethal damage.

 <p>
  You can complete this build with any fast weapon, like Claws or Knuckes — the Vice Grips are especially good with the build. Also, the Lucky Cat ring can grant you an extra chance to avoid lethal damage (That's 3 instances of immortality in total). Rally Band and Thalos Eyelet will help you deal with the chunks of gray health and consistently recover your HP as you fight, and the Brawler's Pride ring is invaluable in boosting your melee speed. The Life Siphoner trait also helps a lot for this build.

 <p>
  The Ruthless Beastmaster build can be accomplished by merging the Summoner and Handler archetypes. Its main perk is Ruthless, which allows you to boost the damage your minions do by friendly firing them. Using the Reaver skill from the Summoner, and the Support Dog from the Handler, you can consistently make your Summons more powerful while the Dog will make sure it stays healthy, constantly healing them. Equip Soul Link to benefit from the damage your minions do and create a perfect synergy.

 <p>
  Use weapons like the Crescent Moon or Corrupted Rune Pistol, which can debuff enemies and mark them for more damage. This build is tremendously fun to play, especially against bosses, which will be too busy being harassed by the Reaver and the Dog to care about your debuffs. Rally Band and Thalos Eyelet will help you deal with the chunks of gray health, consistently recovering your HP as you fight.

 <p>
  So, you want to be a ninja? Then the Shadow Professional build is for you: combine Invader and Gunslinger to create the perfect boogeyman. With the Invader's Worm Hole, you can warp around and distance yourself from the enemies, while you consistently take them down with long-range weapons. Then, the Sidewinder skill from the Gunslinger can help you instantly reload while switching weapons, granting you increased mobility.
 </p>

 <p>
  Shoot, move away, and then shoot again. Tactical repositioning is definitely the main forte of this build, but beware: it's easy to get cornered and lose sight of your escape route. To prevent this, equip accessories that grant extra mobility — and the Mark of the Destroyer to take advantage of the extra perfect dodge boost that the Invader main perk grants. This way, each time you dodge, you create an AoE (like a ninja smoke bomb) that deals considerable damage to your enemies.

 <p>
  The ultimate build for those who love to blast their enemies with powerful abilities. The Tempest Luminary is a combination of the Archon archetype with the Engineer. Both are heavily focused on cooldown reduction and skill power, but the Archon class is especially good with its mod power generation traits and its main perk called Tempest, which constantly generates Mod energy. For your main ability, you should pick Havoc Form, which turns you into a rampaging lightning beast, able to cast lightning bolts and teleport short distances.

 <p>
  To pair with that, you'll want to pick the Vulcan Turret to cover your back while you rampage through the waves of enemies. For consistent damage, pick Nebula or Monarch as your main weapon. You can choose any secondary as long as you equip the Firestorm mod, which pairs beautifully with this build. The Spirit Wisp Amulet will be a consistent source of mod energy recirculation; to boost your abilities and mod skills, pick the following rings: Black Pawn Stamp, Stone of Malevolence, Sapphire Dreamstone, and Burden of the Rebel.

      Nintendo games feature many canonically dead characters, adding depth to usually lighthearted stories.

      Dark themes like death are present in Nintendo games like The Legend of Zelda, adding emotional depth.

      Characters like Mikau and the Four Champions have tragic backstories of sacrifice and heroism.

  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  is often seen as a child-friendly company that makes lighthearted games that very rarely feature dark themes, like death. But this would be quite an erroneous assessment since there are numerous characters in their games that not only have canonically died but have remained dead to this day.

 <p>
  These are some of the most memorable and likable characters from Nintendo games that are canonically dead, originating from franchises like
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  and more. It’s important to clarify that this list will exclusively contain examples from first-party Nintendo games and not anything that was developed by one of their many second-party developers.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask
   </em>
  </strong>
  is undoubtedly one of the darkest Nintendo games ever made so, as a result, its storyline features a lot of death and even the end of the world itself. However, the most prominent deceased characters in the entire game are those whose souls were trapped in the masks that Link can wear to transform himself.
  <strong>
   Mikau
  </strong>
  is one of them, and his backstory is surprisingly tragic.

 <p>
  He was a successful Zora musician who was part of a band alongside his partner, Lulu. But when their eggs were stolen by pirates, Mikau tried to retrieve them by infiltrating their fortress. Sadly, he didn’t succeed, and he eventually died because of the wounds caused by the pirates. Fortunately, Link found him just before he passed away and played the Song of Healing, so his soul would be transferred to the Zora Mask.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a game with a surprisingly rich lore, since it seems that a lot of crucial events happened before Link even began his new journey.
  <em>
  </em>
  The truth is that the war against Calamity Ganon had been raging on for hundreds of years, and many warriors tragically perished while trying to hold back this evil being.

However, despite their demise, their spirits lived on inside each Divine Beast, and they managed to help Link one last time before moving into the afterlife.

  Similarly to its predecessor,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  features a prominent backstory that is set many years in the past. In it, Princess Zelda travels through time and meets
  <strong>
   King Rauru
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Queen Sonia
  </strong>
  , her ancestors and the founders of Hyrule.

 <p>
  But sadly, Zelda found out the tragic truth: both of them passed away in their conflict against Ganondorf. Sonia was brutally murdered by the villain, who was trying to steal her Secret Stone, while Rauru sacrificed himself so he could seal the Demon King’s power for as much time as possible. His arm was the only part of his body left, and it attached itself to Link, so the hero could use it in the fight against the recently liberated Ganondorf in the present.

  Surprisingly enough, it seems that the Ghost enemies from
  <em>
   Luigi’s Mansion
  </em>
  are not technically spirits of the dead, but sentient paintings that were created by Vincent Van Gore. But this artist is a
  <strong>
   Portrait Ghost
  </strong>
  , a group of bosses that Luigi encounters throughout his adventure, and they actually are the spirits of deceased people.

 <p>
  The Portrait Ghosts are the heart and soul of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Luigi’s Mansion
   </em>
  </strong>
  because they all have varying designs and personalities that make them a joy to interact with. From Neville’s obsession with the books he couldn’t read while he was alive, to the athletic Biff Atlas, these ghosts are truly fascinating characters. Not to mention that several portraits can be found in the mansion that has images of their original selves back when they lived, practically confirming that these are their ghosts.

  Longtime Nintendo fans usually recall Rosalina’s Storybook from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario Galaxy
   </em>
  </strong>
  as one of the most shockingly tragic and emotional moments ever put in a
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game.
  <strong>
   Princess Rosalina’s
  </strong>
  backstory is both endearing and sad, and a major highlight of this otherwise cheerful game.

 <p>
  At one point in the story, Rosalina mentions her mother, who tragically passed away of unknown causes. However, right before dying, she tells her daughter that she will always be watching over her in the form of a star, which perfectly ties in with Rosalina’s astral theme. Coming to terms with her mother’s death is a huge part of her backstory and, with the help of her Luma friends, she not only managed to do that, but she also became a loving mother figure herself.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Metroid
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a masterpiece in minimal storytelling since the entire plot of this game is centered on Samus Aran’s retrieval of the
  <strong>
   Baby
  </strong>
  , the infant Metroid that she accidentally adopted back in
  <em>
   Metroid 2: Samus Returns
  </em>
  and who was tragically kidnapped by Space Pirates. Near the end of the game, Samus finds out that the baby has grown significantly after absorbing energy from various lifeforms, and it eventually gets involved in the battle against Mother Brain in a heroic manner.

  Just when it seemed like everything was lost, the Baby inadvertently appears, heals Samus, and attacks Mother Brain. Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough to defeat the evil matriarch, but the baby had departed after giving its adoptive mother a brand-new weapon: the Hyper Beam, which she effectively used to put down Mother Brain once and for all.

  There is no doubt that
  <strong>
   Ridley
  </strong>
  , one of the leaders of the Space Pirates, is Samus Aran’s most dangerous enemy. He not only killed her parents, but he also kept appearing during the bounty hunter’s many missions to attack her, as was seen in games like
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Zero Mission
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Samus Returns
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  However, this deadly rivalry is finally put to an end when Ridley tries to kidnap Samus’ adoptive baby during the events of
  <em>
   Super Metroid
  </em>
  , where she manages to kill him after an intense battle. But the protagonist couldn’t put her mind at ease, because it seems Ridley’s DNA was so valuable that he was cloned not once but twice. Fortunately, Samus managed to defeat and kill all of these clones, putting an end to the reign of this ruthless Space Pirate.

   Andross

  is the iconic main antagonist of the
  <strong>
   <em>

   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise: an evil scientist-turned-tyrant who not only declared war on the entire Lylat System but also seems to be responsible for the disappearance (or death) of James McCloud, Fox McCloud’s father. He’s a ruthless, albeit fascinating villain and a great foil for Fox himself.

  Both
  <em>
   Star Fox
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Star Fox 64
  </em>
  are centered on the intense war against Andross and his destructive forces, and the evil scientist even experimented on himself to turn into a giant mechanical head with cyborg hands. At the end of the day, Fox managed to kill Andross and even escaped Venom with the help of his father’s spirit. In
  <em>
   Star Fox Adventures,
  </em>
  it was revealed that Andross' soul managed to transfer itself into a new body, but he was killed for good by Fox and his team. He hasn’t been seen ever since, except for a few
  <em>
   Star Fox
  </em>
  remakes and reboots.

  FromSoftware's acclaimed
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  series is well-known for its wealth of possible character builds, and a mainstay of the series has always been the spell-slinging wizard. Based on the Intelligence stat, these wielders of devastating ethereal power have often been powerful to the point of broken - one need only look at the Dark Bead spell from the original
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  or the infamous "pushed" Talisman of Beasts setup in
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  to confirm this.

  that can drain a boss' health bar in seconds with the right combination of stats, gear, and prep. Well, adherents of the glintstone arts and seekers of the Primeval Current continue to eat well in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree

  DLC, which features a lot of interesting new spells to study. That said, some of the
  <strong>
   new Sorceries in

  are arguably better than others.

   Miriam's Vanishing

  is sure to pique any conjurer's interest. Part of the Carian school of sorceries, casting this on oneself causes the Tarnished to disappear briefly in a haze of glintstone and materialize a short distance away, determined by the direction they're facing. It's a useful trick for certain situations that any mage can keep in their back pocket.

  The fight against the Twin Moon Knight to obtain this spell is worth the effort alone. Rellana, sister to the Carian Queen of the Full Moon Rennala from the base game, poses a daunting challenge for even the hardiest of Tarnished. Upon her defeat, players can trade her Remembrance for

 <p>
  It's the superior version of her sibling's similar spell, but it also requires a staggering 72 Intelligence and two free memory slots to cast. That means only dedicated mage builds stand a chance of wielding it. The other downside is that players will miss out on Rellana's Twin Blades unless they duplicate her Remembrance at a Wandering Mausoleum.

  It's a handy way for magic-based builds to deal with crowds and stop themselves getting overwhelmed. The Tarnished needs 28 Intelligence to cast this spell, and it can be charged to increase its damage and radius. To get it, players will need to defeat Commander Gaius to obtain the

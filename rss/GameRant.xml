  At the start of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Now
   </strong>
  </em>
  Season 4, hunters now have access to the Switch Axe, the last of the heavier melee weapons to be introduced. For beginners, it could be a difficult one to get used to as it mixes shorter slashes of a sword with big swings of a giant axe, infused with powerful phials of elemental power. In the right hands, though, it's a lethal weapon.

  You'd be forgiven for thinking that the best
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Now
  </em>
  Charge Blade build would be similar to this new weapon. While you
  <em>
   can
  </em>
  build your hunter to take advantage of the same Partbreaking strategy, there's actually a more effective element that you can exploit that will be more useful in when hunting with others. Below are all the suggestions for the best
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Now
  </em>
  Switch Axe build, including skills and Driftstone Ores you should equip.

 <p>
  For the best
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Now
  </em>
  Switch Axe build, the good news is that it's a far less premium-rated build. That means no hunting for Elder Dragons or limited-time event monsters in order to get the required
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Now
  </em>
  material parts. The slight downside is that, unless you were farming materials from Rajang or Odogaron last season, you're probably going to run into issues when trying to upgrade them right now.

 <p>
  This is because these two monsters have temporarily disappeared from the field at the beginning of the Season 4. However, there is a slim chance that Odogaron and Rajang will appear as part of the Season 4 story. If they do appear in any main quest, they will appear in the wild from that point onward.

  Your main hunting target for this season is Volvidon, one of the new monsters that appears during Season 4. The
  <strong>
   Binding Roller
  </strong>
  is a potent Paralysis-based weapon that you can easily upgrade with the help of the Volvidon Mail and Great Girros Greaves, which are fairly common creatures and easy to hunt.

  While Rajang can be quite a tough monster to beat, thankfully we're only hunting it for one piece of equipment: the Rajang Coil. This grants up to three levels in
  <strong>
   Focus
  </strong>
  , which shortens the charging time of charge attacks by 15%, as well as the Switch Axe's fill rate for the gauge by 15%. This helps you use your Power Element Phials quicker, which can be essential during a tough hunt.

  While Odogaron is the easier to hunt of the two beasts and is weak to the same Paralysis-based attacks this build focuses on, you will need to track down a lot of them to harvest enough
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Now
  </em>
  monster materials to upgrade both the Odogaron Helmet and Odogaron Vambraces. However, there's a good reason for this, and no, it's not for the two points in Bleeding Resistance. Across both Odogaron equipment, you'll get three points in Quick Work, which maximizes the speed at which the Switch Axe sheathes or transforms, making it far more efficient.

  The Switch Axe build doesn't have a lot of slots that we can use, so the number of recommended Driftores will be limited to the total available. The main objective is to maximize the Paralysis Attack skill, but this only handles one of the four available slots. You can also try to increase Evade Extender up to Rank 4, or you can introduce other perks such as Divine Blessing for some protection against hits from monsters or Attack Boost for a flat boost to your attack.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Fantasian Neo Dimension
   </strong>
  </em>
  begins with an engaging story centered around characters like
  <strong>
   Leo
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Kina
  </strong>
  , drawing players into its beautifully crafted world.
  <strong>
   Warping
  </strong>
  , a fast travel mechanic, lets players instantly move between visited areas. This feature becomes essential as many side and main quests require revisiting distant regions, making walking impractical. However, Warping is locked during the early hours of the game, forcing players to explore manually.

  After progressing a few hours into
  <em>

  </em>
  , you will arrive at Midi Toy Box in Vence, where you work to recover more of Leo's memories and attempt to acquire the Warp Device. During this sequence, after interacting with various items and triggering a brief cutscene, a secret passageway opens, leading you into the Basement. This area is filled with mechanical turrets that initiate enemy encounters and locked pathways with panels adjacent to them. Navigate through the maze-like environment, overcoming its challenges, until you face the Salamander boss at the end.

  The boss is highly resistant to damage from the front but has a vulnerable tail that can be targeted to prevent it from healing. As the battle progresses, the boss will occasionally stand upright, exposing its stomach. This moment provides an excellent opportunity to deal significant damage and quickly finish this JRPG boss fight.

  Once the boss is dealt with, proceed to the Secret Room, where you'll find several chests—some of which are locked—and a plethora of documents and papers to interact with. This exploration comes to a pause when the Cinderella Tri-Stars appear. After this battle, you can open the remaining chests, one of which contains the Warp Device. Initially, the device appears broken, but further interactions with items in the room will lead you to a chest at the back, where you’ll learn how to activate the Warp Device and conclude this segment.

      FPS games like Doom Eternal excel in combining shooting, movement, and parkour to create an exhilarating experience.
     </li>

      Severed Steel and Ghostrunner offer fast-paced combat and smooth movement, making them stand out in the FPS genre.

 <p>
  Movement is a central part of gaming and constitutes most of the experience that players will have when playing a game. Having good movement is extremely important for leaving a good impression on players, and having parkour is even better, as it adds purpose and excitement to an otherwise monotonous mechanic (i.e., getting from one point to the other).

 <p>
  FPS games take particular advantage of movement mechanics and parkour, with the first-person perspective adding a layer of reliability and reality to the experience that other genres can't quite capture in the same way. Finding
  <strong>
   great FPS games with parkour mechanics
  </strong>
  can be difficult, but there are plenty of titles for those willing to search for them.

  When it comes to fast-paced action FPS games, there aren't any titles that are quite as iconic as the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Doom
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise. From the classic game released in 1993 to the more recent iterations of the title in the form of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Doom (2016)
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Doom Eternal
   </strong>
  </em>
  (2020), there's plenty of demon slaying within the franchise to keep fans busy for quite a while.

 <p>
  <em>
   Doom Eternal
  </em>
  , in particular, is a playground for parkour fans, featuring plenty of interesting movement options for players. Dashes, grappling hooks and wall climbing create a dynamic movement environment that i enjoyable for the masses and enthusiasts alike. The game focuses on three things: shooting, movement, and satisfying kills, and it executes all three to perfection.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Severed Steel
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an inspired title that learns from the best of the best in the genre of platformer FPS games. The combination of fast-paced combat and buttery smooth movement is hard to find in other places, leaving players wanting more as soon as the story mode is finished.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The game encourages the player to master its movement mechanics and perform stunts, and it implements a nice slow-motion mechanic that paves the path for truly masterful combos and complex actions. The stylized look of the game is visually stunning, and the shooting feels extremely satisfying.

  Less shooter and more first person parkour simulator,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mirror's Edge
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the kind of game that defines a genre. Developed by the studio behind the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Battlefield
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise,
  <em>
   Mirror's Edge
  </em>
  directs all the player's focus on one single mechanic: movement.

 <p>
  There is some shooting found within the game, but players are effectively encouraged to ignore it and go for a melee approach instead. The game is very punishing when it comes to parkour, requiring precision and fine-control from the player. However, when the player gets the hang of a level's design, everything starts to come together to create an unforgettable experience.

  <em>
   <strong>

  has all the charm of its predecessor, providing the added bonus of even more content and better graphics that make it hold up much better to modern tastes.

 <p>
  The game doesn't put a lot of emphasis on movement, but sneaking around a hostile Victorian town with special movement abilities leads to a certain amount of parkour nonetheless. The blink ability in particular is essential in the game, and it serves to make the movement much more interesting than it otherwise would be.

  The game is all about precise strikes, planned movement, and epic attack sequences that leave the player breathless from the adrenaline rush. It has a fairly decent story, a simple level-based design, and beautifully stylized graphics that have a distinct cyberpunk aesthetic. For fans of fun traversal, it's also a must-play.

  Widely regarded as the game with the best movement within the FPS genre,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Titanfall 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  lives up to its reputation admirably. Out of any FPS game focused on parkour and movement, it manages to combine the shooting aspect with traversal the best.

  There isn't always a need to combine two genres perfectly, but for the people looking for excellent gun action alongside masterful movement,
  <em>
   Titanfall 2
  </em>
  is the one and only stop. The fact that it even has a multiplayer mode where the game pits players against each other makes it that much more attractive for competitive players.

  The game is, in essence, a puzzle platformer. It encourages the player to find their flow state and go through levels as fast as possible while utilizing as little of the resources at their disposal as they can, essentially introducing a casual audience to the world of speedrunning. The art style is charming, the gameplay is revolutionary, and the story is simple but effective.

  Among many of the unexpected announcements at The Game Awards 2024, HBO and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment revealed a trailer for an upcoming
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  RPG video game titled
  <strong>
   <em>
    Game of Thrones: Kingsroad
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Author George R. R. Martin's writing skills have previously been translated into the realm of gaming with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , and fans of the
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  franchise can get a first look at a brand-new experience inspired by one of the most beloved fantasy stories of all time.

 <p>
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  skyrocketed to the forefront of the cultural zeitgeist with the release of the HBO television drama series in 2011. The show achieved a number of major awards and accolades and established a massive following across the globe, but a lackluster finale season damaged the otherwise illustrious reputation of
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  . Following the recent success of the prequel series
  <em>
   House of the Dragon
  </em>
  and the rise in popularity of high fantasy video games, HBO is teaming with Warner Bros. to bring back the iconic show in a new way.

  Production studio HBO and the Warner Bros. gaming division have unveiled an official trailer for the upcoming action-adventure RPG
  <em>
   Game of Thrones: Kingsroad
  </em>
  , which will feature a star-studded lineup of cast members from the
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  television series. Fans of the HBO drama were shocked to see the familiar face of Jon Snow actor Kit Harington, along with Jaime and Cersei Lannister actors Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Lena Headey, the latter of whom can be spotted sitting upon the notorious Iron Throne. HBO and Warner Bros. have described the title as an action-adventure RPG that will allow fans to "explore the vast lands of Westeros" while experiencing an open world and an original story.

  The official trailer for

  begins with a Northern warrior in a snowy forest fighting off armored enemies before riding across a wintry landscape as the iconic

  </em>
  theme song plays. He stands aside Harington's Jon Snow, as the latter explains key story elements, such as Nightwalkers and the Seven Kingdoms, before fans are treated to in-game shots of recognizable locations from the
  <em>
   Game of Thrones
  </em>
  television show. The game's official website notes that there will be various playable classes, similar to other action-adventure role-playing video games, with more details to be revealed closer to the title's release date.
  <em>
   Game of Thrones: Kingsroad
  </em>
  launches for Android and iOS in 2025.

  Ever since
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  launched in 2020, Naughty Dog fans have wondered what the award-winning PlayStation studio has in store for the future. Rumors of a new sci-fi IP from Naughty Dog have been swirling for years, as have rumors surrounding
  <em>
   The Last of Us 3
  </em>
  . The cancelation of
  <em>
   The Last of Us Online
  </em>
  live-service project in late 2023 cast some doubt over Naughty Dog's release pipeline, but after a long spell of radio silence, the studio has finally announced its highly-anticipated next game as the show-closer for The Game Awards 2024.

  <strong>
   <em>

  , currently in development exclusively for PS5. The four-and-a-half minute announcement trailer for
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  is rendered entirely in Naughty Dog's proprietary game engine and reveals a stunning cosmic setting, complete with a huge red star, glowing blue horizon lines, and a shattered moon. The rest of the trailer focuses on a new protagonist named Jordan, who will be played by actress Tati Gabrielle. Interestingly, a recent rumor alleged that Naughty Dog's next project is codenamed
  <em>
   Jordan
  </em>
  , which has now been validated.

  Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Story Details
 </h3>
 <p>
  According to Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann,
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  is set on a mysterious distant planet dubbed Sempiria that has had no communication with the wider universe for hundreds of years. Apparently, every explorer who ventures to Sempiria to decipher its "mysterious past" is never heard from again. "Dangerous bounty hunter" Jordan A. Mun ends up stranded on Sempiria and will have to utilize all her "skills and wits" to be the first person to escape the planet in over 600 years. Much like Naughty Dog's previous games,
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  touts an "emotional, character-driven epic journey."

 <p>
  Rather excitingly,
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  is also said to feature Naughty Dog's deepest and most innovative gameplay to date. Further details about
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  , such as its release window, have yet to be revealed. This might be announced in 2025, but for now, Naughty Dog fans are rejoiced to finally learn about
  <em>
   Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
  </em>
  .

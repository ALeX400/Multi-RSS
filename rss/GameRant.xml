    <ul>
     <li>
      Job adjustments in Final Fantasy 14 Patch 7.1 aim to close the gap within roles for both PVE and PVP content.
     </li>
     <li>
      Significant changes were made to Jobs like Dark Knight, Gunbreaker, Ninja, White Mage, and Black Mage to enhance their abilities.
     </li>
     <li>
      Overall, the diverse Crossroads content update introduces quality-of-life changes and opportunities for players to explore different Jobs.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </strong>
  </em>
  underwent server maintenance, Square Enix released the full patch notes for its 7.1 content update and confirmed that several Jobs were adjusted to close the gap within their respective roles. The sweeping Job changes for
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  were not exclusive to PVE content, as several PVP adjustments were also made in Patch 7.1.

 <p>
  Days before the Crossroads update went live,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  gave players a preliminary look at what to expect when servers come back online on November 12. Alongside continued main story quests, Patch 7.1 saw several quality-of-life changes. Between the addition of two dye channels for older glamours like
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  's Manderville relic weapons, and changes to the Group Pose feature to make it easier for players to take vertical shots, the Crossroads content update is shaping up to be a diverse patch for
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  overall.

 <p>
  Once
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  players start Patch 7.1 on November 12, some may notice that other Jobs will feel a little more powerful than before. According to the complete patch notes posted by Square Enix, the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  Jobs that saw the most changes were Dark Knight, Gunbreaker, Ninja, White Mage, and Black Mage. The Dark Knight's self-sustaining woes were addressed, as its Carve and Spit and Abyssal Drain abilities were changed to grant more healing. Rather than reducing its health to one point, Gunbreaker's Superbolide ability now reduces its health to 50% while still granting invulnerability for 10 seconds. The Ninja's Dokumori was given area-of-effect damage, and its Ten Chi Jin ability can now be used while moving, as it previously required standing still to be utilized. The White Mage's Holy spell had its cast time reduced by a second, and the Black Mage was given both a second charge of Ley Lines and changed its Despair spell to be instant cast when under Astral Fire.

 <p>
  Other Jobs, including Machinist, Summoner, and Red Mage, saw their overall damage buffed as a way to close the gap with other DPS Jobs such as Pictomancer. Alongside the PVE Job updates,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's PVP modes saw significant changes across the board. All Jobs in PVP had their health increased, while Dragoon and Dark Knight were nerfed in Frontline mode. Gunbreaker, Summoner, and Black Mage received overhauled PVP actions, and the mechanical minions of Rival Wings had their health pools increased.

  Between the balance changes and other additions arriving in Patch 7.1,

  players seeking to try a different Job will have an ideal opportunity. Only time will tell how players will respond to the changes.

  Final Fantasy 14 Patch 7.1 Job Changes (November 12, 2024)
 </h2>
 <h3 id="pve-job-adjustments">
  PVE Job Adjustments
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   In Patch 7.1, we've made several adjustments to the potencies of actions to address issues with the overall balance of DPS within each role.
  </li>
  <li>
   To further improve the ease of gameplay, we've also made more detailed adjustments, such as changing the required level of certain actions, increasing their area of effect, and fine-tuning their hit detection.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":354} -->
 <h3 id="tank">
  Tank
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Abilities that prevent incapacitation, such as Hallowed Ground and Living Dead, have been adjusted across all tank jobs, allowing their status effects to be applied more quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
   We believe this will ensure players can more readily make use of these abilities when taking heavy damage from enemies.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <h3 id="paladin">
  Paladin
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The required level to learn Intervene has been lowered to better align it with the movement abilities of other tank jobs.
  </li>
  <li>
   We've also increased the effective range of Cover to improve ease of use.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":855} -->

 <h3 id="dark-knight">
  Dark Knight
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The required level to learn Dark Missionary has been lowered to better align it with the defensive party abilities of other tank jobs.
  </li>
  <li>
   To improve survivability when taking damage from large groups of enemies, the cure potency of Abyssal Drain has been increased.
  </li>
  <li>
   Moreover, the additional effect "Restores own HP" has been added to its single-target counterpart, Carve and Spit.
  </li>
  <li>
   Lastly, to address disparities in physical defense among tank jobs, the abilities Dark Mind and Dark Missionary will now also reduce physical damage taken.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <h3 id="gunbreaker">
  Gunbreaker
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The cartridge cost of Double Down has been reduced to improve ease of use.
  </li>
  <li>
   Because this cost reduction allows for greater use of Burst Strike and Hypervelocity, we've chosen to reduce the potency of the latter.
  </li>
  <li>
   That said, gunbreaker will still see an overall increase in their DPS.
  </li>
  <li>
   To improve gunbreaker's survivability, we've increased the cure potency of Aurora.
  </li>
  <li>
   Moreover, to address disparities in physical defense among tank jobs, Heart of Light will now also reduce physical damage taken.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":994} -->

 <h3 id="dragoon">
  Dragoon
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   To help prevent DPS loss when it's necessary to keep distance from an enemy, we've increased the potency of Piercing Talon.
  </li>
  <li>
   An additional effect further increasing its potency has also been added to Elusive Jump.
  </li>
  <li>
   To reduce the number of actions executed during damage burst phases, players will no longer gain multiple stacks of Nastrond Ready.
  </li>
  <li>
   Because this change greatly affects dragoon DPS, we've made further adjustments to other actions to maintain balance among melee DPS jobs.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <h3 id="ninja">
  Ninja
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The effect of Ten Chi Jin will no longer end upon moving, which we believe will improve its ease of use.
  </li>
  <li>
   Similarly, Dokumori has been changed to an area of effect attack.
  </li>
  <li>
   To help prevent DPS loss when it's necessary to keep distance from an enemy, we've increased the potency of Throwing Dagger.
  </li>
  <li>
   Please note, however, that this change is meant only to supplement the use of ninjutsu, which allows ninjas to deal high damage at range.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":928} -->

 <h3 id="black-mage">
  Black Mage
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   To help improve black mage's mobility in combat, we've reduced the cast time of Flare and Despair.
  </li>
  <li>
   We've also made Ley Lines a charged action, making it easier to use outside of burst damage phases.
  </li>
  <li>
   While the effect potency of Enochian has been slightly reduced, the above changes should result in an overall increase in black mage's DPS.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <h3 id="summoner">
  Summoner
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The combo requirement for Crimson Strike has been removed, and it will now require the status effect "Crimson Strike Ready" to execute.
  </li>
  <li>
   Previously, the actions Inferno, Earthen Fury, and Aerial Blast were incorrectly set to 750 potency, despite their descriptions stating a potency of 800.
  </li>
  <li>
   This issue has been resolved, and their values now match their descriptions.

 <h3 id="scholar">

 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The MP cost of area-of-effect healing actions has been reduced to help improve MP management.
  </li>
  <li>
   Previously, the actions Embrace and Seraphic Veil were incorrectly set to a cure potency of 150, despite their descriptions stating a potency of 180.
  </li>
  <li>
   After careful consideration, we've determined that a potency of 180 would not disrupt game balance and have therefore increased their cure potency to match their descriptions.

 <ul>
  <li>
   To ensure all targets can be reached when battling groups of enemies, the area of effect for Gravity and Gravity II has been increased.

 <h3 id="pvp-job-adjustments">
  PVP Job Adjustments
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Much like with PVE actions at the release of
   <em>
    Dawntrail
   </em>
   , we have introduced several new PvP actions, and made adjustments to pre-existing ones to better highlight the unique aspects of each job.
  </li>
  <li>
   We've also made changes to certain Jobs' mechanics to provide players with a more enjoyable gaming experience.
  </li>
  <li>
   Because the additions and adjustments made in this patch were so extensive, we have elected to forgo overviews of individual jobs.
  </li>
  <li>
   To help players better contend with enemy burst damage, all jobs will see an increase to their maximum HP, and the recast time of Purify has been reduced.
  </li>
  <li>
   Moreover, we've increased the potency of basic weaponskills and spells considered to be less effective than most, to help place a greater emphasis on sustained damage.
  </li>
  <li>
   Patch 7.1 will also usher in improvements to hit detection, which we believe will significantly affect job balance.
  </li>
  <li>
   We will continue to monitor the situation and consider further adjustments as needed, so we encourage you all to join the fray and give us your feedback.
  </li>

  Successfully securing headshot kills in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  requires
  <strong>
   aiming at the enemy’s head as soon as you engage
  </strong>
  , ensuring that you eliminate them before they have a chance to retaliate. While this might sound straightforward, consistently landing headshots in Multiplayer takes practice, along with some helpful techniques to improve efficiency.

 <p>
  An effective way to increase headshot accuracy is by
  <strong>
   equipping an Optic that you find comfortable
  </strong>
  . While not everyone prefers a
  <strong>
   magnified Optic
  </strong>
  , these can be
  <strong>
   excellent for long-range shots
  </strong>
  , keeping you out of reach from enemy attacks.

 <p>
  Alternatively, you can opt for a classic red-dot sight to improve consistency with headshots. Keep in mind that
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  allows you to
  <strong>
   customize your reticle
  </strong>
  , so choose one that helps you easily locate and target enemies.

  <strong>
   Holding a clear line of sight
  </strong>
  and waiting for distant enemies is an effective strategy for landing headshots. You gain an advantage by
  <strong>
   positioning your crosshairs on the enemy’s head before they see you
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  This tactic works especially well when you’re

   behind a head glitch

  , making it even

  While it may not be as widely known or as popular as the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Jade Empire
   </em>
  </strong>
  stands out as one of BioWare's most special action RPGs, largely due to its distinctive setting and dynamic combat system. The game immerses players in a fictional kingdom inspired by Ancient Chinese history and mythology, populated with mythical creatures, spirits, and legendary kung-fu masters.

 <p>
  As with most BioWare games, characters, dialogue, and quests are central to the experience, showcasing the developer's strengths. However, it's the combat system that sets
  <em>
   Jade Empire
  </em>
  apart from other titles in the genre. Offering a mix of martial arts, weapons, transformation, and magic, the system requires players to constantly adapt to changing scenarios. The game incorporates a simple "rock-paper-scissors" approach to combat styles while also introducing the powerful harmonic combo system, adding depth and strategy to every encounter.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Messiah of Might and Magic
   </em>
  </strong>
  was one of the earliest games from the now-acclaimed Arkane Studios, building on and refining the strengths first showcased in their debut title,
  <em>
   Arx Fatalis
  </em>
  , while taking full advantage of the Source engine's physics. The game earned praise for its impressive graphics and fast-paced, visceral first-person combat, giving players the freedom to choose their path — whether as a warrior, thief, ranger, or mage — and unleash powerful skills and combos on the battlefield.

  Though the game's progression was fairly linear, leaning more toward action-adventure than traditional RPG structure,
  <em>
   Dark Messiah of Might and Magic
  </em>
  remains a standout, beloved entry in the
  <em>
   Might and Magic

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Gothic
   </em>
  </strong>
  series stands as a prime example of a compact yet deeply engaging RPG adventure. Set in a unique and grounded world, it offered remarkable flexibility in progression and quests. With meticulously crafted environments and well-developed characters, it quickly became a cult classic among RPG fans. The sequel, along with its expansion
  <em>
   Night of the Raven
  </em>
  , remains a highlight of Piranha Bytes' portfolio and is still regarded as one of the most beloved RPGs of its time.

  Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Gothic 3

  struggled to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. Overambitious in scope, it was hampered by technical issues at launch and was overshadowed by
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion
  </em>
  in almost every aspect. Despite these setbacks,
  <em>
   Gothic 3
  </em>
  is still remembered as a significant entry in the old-school open-world RPG genre. It remains popular to this day, especially when enhanced by expansive fan-made content and mods.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Deus Ex
   </em>
  </strong>
  is widely regarded as one of the most acclaimed and influential games ever made, consistently appearing on lists of the greatest and most important titles. The game blends FPS, RPG, action-adventure, and stealth action elements, offering players an unprecedented level of freedom. Its futuristic cyberpunk setting allows
  <em>
   Deus Ex
  </em>
  to explore a variety of timely and thought-provoking themes, many of which feel more relevant with each passing year.

  While undeniably groundbreaking and influential, the original

  was released over 24 years ago, and by modern standards, it doesn't quite hold up as well as some of its successors. This is why, despite its iconic status, it doesn't rank higher.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fable
   </em>
  </strong>
  (released as
  <em>
   Fable: The Lost Chapters
  </em>
  on PC) is a unique action RPG that stands out by doing things differently than what players typically expect from the genre. From progression and combat to quests and character interactions,
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  is both exciting and delightfully silly, packed with distinctive British humor. It combines decent action mechanics with quirky, everyday activities, like collecting and donating books to a school or boasting about the hero's trophies. It also offers players the freedom to shape their character's morality, allowing them to become a virtuous hero or a truly devilish villain.

 <p>
  The sequel,
  <em>
   Fable 2
  </em>
  , builds on many of the original's standout features, but unfortunately, it's not as accessible as the first game. It remains exclusive to the Xbox 360 and, unlike the original
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  , did not receive the Anniversary remaster, making it difficult for fans on other platforms to experience it today.

  The original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Witcher
   </em>
  </strong>
  may not have achieved the fame of its acclaimed sequels, but it has plenty of distinct qualities that set it apart from other RPGs of its time. As the first game developed by CD Projekt Red,
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  offered a gritty and convincing portrayal of Andrzej Sapkowski's dark fantasy world, skillfully capturing its brutal atmosphere, complex characters, and the appeal of being a monster-hunting mutant reviled by a world steeped in violence.

 <p>
  From its rhythm-based combat and dynamic day-night cycle to branching dialogue, morally complex quests, and a deep alchemy system,
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  is a dark, immersive action RPG that forges its own path in many respects. It's an experience that remains compelling even years later, thanks to its bold design and unique tone.

  , along with its

  expansion, ranks among the most iconic and enduring loot-based action RPGs. Over 20 years since its release, it remains widely played and beloved by fans.

  Upon release, the original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect
   </em>
  </strong>
  epitomized the idea of a "next-gen RPG," introducing players to a fresh, thrilling sci-fi universe with groundbreaking visuals and a cinematic narrative that was unlike anything seen in the genre. As the powerful start to a now-iconic trilogy widely regarded as one of the greatest in gaming,
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  captivated audiences with its immersive, meticulously crafted world, bold design choices, and the depth of even the smallest character interactions.

  From this point on,
  <em>
   Mass Effect

  set a new standard for dialogue and action in RPGs, moving beyond traditional "talking heads" conversations and combat sequences with little dynamics.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
   </em>
  </strong>
  , bows are one category of weaponry essential for developing a strong combat strategy. They are popular because they provide high accuracy, which is great for aiming at critical points of enemies, as well as being quiet and long-range, making them great for stealth missions and hunting.

 <p>
  The Carja Sharpshot offers the same pros as a lot of the
  <strong>
   best bows in
   <em>
    Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
   </em>
  </strong>
  : It deals good damage at a conveniently long-range, which is great for tactical scenarios. That said, this bow misses some of the ideal traits that other bows have access to. For example, it doesn't take any elemental ammunition, which limits the kind of damage that players can deal. It also has a rather slow rate of fire.

 <p>
  For an early game acquisition, the Carja Sharpshot is a safe bet, available at a very reasonable 210 Metal Shards from merchants.

  The Banuk Powershot Bow certainly has its perks, but its charging requirement is definitely not one of them. Aside from that, it offers high damage stats and high precision, despite not being a fast weapon. The Banuk Powershot can be used from far distances, making it great for challenges requiring stealth and silence.

  The Carja Hunter Bow offers players a good variety of basic and fire damage in a very accessible weapon, making it a great choice for beginners with little combat experience who are not able to buy better bows yet. Fans of the game have recommended this as a great tool to learn about the handling of bows before advancing onto rarer models.

  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn

  , making it ideal for long-range encounters with machines, particularly in order to strip specific components from them. The ability to strip machines is increased using Tearblast Arrows, creating weaknesses that players can exploit using other weapons.

  The Shadow Hunter Bow provides some of the most consistent damage out of all the weapons in
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  , particularly in mid-range combat. Players can also use it for stealth scenarios because of its quick firing and quietness. It's particularly useful when used alongside Fire Arrows to exploit the fire vulnerability of certain machines and enemies. Players can purchase this bow from merchants in Meridian for the cost of 800 Metal Shards and a Sawtooth Heart.

  The Lodge Blast Sling has better handling when compared with other Blast Slings available in the game. It can be obtained during the Weapons of the Lodge side quest. After obtaining 15 Half Sun Marks during the 5 Hunting Ground trials, Aidaba will reward players with it.

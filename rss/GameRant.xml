  <strong>
   <em>
    Street Fighter 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans were in for a treat during the opening day of Gamescom 2024, as Capcom finally showed a gameplay trailer for the game’s newest character: Terry Bogard. The fighter’s arrival to the game didn’t surprise most fans, as he and his fellow SNK character Mai were announced in June during the Summer Game Fest. However, the new Gamescom trailer has generated even more hype because it showcases the character’s moves, some of which seem to break
  <em>
   SF6
  </em>
  ’s conventions.

 <p>
  Terry is the poster boy of SNK’s most popular fighting game franchises,
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   King of Fighters
  </em>
  . He’s the first playable crossover character outside of Capcom to appear in a mainline
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  game. Capcom has lent their characters to other fighting games for years, so taking in a couple of guest characters into
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  was only a matter of time.

  The main draw of guest characters is that they add some more flavor to a fighting game by bringing their signature abilities into it. Like Akuma in
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  , who brought his 2D fighter shenanigans into the 3D space, Terry Bogard brings his iconic moves and some quirks from his SNK games to
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6

 <h3 id="terry-bogard-rsquo-s-special-moves-in-street-fighter-6">
  Terry Bogard’s Special Moves in Street Fighter 6
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Power Wave:
   </strong>
   This is Terry’s main projectile, and it can be activated by doing the usual quarter-circle forward motion plus a punch. It creates a ripple that travels on the ground. The light version travels the fastest, while the medium version is the most damaging. Throwing out a heavy Power Wave will create a round projectile that offers a frame advantage on block, which is great for advancing into enemies. The overdrive version hits multiple times, making it excellent for juggle combos.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Burn Knuckle:
   </strong>
   Terry’s burn knuckle is a powerful punch that launches him toward the enemy. Players can execute this using quarter circle back plus heavy punch. It’s a great way to get into the opponent’s face while also dealing big damage if it hits. Its light version does a one-two combo, while the medium variation can catch crouch blockers off guard with an overhead hit.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Crack Shoot:
   </strong>
   Terry also does his iconic front flip kick, Crack Shoot in the trailer. This move is quite versatile, as players can use it to get around fireballs or pick enemies out of the air.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Rising Tackle:
   </strong>
   This launches Terry into a vertical spinning kick, making it a great anti-air move. Players should have an easy time executing this, as it uses the “Dragon Punch” motion input, which is forward, down, down-forward.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Power Charge:
   </strong>
   This move simply causes Terry to hit enemies with his shoulder. While it lacks flair, it seems to be quite useful. Fighting game content creators like Rooflemonger and Brian_F pointed out that he can seemingly cancel his Power Charge into Power Wave. A special move canceling into another is par for the course in
   <em>
    King of Fighters
   </em>
   , but it’s an uncommon sight in
   <em>
    Street Fighter
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Passing Sway:
   </strong>
   This is a target combo that lets him jump into a second lane to dodge an attack and then hit the opponent with either a jumping knee or jumping lariat. It’s literally a game-changing mechanic borrowed from the
   <em>
    Fatal Fury
   </em>
   series.
  </li>
 </ul>

  Terry Bogard’s Super Moves in Street Fighter 6
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 1 - Buster Wolf:
   </strong>
   This shows Terry cocking and firing an energy blast from his arm. The trailer sees him use this as a combo ender after bouncing poor Luke from the ground with his overdrive Crack Shoot.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 2 - Power Geyser:
   </strong>
   His level 2 is like a souped-up version of his Power Wave. If this volcanic explosion hits the enemy, the player can spend three drive gauge bars to hit a follow-up geyser. If that’s not enough to K.O., they can launch a third one by consuming one super art gauge.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level 3 - Rising Fang:
   </strong>
   Finally, Terry's level three super is a showcase of his signature moves into one cool cinematic that ends with him torching his opponent with a powerful Buster Wolf blast.
  </li>

  A new report indicates that low player counts may land Ubisoft's
  <em>
   <strong>
    XDefiant
   </strong>
  </em>
  in serious trouble.
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  is currently in its first season, which added the GS Kommando faction from
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege,
  </em>
  the classic Capture the Flag game mode, and three new maps in Clubhouse, Daytona, and Rockefeller.

 <p>
  Having launched back in May, Ubisoft's free-to-play
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  competitor initially enjoyed record-breaking results, garnering over a million players within its first three hours live and eight million players in its first week. Mixing and matching different Ubisoft franchises, like
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Watch Dogs
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Ghost Recon,
  </em>
  and others certainly drew a lot of attention to the game, which impressed many with its polished gunplay and engaging map design. Though, it seems
  <em>
   XDefiant'

  According to a new report from Insider Gaming, the future of
  <em>

  </em>
  seems grim. In speaking with direct sources at Ubisoft San Fransisco, Henderson reports that
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's player count and player spending numbers have been steadily declining after its impressive May launch, as the game is currently hovering around 20,000 concurrent players across all platforms. Furthermore, Ubisoft leadership is reportedly giving its San Francisco studio until Season 3 to improve
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's player count before potentially cutting off support for the game. Going by Season 1's current duration,
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's third season should be expected to begin in either late December or early January 2025, right around the holidays.

  Ubisoft San Francisco has already endured a lot of turmoil this year between a seemingly unsuccessful toxic work culture investigation and recent layoffs which directly affected the
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  team.
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's dire player count situation only puts more pressure on Ubisoft SF, and with the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  juggernaut
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  landing in October, and another popular multiplayer shooter in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  launching in early December, it'll likely be difficult for Ubisoft San Francisco to pull lapsed and new players back into
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  come the end of the year.

 <p>
  It's natural for any new multiplayer game to lose players after its opening few weeks. However,
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's extreme player count issues were likely compounded by other big multiplayer FPS titles that have been released this summer, like
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  's arrival on consoles. Hopefully,
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  is able to pull in enough players to have its support continued.

      <title>Anno 1800: 8 Best Map Seeds To Try</title>

  Ubisoft's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Anno 1800
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a management-focused colony sim which puts players at the forefront of exploration and innovation at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. In addition to balancing the production of resources with the happiness of a town's inhabitants, players will also need to be wary of trade routes, pirates, and rival factions seeking to gain an economic advantage in the area. At the start of each game, players are able to make a variety of adjustments to the game's settings in order to suit their chosen playstyle and objectives for the campaign.
  <strong>
   Map "seeds"
  </strong>
  are a way to create variation and replayability, and they enable players to share their creations with other members of the game's community.

 <p>
  Each seed has a unique code and location, and can be found under the World tab. Players can still make adjustments to a variety of other settings, such as Island Size, Mineral Deposits, Fertility, and the Map Type. In this way, each playthrough is able to be made unique through the use of custom settings and the endless variety of Map Seeds available.

   </strong>
   Anno 1800 has plenty of interesting Map Seeds on offer, with randomized locations being generated across each region and with varied resource deposits being produced. Players continue to find and generate new and interesting map seeds in order to add or reduce certain challenges in the game. With so many different seeds to choose from, it can help to note down some of the more significant and popular seeds in order to try them out.

  Map Seed
  <strong>
   111108851
  </strong>
  is a popular map dominated by plenty of large islands, offering players plenty of resources and room for construction. With pirates positioned slightly out of the way, they will only present a challenge when players are ready to deal with them.

 <p>
  The New World variation in this seed is also very unique and contains several large, resource-rich islands, however Crown Falls in Cape Trelawney will have less oil than is typical in other map seeds. Overall, this map seed can lead to some great, competitive gameplay, particularly when it comes to claiming islands.

  One of the most exciting Map Seeds to play is
  <strong>
   1248
  </strong>
  , which works particularly well with the "Corners" Map Type. This seed contains large islands with lots of pirates who will provide plenty of challenge for more experienced players, as well as an abundance of useful resource deposits including Coal, Iron, Cement, Copper, and Clay.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":902} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Another useful advantage of this seed, particularly with the "Corners" Map Type, is the fact that the centrally-located pirates will attack all factions equally, rather than targeting those closest to them. Two large abandoned islands in the center of the map also provide an opportunity for players to expand inwards and contain the pirates.

  Map Seed
  <strong>
   220781
  </strong>
  is one of the most popular Map Seeds and is good for both newer and experienced players alike. With plenty of landmass and pirates contained to the map's far Eastern corner, players can develop their cities with relative ease and plenty of freedom in this resource-rich setting.

  The southern starting island for players in the "Archipelago" Map Setting, which is best for this Seed, contains plenty of useful Agricultural Resources including Potato, Grain, and Red Pepper, as well as Oil, the game's key Strategic Resource.

 <p>
  This Seed is best played on the "Island Arc" map type, which puts a giant sea between the pirates and the rest of the players, making them easier to manage and contain. With a variety of smaller and larger islands, each varying in the value of their resource deposits, this seed can lead to very competitive and exciting games, particularly on higher difficulties.

  One great advantage of Map Seed
  <strong>
   1521800709
  </strong>
  is the ability to corner the pirates by deploying defenses on the surrounding islands. This can allow for a relatively peaceful playthrough thereafter, provided that players have managed to acquire some of the larger islands within the "Arc."

  Map Seed
  <strong>
   1337032
  </strong>
  provides plenty of large, open islands for players to claim, each of which is rich in resources. An added benefit of this seed, particularly with the "Archipelago" Map Type, is the close proximity of AI traders to one another, making trade between different factions much faster. In addition to this, pirates will start on the far side of the map and will be easier to defend against for both the player and AI factions.

  The starting island will ensure players have everything they need to start a successful colony, with Clay, Iron, Coal, and Oil all appearing in abundance. The island also has a number of useful Argicultural Resource deposits which include Potato, Grain, Hops, and Fur. The main challenge of this Seed lies in occupying and maintaining the larger islands in the center of the map.

  For players looking to step up the game's challenge beyond city building, Map Seed
  <strong>
   1814140991
  </strong>
  provides an unconventional layout with lots of smaller islands and pirates at the center, with traders and the player based on the outer ring. This layout inevitably leads to a lot of competition for land and war between different factions.

 <p>
  The map is best played on the "Atoll" Map Type, which will provide a lot of open sea areas. Nonetheless, the islands themselves remain rich in a variety of resources, ensuring players will have a reason to expand beyond their starting island. For experienced players, this Seed can provide a welcome challenge, and often results in different deals being made with the pirates and Old World Traders.

  Across 6
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout
   </strong>
  </em>
  games, fans have been presented with captivating mysteries that, to this day, remain unsolved. While the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series has an abundance of secrets and lore to uncover across journeys in the wasteland, there are some that still remain unsolved to this day, and fans can only ponder the possibilities of what they could possibly mean.

  Below, we've compiled some of
  <strong>
   the greatest mysteries in the
   <em>
    Fallout
   </em>
   world that remain unsolved
  </strong>
  , so get ready to take a look at these disturbing head scratchers. These
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  lore mysteries still lack answers, even decades after the series first came to pass, and the mysteries continue to grow with each additional release.

  There's no doubt that the central conflict between America and China over dwindling natural resources eventually caused the destruction of the civilized world through nuclear hellfire, but the question remains: Who actually pressed the button that doomed the world? While not explicitly stated, there have been heaps of educated guesses that point towards China.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Great War that caused the apocalypse started on October 23, 2077, and ended on the same day. America and China both launched their nukes to destroy each other, and while some say it was over China's stubbornness to engulf the world in death instead of surrender, other questions arise when it comes ot Vault-Tec's direct involvement. Therefore, the question remains static as to who can be blamed for the end of all things? Vault-Tec, America, China, or something else entirely?

  While initially just a fun perk that would see the protagonists of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  aided by a Mysterious Stranger with a random chance to fire a bullet during V.A.T.S., the mystery has further deepened with each entry. It seems that the Mysterious Stranger goes far beyond just a wild wasteland-like perk in which a stranger comes to rescue with a big iron on his hip, as this character has appeared and disappeared across the wasteland for decades.
 </p>
 <p>
  While in-universe, only Nick Valentine makes reference to the Mysterious Stranger and directly calls him out when he spots him helping the protagonist, it remains a secret as to who the Mysterious Stranger actually is. Nick Valentine knows that the Mysterious Stranger has been active in the Commonwealth and Capital Wasteland, but the supernatural elements to his immortality and ability to appear and disappear without a trace beg further questioning. Could the Mysterious Stranger be a guardian angel who aids those with essential missions?

  There are quite a few characters that can be considered cryptids in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  universe, and the Smiling Man is no exception. This character is a random encounter in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , and he will simply wander the Appalachia wasteland with a wide smile stretched across his face, wearing an unusual suit and a desire for cheery people to accompany him.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's nothing known about the Smiling Man, other than that he claims to have been away for a long time, and as such, he just walks through the wasteland. What's scarier than his smile is that attacking him causes him to disperse in smoke, and the Smiling Man also has ties to old West Virginian legends. So, is this character otherworldly, like a demon who has seen humanity's fall?

 <p>
  Religion managed to survive the Post-War world, but truly in a different way. With a new world comes new deities, which is why the Children of Atom quite literally worship Atom, the personification of nuclear radiation and weapons. With its own mythology, one can only wonder if there is some truth to their belief, considering they're not dying of radiation exposure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Further gods seem to appear with Ug-Qualtoth, a character with no known lore other than an obelisk in the depths of the Dunwich Building that cements his place as a deity with a cult of worshippers. Gods are certainly worshipped in
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  , but are they real, and are they a threat? This is all presented without even mentioning the Christian God, which is worshipped by Joshua Graham, a man baptized once in water, and once in flame, kept alive to spread the word of God and Jesus Christ despite third-degree burns across his entire body. That's divine intervention?

 <p>
  One of the more fun mysteries in the world of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  is Elvis Presley's place within it. Elvis was an obvious icon in the series, especially in New Vegas, considering there's an entire school of impersonation based around Elvis, the King of Rock. The faction of Kings is modeled entirely around Elvis in the way they act, dress, and speak, but it seems that they have no idea who Elvis is, nor do they ever mention him by name.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the cultural relevance of Elvis and the popularity he had in Vegas, it seems that his name has been wiped from the records. His music is forgotten, as is his name, and all that remains is his cool factor and image. While one can make assumptions that this was because of the Great War, or even Vault-Tec somehow, it's more than likely that this was because obtaining the rights to Elvis' likeness and music library was far too costly.

  Aliens exist in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  universe, and that's not even a point of debate, considering players in
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  quite literally get abducted by them, they invade the lands of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , and one crashes in the Commonwealth of
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . While they do exist, it's not known what they actually want. Do they just want to investigate a world of sentient creatures that devastated themselves with nuclear war, or do they seek a far darker desire?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Zetans have been abducting people for hundreds of years before the Great War, so it's not as if they seek the remaining natural resources of the world. When one explores the Zetan ship in
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  , they can uncover an army of Pre-War Buttercup toys, upgraded to Zetan designs, but what on Earth are they for, and what's the end goal with their human experiments?

 <p>
  While monuments and beliefs to gods like Atom and Ug-Qualtoth are built upon faith, there's very real evidence of actual Eldritch beings having existed deep in the underground tunnels of Appalachia. Known only as the Interloper and the Visitor, these creatures are lifeless, pale in skin, with mutated limbs stretching across their bodies as if they were attempting transformation before being killed by unknown means.
 </p>
 <p>
  These dead creatures were perhaps here decades ago, or perhaps even centuries, if not more. Buried deep underground, these creatures are clearly not of this world, and if they are Eldritch beings, one can only wonder what killed them, and before that, what purpose they served in the meddling of mankind. Will they have stakes in the story to come, or are they meant to torment the curious with questions that will never be answered?

  The
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games are set over a hundred years after the Great War, and as such, nuclear fallout isn't the greatest threat, opposed to Super Mutants, irradiated creatures, feral ghouls, and general raiders. The series is dominated by America, and that's reasonable considering the stories and satire told within this established world. However, one can only ponder how the other continents are handling the world after the Great War.

  have created renditions of what certain parts of the world could be like, there's no official rendition to look toward. Fans are left wondering what China could look like, or what parts of Europe or the Middle East might be up to in a world ravaged beyond nuclear fire.

  One of the most famed aspects of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  is within the twisted Vaults that are scattered across the wasteland. Those that haven't been found and conquered by Super Mutants and Raiders will eventually be found by a protagonist seeking further adventure, only to be met with horrors beyond comprehension. Vaults were not created for the sole protection of humanity during atomic fallout, but instead, for evil experiments.
 </p>
 <p>
  These experiments range in scale, like Vault 87's experiments on FEV, or Vault 112 acting like a simulated reality, and Vault 68, which consisted of hundreds of men and one woman. There are hundreds of Vaults, and each of them has an evil experiment to uncover. However, Vault-Tec and the Enclave's reasoning seems to be unknown. What data can one use from these experiments, and why is it needed in a Post-War scenario?

 </p>
 <p>
  While the Vault Dweller is known to have left Vault 13 for Arroyo, they wandered off and were never seen again. The Chosen One's story was also never told with an ending, and the same can be said for every protagonist in the

  games. While players can headcanon their own endings as to what their heroes are doing in the wasteland, the truth will remain that nobody will ever know what happened to them, and whether they changed the world for the better, or fade into irrelevance in a wasteland that does what it can to survive.

  To get the Cricket Armor Set, players need to kill one of the hardest bugs to beat in the game: The Cricket. Highly mobile and super aggressive, these bouncing menaces will take the slightest chance to make the Teens their dinner, so tread carefully when facing them. Players will need the following mats to craft the Cricket Armor Set:

 <p>
  The Fabulous Femur is a trinket that can drop exclusively from any of the Cricket enemies in the game (even O.R.C. Crickets), but getting it has a low chance: 5% or less, depending on the type of Cricket.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, for the time being, and while they hunt, players should equip the Nifty Needle, which increases the
  <strong>
   damage of Charged Shots by 10%.
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Fabulous Femur, has two different perks:
  <strong>
   Lucky Flurry
  </strong>
  , which causes all attacks to have a 7% chance to boost the players' critical hit chance by 25% for 3 seconds, and Fall Protection, which reduces fall damage by 50% (the later will be especially useful considering that the ranged players are often exposed to being pounced on and thrown off high positions.

 <p>
  Now, for mutations, players need to go with Bardic Inspiration, which has the following effects:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Attacks with Bows and Greatbows have a 20% chance to buff the player and nearby allies' damage by 15% for 10 seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
   Perfect shots with Bows and Greatbows will buff the player and nearby allies' critical hit chance by 5% for 10 seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
   Dodges have a 20% chance to buff the player and nearby allies' stamina regeneration by 25% for 10 seconds.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Then, equip
  <strong>
   Pheromone Shot
  </strong>
  , which has these effects
  <strong>
   when landing a perfect shot
  </strong>
  with a Bow or Greatbow:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Nearby Buggies will deal 35% more damage for 15 seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
   Nearby Buggies will be targeted 100% more often in combat for 15 seconds.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The other two Mutations should be:
  <strong>
   Trapper PEEP.R
  </strong>
  (to maximize critical damage), and
  <strong>
   Reliable Friend
  </strong>
  , to increase revive speed to allies and buggies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, there are
  <strong>
   two weapons players should pick
  </strong>
  to complete this build: The
  <strong>
   Cricket Lute Bow
  </strong>
  , and the
  <strong>
   Discord
  </strong>
  .

  The Cricket Lute Bow has a 35% chance when hitting a target to give nearby players and Buggies a healing buff​​​​​​. Meanwhile, the Discord, which is a modified version of the same bow, has a chance to apply random
  <strong>
   debuffs to enemies hit with a critical hit
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Alternate between these two weapons to maximize damage output, healing, and causing disruption on enemies (especially bosses, since they are super tough to beat).

 <p>
  There are a lot of
  <strong>
   franchises
  </strong>
  out there that could be called eternal, but few of them have
  <strong>
   three titles
  </strong>
  that can be considered
  <strong>
   absolute classics
  </strong>
  in the gaming world.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->

 <p>
  This list spotlights eight
  <strong>
   trilogies
  </strong>
  where every game is a classic that all fans of games should try at least once in their life. From one of the most notorious Western RPGs of all time to the game with the most famous dragon in the gaming universe. Here are eight trilogies composed of eternal classics.

  <div class="article__gallery image-masonry masonry-images-3" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-1-1477395285" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-1-1477395285" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-1-1477395285" data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-1-1477395285" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-1-1477395285-img" data-gallery-type="image_masonry" id="article-gallery-1-1477395285">

 <p>
  Starting this list, we have the legendary franchise called
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fable
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with
  <em>
   Fable: The Lost Chapters, Fable II,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fable III
  </em>
  being its core titles. Even though
  <em>
   Fable III
  </em>
  turned out to be a disappointing ending for the original franchise, the legacy of Lionhead Studios and the legendary Peter Molyneux lives on today.
 </p>
 <p>
  The proof of this is that its reboot is fast approaching, and both long-time fans and newcomers are excited to chase chickens in the lands of Albion, forging their own tales as legendary heroes.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Halo
  </strong>
  is one of the most iconic franchises of all time: From its engaging gameplay and multiplayer to its immortal soundtrack that has reached millions of reproductions throughout several platforms. Every game of the original trilogy, from
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Halo 3,
  </em>
  is a masterpiece.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is no wonder that players are so attached to this incredible series, since it meant a before and after in the FPS genre, and teached a whole generation the importance (and fun) behind cooperative play.

  Rayman

 <div class="valnet-gallery images-count-3">
  <div class="article__gallery image-masonry masonry-images-3" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-1160678536" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-1160678536" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-1160678536" data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-1160678536" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-1160678536-img" data-gallery-type="image_masonry" id="article-gallery-3-1160678536">

 <p>
  <strong>
   Rayman
  </strong>
  is one of the best platformers made by Ubisoft, and marked the way for various games to follow up in the years after its original release. Comprised of
  <em>
   Rayman
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Rayman 2: The Great Escape
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc,
  </em>
  this fantastical series has been qualified as challenging and endearing by fans and connoisseurs of the genre.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its beloved main character, who gives the name to the series, has been greatly missed by fans all over the world. With the last game of the series (
  <em>
   Rayman Legends
  </em>
  ) releasing in 2013, it has been over a decade without this incredible game. Sadly, for the moment, its publisher has no plans to release a new entry in the franchise.

 </p>
 <p>
  This trilogy is already a new classic, and its characteristic Bullet-Time mechanic has been reproduced a hundred times, though it was originally inspired by the Matrix movies.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Tomb Raider
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a franchise that doesn't require presentation, and it has the most popular female protagonist in the history of gaming as its star: Lara Croft. Originally inspired by Nathalie Cook, who represented Lara in real-life events and posed as the model for the video game character, Lara jumped to fame between Tomb Raider I and II, becoming an icon by herself, and gaining millions of fans in a few years.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the release of the third installment of
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  , her place among the most notorious game characters in history was already guaranteed. Even today, with the new reboot of the series coming in hot, the original trilogy is still considered an unforgettable classic.

  <em>
   Legend of Mana
  </em>
  began as a spin-off of the Final Fantasy series called
  <em>
   The Legend of the Sacred Sword,
  </em>
  called
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Adventure
  </em>
  in the U.S. With the release of the second game, the title changed to
  <em>
   Legend of Mana
  </em>
  , which then released three subsequent games titled:
  <em>
   Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dawn of Mana
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  From its humble origins on the Game Boy handheld in 1991, to launching on the PlayStation 2 platform in 2006, the Mana series reigned as one of the most critically acclaimed JRPGs, alongside heavyweights like its parent series
  <em>
   FF
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  , and the eternal
  <em>
   Chrono
  </em>
  series.

  Though the games greatly diverge from the events in the books, it narrates the story of various champions of justice fighting against the evil remnants of the dark forces after the War of the Lance, and it's considered a jewel of classic RPGs. Every game in this series is a classic by itself, but the best of the best is the last of the series,

  follows gacha tradition and incorporates a Banner system where you can save free currency to use toward pulling for the characters your heart desires, or for characters at the top of the current meta. While you can spend real money to pull on Banners,
  <em>
   Arknights: Endfield
  </em>
  dishes out enough free currency for you to get plenty of characters and their weapons for free — you just have to be picky with who you're aiming for, and have a bit of patience.

  Here are all the ways you can get more free pulls in
  <em>
   Arknights Endfield
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Use your Bond Quota currency to get Chartered HH Permits from the Bond Quota Exchange
  </li>
  <li>
   Use AIC Quota to get the rate-up character's limited-time HH Permits
  </li>
  <li>
   Login every day when there are sign-in events
  </li>
  <li>
   Claim everything in your mailbox
  </li>
  <li>
   Increase your Authority Level
  </li>
  <li>
   Raise Regional Development Levels
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  All of the above methods reward Permits, which you need to use to pull on the Banners in
  <em>
   Arknights: Endfield
  </em>
  (which the game calls Headhunting). Each type of Banner uses a different type of Permit: Basic HH Permits for the permanent Banner, and Chartered HH Permits for the limited-time Banner (this changes its rate-up character every few weeks). You can also use special HH Permits linked to a specific character to pull on their limited-time Banner — but these expire once the Banner changes character. For example, you can use Firewalker's Trail HH Permits to pull on Laevatain's Banner.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Arknights: Endfield
  </em>
  does dish out a lot of Permits in the early game, later on, it's far more likely to reward you with Oroberyl. This still nets you pulls in the end though, as Oroberyl can be converted into Permits at a rate of one Permit every 500 Oroberyl. If you really want to, you can also convert the (mostly) premium currency — Origeometry — into Oroberyl, then convert that Oroberyl into Permits. So the chain of conversion is: Origeometry &gt; Oroberyl &gt; Permits.

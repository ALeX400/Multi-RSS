      <title>Psychonauts Developer Reveals Its Next Game, and It's Something Completely Unexpected</title>

  <em>
   Kiln
  </em>
  is the next game from Double Fine Productions, revealed during the latest
  <strong>
   Xbox Developer Direct
  </strong>
  . Described as an "online multiplayer pottery-party brawler," the upcoming title marks a somewhat unexpected venture for both the
  <em>
   Psychonauts
  </em>
  developer and the Xbox Game Studios family as a whole.

  Double Fine's most recently launched game is
  <em>
   Keeper
  </em>
  , a dreamlike platformer with a voiceless story, starring a walking lighthouse and its pelican-like friend.
  <em>
   Keeper
  </em>
  was released for the Xbox Series X/S and PC on October 17. Barely three months later, the American studio has revealed its next project.

  Announced during the 2026 Xbox Developer Direct,
  <em>
   Kiln
  </em>
  is billed as an "online multiplayer pottery-party brawler." The premise marks a fairly novel direction for the
  <em>
   Psychonauts
  </em>
  developer, even by Double Fine's experimentation-friendly standards. It is named after a type of furnace often used for drying pottery. True to its name,
  <em>
   Kiln
  </em>
  's gameplay loop centers on players crafting pots that become their fighters, then proceeding to control them to duke it out in 4v4 online matches.

  <em>

  's inventive premise was not invented overnight, but it did not take much longer either. Its roots can be traced back to Amnesia Fortnight, one of Double Fine's annual traditions where the developer prototypes various game ideas over a two-week period. For the 2017 edition of the event, the studio picked several concepts: three voted by fans, one chosen by Double Fine founder creative director Tim Schafer, and one that the team tasked with developing all of the prototypes—led by principal artist Derek Brand—wanted to make.
  <em>
   Kiln
  </em>
  was born out of that final pick.

  How Kiln's Pot-Making Works
 </h2>
 <p>
  The game's pot-making mechanics have been significantly streamlined compared to the real thing, but Double Fine still thought it sensible to include them given the premise. "It's just a button and a control stick," Brand says of the in-game pottery experience. In practice, that means aiming somewhere with a stick and throwing a chunk of clay with a button. However, the simple execution still allows for fairly diverse creative applications, especially when paired with the ability to pick between three different clay sizes and eight wheelable shapes, including bowls, cups, and bottles. "You can make any kind of shape you wanted," Brand says.

  Why Kiln's Pot-Making Matters
 </h3>
 <p>
  Each pot-making session will essentially serve as an engaging and highly granular class picker. Apart from dictating pot shape, the player's decisions during this stage will determine things like durability, speed, and moves, including 24 special attacks inspired by shapes, or rather functionalities associated with shapes. For instance, massive cylinders will turn into hammers, while hockey puck-like pots will be able to pull off a trick shot that ricochets between enemies. Ultimately, the pot-making and 4v4 battles work in tandem to create a unique casual multiplayer experience. "The whole pottery part is such that it grabs people who might not want to jump into a multiplayer game," Brand explains. "If we can, we just slowly ease them into the ‘I want to punch something now with this pot.’"

  is presently targeting a spring 2026 release. It will debut simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC. As a first-party Microsoft game, it will also be a day-one Xbox Game Pass title, available on the PC and Ultimate tiers of the subscription service. While it's still waiting for a concrete release date, Double Fine's last game was announced and launched in a span of just over four months—if that's any predictor for the immediate future, it would help narrow down the spring 2026 window to late April or early May.

      <title>10 FPS Games That Let You Play At Your Own Pace</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/fps-games-play-at-your-own-pace/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The FPS genre is well-known for intense gameplay and often fast-paced action that can be quite difficult to keep up with at times. Many players feel a lot more enjoyment when they can play through a game at their own pace, rather than being forced to rapidly shoot through hordes of enemies and run between objective after objective.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <p>
  Thankfully, the genre has quite a range of games that fall into the slower category, giving players a chance to choose how they want to engage with the world as opposed to being pushed through it. Some do this by reducing the amount of compulsory tasks that players need to overcome, while others take a step back and simply give players more choice with regard to actually approaching the missions themselves.

  universe, thrusting players into the lush forested world, with all the tools they need to explore and engage with it however they choose. The mission structure is already very freeing, often forcing players to travel far across the world, whilst encountering new areas and side-quests along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite a few timed moments, players are free to fly around and take in the sights for a while, forage for materials, or speedrun all the way to the end of the story, with no one approach being better than the other. It is truly an exceptional open-world game purely from an exploration perspective, having a sense of scale that very few other titles even come close to.

  allows players to dictate their own pace by giving them the freedom to explore its open landscape without imposing any real-time constraints. The Zone does not push players with constant momentum, instead encouraging them to take in their surroundings and progress at a rate that suits them.
 </p>
 <p>
  A lot of encounters can actually be avoided entirely through patience and planning, and the core element of survival depends solely on the player's ability to absorb environmental information and manage their resources, without running in guns blazing whenever they get a chance.

  offers a flexible structure where aggression and speed are largely optional. Main objectives can be approached head-on or ignored in favor of side activities, exploration, and character progression, with the player rarely being penalized for deviating from the primary path.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is also not much intensity within the actual combat, as encounters scale gently and players are given more than enough time to experiment and try new things, without feeling pressured into progressing further down one specific route.

  is an incredible post-apocalyptic experience that blends linear storytelling with semi-open environments that reward patience above all else. Outside of scripted story moments, players are free to explore however they want, scavenging resources and avoiding conflict altogether should they choose to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stealth is not only viable but encouraged, allowing for an alternative combat strategy that has just as much, if not more value, in a lot of cases. The game’s strongest moments often occur in the quieter moments, reinforcing the concept of patience that greatly contrasts with traditional FPS design.

  is a fan favorite in the FPS space, and it is easy to see why. The game's world is so compelling, both from a thematic and a visual perspective, and the story that ties it all together has so many unique and interesting moments that are all just as memorable as the last.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of gameplay, there is a good amount of variety in terms of what weapons and powers the players can use. They can run in and spray down anything that moves, or carefully take out turrets and approach larger rooms with caution, making each encounter feel far more open, despite the game being entirely linear.

  is built around player-driven tempo, as missions can be completed with or without combat and as slow or fast as the player decides. The level design supports slow traversal through the various alternate paths, letting players approach from above or stick to ground level to take out enemies up close.
 </p>
 <p>
  The chaos mechanic also directly feeds into how the player plays the game, whether by being aggressive and loud or silent and careful. This choice means that there are just as many reasons and chances to play smart and slow for players who prefer to take their time and find the right moment to strike.

 </p>
 <p>
  The gunplay almost feels secondary to the star of the show, which has to be the RPG elements. Very few other games come close to the level of depth and choice available, turning the world into a living, breathing landscape that players are free to explore at their own pace.

  There aren't large sweeping areas or a huge range of side content, but there are enough nooks and crannies for players to explore, and super well-thought-out stages that players will never feel rushed to get through in a set amount of time. Despite its age, the game has held up superbly well on virtually all fronts, delivering a timeless FPS campaign that has had players begging for a sequel for over 20 years.

  is a game that can be described in so many ways. Strange, spooky, beautiful, and so much more, but arguably the one that defines it the best is meditative. Players don't spawn in with a specific overarching goal in mind, nor are they completely directionless in the world, so instead, they are tasked with slowly exploring and venturing out into the unknown, using anything they can to help them fight and progress further.

  There are opportunities for speed as well as care, as at several points, players will come face-to-face with some pretty deadly enemies, and will need to carefully think about how they want to fight them. It isn't a conventional FPS experience by any means, but it is unique in so many ways that fantasy lovers will be missing out if they don't choose to give it a try.

  exemplifies the idea of control in every single mission. The pace of the game is largely dictated by whether the player wants to sneak, fight, or hack their way through the missions, letting them slow down or speed up whenever they desire.
 </p>
 <p>
  The levels are also dense with alternate routes, meaning that there is never one right path or one right speed at which to clear the area. The absence of any real-time pressures, combined with a meaningful sense of choice, ensures that the pacing remains entirely player-defined, being equally engaging and satisfying to play regardless of how high-octane or careful the player chooses to be.

  The Flashing Fish Shadow Quest is
  <strong>
   assigned by Vanya
  </strong>
  , the fishing mentor. As you continue completing her tasks, Vanya will eventually contact you about a special tool: the
  <strong>
   Mermaid Fish Attractor
  </strong>
  . This tool draws rare fish into a focused area, making it possible for legendary targets to appear.
 </p>
 <p>
  This triggers the Flashing Fish Shadow Quest. The objective of this quest is to
  <strong>
   share your Fish Attractor with others
  </strong>
  and find the Flashing Fish Shadow, a glowing mystery beneath the waves. Unlike regular fishing tasks, this one pushes you beyond simple casts and reels.

  To increase your chances of finding the Flashing Fish Shadow,
  <strong>
   head to the Fishing Village and speak with Bill
  </strong>
  , the white-bearded NPC near the dock. Choose the Sea Fishing Event option and select a boat. Once onboard, you can invite friends or even random players to join you.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the event begins, toss your Mermaid Fish Attractor into the water. From here, everyone should start fishing within the attractor’s circle. Your goal is to
  <strong>
   catch a fish with a distinct blue glow
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Make sure to watch the water carefully. Most fish appear as dark or golden silhouettes. The
  <strong>
   Flashing Fish Shadow glows with a soft blue light
  </strong>
  that immediately sets it apart.

  Here are some tips to boost your chances of finding the Flashing Fish Shadow:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Catch fish quickly to refresh spawns.
  </li>
  <li>
   Have everyone fish within the attractor’s radius.
  </li>
  <li>
   The more players involved, the faster the shadow tends to show up.
  </li>
  <li>
   If it doesn’t appear, throw in another Fish Attractor and try again. You can buy them from Vanya.
  </li>
 </ul>

    <p>
     Rabbit Fish did the job for us, and some other players have also reported that catching a Rabbit Fish completes this quest. It could be a different fish in your case, but you should
     <strong>
      aim for fish that emit a soft blue glow
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Even if one of your teammates reels in the glowing fish, it still counts toward your quest progress. You can expect the shadow to appear after about five or six catches.

 <p>
  We all know Devsisters love introducing a sidekick baked character alongside the main Cookie with every new update in
  <em>
   Cookie Run Kingdom
  </em>
  . For example, Pavlova Cookie came out with Eternal Sugar Cookie, and Salt Cellar dropped with Silent Salt Cookie. These little companions aren’t just fun to use on their own in low-level modes; they perform really well when paired with their linked fighter.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <p>
  This 5th Anniversary update brings Mold Dough Cookie, the partner of none other than Dark Enchantress Cookie. They share the same elemental damage, but Mold Dough’s Arena position and attack type are pretty different from the Queen of Witches. For those who’ve unlocked him,
  <strong>
   this guide covers Mold Dough Cookie’s best Topping and Beascuit build in
   <em>
    Cookie Run Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>

  Mold Dough Cookie is a charge-type Cookie, which means he can tank for the whole team and, naturally, encounters enemies from the first row. His playstyle is a bit aggressive;
  <strong>
   he’ll leave the team behind and walk toward enemies, hitting them with 275.6% damage while also knocking some of them back.
  </strong>
  That’s his main skill, and when it ends, he deals heavy AoE damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  A unique thing about this muscular, evil Cookie is that he can enter
  <strong>
   Gem Frenzy mode
  </strong>
  . In this mode, he gains Injury (which works similarly to Dark Enchantress Cookie’s Injury damage), but instead of inflicting it on others, his own HP starts to go down. At the same time, his normal attacks become supercharged, allowing him to deal even more damage. The downside is that he cannot use his primary charge skill while in Gem Frenzy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The first time Mold Dough is defeated in Gem Frenzy mode, he stays on the field for a little longer
  </strong>
  , giving him a chance to continue attacking. If he manages to survive, he becomes exhausted for 10 seconds, and during this time, he is stunned, but moves faster and makes all team members immune to damage for a few seconds. If you summon him with Dark Enchantress Cookie,
  <strong>
   both of them deal more chaos-type damage
  </strong>
  when the Dragontongue Brand passive is active.

 <p>
  Unlike Dark Enchantress Cookie, you can go for a full attack build on Mold Dough to increase his damage, since he doesn’t have any caps or negative effects on his Toppings.
 </p>
 <p>
  With that in mind,
  <strong>
   the best toppings for Mold Dough Cookie in
   <em>
    Cookie Run Kingdom
   </em>
   are five pieces of Looming Dark Raspberry.
  </strong>
  That's because these are the resonant variants of Searing Raspberry, and they offer more substats. You can easily purchase them from the Event Shop.

 <p>
  Players who don’t have Looming Dark toppings can instead equip five Searing Raspberry M in the Toppings slots. If your team already has tanks and heavy damage dealers, you can go for
  <strong>
   five pieces of Looming Dark Almond or Solid Almond M
  </strong>
  to boost the damage resist stats he grants to other teammates.

  As for Tarts, you can choose

   Searing Raspberry Tart M
  </strong>
  for a full attack build or
  <strong>
   Solid Almond Tart M
  </strong>
  for a damage-resistant build. For Beascuits, fans looking for the perfect setup should definitely go for
  <strong>
   Legendary Chewy Beascuit with Damage Resist substats
  </strong>
  . You can also swap in Attack Speed if you want him to charge faster.

  C-Tier is the lowest of the low. These characters might excel at a support role given the right circumstances, but players shouldn't invest too many resources in them. Build only in extreme necessity cases.

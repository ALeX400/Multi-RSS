  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch Online
  </strong>
  is far from a perfect service. Since its 2018 launch, Switch Online has struggled to live up to its Xbox and PlayStation counterparts, with the service lacking common features like party chats and direct messaging. Switch Online's infrastructure has also been a consistent point of criticism over the last six years, with netcode and server issues often causing extreme lag. But one shining beacon over the years has been Nintendo Switch Online's ever-growing library of retro video games.

  Beginning with just a handful of NES games, Nintendo Switch Online is now home to over 300 retro titles, encompassing the SNES, Sega Genesis, Game Boy, GBA, and Nintendo 64. That impressive collection has just grown a little bigger, with a classic
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  game having been added a few days ago.

  Donkey Kong Land 2 Is Now on Switch Online
 </h3>
 <p>
  In 1995, the Rare-developed
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land
  </em>
  released for the original Game Boy. An incredibly ambitious project for the time,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land
  </em>
  was a condensed, reworked version of the beloved SNES game
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  . While some bosses were changed and levels were added,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land
  </em>
  was a remarkably successful attempt at capturing the gameplay formula of
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country
  </em>
  , so much so that a sequel released just a year later.

 <p>
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land 2
  </em>
  launched in September 1996, also for the original Game Boy. Much like its predecessor,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land 2
  </em>
  attempted to distill a full SNES
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  game into one tiny Game Pak.
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land 2
  </em>
  is essentially a retooled version of
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest
  </em>
  , with it borrowing the SNES game's narrative and many of its stage names, but changing some level designs.

 <p>
  A big change in
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land 2
  </em>
  and its more technically impressive SNES counterpart was the ability to play as Dixie Kong, who could spin her hair to glide.
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land 2
  </em>
  is now available on Nintendo Switch Online.

 <p>
  But the
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land
  </em>
  series is actually a trilogy, and that means there's still one entry left to join Nintendo Switch Online's roster.
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land 3
  </em>
  was originally released in 1997, giving fans a portable version of
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!
  </em>
  , albeit with changed level layouts once again. With
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  now on Switch Online, it'd be great if
  <em>
   Donkey Kong Land 3
  </em>
  was right behind them, especially as
  <em>
   DKL2
  </em>
  was added just four days after its predecessor.

  With both

  and
  <em>

  </em>
  now on the service, Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy/Game Boy Color library is currently sitting at a solid 33 titles. While that's not quite as high as NSO's NES or SNES game count, the vast majority of these Game Boy titles are certified Nintendo classics. From
  <em>
   Mega Man 1-5
  </em>
  , to
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX
  </em>
  , to
  <em>
   Metroid 2: Return of Samus

  <em>
   Super Mario Land 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  , to
  <em>
   Kirby's Dream Land 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  , Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy library is packed with games that must be played, even for those who don't have nostalgia for that particular era of gaming.

      <title>How to Get the Depths Key in Fisch</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The Depths Expansion brought a brand-new location to
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  , with a unique bestiary and an expensive fishing rod. But to get there, players have to complete several difficult conditions, one of which is to find a special key. Therefore, in this guide, we will tell you how to get the Depths Key in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Update 1.06.0 made Vertigo the most popular location in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  , as it is the entrance to the Depths. But, of course, you can't just walk in there. Instead, players must complete the Vertigo bestiary and get the elusive Depths Key in the same location in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":695} -->
 <p>
  So, your first task is to get to the Vertigo location. This place is deep underwater, so it is impossible to get there by ship. Therefore, you need to wait for the strange whirlpool to appear. Luckily, players receive a notification when such a whirlpool spawns.

 <p>
  After that, you need to find the strange whirlpool, which differs from the others by a beam of light beating from the center. Jump into it, and you will get to Vertigo, the only place where you can catch the Depths Key in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  As befits an Exotic rarity, catching this item is a real challenge. To get the Depths Key you can use any bait or not use any at all. Also, weather conditions do not matter. In any case, the chance to catch the Depths Key in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  will be about 2%.

 <p>
  In other words, you should be prepared to spend a lot of time on this. It is important to note that this is the only way to obtain the Depths Key on your own. However, you can try trading with other players who have already found this Exotic key.

 <p>
  When you finally get the Depths Key in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  , you will most likely have the Vertigo Bestiary completed. After that, you will need to talk to the NPC near the red gate and use the key to open it.

 <p>
  The RPG genre has given players some of the most powerful, important, and moving games in history. Whether they're text-based explorations of a setting or fast-paced ARPGs, roleplaying games have been at the crux of the gaming scene for some time now. The main thing that makes an RPG high-quality is its setting. A fantastic story will still fall flat in an uninspired setting, and conversely, having a world that feels lived in and real can make up for a lot of other missteps in a title.

 <p>
  Many RPGs take the opportunity to tell a story set in a huge fantasy world or a grim dystopic future. But some titles, instead of looking to the future, or into worlds beyond human understanding, look to the past for inspiration. Historical fantasy games blend fantasy elements with settings from humanity's past, often (but not always) including magic. These RPGs in particular take fantastical perspectives on periods in time from humanity's past.

  One of those first soulslikes that helped define the genre and its goals, similar to
  <em>
   Salt and Sanctuary
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Nioh
  </em>
  was a fantastic action RPG, with an equally strong sequel. The game focuses on an Irish sailor washing up in a grimdark fantasy Japan.

 <p>
  Yokai have taken advantage of the chaos in this pre-Tokugawa era and are terrorizing the land — leaving William Adams, who arrives in pursuit of an old and bitter longtime foe, to defeat the Yokai with swordsmanship and fast reflexes. This title is an excellent take on a historical setting that incorporates its own myths in an engaging way.

  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance

  prides itself on the lack of fantastical elements in the game, being one of the most grounded RPGs of its era with a great emphasis on historical authenticity and combat.

 <p>
  This doesn't make Henry's story any less fantastical, however. This is a classic coming of age tale worked into the Hero's Journey. Players who want to see an authentic historical Bohemia will be hard-pressed to find a title that tops this game... at least until the sequel comes out.

  Saying that
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  felt like a passion project of FromSoft's might feel disingenuous, as all games from this storied developer are imbued with passion. Yet, the game still feels like the developers wanted a specific story to tell in this rich historical period, owing to how different it feels from other FromSoft titles.

  With some fantastic combat, great puzzle bosses, and a rich take on Sengoku-era Japan (slightly earlier than
  <em>
   Nioh

  's time period), this is one of the best historical fantasy titles players can get their hands on today.

  This dark and slick CRPG features some excellent design choices. Set in 20th Century Warsaw, this game takes an excellent spin on both magical realism and historical realism. There are elements of body horror here that make the game a confronting, but compelling affair.

  Playing a clandestine mage during a tumultuous time in history is one of the most interesting tacks taken by a CRPG. And yet, and the classic return to form for the genre is something players will not want to miss.

  If
  <em>
   Vampyr
  </em>
  has one core message to drive home to players, it's that being good is not always easy. Post-WWI London is a fascinating time period for players to explore as a member of the undead, and
  <em>
   Vampyr's
  </em>
  unique mechanics make it one of the greats.

  Before this update,
  <em>
   DTI
  </em>
  models could create glamorous looks by layering clothes and wearing items like Teddy Bear, Coconut, Apple, Doll, and more, but there was no way to save them. Even those who spent a lot of time creating fun hacks couldn’t save them. But now, you can store your outfits and easily put them on whenever you want. Check out this guide to learn
  <strong>
   how to save outfits in

  To save outfits in
  <em>
   Dress To Impress
  </em>
  , players need to use the Dressing Pods located in the main dressing room and save them in the wardrobe section. Once you have created your look, follow these steps to store it in the game:

 <ul>
  <li>
   First,
   <strong>
    find the Dressing Pods
   </strong>
   . Just head straight from the VIP room until you spot the skin tones booths on the right, then turn left to see the pods.
  </li>
  <li>
   Next, approach a Dressing Pod and
   <strong>
    click the ‘E’ mini-heart to enter
   </strong>
   it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you’re inside the pod, tap the
   <strong>
    ‘Wardrobe’ icon
   </strong>
   , which is represented by a brown closet and a pink dress.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finally, click on the
   <strong>
    ‘Plus’ icon
   </strong>
   , give your outfit a name, and hit ‘Save’ to store it.
  </li>
 </ul>

  After saving your outfits in

  you can equip them by going back to the Wardrobe section in the Dressing Pods, tapping on your outfit’s name under the ‘Plus’ button, and hitting the

  You can also change the color of your dress or remove items and accessories by pressing the ‘Yellow Mannequin’ icon in the pod.

  Moreover, the Dressing Pods showcase your code items and things you’ve purchased with in-game money or Robux, so you can quickly give your avatar a fresh touch.

  , head to the ‘Wardrobe’ section in the dressing booths, select the outfit you want to remove, and hit the

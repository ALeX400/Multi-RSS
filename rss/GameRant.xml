  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  expansion has provided fans with another compelling reason to delve into the rich world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  . However, this expansion is not merely an extension of the main game; it significantly diverges from it in many aspects.

  One notable change is the level design. The Land of Shadow is much more complex. While some fans appreciate this added depth, others may find navigation challenging. The Cathedral of Manus Metyr is a particularly important location that fans should explore, though reaching it is no easy feat. The guide below details the exact route you have to take to reach the location.

  The Cathedral of Manus Metyr is a location you'll encounter after leaving the starting area of the expansion, Gravesite Plain. Getting there involves a lengthy and complex journey, but it can be reached with a few straightforward steps.

 <p>
  Begin by locating the Moorth Ruins site of grace, which serves as the starting point for the guide below. The above image reveals its exact location. Once you've reached this spot, mount your trusty Torrent and head northeast, passing numerous broken structures. Near a pile of debris from one of these structures, you'll find a path leading downward.

 <p>
  Use your Torrent to descend below; be cautious as enemies may be present, so be on your guard. As you descend, follow the cave that continues downward. Instead of proceeding through the door illuminated by two candles, turn around and go down even further. Once you've reached the bottom, head towards the cave directly in front of you where you'll encounter a ladder. Climb upwards, and you'll arrive at Bonny Village, your first pit stop on this journey.

 <p>
  Interact with the site of grace directly in front of you, then proceed southeast briefly before heading eastward. You'll encounter a broken bridge that's too far to cross directly. Descend below and turn right to find a path upward again. Cross the next two bridges ahead of you to reach a forested area.

  Take a moment to breathe a sigh of relief, as you're now much closer to your destination. Follow the damp road ahead and steer clear of the burning monster. Continue along the path until you eventually reach another site of grace. Interact with it to unlock it as a fast travel point for future journeys.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a rather impressive DLC, expanding
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's already massive and complex world with an entirely new map to explore. With these new environments have come a number of new weapons, including weapon types that aren't in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's base game, greatly broadening build potential and keeping combat feeling fresher than ever.

 <p>
  Build experimentation in FromSoftware's Soulslikes has always been an interesting subject. In a game like
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  , there is virtually no build variety, as combat is designed around a single playstyle;
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  offers a bit more freedom, but the variety is still a bit constrained due to its commitment to fast-paced and aggressive combat.
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  offer players the greatest degree of freedom for their builds thanks to their massive selection of different weapons, variable roll speeds/equipment loads, and stats that can be altered to make for radically distinct gameplay experiences. However, these games all have a major roadblock in the way of build crafting, which
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  manages to remove, at least partially.

  Why Upgrading Weapons Can Be a Problem in Soulslikes
 </h3>
 <p>
  Like in
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , upgrading weapons in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  requires specific materials that can be hard to find. As a weapon's level increases, so does the rank of its requisite upgrade materials, meaning that raising a weapon to its fullest potential can be a time-consuming endeavor. More importantly, this process means that players are all too often locked in to one or two specific weapons after a certain point in the game.

 <p>
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  allows players to purchase upgrade materials after they find Smithing and Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearings, but this can take up plenty of time in and of itself, and most players won't collect all nine Bell Bearings. Also, the highest-level upgrade materials will never be available for purchase, and they are a finite resource, which means that players can only fully upgrade a few weapons per playthrough. Plus, Bell Bearings reset on NG+, making collecting them a significantly tedious process during new runs.

 <p>
  This is disappointing and runs contrary to FromSoftware's action-RPG design: if players find a cool weapon during the late-game of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , it will almost never be beneficial for them to use it over the weapon they have already invested in throughout the game. And if the player has upgraded this primary weapon to a significant degree, they won't have the materials needed to improve the new, cool weapon they just found. They may have to start a new playthrough just to make the late-game weapon viable.

 <p>
  To find higher-level Smithing Stones and Somber Smithing Stones in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's base game, players will usually have to either scour the various mines dotted around the overworld or loot predetermined locations; the chance to get higher-tier Smithing Stones as random drops from enemies oscillates between extremely low and nonexistent. But this description doesn't quite apply to the setting of
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . It's not at all uncommon to find high-tier Somber Smithing Stones as random enemy drops in The Land of Shadow, and drop rates for regular Smithing Stones are much higher as well, even with a low Discovery stat.

  This change was likely implemented to encourage build experimentation, letting players easily upgrade
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  's new weapons, but FromSoftware shouldn't stop here. More abundant upgrade materials would help all the studio's action-RPGs, fostering a sense of freedom and flexibility that is sadly lacking during the later hours of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , and the
  <em>
   Dark Souls

  games. At the very least, upgrade materials shouldn't be finite, as this discourages branching out from a tried-and-true weapon or build, ultimately punishing players who don't want to stick to a single weapon.

      <title>Upcoming Role-Playing Games People Are Excited For</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Role-playing games have been a staple of the gaming industry for more than three decades. Each month, the genre tends to welcome a couple of noteworthy titles, be it high-profile releases such as
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Lies of P
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty
  </em>
  or more niche projects like
  <em>
   Labyrinth of Galleria: The Moon Society
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   8-Bit Adventures 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Little Witch Nobeta
  </em>
  . There are always
  <strong>
   new RPGs
  </strong>
  on the horizon.

  Due to the ambitious nature of the genre's AAA projects, they are often announced years in advance, a practice that can result in extremely high expectations. Once the hype train gets moving, stopping it can be impossible, which has resulted in some disappointments in the past. However, when a game lives up to its potential, it is a thing of beauty. Which
  <strong>
   upcoming RPGs
  </strong>
  are the most sought-after?

  Despite never quite garnering the same exposure as
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  , Nihon Falcom's
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  franchise has been dishing out quality games for the best part of two decades. While all the main titles take place in the same world, they are divided into smaller region-based arcs that focus on a set group of characters.
  <em>
   Trails Through Daybreak
  </em>
  marks the start of a new storyline, one set in Calvard, a country that has recently established democratic rule. Players take control of Van, a Spriggan who works as a bounty hunter.

  Now, like all Nihon Falcom games,
  <em>
   The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak
  </em>
  was released in Japan a couple of years ago, so it is a known quantity by this point. Going by that version's reception, this entry seems to be a bit more of a mixed bag than some of the franchise's highest points; however, it also takes quite a few risks. For one, the gameplay blends real-time and turn-based combat, which is unheard of for a
  <em>
   Trails
  </em>
  title.

  RPGs are synonymous with grand, massive adventures; however, they do not have to be. The Gentlebros'
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  games are delightful. The available titles deliver short but sweet adventures packed to the brim with charming NPCs, solid open-worlds, and enjoyable combat. They might not have jaw-dropping visuals or 100+ hours of content, but they are cute, polished, and fun. The upcoming
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  should offer more of the same, albeit with a pirate makeover.

 <p>
  On the surface, the sequel does not appear to be a stark departure from its predecessors. Players will still travel across an overworld in search of quests, dungeons, enemies, and puns. The combo-driven combat is likely to be simple but flashy, and Gentlebros promises to expand on this area. When it comes to new ideas, sailing appears to be a big part of
  <em>
   Cat Quest 3
  </em>
  , which makes sense considering the pirate theme and the open-world's island structure.

  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  has been making the rounds for a couple of years. Although the early footage was encouraging, the hype train picked up considerable steam in August 2023 when some publications got hands-on time with the game, showing that it has more to offer than well-done trailers. Naturally, these previews only got to experience a sliver of what the final product will hold, but they did highlight the title's combat system that appears to combine melee, magic, and stance changes. The former comes courtesy of a staff, which makes sense considering the game is inspired by the
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  novel (which also helped shape
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  ).

 <p>
  Visually striking and featuring fast-paced and complex action,
  <em>
   Black Myth
  </em>
  could prove to be among 2024's nicest surprises. The game appears to provide a fairly fresh take on the Soulslike blueprint, utilizing that subgenre's penchant for tough boss fights and hard-hitting combat as a launch pad to craft something familiar but new.

  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
  </em>
  is a difficult series to define. The games are first-person shooters, but they are hardly similar to most of the genre's popular releases. Open-world is more of a theme and concept rather than a full-blown genre, and
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
  </em>
  's very harsh universe and survival elements set it apart from seemingly similar projects like
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  . Survival horror is somewhat accurate, although newcomers expecting something in the vein of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  will be disappointed. The same holds for the RPG descriptor, although the games usually incorporate enough ideas from the genre to be worth recommending to fans provided they are not averse to
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
  </em>
  's other categories and its immersive sim qualities.

  A new Atlus production is always exciting, and
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is far from an exception. Announced halfway through the 2010s, the game has finally reached maturation, allowing a release date to be set for October 2024. While taking inspiration from
  <em>
   Megami Tensei
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  should be introducing quite a few twists to the Atlus formula, including a battle system that blends real-time and turn-based. Going on the current information, action combat is used for easy battles, while harder fights switch to turn-based. The concept sounds intriguing on paper.

  Narratively,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  appears to have a lot going on. Set in a fantasy realm that has entered a period of disarray due to the king's demise, a tournament has been declared to crown the next ruler. The protagonist is aiding the kingdom's prince, and they will be accompanied by a plethora of other playable characters. The game also seems to have a social link-style system called Archetypes.

  Recently, Nintendo has been happy to embrace Mario's role-playing legacy, releasing remakes of
  <em>
   Super Mario RPG
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
  </em>
  . Both of those Switch games are great, particularly the latter, but they are hardly a replacement for new adventures. Putting aside remakes and remasters,
  <em>
   Paper Mario: The Origami King
  </em>
  was the only fresh Mario RPG to debut in the last eight years, and an argument could be made against that game being part of the genre.

  For a while, the
  <em>
   Mario &amp; Luigi
  </em>
  series started to feel like a thing of the past, with the last fully new entry being 2015's
  <em>
   Paper Jam
  </em>
  . However, that all changed during the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, which included a reveal for
  <em>
   Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership
  </em>
  . This upcoming project will mark the IP's home console debut, and it seems set to be an impressive evolution of the franchise's gameplay, visual style, and sense of humor. While perhaps not as decorated as
  <em>
   Paper Mario
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mario &amp; Luigi
  </em>
  is arguably among the most consistent JRPG series of all time, delivering nothing but greatness. Even the weakest entries –
  <em>
   Dream Team
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Paper Jam
  </em>
  – are very good, and
  <em>
   Brothership
  </em>
  should surpass that threshold.

  While not everyone loved the shift,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  has been steadily implementing more RPG elements since
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  , with
  <em>
   Mirage
  </em>
  being an exception. Ubisoft's upcoming entry,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , looks set to continue this trend, at least according to comments made in this Xbox interview by its Game Director, Charles Benoit. Set in Feudal Japan, this project will feature two protagonists, a shinobi named Naoe and a samurai called Yasuke. Except for certain missions, players will be able to swap between these characters on the fly, and they have unique skills, weapons, and playstyles.

  Every
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game is a big deal, but
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  appears to be attracting more hype than usual. Part of that has to do with the setting, as fans have been craving a Japan-based adventure for years. The dual-protagonist structure is also compelling, especially since Naoe seems to be designed to facilitate stealth-based combat similar to the older entries in the series. As November 2024 approaches, Ubisoft will gradually pull back the curtain and reveal more of
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  ' unique ideas, hopefully paving the way to one of the best
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed

  games.

  <em>

  garnered a slightly mixed reception, the overall series has been on a high since

 <p>
  If reviews of the Japanese version are any indication,
  <em>
   Ys 10
  </em>
  will likely be divisive among fans. The game ditches the series' party system in favor of a dual protagonist setup; more importantly, a combo system that allows the two leads to combine forces seems to be overpowered to the point of rendering individual abilities somewhat pointless. The ship-based exploration and combat might also prove to be polarizing. Still, Falcom knows its way around fun action, and even if
  <em>
   Ys 10
  </em>
  proves not to be among the franchise's greatest creations, it should still be very enjoyable.

  A new
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  is always a cause for celebration, and
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  looks primed and ready to be an impressive work of art. Although details are still fairly scarce at this point, Capcom has confirmed that a 2025 release is on the cards and that the game will launch on the PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S. Consequently,
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  will likely have more in common with
  <em>
   World
  </em>
  rather than
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  since the latter was designed around the Nintendo Switch's limitations, resulting in fairly small maps compared to its predecessor.

  Now, an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Monster Hunter

  exists in a unique category outside of RPGs, which is certainly fair. Still, the games always incorporate a variety of role-playing elements, and they are generally good picks for fans of the genre who want to focus on action over story.

  is the definition of a cult classic. While rough around the edges, the RPG features fantastic writing and characters, along with a great deal of customization that provides players with plenty of creative freedom. It is a masterpiece that, for the longest time, seemed destined to remain a solitary project (in the video game industry, anyway); however, in 2019,

   <em>
    Bloodlines 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was revealed to the world. Since then, the game has been pushed back a few times, and information regarding its production has been inconsistent. That said, a few
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade
  </em>
  spin-offs have debuted over the last few years, so the IP is alive.

  Set in Seattle,
  <em>
   Bloodlines 2
  </em>
  will let players create a newly-transformed vampire, which will involve picking things like their human background and preferred discipline.
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade
  </em>
  's success can be partially credited to its deep clan system, which permits players to commit to one of the vampire groups operating in the city. This element should be present in
  <em>
   Bloodlines 2
  </em>
  . In terms of gameplay, so far, it seems like the sequel will stick close to its predecessor; therefore, expect first-person action with a heavy focus on a dialogue system.

  More than a decade has passed since the last
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game, and the world is long overdue for another BioWare masterpiece. Even if the sequels were polarizing, the franchise still holds a lot of weight in the RPG sphere, and a new entry will not only attract a lot of attention but also be held to very high standards.

 <p>
  According to reports, a sequel has been in development for years and the process has not been smooth. A complicated development cycle does not have to result in an underwhelming final product, but fans might want to temper expectations until more information is officially released. Still,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
  </em>
  will be a big deal when it eventually comes out.

  It was only a matter of time before
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  was revealed, although that is essentially all that Bethesda has done. Except for some minor details that can be surmised from the few seconds of footage that has been released so far, the game is still largely a mystery; however,
  <em>
   TES 6
  </em>
  is one of those
  <strong>
   upcoming RPGs
  </strong>
  that only needs to exist to generate hype.

 <p>
  Realistically, Bethesda's sequel is still a few years away from a debut, and the publisher will probably not start to heavily market the project until after
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's cycle is complete. Nevertheless, it would be shocking if
  <em>
   TES 6
  </em>
  does not wind up as one of the best-selling games of all time.

  <em>
   Dragon Quest 12
  </em>
  is a weird one. Since being revealed in 2021, Square Enix has barely uttered a word regarding the next mainline entry in the storied JRPG franchise.
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  's influence and popularity cannot be understated, particularly in Japan where the series is nothing short of a cultural phenomenon. While there was a fairly long dry spell after
  <em>
   DQ8
  </em>
  , the 11th mainline entry was a hit in Western countries, elevating the license to international highs it had not experienced for a while. Thanks to its predecessor's success,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 12
  </em>
  is poised to be one of the biggest releases in the license's history outside of Japan.

 <p>
  Perhaps, Square Enix announced
  <em>
   DQ12
  </em>
  's existence a bit prematurely or simply wanted to gauge the public's interest in a sequel; whatever the reason, the post-reveal silence has lasted slightly too long. Hopefully, the publisher will expand on the game's development at some point in the near future as the gaming world is ready for a new mainline
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  adventure.

  Subjective opinion aside,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3

   </strong>
  </em>
  -focused Sonic Central broadcast will not be happening this month. The
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  franchise turns 33 this year, and Sega has been doing a lot to celebrate the blue blur and also Sonic's red-and-black rival, Shadow the Hedgehog. Between new content for games like
  <em>
   Sonic Dream Team
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic Superstars
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  remaster, and other media ventures like the
  <em>
   Knuckles
  </em>
  TV Show and Sonic Symphony tours,
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  fans have had a lot to participate in.

  Usually around the
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  franchise's birthday, Sega would announce a Sonic Central broadcast event, similar to a Nintendo Direct or other livestreams. These annual events show the latest announcements for the franchise, revolving around new games, TV shows, or other merchandise. The first one was broadcast in 2021, and each subsequent one took place close to the franchise's anniversary. Games like
  <em>
   Sonic Frontiers
  </em>
  were usually given focus during these events, showing off gameplay before its launch.

  A recent livestream was held earlier this week celebrating the franchise's 33rd anniversary, which featured a closer look at some of the new
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  LEGO sets and other merchandise like wireless earbuds and a bag.
  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  brand and community manager, Katie Chrzanowski, was part of the stream, where she announced that, unfortunately, Sonic Central won't be happening this year in June. This, however, doesn't mean the event itself won't be happening this year. "I will say there's not one happening this month...but we have not forgotten about them. So don't worry, keep checking the official channels for any news on a future Sonic Central," says Chrzanowski.

  While there isn't a presentation happening this month, there were a few things that the team discussed they were excited about. Topics included the new
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  animated short that will be premiered at Anime Expo, which is focused exclusively on Shadow, when the trailer for the third theatrical
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  film will possibly be announced, and even some clean recordings of various Sonic Symphony concerts.

  As mentioned earlier, Sega has also declared that 2024 is the Year of Shadow, which has given the anti-hero hedgehog a lot of focus. Aside from a starring role in the upcoming
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  and its prequel short, Shadow has also been the focus of various ventures, such as a motorcycle built like the one from his spin-off game, special events in various
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  mobile games, and Good Smile even revealed a Shadow the Hedgehog Nendoroid figure at Smile Fest 2024.

  Aspect of the Crucible: Bloom can be found on a corpse near the Ravine North site of grace in Rauh Ruins. However, you will have to grind for the Aspect of the Crucible: Thorns incantation. Here’s how you can get this spell in the
  <em>
   Elden Ring DLC
  </em>
  .

  To get the Aspect of the Crucible: Thorns incantation, you will have to
  <strong>
   defeat the Golden Hippopotamus guarding the entrance to Shadow Keep
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . You can fight this boss by taking the lift from the main gate of Shadow Keep. After taking the lift, rest at the Shadow Keep Main Gate site of grace and then enter the plaza ahead to start fighting the Golden Hippopotamus. Once defeated, you will be rewarded with the Aspect of the Crucible: Thorns incantation and two Scadutree Fragments.

 <p>
  The Golden Hippopotamus is one of the more annoying bosses in
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . Right as you enter its arena, it will start running at you with its mouth wide open and will grab you unless you roll sideways. If it grabs you, the chances of surviving are low as it will quickly follow up with a smash attack using its giant head.

  In its first phase, the Golden Hippopotamus mostly uses its mouth grab and face slam attacks. Most of its attacks can be dodged by rolling sideways towards its body. However, once its HP drops to near 50%, the Golden Hippopotamus grows thorns on its back and becomes a little more agile. With its thorny back, it will now be able to perform a rolling attack similar to the Godskin Noble and execute a spin attack that launches thorns in all directions.

 <p>
  Using the Mimic Tear summon can help you beat the Golden Hippopotamus in
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . You can also summon Redmane Freyja for the fight if you have progressed her questline. As it is a living animal, you can always use a bleed build to quickly take down the hippopotamus. Another option is using a stance-breaking build to deal huge chunks of damage from ripostes.

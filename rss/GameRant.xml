      <title>The Best Local Co-Op &amp; Split-Screen Games You Can Play On Nintendo Switch</title>

  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  can adapt to most situations. While perhaps not the most powerful console ever, the system is the definition of flexible, and that goes beyond its hybrid selling point. The Switch library is incredibly robust, thoroughly covering pretty much every genre on the market. The same can be said for features, as the console has more than a few games designed around online multiplayer or
  <strong>
   local co-op
  </strong>
  . Even if it is no longer as popular as it was during the late '90s and early 2000s, couch gaming will always have a place in the industry.

  Due to the store having so many products (and clutter), it can be difficult to sift through the noise to find the diamonds in the rough. Consequently, this article will highlight the
  <strong>
   best couch co-op Switch games
  </strong>
  to try and simplify the process as much as possible.

   June 2024 was not a particularly huge month for
   <strong>
    local co-op Nintendo Switch games
   </strong>
   ; however, one title came out that deserves to be highlighted. Spoiler: it involves a monkey and a ball.

 <p>
  In terms of upcoming releases, July 2024 does not have much to offer co-op fans. However, August has Cat Quest 3, which should be another delightful action RPG. Also, on August 12, Cult of the Lamb will be releasing a co-op update.

  <em>
   WarioWare
  </em>
  is dependable. Sure, the franchise will probably never sit among Nintendo's most popular or mainstream productions, but not every game needs to be
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros.
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  . Sometimes, nothing hits the spot like a few dozen silly microgames that are surprisingly creative despite lasting only a few seconds.
  <em>
   Move It!
  </em>
  is reminiscent of 2006's
  <em>
   Smooth Moves
  </em>
  , almost to the point of being an exercise game rather than a conventional party game.

 <p>
  Crucially, the title leans very heavily into multiplayer, both co-op and competitive; in fact, it is quite light on single-player content, to the point of being difficult to unabashedly recommend to players who would like to focus only on solo sessions.

  The third entry of Blizzard's famed dungeon-crawling epic is largely known for its addictive, robust online gameplay. Yet, the Switch version of this game makes for a streamlined way to enjoy
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  with three other players locally.

 <p>
  The game's convenient system of hotkeys and a palatable interface allows gamers to get the most out of the experience even amid chaotic four-player skirmishes with enemy hordes. A single-screen can be shared, but remote play – or a combination of TV and handheld play – is
  <em>
   also
  </em>
  available. And with such an expansive rendition – which includes the
  <em>
   Reaper of Souls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rise of the Necromancer
  </em>
  DLC – players can be assured countless hours of hack 'n slash goodness with their friends or family.

  2013's
  <em>
   Risk of Rain
  </em>
  has been largely overshadowed by its 3D successor, but the first game is still a great and influential roguelike. 2023's
  <em>
   Returns
  </em>
  serves as both a 10-year celebration of the original project's debut and a revamp that irons out some of its rougher and more dated components. Nowadays,
  <em>
   Risk of Rain Returns
  </em>
  is arguably the best way to experience this seminal release, offering an addictive and challenging experience that can keep players engaged for potentially months on end.

  The remake pays quite a bit of attention to the multiplayer portion, and this is arguably the most improved area over the 2013 version. Online multiplayer is easy to set up and allows four people to participate together. While joining up with strangers is naturally an option,
  <em>
   Risk of Rain Returns
  </em>
  ' high difficulty and item sharing (or exclusivity, depending on the host's decision) demand a united front if players wish to get far in a playthrough. Couch co-op is also available, and it plays out largely the same as the online variant. As the action gets hectic quickly in single-player, co-op amplifies the chaos quite a bit; however, it is all part of the fun.

  Nintendo's pink, spherical mascot has shined since the SNES days when it comes to simultaneous couch co-op – and this charming rendition on Switch is no different. In a sense, the game takes on the feel of both
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   New Super Mario Bros.
  </em>
  Up to four players can embark on this colorful adventure, which hovers somewhere in between a platformer and a party game.

  The game stresses the consumption of foes and the fusion of different powers and abilities. These attributes lend themselves to cooperative play, encouraging friends to work together and combine forces against the baddies, bosses, and puzzles in their path.

  Players looking for
  <strong>
   local
  </strong>
  <strong>
   multiplayer Nintendo Switch games
  </strong>
  with a horror twist have a couple of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  titles at their fingertips.
  <em>
   Revelations 2
  </em>
  is a great pick due to its co-op raid mode, which is a blast with friends; however, while two players can take on the campaign, one of them will feel like a passenger rather than a fully active participant.
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  has a fleshed-out co-op campaign, but the game itself tends to attract a fair amount of criticism. That said, fun can still be had with Capcom's title.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Ultimately, that leaves
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  , the first entry in the franchise to properly embrace co-op. The story mode supports two players, and they are both treated as equals in terms of gameplay. Even though it leans heavily into action, the 2009 release is still a polished and entertaining experience. The game's West African setting also sets it apart from most other action-horror projects on the market.

  The Nintendo Switch has a couple of Musou games that support co-op. While their quality varies to an extent, someone's preference is likely to come down to which license they feel most attached to.
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  fans should check out the
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  sub-series, while
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  has a couple of decent entries. Koei Tecmo's
  <em>
   Samurai Warriors
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warriors Orochi
  </em>
  also have representatives on Nintendo's hybrid system.

  Along with just screaming "Nintendo,"
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors
  </em>
  spin-offs are arguably the most impressive Muou games on the Switch, excluding
  <em>
   Persona 5 Strikers
  </em>
  since it does not support co-op.
  <em>
   Age of Calamity
  </em>
  gets the nod as it is a proper Switch project rather than a port of a Wii U release. Supporting split-screen, two players can take charge of Link, Zelda, and a host of other characters as they engage in a strange twist on the
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  mythos. While not free of the occasional stutter,
  <em>
   Age of Calamity
  </em>
  looks great and plays reasonably well.

  Beat 'em ups are just made for
  <strong>
   local co-op
  </strong>
  (or arcades). Rampaging through a city's streets while punching thugs into the stratosphere is always entertaining, however, it becomes infinitely better when a friend tags along for the ride.

  flips things around by having two girls, Kyoko and Misako, head out on a quest to save their kidnapped boyfriends. Naturally, anything that moves or stands in their way is just asking to be greeted with a stylish attack.

  Supporting local co-op, two friends can work together to usher in a new era of prosperity and growth, with each person using one Joy-Con to control their character. Unlike most local co-op Switch games,
  <em>
   Kingdom Two Crowns
  </em>
  does not tether players to each other, allowing them to do their own thing. At times, it can feel like they are sharing the world rather than specifically working together, although they will eventually having to co-exist (or not).

  Nintendo Switch owners have a few
  <em>
   Trine
  </em>
  games at their fingertips, and an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Trine 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  are the picks of the bunch. However,
  <em>
   Trine 5
  </em>
  is a very solid addition to the franchise and also the most recent project. Three adventurers who conveniently fit into fantasy archetypes find themselves having to go on another quest, this time to stop a power-hungry villain called Lady Sunny. As far as stories go,
  <em>
   Trine 5
  </em>
  does not try to be anything more than just passable, but it succeeds in reaching that standard. The game is entirely about its puzzles, and they are consistently engaging and creative.

  Solo runners have the option to swap between any of the characters at once, allowing them to use their unique skills to carefully work their way through each puzzling scenario. Meanwhile, co-op players can also pick any of the characters, so they won't be forced to commit to one class; as such, there could be four clones on the screen at any given time.
  <em>
   Trine 5
  </em>
  is a better overall experience in co-op.

  Originally released in 2013,
  <em>
   Rayman Legends
  </em>
  was one of its decade's best platformers. Featuring colorful visuals, creative levels, tight and fast-paced gameplay, and an awesome soundtrack, the game scores a homerun in nearly every area, and it is an easy recommendation for those seeking an engaging single-player package on the Switch. Even if it is not the definitive way to experience the campaign, Ubisoft's project also supports co-op, allowing up to 4 players to take on the roles of Rayman and his friends.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rayman Legends
  </em>
  ' co-op does not change all that much in the grand scheme of things, as it basically amounts to the group running through the standard levels as solo players (albeit with the introduction of a mechanic that allows someone to save their downed partners). However, the core gameplay loop is so strong that it applies seamlessly to co-op. Ubisoft needs to develop a new

  <em>
   Pico Park
  </em>
  is a small release that does not have that much of a presence (it doesn't even have a Metascore), but if some friends are looking for a cute but challenging puzzle game, this project should be able to scratch that itch. The levels are generally quite simple, but they vary their mechanics just enough to ensure things do not get repetitive too quickly. The content is split into levels revolving around specific game styles, with each one being fairly different to allow players to pick and choose which activities best fit the group.

  With accessible controls and concepts that are generally very easy to grasp,
  <em>
   Pico Park
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   great local co-op Switch game
  </strong>
  to throw on for a mixed group that has both experienced players and beginners. That said, it is very much a party-style title rather than one that people will revisit endlessly.

  Sometimes, nothing beats the classics. Despite debuting in 2024,
  <em>
   Contra: Operation Galuga
  </em>
  very much feels ripped from a bygone era, with the side-scrolling run and gunner largely striving to recapture the license's former glory while also implementing a handful of tweaks along with prettier visuals. This might not sound interesting on paper, but
  <em>
   Contra
  </em>
  games have been in short supply over the last two decades, and the franchise's previous decent entry came out in 2011. As such,
  <em>
   Operation Galuga
  </em>
  is a breath of fresh air that tastes nostalgic and sweet.

  While perfectly enjoyable solo, Wayforward's project shines far brighter in co-op, which allows up to four players to step into the shoes of the playable characters. The latter's basic actions are fairly similar, although they are complemented by unique abilities that grant them some individuality; as such, co-op won't feel like four clones are running around on the screen. In terms of content,
  <em>
   Operation Galuga
  </em>
  is both a sequel to the 1987 original and something of a rethread. The story blends classic reimagined stages with brand-new ones, creating a campaign that looks to the past but also does not completely ignore the present.

  An idyllic British village finds itself under siege by a feathered fiend determined to spread chaos with reckless abandon. And, just when the locals thought things could not get worse, the goose brings a friend along for the ride.
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  is an absolute joy, particularly for those players who just want to mess around in a cute sandbox. The eponymous bird(s) slowly plow through the town's areas, ruining everyone's day in the process. Although they have a couple of objectives they need to complete, players are generally encouraged to experiment and do their own thing.

  <em>
   Snipperclips
  </em>
  is a charming puzzle game that feels tailor-made for the Nintendo Switch. Depending on the chosen mode, either up to 2 or 4 players need to work together to solve short but amusing puzzles. They control paper-esque characters who can have their designs changed, a process that requires coordination between the players. The puzzles largely fit on one screen and are self-contained, making them perfect for quick sessions.

  While accessible for all ages,
  <em>

  Despite persisting as a presence over the last two decades, Sega's
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball
  </em>
  's last 15 years were poor.
  <em>
   Banana Blitz HD
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Banana Mania
  </em>
  remastered or remade earlier entries, and neither of them was particularly great. The franchise was overdue a proper sequel that focused completely on recapturing the magic of the original two games, and
  <em>
   Banana Rumble
  </em>
  managed to accomplish just that and also offer a few modern touches.

  While the pre-release marketing emphasized the online multiplayer quite a bit, the 2024 Switch exclusive entry is, for the most part, a traditional
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball
  </em>
  experience. Players get to play through 100+ levels in
  <em>
   Banana Rumble
  </em>
  , tilting the screen to guide a ball-trapped monkey to the end point, picking bananas along the way. Simple as this concept sounds, all it takes is some slightly off controls to ruin the entire experience; thankfully,
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble
  </em>
  controls like a dream. And, the game gradually ramps up the difficulty, going from a relatively casual experience to a challenging puzzle-platformer that requires pinpoint accuracy.

  Along with PvP,
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble
  </em>
  also includes local and online co-op, with both modes supporting up to four players. The gameplay loop sounds like a more natural fit for competitive rather than cooperative multiplayer, but the latter is implemented quite well, all things considered. Basically, players are charged with working through the same stage, with only one of them needing to complete it. While not interacting much within the level, players can coordinate their goals, ensuring they accomplish as much as possible as a unit.

  Taking inspiration from tabletop classics and turn-based JRPGs,
  <em>
   For the King
  </em>
  is a good pick for solo players and a great one for a group of friends. As three adventurers, players explore a sizable randomly generated land to stop the approaching darkness, which naturally means completing the occasional puzzle, exploring dungeons, and fighting a lot of enemies.

  Do not be fooled by its cute art style,
  <em>
   For the King
  </em>
  is a grueling game that punishes parties who are ill-prepared for encounters or have made some costly mistakes during their movement on the overworld. Out of all the co-op games on the Nintendo Switch,
  <em>
   For the King
  </em>
  arguably comes the closest to replicating the tabletop experience, at least when it comes to combat. In terms of storytelling, it is nothing to write home about.

  Supermassive has cemented itself as one of the gaming industry's leading horror developers, particularly when it comes to cinematic co-op adventures. While arguably overshadowed by the company's standalone projects,
  <em>
   The Dark Pictures Anthology
  </em>
  is nevertheless a reliable source for short but fun games that deliver a few jump-worthy moments each, even if they are not necessarily fantastic individual experiences.

  Switch users can pick up
  <em>
   Man of Medan
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Little Hope
  </em>
  , with both being roughly of the same quality. Newcomers should start with the former since it is the first entry in the series and, overall, less divisive than
  <em>
   Little Hope
  </em>
  . Still, they are both solid.
  <em>
   Man of Medan
  </em>
  's 5-player co-op assigns a character to each person, forcing them to make decisions that could have negative consequences for their friends. This system is perfect for a party night, especially since the story can be completed in one day.

  was and still is great, and its sequel takes the same core concept and throws in a second Yarny. Once again, players find themselves traversing fairly realistic locations as a yarn-based entity that needs to use their own string to overcome puzzle and platforming challenges. While most of the mechanics are similar to the first entry,
  <em>
   Unravel Two
  </em>
  shakes things up considerably by introducing a second playable character that, ideally, is controlled by another person. That said, the campaign can be easily completed in single-player, so it is not like the game becomes unplayable if co-op is not an option.

  Most challenges emphasize multiplayer/teamwork, encouraging players to support each other to get through the presented obstacles. Although not excessively difficult,

  If nothing else,
  <em>
   Darksiders
  </em>
  cannot be criticized for playing it safe. The series swaps genres with each new experience, and no entry seemed to undergo a more significant shift than
  <em>
   Darksiders Genesis
  </em>
  . Rather than a third-person game, this spin-off is a top-down RPG, although it still very much feels like
  <em>
   Darksiders
  </em>
  . This means fast-paced hack and slash combat, visually impressive bosses, and a solid selection of unlockable skills.

  <em>

  introduces Strife as a playable character, and the sharpshooter is accompanied by War.

In co-op, each player assumes control of one Horseman, and they can play through the full campaign.

  This labor of love, shared on Reddit by user octavian_world, is massive in its scope, containing seven distinct cities with their own personalities, all spread across a landscape filled with tree-covered mountains in a variety of climates that reflect some of the biomes featured in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . The Appalachian imagery of sprawling green hills shared by this creator is a work of art that has fooled at least one mountain-dwelling resident, who stated in the comments that they thought they were looking at a real picture at first glance. The creator said they use a third-party program to help create the mountains, but they still terraform, landscape, and detail the verdant hills after the program generates them: a process that's taken since July 2023 to complete.

  As for the cities, each has a unique aesthetic, from a neon-drenched, futuristic cyber city to a foggy riverside burgh made distinct by its rustic steel suspension bridge. Some familiar real-world landmarks have been included in the worlds as well, such as the towering Space Needle from Seattle and a version of Cinderella's Castle that would fit perfectly into Disney World or
  <em>
   Disney's Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  if it weren't for
  <em>

  's distinct, intentionally blocky art style. The world even has a functional system of mass transportation, sporting a unique railroad system that will help players venture out across its expansive swamplands, canyons, and other natural features, as well as its urban centers.

 <p>
  A creative fan of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </em>
  </strong>
  crossed the iconic Nintendo franchise over with LEGO in their own way by creating a replica of the Master Sword out of spare bricks. The colors do not necessarily match, since it is made from multicolored LEGO bricks, but the design clearly resembles the iconic weapon from
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda.
  </em>

 <p>
  The Master Sword has been a staple of the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise for over 30 years, having first appeared in the top-down action-adventure game
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
  </em>
  in 1991 and becoming a recurring weapon from that point on. Now, the iconic design is synonymous with the longstanding Nintendo franchise, appearing as a postgame weapon in
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and even crossing over with
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  in the Switch port of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
 </p>

 <p>
  Fan-made replicas of the weapon are common as well, but the one made of spare LEGO pieces by Reddit user Tinenan stands out for its distinct multicolored look while still retaining the main elements that make it recognizable. The creator shared an image of the sword to the official
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  subreddit, which shows the seemingly life-sized replica sticking out from a base adorned with the Triforce symbol from the
  <em>
   Legend of
  </em>
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  series.

 <p>
  Fans were quick to comment with praise for the build, stating how impressed they were that the builder managed to keep the Master Sword recognizable despite not adhering to its original color scheme by using a rainbow of LEGO bricks. Others made no mention of the colors at all, instead focusing on the design itself and making references to
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  and the many things the Master Sword has achieved throughout the series.

 <p>
  Regarding whether they used a guide or blueprint for the build, the creator states that they simply built the entire thing from the base to the hilt with patience and a lot of LEGOs, but did not use any actual instructions. They did not provide any specifics about the sword's size or how long it took to build, and it is seemingly attached to the base, so they cannot actually wield it like Link in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games.

 <p>
  Though this Master Sword was crafted out of LEGOs purely by hand with seemingly no instructions, fans looking to bring the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise to life with the colorful bricks in an official capacity do not have long to wait. An official
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  LEGO set based on The Great Deku Tree from

  is set to release later this year, giving all fans a chance to build something from the series themselves.

  Third-person horror games have been a staple in the horror genre since the 90s. From early groundbreaking releases, using a fixed camera perspective, these titles offered tense gaming experiences that would dominate the horror industry. Third-person horror games contain some of the most disturbing visuals, complex puzzle-solving, and immersive gameplay fans could want and continue to be a big part of the horror genre.

  In modern gaming, the first-person perspective has become the standard for survival horror. However, third-person games continue to be a major force in the genre, with standout remakes, groundbreaking new releases, and hidden indie gems. The best third-person horror games have come to define the genre, engaging players each year with tense and immersive horror experiences that stick with players longer after.

  <em>
   Tormented Souls
  </em>
  is not as slick as other modern horror games. However, the simple graphics, immersive story, and dark atmosphere create a memorable horror experience. Players may have access to only a few weapons, but combat is generally best avoided. While some puzzles can be rather obtuse,
  <em>
   Tormented Souls
  </em>
  is a worthwhile horror game filled with nostalgic charm.

  On release, the game was a hit with horror fans, with its gory content and emphasis on survival rather than action.
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  has grown into a classic of the genre, with a sequel following in 2017. While never outshining the bigger franchises,
  <em>
   The Evil Within
  </em>
  remains a major release in horror gaming.

  <em>
   Fatal Frame 2
  </em>
  is often considered one of the scariest video games ever. The game was highly influenced by the emergence of Japanese horror at the time, through films such as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ringu
   </em>
  </strong>
  in 1998 and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ju-On: The Grudge
   </em>
  </strong>
  in 2002. It follows twin sisters, Mio and Mayu, as they investigate paranormal events around an abandoned village. Using their enchanted Camera Obscura, the sisters can exorcise the dangerous spirits they find.

 <p>
  <em>
   Fatal Frame 2
  </em>
  became a favorite among horror fans, with some unable to finish the game because it was too scary. It would go on to become a successful franchise with multiple sequels following. While the franchise has yet to reappear in the modern era,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly
   </em>
  </strong>
  remains a genre classic.

  was revitalized for a new audience, using modern graphics, sound, and lighting. It provided seamless transitions between levels and expanded the central character to include voice lines.

  Players control James Sunderland as he explores the mysterious town of Silent Hill looking for his deceased wife. The sparse nature of the game, mixed with its bleak atmosphere and emotional narrative, created a classic game that pushed survival horror to new places. With the upcoming
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  remake, this popular franchise is once again at the forefront of horror gaming.

  The original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a high point in survival horror. As the zombie outbreak spreads throughout Raccoon City, the protagonists, Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, are trapped in the local police station. The maze-like building holds many secrets connected to the virus and is soon attacked by deadly creatures and unstoppable monsters.

 <p>
  While the original is a genre classic, in 2019, the remake was released to critical acclaim. Far from just a modern remaster, the game was remade from the ground up. Every aspect of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  was improved, from the gameplay to the graphics and sound, to changing the original fixed camera style to an over-the-shoulder perspective. These improvements breathed new life into the series and introduced a horror classic to a new generation of gamers.

  The
  <em>
   Resident Evil

  series was well-established as one of the biggest names in horror gaming when
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released in 2005. The game was not only a classic in the survival horror genre, but a reinvention. It took the series into an action-orientated style while retaining all the fun and scares of the original games.

 <p>
  Following their trend of high-quality remakes, Capcom re-released
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4

  to critical acclaim. This exceptional remake improves every aspect of the original and seamlessly brings in new gameplay elements, such as parrying and stealth mechanics. The horror has been ramped up, with improved lighting, sound, and graphics, creating even more atmosphere and elevating the many iconic moments featured in the game.

  Repeating the success of
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  was always going to be a tough proposition for the developers. However,
  <strong>
   <em>

  succeeds on every front, while never quite living up to its predecessor. While parts of the story became divisive among some fans, the game is undoubtedly a colossal achievement.

 <p>
  <em>

  features heart-pounding horror, explosive action, and tense stealth sequences. The emotional storytelling hits just as hard as the original, while the landscape remains as beautiful and desolate as ever. The creature design is just as memorable, with the Rat King boss fight being a standout moment. Fans of the franchise will love this unforgettable game that stays with players long after completion.

  Few games have achieved the heights of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  . Blending stealth, action, and horror with an engaging and emotional narrative,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , without a doubt, is one of the best games ever made. Players follow the story of Joel and Ellie, as they travel across post-apocalyptic America, searching for the elusive and rebellious fireflies.

 <p>
  The game works on every level, from the immersive world ravaged by the Cordyceps fungus to the characters, enemy design, narrative, and gameplay. The horror is tense, while the action is exciting. It is now one of the best-known video game franchises in the modern era, with the successful TV adaptation further cementing
  <em>
   The Last of Us’s
  </em>
  place in popular culture.

  Each ability has unique movesets, so players can find something that suits their playstyle in this
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  experience. However, only a few can become even stronger beyond increasing Mastery.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   RE: XL
  </em>
  offers players a large pool of abilities, only four of them can be evolved. Of course, this dramatically reduces the variability of possible builds, but these abilities are too good not to use. So, to evolve abilities in
  <em>
   RE: XL
  </em>
  , you must fulfill several requirements:

  <li>
   Have one of the required abilities

  <li>
   Reach 500 Mastery with this ability

 <p>
  Only four abilities are suitable for evolution in
  <em>
   RE: XL
  </em>
  . Luckily, almost all of them have a Common rarity. Therefore, getting three of them is quite easy. At the same time, one of the suitable abilities is Rare, which does not complicate obtaining much. So, your first step is to visit Fortuneteller Baba NPC. In exchange for Cash, you will be able to roll the required abilities there:

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Shock Fist (Common)
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Burning Spear (Common)
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Blazing Knight (Common)
   </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Black Leg Style (Rare)
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  After getting one of the abilities, you must increase its Mastery to 500. This can be achieved by fighting enemies, bosses, and even dummies. However, you will still need a lot of time to complete this step. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you complete Missions along the way. With their help, you can earn a lot of Cash, which is necessary for the last step.

 <p>
  Once players reach Mastery 500, they can evolve abilities using a suitable Stone. You just need to use the Stone to get a new, more powerful moveset. The good news is that each can be purchased from Fortuneteller Baba for 50,000 Cash. Here is a list of them:

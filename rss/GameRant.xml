       The Best Roblox Anime Games Like Peroxide

 <p>
  There are plenty of great
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  games that are inspired by manga and anime, but few, if any, are quite as good as
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  . As its name suggests, it's based on Tite Kubo's
  <em>
   Bleach
  </em>
  and offers players an incredibly enjoyable combat experience that Ichigo himself would be proud of. As in most other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, that experience can become even better with the help of
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes.

  Players can redeem
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes to claim a ridiculous amount of free Product Essences, which they can then take to Kisuke in The City to get rerolls on every individual path. Product Essences can also be used to acquire cosmetic items, which is why fans of the game are always on the lookout for all of the latest
  <em>
   Peroxide
  </em>
  codes.

    Updated June 8, 2024, by Tom Bowen:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   New Peroxide codes used to be added to the game all the time. Sadly, however, that's no longer the case. It's been weeks now since the last new code, much to the dismay of many players. Thankfully, there are still plenty of working codes for Peroxide, meaning that new players can get a pretty decent amount of Product Essences right from the get-go. After redeeming these codes, it's a good idea to bookmark this page and check back here often, as we'll be adding new Peroxide codes to the list below as soon as we find them.

 <ul>
  <li>
   First, it is necessary to launch
   <em>
    Peroxide
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Then, if players are entering the game for the first time, they'll need to go through the tutorial.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once the tutorial has been completed, in the upper left part of the screen, players should find and select the start button. It is located to the right of the chat button.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the resulting menu, players should type or paste any of the active
   <em>
    Peroxide
   </em>
   codes listed above and then press Enter.
  </li>
 </ul>

  <em>
   Fruit Seas
  </em>
  (formerly
  <em>
   Demon Piece
  </em>
  ) is another
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game inspired by the popular anime
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  . Compared to most of the others though, it is much better designed and more enjoyable. In this RPG adventure, your goal is to become the best among other players, and the path to the objective is very difficult and thorny.

  Hundreds of enemies and bosses will stand in your way, and if you are not well-leveled, it is unlikely that you can confront them. However, by redeeming
  <em>
   Fruit Seas
  </em>
  codes, you can provide yourself with a decent amount of currency and boosters that will help you progress through the game much faster.

   <em>
    Updated June 8, 2024, by Tom Bowen:
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   New Fruit Seas codes have been a little hard to come by lately, despite the game hitting the most recent likes goal set by the lead dev. With Update 2 now looming large on the horizon, though, one suspects that some new codes will be added fairly soon. Players should be sure to check back here often so as to avoid missing out once they are, as many of the redeem codes for Fruit Seas expire after just a couple of days. In the meantime, there are still some working Fruit Seas codes that new players can enjoy.

  Redeeming
  <em>
   Fruit Seas
  </em>
  codes is not a difficult process. Fortunately, there are no restrictions or tutorials in the game, so you'll have access to this option as soon as you launch the title. So, if you're a beginner and have never redeemed codes in a
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  game before, or if you just forgot how to do it, below is a detailed guide:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":582} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    Fruit Seas
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Pay attention to the left side of the screen. There will be a white button with black dashes on the icon above your HP and stamina, and you should click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   After doing so, you will open a side menu with several more buttons. Among them, find and interact with the settings button with a gear on the icon.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the settings menu, in the lower section, you will see an input field. Here you need to enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the active codes listed above.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you've done that, press Enter to submit your reward request. If you have done everything correctly, REDEEMED! will be highlighted in green in the input field, and the rewards will be added to your inventory or balance.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1318} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  This way, you will need to redeem every active code if you want to receive all the available rewards. Try to redeem all codes as soon as possible, as each code has an expiration date after which you will no longer be able to receive these rewards.

  There are plenty of great
  <em>
   <strong>
    Roblox

  </em>
  games inspired by
  <em>
   Jujutsu Kaisen
  </em>
  , but few have made quite as big an impression as
  <em>
   Jujutsu Shenanigans
  </em>
  . Featuring several
  <em>
   JJK
  </em>
  characters and a plethora of powers and abilities from the anime, this combat-focused battlegrounds game has taken the community by storm and continues to grow at an impressive pace.

   Despite the game being played by hundreds of thousands of people every week, new Jujutsu Shenanigans codes are incredibly hard to come by, making them a whole lot more meaningful when they do eventually show up. Sadly, there hasn't been a new one for quite some time now, but with the game fast approaching a quarter of a billion visits, there's a pretty good chance of that changing fairly soon. With this in mind, it's a good idea to bookmark this page and check back here from time to time, as we'll be sure to add new codes for Jujutsu Shenanigans whenever we find them.

  Occasionally, a game comes out that players just want to cozy up to for hours on end.
  <strong>
   Open-world games
  </strong>
  can be riveting, or they can be frustrating and tedious. The scale of an open-world game can be both its strong and weak suit. On one side of the spectrum, some games have enormous maps that are time-consuming to traverse.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":327} -->

  With focused gameplay, however, open-world games can provide immersive experiences that have immense replay value. The realism of these maps is awe-inspiring. Love or hate the following titles, they are some of the highest-selling in gaming. Let's take a look at the
  <strong>
   most immersive open-world games

   May 2024 was not a particularly big month for open-world games, although Soulmask launched on Steam early access to a decent response. Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut also made its PC debut, garnering unsurprisingly positive reviews. While the latter was already highlighted in this discussion, the former is not quite ready to be included, although it could get there eventually. In the meantime, a PS3-era WW2 game has been added.

  After making waves via a demo,
  <em>
   The Planet Crafter
  </em>
  had its full release in April 2024, garnering near-universal praise in the process. A survival sandbox game set on a vacant planet not equipped for human life, this title shares quite a few hallmarks with other releases and is a fairly small project in the grand scheme of things. However,
  <em>
   The Planet Crafter
  </em>
  knows what it is trying to be and does a great job of actualizing that goal. The goal is simple: Terraform a planet.

 <p>
  Dropped in a harsh world with little to their name and almost no help, players will initially need to focus on meeting the bare minimum requirements to survive, which includes monitoring their oxygen levels. As they gather resources and slowly begin to craft tools and buildings, their new hellhole will start to transform into something a bit more charming and, eventually, beautiful.

 <p>
  With accessibility options that allow the gameplay's difficulty to be tweaked to match a user's preferences,
  <em>
   The Planet Crafter
  </em>
  can be either brutal or relaxing; either way, it should make for an
  <strong>
   immersive open-world game
  </strong>
  . Miju Games did a fantastic job of emphasizing visual progression through
  <em>
   The Planet Crafter
  </em>
  's base building and expansion, granting quite a bit of freedom in the terraforming process. After a considerable number of hours, players will have shaped the planet to their tastes.

  Many fans were heartbroken to hear that masterclass game developer Hideo Kojima wouldn't be working on the critically acclaimed
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  series any longer but were quickly placated to learn the iconic creator was opening his own studio. His first foray into the world of video games as an untethered designer was
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Although it's a bit avant-garde for some, the world that Kojima created is nothing short of spectacular, especially from an immersion standpoint. Players get to control Sam, a "futuristic delivery man" portrayed by the talented Norman Reedus of
  <em>
   Walking Dead
  </em>
  fame. Although the game itself is superbly strange, it's also incredibly enthralling (although some may find it hard to enjoy its quirky gameplay). It's definitely worth a look, if just to appreciate its open world.

  While not the be-all and end-all of what makes a great game, graphics do matter. Would
  <em>
   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  have made the grade if it was not so gorgeous? Probably not, and that is not an indictment of the rest of the experience. It is just that the title's visuals are by far its most striking feature, and they bring to fruition a vibrant, lively, and reactive alien world that is packed to the brim with jaw-dropping vistas. The game is fully aware that its main selling point is its world, and it goes out of its way to ensure nothing distracts from its beauty.

 <p>
  The immersion goes beyond just the visuals though, as
  <em>
   Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  also does an admirable job of making players feel like they are controlling huge alien creatures that tower over humans. While the combat is not that far removed from the typical Ubisoft first-person experience, the game's heightened mobility gives everything a different and refreshing flavor.

  Pandemic Studios was great. The developer knew how to combine cool settings with addictive and accessible gameplay while telling unique and (occasionally) comedic stories. While perhaps not "immersive" in the traditional sense, both
  <em>
   Mercenaries
  </em>
  games are highly entertaining sandbox projects that feature some of the genre's best-ever destruction. The
  <em>
   Destroy All Humans!
  </em>
  games also offered fun smaller-scale twists on the open-world format. The developer could also handle non-sandbox projects masterfully, as shown by
  <em>
   Star Wars: Battlefront
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Full Spectrum Warrior
  </em>
  . Even
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings: Conquest
  </em>
  deserves praise for its presentation, despite not being among the franchise's best titles.

  EA shut down Pandemic in November 2009, a month before the developer's final game hit store shelves. Putting everything else aside,
  <em>
   The Saboteur
  </em>
  saw Pandemic go out on a high note that is still worth revisiting to this day, as long as new players have a fondness for PS3-era open-world projects that take fairly heavy inspiration from the first few 3D
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  s. Surprisingly, very few open-world games have tried covering World War 2, and
  <em>
   The Saboteur
  </em>
  is extra special due to taking place in Nazi-occupied Paris. The city's recreation is historically accurate, albeit stylized through artistic choices like depicting yet-to-be-liberated areas in black and white (and introducing color as a reward for liberating them).

 <p>
  <em>
   The Saboteur

  has a few shortcomings and enjoyable gameplay that does not break any new ground. Nevertheless, its unique and immersive setting is more than enough to keep things interesting, and it is hardly the game's only strong suit.

  <em>
   Prey
  </em>
  is not an open-world game in the sense that players can immediately explore the entire map, but they will be able to return to previous areas. Essentially, Arkane created a 3D Metroidvania, and a fantastic one at that.
  <em>
   Prey
  </em>
  is an immersive sim set within Talos 1, a quite large space station that has been taken over by an alien threat.

 <p>
  Talos 1 is a masterclass of world design, with each area telling a story through its environment. The map is interconnected, not only in terms of exploration but also in consistency. Even though the campaign mainly takes place after the station has become a wasteland, it is easy to buy Talos 1 as a real place.

  Before
  <em>
   Shenmue
  </em>
  arrived for the Sega Dreamcast back in 1999, the concept of open-world games was still very much in its infancy. While most other developers were still trying to figure out how to make the leap from 2D to 3D though, Yu Suzuki was instead focused on creating one of the most immersive and realistic video game worlds of all time; and boy, did he succeed.

 <p>
  Set in the late eighties, the game allows players to explore parts of Yokosuka; a small city in Tokyo's Kanagawa prefecture. All the NPCs that they'll encounter are fully voiced and have their own well-fleshed-out identities and daily routines. The game even utilizes historic geographical data to ensure that the in-game weather matches that of the period in which the story takes place.

  serves as a window into life in 1980s Japan and, in its sequel, 1980s Hong Kong,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima

  instead takes players back quite a bit further. Set on the island of Tsushima during Japan's Kamakura period, Sucker Punch Productions' epic action-adventure tells the story of a samurai named Jin and is one of the best-looking games of the PS4 era.

  What makes
  <em>

  all the more impressive is that it was developed by a Western studio. Indeed,

  is not for everyone, but if the game clicks with someone, it might just become one of their favorites. As the title implies, this project is all about simulating the flying experience, and realism is prioritized to quite an extent. That said, the game does provide players with some options to neutralize the difficulty. Alongside a mode revolving around specific flight plans,
  <em>
   Microsoft Fight Simulator
  </em>
  also includes the entirety of Earth as a world map, permitting players to just pick a location and fly there.

  <em>
   Sons of the Forest
  </em>
  is the sequel to 2018's
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  , which is a great survival open-world game in its own right. After a stint in early access, the project made its full debut in 2024, launching in great shape if someone is mainly interested in the survival gameplay loop rather than the story. Once again, players find themselves stranded on a beautiful but hostile island that is home to cannibals (and other natives), who might or might not be aggressive toward the outsider.

  <em>
   Sons of the Forest
  </em>
  is punishing and addictive. While encouraging exploration, the island is also packed to the brim with things that can spell someone's doom, and discovering these dangers often produces a playthrough's most enjoyable moments. Endnight's project is a full-blown survival game set in a challenging and immersive world.

  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  is an ambitious game that drops people into a massive open-world and challenges them to make their own way. After creating a group of starting characters, players are not given much direction, so they must venture out into the unknown as they gradually develop their party's skills through activity. They can build houses, farm goods, and establish settlements, just to name a few things.

 <p>
  "Immersive" is not a synonym for "realistic." Rocksteady's
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games do not pretend to be grounded crime dramas; however, in terms of making players feel like they are the Dark Knight, they are almost flawless. An argument could be made that
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  represents the franchise's peak in open-world design, but the polarizing Batmobile sections can pull someone out of the experience if they do not enjoy them.
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  has no such issue, and the game nails almost everything else.

  After being purposefully arrested and imprisoned, Batman finds himself in the eponymous Arkham City, a large-scale prison that serves as the home of Gotham's worst and most iconic criminals. Armed with an impressive arsenal of tools, DC's Caped Crusader investigates Hugo Strange's Protocol 10, all the while engaging in a plethora of side content. Arkham City's nature means its streets are mostly devoid of NPCs, except for thugs who have a date planned with Batman's fists. While this emptiness would be frustrating in most open-world projects,
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  provides narrative justification for this decision, helping to enhance the immersion.

  Regardless of someone's feelings for Harry's story,
  <em>
   Harry Potter

  's universe is generally regarded as fantastic, and
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy

  enables fans to immerse themselves in a world filled with magic, mystery, and charm. Even if its story is nothing to write home about and everything outside Hogwarts leaves something to be desired, the game nails its aesthetic and recreation of the eponymous academy, and players can spend dozens of hours living out their Wizarding World fantasies.

  Nowadays, the mantra for open-world games seems to be that "bigger is better", but
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  has constantly proven that is not really the case.
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  takes place in two districts called Kamurochō and Sotenbori, neither of which is particularly huge. However, these settings nevertheless effectively complement the main story and also provide players with a playground to participate in entertaining optional content.

  The
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  games blend realism with over-the-top silliness fit for B-movies, and the open-world tends to focus on the former. These maps are packed with arcades, restaurants, and bars, along with containing plenty of side activities and mini-games.

  This one is a different case than all the other games on this list as
  <em>
   Mafia 2

  's open-world is mostly set dressing that does not offer much to do outside of driving from one main mission to the next. This is not a map designed to distract people for hours on end.

  However, in terms of realism,
  <em>
   Mafia 2

  does a fantastic job of recreating the aesthetic of the late 1940s and early '50s. The cars, slums, and shops all come together to craft an immersive landscape soaked in historical accuracy (despite the game taking place in a fictional city), albeit one that cannot be interacted with in any significant way.

 <p>
  Similar to its predecessor,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  is not the prettiest or biggest open-world game on the market. The main storyline is little more than serviceable, and the enemy selection is decent but a touch limited. Most of the map consists of roads, caves, and mountains, which can get repetitive at times. If someone wants to dash through the campaign, they just need to stick to the primary paths and will generally be fine. Despite all that, Capcom's RPG is impressively immersive, and that largely stems from its willingness to force players to take things slow.

 <p>
  While possible with some prep, Dragon's Dogma 2 makes fast-travel inconvenient enough that players will likely restrict it to special case scenarios. Even though making a beeline for the next plot point is a viable way to play the game, doing so is not encouraged; in fact, an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  truly comes alive when quests are ignored in favor of exploring off the beaten path. Before long, players will find themselves running into random encounters that feel like genuine emergent experiences, rather than enemies that are forever pinned to one spot on the map.

  An acquired taste,
  <em>
   Outward
  </em>
  somehow combines many standard ideas found in action RPGs in a way that gives the game an entirely unique feel. For one, this open-world title incorporates survival elements like a hunger meter, and players will need to keep a close eye on these mechanics as they are not especially forgiving.
  <em>
   Outward
  </em>
  also opts against the typical "save the world" premise, focusing instead on a more mundane debt-clearing quest to get players started. This storyline is primarily there to incentivize the main character to begin adventuring, at least until they no longer need a reason to justify heading out into the unknown.

  <em>

  is all about exploration and discovery. Whenever heading out into the world, players need to prepare themselves for their travels as they could quickly find themselves stuck in a dire situation. The map can be accessed in its entirety right from the start, even though some sections are obviously designed for higher-level players.
  <em>
   Outward
  </em>
  has its share of issues, such as underwhelming combat, that could be deal-breakers for some people, but the game's open-ended structure is a huge positive in its favor.

  Piranha Bytes achieved open-world perfection with the original two
  <em>
   Gothic
  </em>
  games, so much so that the developer spent the next two decades trying to recapture the same magic, to mixed results. The first entry is impressive and arguably features the best story in the trilogy, but in terms of open-world design,
  <em>
   Gothic 2
  </em>
  is up there with the genre's best projects. Set on an island, the campaign finds the Nameless Hero going on a quest to defeat the dragons, a journey that will take them all across Khorinis.

 <p>
  The central storyline is nothing all that special, but
  <em>
   Gothic 2
  </em>
  shines in its minute details. NPCs feel like they are leading lives within this world, and they have their own things going on that have nothing to do with the protagonist. Featuring an impressive range of customization and progression options,
  <em>
   Gothic 2
  </em>
  encourages players to craft their ideal adventurer, granting them endless choices in how they fight, live, and explore. Although fairly small by modern standards, Khorinis is a joy to traverse, provided someone does not mind the occasional difficulty spike.

  Rare's
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  garnered a mixed reception upon launch due to a lack of content. More than 5 years later, the pirate-themed game is still going strong, a triumph credited to the developer's commitment to the project and the community's appreciation of that work.
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  can be played solo or as part of a crew, and both iterations have their positives; however, the latter opens up more avenues. The game takes place in a shared world, so groups of players can engage in PvP as they try to sink each other's vessels.

  Although not especially difficult,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  encourages exploration and self-reliance. Treasure seekers will need to read and figure out maps for themselves rather than just follow a waypoint. While on the sea, there is a sense that something could happen at a moment's notice, challenging crews to stay on their guards at all times.

  Square Enix has dabbled in open-world design a few times, but most of these attempts left something to be desired.
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15
  </em>
  serves as a prime example, with the game featuring a beautiful but empty open-world that does not particularly complement the main story.
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  is fairly linear in design, despite incorporating open areas that encourage exploration. In comparison,
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  feels like a full attempt to incorporate an open-world, and it is comfortably the developer's best effort at this type of project.

  Set after AVALANCHE leaves Midgar, the characters (and players) are quickly exposed to an expansive horizon that goes well beyond what they have ever experienced, and the sequel does a fantastic job of emphasizing the sheer freedom in front of them. Many people grew up with the original
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  , and as influential and masterful as that JRPG is, its post-Midgar sections are relatively small-scale.
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  brings these areas to life in all of their modern glory, allowing fans to immerse themselves in locations they knew but had yet to fully experience.

  <em>
   Rust
  </em>
  often gets criticized due to the large number of players who shoot on sight and raid other peoples' bases. Though this kind of behavior can make things difficult for new players, it's arguably exactly what one should expect from a post-apocalyptic wasteland and therefore helps to make the game's open-world a lot more immersive.

  <em>
   Rust

  pose very little threat to those who know what they're doing. The unpredictable nature of humanity, on the other hand, ensures that players need always remain on their toes, while simultaneously making the experience feel a lot more genuine than it would otherwise have been.

  There are plenty of great tower defense games on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but few that are quite as well fleshed out as
  <em>
   Anime Defenders
  </em>
  . The game has a unique and varied selection of units for players to choose from and plenty of challenging levels in which they can show off and hone their skills.

 <p>
  Before they can start pulling for the best units, though,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  players will first need to get their hands on a healthy supply of Gems. They can do this simply by playing the game if they want to, but can speed up the process dramatically by redeeming
  <em>
   Anime Defenders
  </em>
  codes.

  </strong>
  <em>
   With more than a quarter of a million daily players, Anime Defenders is now one of the most popular games on Roblox. This success has led to it passing a ton of impressive milestones in a relatively short amount of time, which has in turn resulted in plenty of new Anime Defenders codes. Players can redeem these codes to get a bunch of free Gems, which they'll need if they want to be able to summon new mythical and legendary units. With this in mind, it's a good idea to check back here daily to avoid missing out on future codes, as some of them can expire pretty quickly.

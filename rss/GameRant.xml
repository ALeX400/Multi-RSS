      <title>Type Soul: How To Change The Color Of Flashstep</title>

  While
  <strong>
   <em>
    Type Soul
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers plenty of abilities and weapons with cool animations, Flashstep doesn't have much in the way of customization, but you can change its color. By doing so, you can leave behind red, purple, turquoise, and many other light flashes, which look extremely impressive. However, obtaining this cosmetic effect comes with significant costs, and getting the desired color depends on luck in this
  <em>
   <strong>
    Roblox
   </strong>
  </em>
  game.

 <p>
  The only way to change the color of Flashstep in
  <em>
   Type Soul
  </em>
  is to buy a reroll of this effect for
  <strong>
   500 Robux
  </strong>
  . After spending this money, you get a random Flashstep color that is different from the base one. Moreover, you canâ€™t choose the color you want, so such a high price seems unfair. However, if that is what you need, here are the steps to change the Flashstep color:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    Type Soul
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Open your inventory and go to the Dev Products tab.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select Flashstep Color Reroll.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click Purchase, then confirm it, after which you will receive a new color.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Regardless of the Flashstep color, or even if you use the base color, you will not gain any benefits or special abilities.
  <strong>
   This effect is purely cosmetic
  </strong>
  and, in rare cases, can even be a little distracting during battle. However, color effects always make gameplay more fun, so this may be just what you need to elevate your gameplay experience.

 <p>
  If you don't like the color you get, you'll have to pay another 500 Robux to try your luck again and find what you want. Unfortunately, there is no way in the game to get a new color for your Flashstep for free.

 <p>
  Flashstep is a skill from the Speed Tree that allows the user to dash forward over a long distance. This move enables you to quickly move from ranged to melee or turn around and retreat. You can use this ability by
  <strong>
   holding Shift and Pressing Q
  </strong>
  , after which you will perform several
  <strong>
   mini-teleportations
  </strong>
  in the chosen direction. The basic animation for you to disappear during this move is pretty boring, but by paying 500 Robux, you can make this one of the most striking skills in your build.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared a Poke Ball based off of Gastly, the iconic Gen 1 Ghost/Poison-type Pokemon. The design captures Gastly's most iconic features and can be open and shut like a real Poke Ball in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series.

 <p>
  Poke Balls are one of the most iconic items to exist in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise. They've changed quite a bit over the years, with only a few different designs existing in the original games, and rarely any outside of the traditional Poke Ball appearing in the early seasons of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  anime. Their use in capturing every Pokemon in the games has cemented them in the minds of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans and even those who aren't that familiar with the series outside of it being a part of pop culture. This has led to some fans designing their own Poke Balls, including Poke Balls based off specific Pokemon.

 <p>
  One such example comes from Big-hairy-axe-boy, who shared their 3D-printed Gastly Poke Ball. The Poke Ball is demonstrated in a short video, where they show it from all angles and open and close the ball, revealing the interior. The exterior of the Poke Ball features Gastly's color scheme of black and purple, its eyes, and its tiny fangs stick out of the top half of the ball and remain visible when it's closed. The Poke Ball also includes a base that's quite impressive, as a large plume of Gastly's gaseous miasma can be seen there.

  According to the OP, this Poke Ball was made out of PLA+ via a 3D printer. The design was created by an artist called linksprintables, who sells the pattern on the Thangs website. Big-hairy-axe-boy downloaded the pattern and printed out the Poke Ball, and for those who are interested, they will be selling the printed version on their Etsy shop.

 <p>
  There have been plenty of Ghost-type Pokemon over the course of the series, and many of them have a large fanbase. However, the popularity of the Ghost/Poison-type trio from Gen 1 nearly can't be overstated. Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar are all extremely popular to this day, receiving fanart, official merchandise, and fan creations like these on a regular basis. Their iconic designs help them to stand out among an ever-increasing roster of Pokemon.

  It would be hard to distance the early days of Pokemon from this particular trio. In addition to Gengar's evolutionary line being extremely important during Ash's attempt to defeat Psychic Gym Leader Sabrina, Gengar was also present from day one on the start menu animation for
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  , facing off against Nidorino or Jigglypuff, depending on the version of the game. This has helped to maintain their legacy, and it's clear many fans still love these three spooky Pokemon.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
  </em>
  has brought 39 new talismans into the Lands Between, giving almost every build some new toys to play with. If you've built your Tarnished around summoning spirits then you have a new Talisman to look forward to in the Dried Bouquet Talisman.

  Summoning Spirit players will also have 19 new spirits to choose from in the DLC. While it'll be difficult to stop using the beloved Mimic Tear or other powerful summons in the base game, changing out your summon to something that synergizes a little better with the Bouquet Talisman could add a new way to play the game. It's possible to find the Dried Bouquet talisman fairly early in your journey through the Shadow of the Erdtree, and once you do, your Summoning build will have a new playstyle for you to enjoy.

  The Dried Bouquet is a new Talisman in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  that
  <strong>
   increases your damage whenever a spirit you summoned dies

  . The buff lasts about 30 seconds and increases your damage by 20% when it activates. Be aware,
  <strong>
   this buff will not stack when multiple spirits die and instead refresh the timer.
  </strong>
  The Dried Bouquet Talisman's weight is .3.

  <strong>
   This talisman is best used with spirit summons that summon multiple spirits so you can prolong your buff for as long as possible.

  The best spirit ash to use with this is the

   Greatshield Soldier Ashes
  </span>
  since it summons 5 durable bodies per summon. Even if they do start dying, each one usually has a more staggered death which can extend the Dried Bouquet's buff timer.

  Alternatively, single body spirit summons like

   Stormhawk Deenh Ashes

  can still be useful since
  <strong>
   they give a useful buff when they're summoned, distract the enemy, then activate Dried Bouquet when they die.

   Nightmaiden &amp; Swordstress Puppets Ashes
  </span>
  also work well since they tend to seperate from each other during the fight, leading to them dying at different times and refreshing the Dried Bouquet buff timer with little overlap.

 <ol>
  <li>
   Headout the Northward door and up the stairs to your right
  </li>
  <li>
   Take the stairs to your left and immediately head right at the top of the stairs. You should be running behind a destroyed wall.
  </li>
  <li>
   Continue heading straight and turn left when you reach the wall.
  </li>
  <li>
   When you reach the next wall across from the sewage, turn left.
  </li>
  <li>
   Before you reach the enemy sitting by the waterfall, and after your run past the wall on your right, turn right and head into that doorway.
  </li>
  <li>
   Climb up the ladder, head out the exit, and go up the stairs. (If you have the shortcut unlocked,
   <strong>
    start at the Belurat, Tower Settlement Site of Grace, head up the elevator and start on this step)
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   At the top of the stairs, head to the left (west).
  </li>
  <li>
   There will be some ruins to your right. Run past those ruins and look for a collapsed part of the wall. Jump over this collapsed section, and jump to the other side of these ruins.
  </li>
  <li>
   Head into the hallway and be careful of the enemies hiding around the corner.
  </li>
  <li>
   Continue through the hallway, turn right at Miquella's Cross and when you run outside the door, turn left.
  </li>
  <li>
   There will be an altar just ahead of you with the Dried Bouquet in it.
  </li>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dynasty Warriors
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a long-lasting series, having debuted in 1997. It was a fighting game spun off from Koei's strategy game,
  <em>
   Romance of the Three Kingdoms
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  which was
  <em>
  </em>
  based on a Chinese novel focusing on the end of the Han dynasty. However, the series really hit its stride with
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors 2
  </em>
  . This sequel took what was originally a fighting game, and transformed it into a hack-and-slash beat-em-up where a singular warrior could take on hundreds of foes with their sheer power. This mechanic, combined with the free-roaming elements of the game, made a successful formula that produced numerous sequels and spin-offs.

 <p>
  Many of these spin-offs were based on third-party properties, starting with
  <em>
   Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage
  </em>
  , a
  <em>
   Warriors-
  </em>
  style game making use of characters originating from the
  <em>
   Fist of the North Star
  </em>
  manga. Since then, numerous Japanese properties have been given a similar spin-off, such as
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  . Many of these games also received sequels of their own. With the continued longevity of the greater
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  franchise, it seems these spin-offs also won't be going anywhere soon. Here are some franchises that deserve the
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  treatment.

 <p>
  As mentioned above, there are multiple licensed
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  franchises based on Nintendo properties. In a way, Kirby could be a fairly unique choice to focus on for such a game. With a variety of possible enemies to translate over, Kirby could adhere to the strategy of his previous games, and take on numerous forms during a battle based on enemies he inhales, with each having a signature combo attack.

 <p>
  Other notable
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  characters like King Dedede, Meta Knight, and perhaps even Bandana Waddle Dee, could also be playable characters. Meta Knight in particular seems like he could pull off some pretty devastating combo attacks. However, these additional fighters should not be as huge as the average
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  roster (preferably sitting somewhere closer to
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors
  </em>
  ), as a greater amount of focus should go towards Kirby's various forms. If this game were pulled off correctly, it could be a fun, unique addition to the catalog of licensed
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  spinoffs.

 <p>
  The SNK series
  <em>
   Samurai Shodown
  </em>
  is a pioneer in weapon-based fighting games. The series is rife with anachronisms ranging from mythical monsters to a Western outlaw with a Winchester rifle. It has accumulated an incredible cast of characters in its several decades of existence. With conventional combatants like Haohmaru, the flagship fighter with a sword that can cause tornados; the priestess whose moveset makes heavy use of her hawk, Mamahaha; and the gigantic Texan ninja with a surprising amount of stealth. As such, many characters have attacks that could translate well into an open-world setting.

 <p>
  Although an exact ideal antagonist is hard to pinpoint, the game has a variety of villains, from which lesser foes can be extrapolated. Whether it's the corrupting influence of the demon Ambrosia, an evil sorcerer known as "Yuga the Destroyer," or perhaps a more mortal foe like the military mastermind, Golba, there's plenty of evil to go around.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  The only potentially offputting aspect of the affair would be the prospective spinoff's name, as
  <em>
   Samurai Warriors
  </em>
  already exists as a sister series to
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  would fit like a glove with the
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  mechanics on the merits of the characters' power alone. Many of its weaker characters (such as Krillin and Tien) are already capable of taking on numerous enemies at once. Its strongest characters (including Goku, Vegeta, and the various God-tier fighters) are capable of wiping out entire planets.

  With antagonists such as the Red Ribbon Army, the Freiza Force, and Babidi's unnamed organization, there are many potential characters to fulfill the archetypal grunt roles of various

  This fact, alongside the series' numerous iconic attacks, already maps out several potential ways in which the game could play out. Like many established
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games, it could be an original story, making use of the various available characters from throughout the franchise.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  With the
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  spin-off franchise,
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors
  </em>
  laying the groundwork for what a shonen
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  game could be, a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball-
  </em>
  themed
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  certainly could prove entertaining.

  The greater
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  series is shown to maintain an audience even when it comes to spin-offs. Whether it's one of the numerous RPG spin-off games, the
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  games, or even just games focusing on characters from other connected series. This diversity leaves several angles from which to go about creating a spin-off.

  Bits and pieces of a potential blueprint are mapped out in the form of various abilities several characters have shown throughout the years, in part accumulated from their various games. Whether it's
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Donkey Kong letting foes have it with both barrels, Luigi making good use of his poltergust, or even something simpler like Mario flooding foes with flames, the potential for field-clearing finishers persists throughout.

 <p>
  The games also feature a variety of generic enemies to build up the forces with, as well as definite boss units, generally appearing in Bowser's army. While the variability of the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  series leaves an exact shape hard to predict, a
  <em>

  spinoff could be an interesting prospect for the series.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  is a series that has existed since the late 80s. It has since expanded into numerous mediums, including shows, movies, and radio dramas, among others. It tends to contain a variety of different characters within each installment, making which cast to draw from hard to determine. However, to some extent, a blueprint for such a crossover exists within
  <em>
   Dissidia
  </em>
  , a spinoff fighting game series, which features a few characters from each
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game to create a substantial cast.

  Like other

  spin-offs from licensed RPGs (such as
  <em>

  and
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  ),
  <em>
   Dissidia
  </em>
  also contains RPG elements within its gameplay, allowing for some synergy to the respective games' roots even when the exact genre is different.
  <em>
   Dissidia
  </em>
  's newest installment,
  <em>
   NT
  </em>
  , emphasizes a 3v3 system that lets AI control two characters on the player's side. This mechanic is similar to many
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  games where computer-controlled allies act alongside the player in many scenarios.

  A skilled fan of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise shows off some terrifying artwork they made of
  <em>
  </em>
  Fuecoco, the Fire-type starter Pokemon from Generation 9. Though Fuecoco is normally well-known for its adorable and charming appearance, this unsettling rendition of the popular character from the massively successful
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series really puts the "monster" in "Pocket Monster."

  If there's one thing the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise is known for having, outside of Poke Balls and evil villain teams, it's cute mascot Pokemon that broadly appeal to children and adults alike. Throughout the 28-year-run of Game Freak's mega-hit series, there have been plenty of adorable Pokemon that have caught the attention of fans worldwide. Some of these were introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , the latest mainline installment in the titular franchise. There's no shortage of wholesome-looking Pokemon in this game, from Greavard and Cetoddle to Flittle and Sprigatito. One of the most well-known of these
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  characters, though, is the Fire Croc Pokemon Fuecoco, which has maintained its popularity thanks to its charming, friendly appearance.

 <p>
  A recent piece of Fuecoco fanart, however, sucks out all the friendliness from the Fire-type Pokemon's character design. A Reddit user named ikea_meat_ball made a post on the r/Pokemon subreddit showing off a 3D model of Fuecoco they made that looks like it's straight out of a horror movie. The Redditor's artwork takes some major creative liberties by drastically altering Fuecoco's design and making the innocent-looking Pokemon have a menacing appearance, complete with sharp teeth, human-like hands, and a skull for a head. Normally, Fuecoco is one of the cutest Pokemon in
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , but this unnatural depiction of the Fire Croc Pokemon makes it look more fearsome than Guzzlord or Gyarados.

  Despite its rather disturbing nature, commenters on Reddit responded favorably to ikea_meat_ball's Fuecoco artwork, with some Reddit users calling the artwork "awesome." A Redditor by the name of sleepylizard52, however, questioned some aspects of the
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  starter Pokemon's unsettling redesign, with them asking ikea_meat_ball why they decided to give Fuecoco "5 fingers and so many teeth." The artist simply responded by saying that their fanart "wouldn't be nightmare fuel otherwise."

  The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community is no stranger to coming up with frightening renditions of popular creatures from the franchise. Just recently, a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan artist created a terrifying version of Orthworm, the Steel-type worm-like Pokemon from
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  . Meanwhile, some fans have drawn horrific recreations of
  <strong>
   Pokemon
  </strong>
  like Drifblim, Mewtwo, and Gengar, among many others.

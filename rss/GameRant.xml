 <p>
  In the world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  , nothing is ever as it seems. Many games will tease players with small hints of information about the story throughout their playthrough while keeping them in the dark about the intentions and identity of certain characters. For a character to be mysterious, it doesn't mean they need to be off-screen and missing most of the time, but instead, someone who simply remains tight-lipped about who exactly they are, and why they are supporting or opposing the protagonist.

 <p>
  Even some of the franchise's most beloved characters still have an aura of mystery surrounding them that Capcom has yet to answer for. Whether or not more context about these individuals will come out in the future is uncertain as of right now, but knowing Capcom, there will surely come a time when they shed some light on at least a few of these shady characters.

 <p>
  Though players are never going to pass up the chance to buy some new weapons from the Merchant in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the question still stands; why exactly is this cloaked figure helping Leon? Another question many fans have been asking since the original game is how the Merchant even manages to move around the village, castle, and island so quickly, to the point where he's always ahead of Leon.

 <p>
  One popular theory that could explain all of this is that the Merchant is actually Luis' grandfather, who is revealed to have known the area pretty well. If this were true, then maybe the Merchant is using tunnels to be one step ahead of the protagonist, but even if that were so, why he has such a staggering number of weapons on him remains unanswered.

 <p>
  Throughout the entirety of Jake and Sherry's campaign in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the unlikely duo is hunted down by a malicious behemoth simply known as Ustanak. There are files in the game that reveal this mutated hunk of flesh was once a human being who volunteered to be injected with the C-virus under the command of Carla.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, why this individual was so eager to be infected, and who they were as a human being, is unclear. Judging by the way they act as the Ustanak, it's presumed they were already fairly violent, but by looking at their mechanical arm, which they apparently built for themselves, there's also the chance they could have been a bright inventor or mechanic in their past life too.

 <p>
  At the beginning of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 0
   </em>
  </strong>
  , all players are told about Billy is that he's a wanted criminal who has seemingly been on a killing spree. When the man himself shows up though, he neither confirms nor denies this claim, and instead, talks in subtle riddles for much of his journey with Rebecca.

 <p>
  This already made him unexpectedly mysterious, but what has also added a lot of intrigue to him is where exactly he ends up after the events of his debut game. Though he can be seen aimlessly wandering off into a forest, some fans have suspected he was ambushed by zombies, while others suggest he fought them off to return in a future installment. Ultimately, Capcom didn't give much away about Billy or his past, which has certainly sparked a lot of speculation online.

  By the time Ethan comes face to face with each of the four Lords in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil Village
   </em>
  </strong>
  , he ends up learning quite a lot about them, but Beneviento is by far the most mysterious of them all. Rather than confronting Ethan personally, Donna instead uses her doll Angie as a step-in, who proceeds to mock Ethan with child-like games.

  While players can therefore see a single picture of Donna hung up in her estate, the woman herself only makes a very brief appearance as she's being killed. Aside from a single document that gives subtle hints about her backstory, and how she was found by Mother Miranda, not much else is known about the unnerving puppeteer.

  Providing a straight answer is more or less impossible for Luis during the first few hours of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4

  . Though he does initially seem like an ally of Leon's, it's also clear that the witty Spaniard is hiding something else up his sleeve which, for a good chunk of the game, he's unwilling to talk about.

 <p>
  In the original game, Luis takes these secrets to the grave with him, remaining an enigma right up until his final moments. The Remake, however, does see Luis eventually spill the beans concerning his involvement in developing the Parasite, and his involvement with Umbrella, but he still keeps people guessing for a good while until then.

  Despite appearing in several games, Ada's end goal is still very unclear. One lingering question that arose in the original
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is who Ada is really working for. Sure, she claims to be an FBI agent in the second game and then claims to work for Wesker in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  , but her devious nature implies that Ada has a much bigger plan in mind.

 <p>
  Her mysterious character often comes at odds with Leon, who is constantly guessing whether he can trust her or not. Considering the popularity of Ada among the fanbase, there's a good chance her character will be fleshed out more in future installments, but until then, one can only guess what she's up to.

 <p>
  Similarly to the Merchant from
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  , the Duke will show up from time to time in
  <em>
   Village
  </em>
  to supply Ethan with not just weapons, but also vital information on how to find his daughter Rose. How he knows all of this is left unclear, alongside his reasons for even helping Ethan in the first place.

 <p>
  What adds more mystery to the character is how he miraculously shows up near the end to save Ethan's life just as he was seemingly killed by Mother Miranda. Some fans have theorized that this could indicate that the Duke is some sort of guardian angel who is assisting Ethan in his last few days of being alive, and as outlandish as that might seem, it would fit right in with the absurdity of
  <em>
   Village's
  </em>
  story and characters.

 <p>
  Over the years, small tidbits of information on HUNK have been revealed, but this character is still as mysterious as they come. What has been made clear is that HUNK was an Umbrella agent who is widely known as the "Grim Reaper" due to how he would be able to go on suicide missions and somehow come out the other end still in one piece.

 <p>
  However, pretty much everything else about this mask-wearing badass is unknown, despite him becoming a fan favorite. Capcom is aware of this, and will therefore drop him into scenes here or there to tease players. For example, HUNK shows up in the tutorial area of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Operation Raccoon City
   </em>
  </strong>
  and even gets his own speedrun mode in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2 Remake
  </em>
  . How he became such a skilled mercenary, the world may never know.

  When it was announced that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
   </em>
  </strong>
  would include not only a complete visual overhaul, but also several new pieces of story and gameplay content, fans of the much-loved JRPG were excited to learn exactly what that content would be. Now that players have gotten their hands on the game, they have likely noticed that the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game, which can make it difficult to find. In this guide, we'll examine
  <strong>
   all the new content in
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Quest 3 Remake

  </em>
  , and for the content that is tied to specific locations, we'll show you
  <strong>
   where that new content can be found
  </strong>
  .

  you will be treated to several new fully-voiced cutscenes. We will explore the exact locations below.

While there was technically a Monster Arena in the original, the new arena is completely overhauled.

  The
  <strong>
   Monster Wrangler
  </strong>
  is a brand-new vocation in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Quest 3 Remake
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  This class is incredibly powerful, and works in conjunction with the monsters you recruit in the overworld. And while every vocation can recruit at least some monsters from the field, the Monster Wrangler can automatically recruit every monster you encounter. As you collect more and more monsters, the wrangler will unlock powerful new abilities that target every enemy in an encounter.

  Players can add a Monster Wrangler to their party as soon as they have access to Patty's Party Planning Place. Returning players who know
  <em>
   DQIII
  </em>
  's systems well should be able to use them with no issues. New players may want to wait until they learn the combat mechanics and level up their Hero. Old and new players alike will find a lot to like about the new vocation, and should both consider adding them to their party.

  Over the course of
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 Remake
  </em>
  , players will be following in the footsteps of Ortega, the main protagonist's father. And while Ortega's mission – and it's ambiguous result – loom large over the original release, the developers clearly saw his journey as a prime place to expand the game's story. As such, there are multiple locations where new cutscenes and vocal performances have been added to provide more insight into Ortega's adventure.

  <strong>
   Mur:
  </strong>
  There are several locations that trigger new cutscenes in
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 Remake.
  </em>
  The most important takes place in
  <strong>
   Mur,
  </strong>
  a small town in the frozen tundras found on the central-eastern edge of the western continent. Once in town, head to the eastern side of the Item/Weapon Shop and you'll see a large opening you can enter. Once inside, you'll see an old man with an exclamation point over his head. Speak to him to begin the cutscene.

   More 'Words of Wisdom' - there are now three copies of the book that changes party members to the Sage vocation. The first is at the Tower of Transcendence, the second is in Rimuldar, and is found in a chest of drawers in the northernmost building. The third is at Cloudgate Citadel.
  </li>
  <li>
   New Spells:
   <strong>
    Zin
   </strong>
   has been added, a lesser version of Zing and Kazing, which allows players to use spells to resurrect party members earlier.
  </li>
  <li>
   More Mini-Medals, and Mini-Medal Rewards: There are several more Mini-Medals spread throughout the world, with a new total of 130.
  </li>
  <li>
   'Secret Spots' - look for odd-looking locations in the overworld, locations that stand out in some way. These will often be Secret Spots. These locations will include treasure, Mini-Medals, and sometimes friendly monsters.
  </li>
  <li>
   New sparkling treasure locations: All around the overworld, players will now encounter sparkling treasure caches. Interact with these to find a wide variety of items, including rare weapons like
   <strong>
    Zombiesbane.

      Open-world games may lack fast travel, posing challenges for completion and exploration.

      Games like Batman: Arkham Knight and Jak 3 would benefit from fast travel options for collecting hundreds of items.

 <p>
  Games set in an open world have been a staple for over twenty years now and one of the most useful abilities to have is fast-travel. Whether it's exploring a sprawling city or an alien planet, having the ability to simply teleport back to a hub world or a base of operations is nice for those who don't feel like backtracking.

 <p>
  With that said, occasionally, developers create games that do not feature fast travel. It may not ruin the game by any means, but gamers would have appreciated to at least have the option and they would prove to be vexing at times when trying to complete certain quests or just simply exploring to find collectibles.

 <p>
  Part of what makes
  <strong>
   <em>
    State Of Decay 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  so thrilling is that it doesn't hold the player's hands when it comes to surviving a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested open world. It forces players, both solo and co-op, to scavenge and survive however they can, and to its credit, the idea is effective in that it makes the zombies feel like a genuine threat to endure.

 <p>
  That doesn't stop players from wishing there was an unlockable way to quickly teleport back to their camp in
  <em>
   State Of Decay 2
  </em>
  . Thankfully, vehicles can make the long treks back to camp better, but even that can lead to arduous zombie encounters and other fuel struggles going across the six open-world maps.

 <p>
  Using portals, players can teleport from a space station to their base in
  <strong>
   <em>
    No Man's Sky
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but those don't help when exploring the many massive alien planets. If a player is on the opposite side of the planet from their base, there is no convenient way to get back to it if there is no way to get to the ship, which is part of the challenge of being a survival game.

 <p>
  Still, a craftable gadget that allows someone to teleport to their base would be appreciated. Thankfully, starships are pretty fast in
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  , but they are not always able to be called and sometimes the trek back to the ship can be just as dangerous as adventuring outward to whatever quest the player was up to.

 <p>
  Parkour is the main gimmick of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dying Light
   </em>
  </strong>
  games, so it makes sense that the developers wanted players to hone their traversal skills. With that said, it is a good thing that
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  added a fast travel system, as the first game direly needed it at points due to the massive map with no other way to get around other than running, jumping, and climbing.

 <p>
  On the one hand, it helps make the infected in
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  some of the scariest zombies to be chased by. On the other hand, free-running to opposite sides of the map depending on the mission is taxing on a player's patience, when the sequel proves that the fast travel does not take away from the well-crafted parkour gameplay.

 <p>
  Fast travel would have been most helpful in the post-story portion in which players are trying to beat every side quest in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  . The quest that needed the most would have been the arduous process of collecting every Riddler trophy and solving his every challenge, especially when it came to backtracking to interior levels like the Arkham Knight HQ and the movie studios.

  In Jak's third adventure, exploring a massive open world, fast travel would seem like a logical addition.

  , however, stuck to the same formula that requires the player to traverse every inch of the world for collectibles, either on foot or in a vehicle, which is no less fun, but like in a lot of 3D platformers, the backtracking gets to be a little much if looking just for one single Precursor Orb.

  To a degree, the Metroidvania-esque approach that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes renders the game unfit for fast travel, but that still makes it frustrating to experience. From the customization of the main character, Cal Kestis, to the Soulslike lightsaber combat, it does many things well, but even die-hard fans of the game disliked the lack of fast travel, hence why it was added in the sequel.

  Certain chests can only be accessed by the end of

Even with a few shortcuts, there is no convenient way to get through the planets without arduous treks through platforming challenges and puzzles, and the same goes for heading back to Cal's ship, the Mantis.

   <em>
    Vampyr

  </strong>
  is the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  of vampire games, with Jonathan Reid being one of the best vampiric protagonists. As fun as it is to freely roam the city of London in 1918, one of the biggest drawbacks to
  <em>
   Vampyr
  </em>
  is the backtracking through different districts as they are quite large with many alleyways and streets.

  If Focus Entertainment and Dontnod ever made a sequel, it could feature some vampire ability for players to teleport with.
  <em>
   Vampyr
  </em>
  essentially forces the player to do everything possible in one night before progressing. It's considered one of the few flaws with

  because there are safehouses throughout London that could have acted as fast travel points.

  A creative
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has transformed their Titan into C-3PO, one of the characters from
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  . Like the Disney franchise,
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  tells a story that takes place on different planets and features a cast of memorable characters, such as Cayde-6, Uldren Sov, and Mara Sov.

 <p>
  When it comes to
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  characters, it's hard for even the youngest fans not to know the charismatic droid duo of C-3PO and R2-D2. Created to interact with organics, C-3PO became known for his polite and ever-concerned personality, which made him the protagonist of countless panic attacks. But the character is also remembered for his faithful companion R2-D2, a blue droid that became famous for his loyalty and courage, and for having an adventurous and independent attitude that put him at the center of key moments in the galaxy's history many times.

 <p>
  C-3PO and R2-D2 have made several appearances in games, and this time the duo have been given another one by Reddit user Chobwokk, with a
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  twist. Their Titan has been transformed into C-3PO with a golden armor set. The three points of the build that stand out the most are the head, shoulders, and legs, whose equipment is significantly close to the appearance of the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  character.

  Sharing the details of the set they created, they achieved a golden hue similar to that of C-3PO using the shaders called Calus's Treasured and Calus's Shadow, two rewards for doing the Leviathan raid on Prestige difficulty. The pieces of equipment, meanwhile, are the default head ornament, Righteous Gauntlets, N7 Plate, Forget Machinist Greaves, and Prodigal Mark. Not to leave their Titan alone, the OP has given their Ghost's shell tones of blue and white, turning the Titan's companion into a version of R2-D2.

  The player's post is one of several creative ideas from the community for Festival of the Lost, the
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  event that celebrates Halloween every year. This year's event started on October 29 and will end on November 19, so players still have a chance to get the rewards they haven't yet obtained. But after the event is over, Bungie's game will continue to be buzzing with activity, as shown in the stream revealing Act 2 of Episode: Revenant, and the announcement of the collaboration between
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  and
  <em>
   Street Fighter

  , bringing items inspired by Capcom characters.

 <p>
  There are a lot of fantastic games to play on
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium
  </strong>
  , with many of them offering engaging single-player storylines and experiences. Sometimes, though, it's more fun to enjoy a PS Plus game with friends, and it's even better if that title can be played locally. Online games have made massive strides in recent years, but it's hard to deny how entertaining it is to play through a riveting cooperative adventure with friends in the same room.

  Although they might not be the standard anymore, local co-op games are still fairly common, and Sony's subscription service has quite a few projects that support the feature. These titles cover a wide range of genres and gameplay styles, so there should be something for most players. Here are the
  <strong>
   best local co-op PS Plus games

    Updated November 16, 2024 by Mark Sammut:
   </strong>
   With another month roughly halfway through, Sony has announced the PS Plus Extra and Premium games for November. As always, the lineup is quite diverse and includes a few multiplayer and online co-op options (Chivalry 2 and Dying Light 2, respectively). The selection also has plenty of single-player stories that should be able to keep subscribers busy for a while.

  <em>
   Overcooked! 2
  </em>
  is one of the best local co-op games of the last few years, so the announcement that it would leave PS Plus Extra in November 2024 was disappointing. However, Sony had a plan and revealed that
  <em>
   Overcooked! All You Can Eat!
  </em>
  would essentially replace it. This release contains
  <em>
   Overcooked!
  </em>
  , its sequel, and their DLC, making it by far the most complete option. Basically,
  <em>
   Overcooked! 2
  </em>
  was upgraded.

  So, what is this franchise about? Well, it is about cooking. Putting aside fantastical stories that add an element of silliness and drive to the campaigns of both titles,
  <em>
   Overcooked!
  </em>
  is ultimately a restaurant party game where players have to complete orders and keep customers satisfied. That might sound straightforward, but like a real restaurant, things get complicated quickly. Before long, chefs will be drowning in requests as they try to navigate a bizarre kitchen while hopefully keeping their cool. Most co-op games bring people together, but some can break them apart.
  <em>
   Overcooked!
  </em>
  can inspire both.

  PS Plus Premium exclusives tend to be overshadowed by their Extra counterparts, which makes sense since the latter are usually fairly modern. For example, August 2024's Extra lineup included
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  , two fantastic "recent-ish" games that can consume someone's life for a good while. However, the month's Premium classics were arguably just as exciting, solely for one franchise:
  <em>
   TimeSplitters
  </em>
  . Too many years have passed since Free Radical's trilogy was last spotlighted, and all three entries are now readily available on the PS4 and PS5.

  All three titles support 2-player local co-op, allowing their campaigns to be experienced alongside a friend. Generally speaking,
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  are considered to be far superior to their predecessor, to the point of the original game being relegated to something of a footnote in the IP's legacy. Honestly, players can just jump into the sequel and skip the first; however,
  <em>
   TimeSplitters
  </em>
  is a charming time capsule of its era. Its gameplay also feels quite different from its sequels since levels emphasize speed above everything else. So, while not perfect, it is worth a try.

  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  hold up as two of the greatest FPS games of all time, and they are still an absolute blast to play through. Their campaigns are great in single-player, but they do shine slightly brighter in co-op. The gunplay's chaotic nature is amplified by having a second user along for the ride, and the maps are consistently fantastic in both games.
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  has the superior story mode, but
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  arguably has the better gameplay.

 <p>
  While not supported by every entry, Bandai Namco's
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  franchise is generally a reliable pick for co-op. PS Plus Premium subscribers have access to two of the most beloved games in the series:
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  . The former is rightfully hailed as a classic of the genre, and the PS2 release cemented the IP as an all-time great. PS Plus has the 2023 remaster, which does not offer much more than a boost to the visuals and a few minor tweaks. As this iteration is largely the same as the 2003 version (or, more accurately, the PS3 HD rerelease), the game can feel antiquated by today's standards, and a complete newcomer might struggle to get through the campaign's fairly slow opening few hours. Nevertheless,
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  offers a great story and even better characters, along with a real-time combat system that supports a plethora of playstyles. Co-op also fixes one of the title's biggest shortcomings: fairly dumb partner AI.

 <p>
  Alternatively, players can try
  <em>
   Tales of Vesperia: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  , which has arguably aged better as a complete package than
  <em>
   Symphonia
  </em>
  . Although the games do not have extremely different battle systems,
  <em>
   Vesperia
  </em>
  is notably faster and more responsive, creating an overall superior experience. Its cel-shaded visuals have also aged like fine wine, allowing both the 2008 original and its 2019 iteration to be pleasing to the eye. The story is also top-notch, and it is led by perhaps the best protagonist in the entire
  <em>
   Tales
  </em>
  franchise.

  Regardless of which game people pick, they can look forward to a lengthy action JRPG with a well-implemented co-op. That said, co-op is limited to combat.

  was always great, but it used to be kind of lonely. However, in 2024, Massive Monster released a free update that, among other things, introduced a 2-player co-op for the campaign. Now, everyone's favorite cult-leading lamb does not have to take on the responsibilities of guiding followers and clearing dungeons on their own. It can be a team effort, with the lamb being able to summon a goat.

 <p>
  Narratively,
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  does not directly reference the co-op element, so the feature does not add much from that perspective. However, a second player should help extend the replay value of the dungeon runs, which might have started to feel old for people who have been leading a cult since 2022.
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  's local co-op is easy to access, and it even includes a few unique tarot cards and relics.

  Beat 'em ups really are made for co-op, and
  <em>
   TMNT: Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  exemplifies that. Inspired by the franchise's classic entries in the genre, the 2022 release is a colorful and challenging throwback that should satisfy fans of
  <em>
   Turtles in Time
  </em>
  along with newcomers who never stepped into arcades. For the most part, the campaign follows a fairly standard structure for a beat 'em up, including offering a myriad of playable characters: the Turtles themselves, Splinter, April, and Casey Jones. More importantly, each character has a unique moveset and strengths that set them apart from their peers. This versatility significantly enhances the project's replayability since a single playthrough probably won't take somebody longer than a couple of hours.

  In co-op, friends can team up to take on the Foot Clan, and they will do more than just share a screen.
  <em>
   Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  incorporates a couple of multiplayer-focused mechanics that reward co-op play, including special 2-player attacks. Along with local co-op, the game also supports online multiplayer for up to 6 participants, and it is possible to mix and match the two versions to fully stack a lineup.

  <em>
   Sackboy: A Big Adventure
  </em>
  is a delightful 3D platformer, a genre that is not overrepresented on the PS5. As the
  <em>
   LittleBigPlanet
  </em>
  spin-off can largely be experienced in single-player, any solo runners will have generally a good time; however, the game not only supports local and online co-op but occasionally emphasizes it. While most of the campaign's levels are designed for solitary players, there are a few stages specifically created for co-op. These do not have to be completed to get to the end of the campaign, but they do make the process a lot easier.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  While these stages are co-op driven, the rest of the campaign can also be tackled by four players.
  <em>
   Sackboy
  </em>
  uses a drop-in, drop-out multiplayer system, permitting friends to jump in whenever they feel like it. This method complements the game's relaxed tone and makes it perfect for short sessions since players do not have to commit to completing a full playthrough.

  Vanillaware does not create bad games, and
  <em>
   Dragon's Crown
  </em>
  ranks comfortably among the decorated developer's greatest achievements. Originally released for the PS3 and Vita, the game eventually made its way to the PS4 in the form of a Pro edition, and this version is on PS Plus Premium. Featuring six playable classes,
  <em>
   Dragon's Crown
  </em>
  blends side-scrolling beat 'em up action with RPG systems, crafting an experience that can be deeply addictive despite being ultimately quite repetitive. Players will find themselves playing through the same nine levels as they gradually level up their characters (and take on higher difficulty levels), and the combat system is more than good enough to keep things interesting for a long while.

 <p>
  In terms of co-op support, four friends can team up to take on the campaign's challenges. When the full playable roster is used, the on-screen action can get a touch chaotic and overwhelming; nevertheless, co-op is a positive addition to
  <em>
   Dragon's Crown
  </em>
  . The game is great solo, but bringing a friend along can make the grind less exhausting.

  An action-RPG roguelike,
  <em>
   Children of Morta
  </em>
  follows the Bergson family as they crawl their way through randomly-generated dungeons. Featuring seven playable characters that each feel unique, players have a wide range of duos they can try out, and they will need to experiment since swapping between family members is required.

  Capcom's
  <em>
   Lost Planet
  </em>
  is such a bizarre series. The franchise produced three main games and a spin-off, all of which are fairly distinct from each other. Even though the console
  <em>
   Lost Planet
  </em>
  trilogy was all released on basically the same hardware and within a span of about 7 years, they vary so greatly in terms of strengths, weaknesses, and tone that they cannot be recommended as a whole. If someone is seeking a single-player experience, they should check out the original
  <em>
   Lost Planet
  </em>
  ; however, if co-op is someone's poison, they should look no further than
  <em>
   Lost Planet 2
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Lost Planet 3
  </em>
  is also a game that exists.

  Supporting local split-screen and 4-player online co-op, the sequel was clearly designed to be played with friends. The campaign is split into missions that contain a few basic objectives, although they are mainly there to give players something to kill while wearing awesome mech suits.
  <em>
   Lost Planet 2
  </em>
  emphasizes teamwork to an extent, especially during its massive and awe-inspiring boss battles. Even all these years later, the latter encounters are still visually impressive.

  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's shadow looms far and wide over the isometric action RPG genre. While Blizzard's franchise might not be on PS Plus,
  <em>
   Vikings: Wolves of Midgard
  </em>
  serves as a respectable alternative. Except for its Norse influences, a setting that was more unique in 2017 prior to the launch of
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Vikings
  </em>
  doesn't deviate too far from the beaten path for this type of game. The kill, loot, and recycle loop continues to be repeated for a reason – it works.

 <p>
  PS Plus has a couple of
  <em>
   Earth Defense Force
  </em>
  projects, and they are all acquired tastes. Sandlot's franchise translates monster b-movies into games, delivering a straightforward, silly, but highly enjoyable experience. While not completely devoid of variety, most missions boil down to "kill every insect" as hundreds of these big buggers crowd the streets and crawl over buildings. Even though the visuals are far from great,
  <em>
   EDF
  </em>
  is relentlessly charming, as long as somebody goes in with realistic expectations. These titles offer mindless fun, and that's largely it. Do not go in expecting a great story, very deep gameplay, or a wide assortment of character customization options. Just pick a class, try out some different weapons, and shoot everything that moves. Also, mecha.

  Although viable solo,
  <em>
   EDF 5
  </em>
  can get repetitive very quickly when players are taking on the alien insectoid hordes as a one-soldier army; fortunately, the franchise tends to prioritize multiplayer. Along with 4-player online support, 2-player local co-op is available, and the introduction of a secondary user really elevates the overall experience. Co-op lets the class system shine and increases the difficulty slightly, requiring a slightly more tactical approach in the process. Not every name needs to be complex; sometimes, nothing hits the mark like blasting away an army of ants.

  House House's
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game
  </em>
  is a silly but charming game that puts players in charge of a goose (or two geese in local co-op) as they steadily try to complete tasks. More often than not, this process involves being a nuisance to the townsfolk, and the indie title is a lot of fun. Beyond the addition of a second goose, the game does not change too much since the campaign's objectives remain the same. Players can have a blast working together as they annoy the furious NPCs.

  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  and its sequel are both relentlessly charming smaller-scale action RPGs, but only the latter supports 2-player co-op. More importantly, the campaign was likely designed to be played with a friend, to the point of both the story and cover image showcasing the dual protagonists (this time, the feline partners with a dog to create perhaps the most adorable pair of heroes in gaming). For the most part, the conventional good vs evil story plays things safe, mostly serving as an excuse to send players on a joyous adventure through towns, wastelands, and dungeons. En route, they will face off against an impressive range of monsters, engaging in combat that has more depth than might initially appear to be the case.

  Now,
  <em>
   Cat Quest 2
  </em>
  is a perfectly fine solo RPG that allows players to swap back and forth between the two protagonists; however, an AI partner is seldom as useful as another human, and that is mostly true for this game. In terms of difficulty,
  <em>
   Cat Quest 2
  </em>
  delivers enough of a punch to not bore experienced players (at least when played in Normal Mode), while also being accessible to children who might be taking their first steps into the world of gaming.

  <em>
   Magicka 2
  </em>
  is a power fantasy in the sense that it gives players the ammunition to create spells that could impress the likes of Gandalf, Shang Tsung, and Doctor Strange. While players are given all the tools they might need, executing them is hardly easy as it requires carefully pressing the right buttons to combine magic types, and these input sequences are long. Testing as the game's learning curve can be,
  <em>
   Magicka 2
  </em>
  rewards the committed with satisfying wizardry destruction.

  A twin-stick shooter,
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  was a blast when it came out in 2016 and time has done little to hurt the game's appeal. Earth has fallen at the hands of an alien invasion, so it is up to the players to turn the tide by doing a lot of shooting and killing.

  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  supports single-player and online co-op, both of which are quite fun, although the latter isn't all that active nowadays. However, the shooter is arguably at its best when played in local co-op since this allows the team to coordinate better. There are four characters with individual classes, each of whom has unique strengths and weaknesses.
  <em>
   Alienation
  </em>
  is explosive, incorporates engaging RPG elements, and offers quite a steep challenge.

  Depending on the player,
  <em>
   For the King
  </em>
  will either be a frustrating time-sink that is not worth the hassle or an addictive RPG that does an admirable job of replicating a tabletop campaign. Fondness for the latter is required to appreciate IronOak's project as the developer clearly set out to recreate that type of experience, and that goes beyond the implementation of turn-based movement and fantasy tropes.
  <em>
   For the King
  </em>
  is driven by randomness, with nearly every action taken by players adhering to the discretion of the RNG gods. As such, there can be times when the game seems to be actively working against the player, which is not fun. However, randomness is a central part of many classic tabletop games, adding an element of unpredictability to playthroughs. Love or hate it,
  <em>
   For the King
  </em>
  knows what it wants to be and delivers on that promise.

  Moving past that extended disclaimer, this RPG tells a fairly basic story about setting out on an adventure to protect the kingdom following the death of its ruler. Players create a party and are dropped into a grid-based map, with every action being turn-based.
  <em>
   For the King
  </em>
  utilizes roguelike elements to ensure each playthrough offers something different, and players will likely find themselves having to start over after their characters are wiped or they are just having a brutal campaign. The combat is also turn-based and generally enjoyable, opting to match accessible mechanics with a high difficulty ceiling (even on lower levels).

  If unpredictable physics and a sandbox that encourages experimentation are a recipe for endless giggles, then
  <em>
   Human: Fall Flat
  </em>
  turns players into master chefs. Each of the game's thematic levels provides a few objectives that require completing platforming challenges and solving puzzles; however,
  <em>
   Human: Fall Flat
  </em>
  is at its most entertaining when any guidelines are ignored in favor of producing chaotic messes.

  In split-screen, two people receive blank humans to direct, and the addition of another player opens up even further the already vast gameplay possibilities. The more creative and curious the users are, the more fun

  Debuting as an Xbox console exclusive,
  <em>
   The Ascent
  </em>
  eventually joined Sony's ecosystem, and while not a masterpiece, the cyberpunk game has more than enough to offer to warrant a recommendation. Just to be clear, this action RPG works well as a solo experience, and an argument could be made that this option represents the game at its best. Nevertheless, the 4-play co-op support does not detract much from the overall package, even if it does not add a great deal to it. Furthermore,
  <em>
   The Ascent
  </em>
  can be a slog at times, so having a few friends along for the ride can help greatly during these moments.

 <p>
  Set in Veles, players step into the shoes of a mercenary, a role that is not exactly highly regarded. The beautifully designed urban jungle is arguably the game's highlight, and exploring Veles leads to some of the campaign's most memorable moments. The RPG utilizes a twin-stick shooter combat system that, while decent, might take a second to grow on someone since it is slower than the genre's typical offerings.

  Musou games are an acquired taste, but they can be a blast in the right headspace. Although very straightforward, their gameplay loop lends itself to cathartic demolishing, allowing players to wipe the floor with hundreds of enemies without breaking a sweat. It is satisfying.
  <em>
   Samurai Warriors 5

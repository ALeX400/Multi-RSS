	 <em>
		Fishing Clash
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is an interesting and fun fishing simulator that perfectly captures the thrill of this kind of sport. You can just go fishing alone to catch a few fish and improve your skills or upgrade your fishing rod, or you can take part in a tournament and compete with other players for valuable prizes. The game has a lot of mechanics and options that will give you an advantage in fishing, but most of them need to be unlocked or upgraded first. All of this will reruire a ton of currency and resources, but don't worry, because by redeeming
	<em>
	 Fishing Clash
	</em>
	codes, you will have everything you need to get off to an easy start.

	To catch a massive and valuable fish, you first need to partially progress in the game to improve your fishing rod and your chances of catching it, which can take quite a while. By redeeming
	<em>
	 Fishing Clash
	</em>
	codes, you will receive generous rewards that will help you achieve your goals much faster, so be sure to use them.

	Redeeming

	 After doing this, you will open the redemption menu. There will be an input field and a green Claim button. Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the active codes into the input field.

			<title>Mortal Kombat 1: How to Complete the FROM THE SHADOWS Klue in Season 6 of Invasions</title>
			<link>https://gamerant.com/mk1-mortal-kombat-1-sun-do-festival-from-the-shadows-klue-solution-invasions-season-6/</link>
			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	Unlike in previous seasons of Invasions Mode, there's only one Sun Do Festival Klue in Season 6. It's called FROM THE SHADOWS, and is tied to the Say What?!?! Node, which
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Mortal Kombat 1
	 </em>
	</strong>
	players can find around halfway through the Mesa to the north of the green Reptilian Eye Locked Gate.

 <p>
	As some
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat 1
	</em>
	players should quickly deduce, FROM THE SHADOWS refers to one of the roster's many ninjas, with Smoke's moveset making him the likeliest candidate. Figuring out which move they need to use may require a bit of trial and error, though, or the help of a good FROM THE SHADOWS Klue guide.

	To solve the FROM THE SHADOWS Klue, players will need to
	<strong>
	 perform Smoke's Hazed and Infused Fatality
	</strong>
	, which can be done by pressing Back, Forward, Down, Front Punch (Square on PlayStation, X on Xbox, or Y on Switch) while standing at any range. Once triggered, Smoke will slice off his opponent's arms and then shove an active grenade into their mouth, causing their bottom jaw to blown off. When players return to the map screen, they'll find that the nearby debris disappears, allowing them to move forward and access the nearby Klue chest.

	, and

For those unaware, Trash Talker makes it so that the player's first hit deals 100% more damage, and taunting while the Trash Talker relic is equipped will double the damage of the player's next attack. As for the other rewards, players can equip the Raiden palette via the Kustomize menu, while the Seasonal Kredits can be used to purchase time-limited kosmetics from the Seasonal Store. Players will need to act relatively quickly, though, as Seasonal Kredits will expire once the current season of Invasions comes to an end in late July.

	Over the 41 years that Mario and Luigi have been around, the expansive world of the Mushroom Kingdom and its neighbors has seen many a threat, but one of the most interesting can be found in the RPG
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
	 </em>
	</strong>
	. Originally found on the GameCube, players can now experience
	<em>
	 Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
	</em>
	on the Switch, which sees Mario go up against the X-Nauts.

	Gamers will find themselves fighting against the goggled X-Nauts in
	<em>

	's many chapters, be it in small doses or even in sizable raids across their locked-down bases. They serve as one of
	<em>

	</em>
	's bigger antagonists and only appear in this one game, but they masterfully integrate intimidation into a narrative that is upbeat and humorous overall, doing so without taking away from its lighthearted tone.

 <p>
	To understand why the X-Nauts are so critical to
	<em>
	 Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
	</em>
	, it should be understood that
	<em>
	 Paper Mario
	</em>
	focuses on being a fun experience above all else. Simply telling a story about Bowser stealing the Star Rod to be all-powerful, humor and whimsy are present throughout the tale the game tells. Still,
	<em>
	 Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
	</em>
	improves on many aspects of the Gamecube version, including the size and depth of the overall story, which is where the X-Nauts come in.

	Lord Crump is Perfect as One of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door's Comedic Villains
 </h3>
 <p>
	Lord Crump is the player's introduction to the X-Nauts, helping set the tone of the game as he chases after Goombella for answers in plenty of humorous dialogue and scenes. This doesn't change throughout Crump's involvement in the story, as he remains the butt of jokes with characters like the Punie Elder and even his own boss fights. He matches well with how many of the standard X-Naut soldiers are also just as bumbling as he is, with the computer TEC serving as a great melancholy balance between all the humor and the far more intimidating Sir Grodus.

 <h3 id="sir-grodus-is-a-terrifying-face-in-the-paper-mario-series">
	Sir Grodus is a Terrifying Face in the Paper Mario Series
 </h3>
 <p>
	Players won't get to meet Sir Grodus until they beat Chapter 1 and start Peach's intermissions, though that doesn't make him any less powerful as a character. He stands tall as the leader of the X-Nauts, and holds his cards close to his chest, being revealed more by TEC due to his desire for his beloved Princess Peach to be informed and safe. Grodus is more aware of the truth behind the Thousand-Year Door than the player is, which is made clear through his cold demeanor and calculated actions that add a sense of urgency to what's going on. Mario needs to stop Grodus, and doing so isn't just a fun little adventure because Grodus is cold and cunning, and will take over the world if left to do so.

 <p>
	It's specifically because of Grodus' seriousness that
	<em>
	 The Thousand-Year Door
	</em>
	has a weight behind it that lingers beneath the more comedic moments, which turns the adventure into one that's mainly fun yet is still able to leave fans on the edge of their seats. The fact that this RPG can seamlessly balance stakes with its heavily comedic tone in such a great way is one of the reasons

	 Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
	</em>
	is so beloved. Even if they only appeared in one game, the X-Nauts are extremely memorable because of how different Grodus and Crump are.

			<title>What Dragon Age: Dreadwolf Combat Change Rumors Could Mean for Mass Effect</title>

	<strong>
	 <em>
		Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is the next title in BioWare's acclaimed
	<em>
	 Dragon Age
	</em>
	franchise, and while not much has been revealed yet, several leaks and rumors suggest one big change coming to the franchise. If the leaks are true,
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
	</em>
	will feature more action-oriented combat like
	<em>
	 God of War
	</em>
	than the combat
	<em>
	 Dragon Age
	</em>
	has been known for in the past. Of course, each
	<em>
	 Dragon Age
	</em>
	game has changed its combat system, so this is to be expected. Still, ARPG-style combat would be quite a departure from the norm for
	<em>
	 Dragon Age
	</em>
	. Assuming this information is accurate, one might wonder which direction BioWare's
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	series might be heading in next.

 <p>
	Unlike the
	<em>
	 Dragon Age
	</em>
	franchise, which has seen a change in combat with every game,
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	's combat has stayed true to its roots. Apart from some smaller changes to skill usage, general fluidity, and quality of life,
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	's combat system has essentially stayed the same throughout each installment. As such, perhaps it's time for the next
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	game to feature combat similar to
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
	</em>
	's rumored combat system, if only to shake things up for once and start a new era of
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	for modern audiences.

	Mass Effect Has Always Been a Cover Shooter
 </h3>
 <p>
	Since the first
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	game in 2007, the series' combat has remained the same, following the design and mechanics of a typical cover shooter like
	<em>
	 Gears of War
	</em>
	. This style of combat generally allows players to strategically plan their next move, especially when time-altering mechanics are implemented that either slow or pause the flow of combat when a weapon or skill wheel is opened and give players plenty of time to choose their next action.
 </p>

 <p>
	For the most part, this combat style has served the
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	series well, though the first game's combat was very clunky and unresponsive before
	<em>
	 Mass Effect: Legendary Edition
	</em>
	revamped and updated it. However, like turn-based combat, the cover shooter formula may be too old-fashioned for some modern audiences, so the series may need a change in
	<em>
	 Mass Effect 4
	</em>
	.

	Dragon Age: Dreadwolf's Rumored Combat Change Could Be What Mass Effect Needs
 </h3>
 <p>
	In the increasingly fast-paced modern world where higher speeds, in general, are demanded almost everywhere, video games are evolving along with those demands and offering players mechanics that suit the needs of those looking to be instantly gratified by a game's loading times and input responsiveness.
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy 16
	</em>
	is a perfect example of this, as it is the first mainline
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy
	</em>
	game to feature fast-paced action combat, as opposed to the turn-based system the series was previously known for.

 <p>
	This drastic change divided the
	<em>
	 Final Fantasy
	</em>
	fanbase, but Square Enix backed it up by clarifying its intentions to deliver an experience that younger audiences could enjoy. From what the developer understood, younger audiences crave fast-paced action above the slower, more intentional movement of turn-based combat. This is why
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
	</em>
	's rumored combat change makes sense, and it may do
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	some good to consider the same.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	's cover shooter mechanics may not move as slowly as turn-based combat, but it still lacks the engagement that true action combat can provide. Of course, shifting from cover-based mechanics to action would essentially exchange the defense provided by cover for blocks and dodges, but it could fit well in the
	<em>
	 Mass Effect
	</em>
	franchise, especially if BioWare is aiming to take
	<em>
	 Mass Effect 4
	</em>
	in an entirely different direction than before.

 <p>
	Since it may be a good idea for
	<em>
	 Mass Effect 4
	</em>
	to distance itself from the original trilogy after all these years, perhaps it could use
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
	</em>
	's rumored combat change as an excuse to change as well. This would see BioWare taking its two biggest franchises in the same direction for a more cohesive move of progress for the developer.

			<title>It's Time For An Update to this Elden Ring Feature</title>
			<link>https://gamerant.com/video/invasion-update-elden-ring-feature-pvp-co-op-multiplayer/</link>
			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	The future of Soulslike games after Elden Ring is unclear, however one feature from the genre should perhaps be updated for future titles. Elden Ring has done a lot to make these games more accessible, but there's still a few features that keep the game from many gamers.

  Running or driving around in a massive world is always enjoyable, but there's something incredibly liberating about
  <strong>
   gliding through virtual skies and
  </strong>
  watching sprawling landscapes unfold below. It highlights the effort developers invest in creating open worlds, allowing players to relax and appreciate the beauty from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it’s a parachute, hang glider, or wingsuit, different games offer various ways to soar through the air as a traversal method, especially when the distance between destinations is significant. They can not only be entertaining to use, but also valuable for solving puzzles and overcoming other gameplay challenges within the open world.

  There are many ways to get around the Rook Islands in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  , from boats and jetskis in the ocean to trucks and ATVs on the land, which are effective when chased by pirates or animals. The open world is filled with many dangers, and while the protagonist can be armed to the teeth and even feature downright supernatural abilities, going through all the Rook Islands can be a slog.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately,
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  introduced a hang glider that can be used to bypass by taking to the skies, but that is only the beginning. Later on, the player is upgraded to have a wingsuit that can be activated at any moment after jumping off a high place. This suit provides the same aerial protection but at much greater speed, rendering all other vehicles useless.

  made the zombie-infested fictional city of Villedor even more massive than the previous game’s city, both horizontally and vertically. It allows for even more parkour challenges to overcome with more horror-inducing zombie variations during the day and night for an even more difficult experience. That’s where the paraglider comes in handy.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it takes time to unlock, the paraglider can be essential, allowing the player to hover between skyscrapers or get across the city without going through hordes of zombies. With the many air vents spread across the city, the paraglider can keep being launched back into the sky, extending airtime, which can be used to fly across the entire map.

  While the stories and missions are enjoyable, part of what makes
  <em>
   <strong>
    Just Cause 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  so fun is the freedom it offers players. It is almost comical how much can be destroyed on the island map of Medici. One of the major mechanics that helps the game stand out is the gliders and wingsuits that facilitate exploration almost anywhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  At times, the main protagonist, Rico Rodriguez, feels like a comic book hero as he maneuvers through the skies in his wingsuit. When combined with his grapnel gun straight out of a Batman game, the wingsuit becomes the definitive means of transportation in
  <em>
   Just Cause 3
  </em>
  , which is why it appears on a lot of key art for the game.

   <em>
    Prototype

  </strong>
  features the same kind of open world where every car, bench, and building can be destroyed. This is all possible thanks to the Blacklight virus gifting the protagonist with shapeshifting abilities to conjure weapons, give him enhanced strength, or leap tall across the city.

 <p>
  <em>
   Prototype

  feels like the closest thing to a Venom video game, and the M-rating allows players to embrace their dark anti-hero side. One of the Blacklight abilities is gliding, making Alex Mercer go from a powerful leap to a graceful hover for long distances across the city of Manhattan.

  Gliding was already a pivotal part of Link’s journey in
  <em>
   Breath Of The Wild
  </em>
  , thanks to the massive version of Hyrule with its many towers, mountains, and other high locations. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tears Of The Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  , it is amplified because not only is Hyrule even bigger than before, but there are floating islands in the sky that can be explored and Link’s glider becomes essential up there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyone who has played
  <em>
   Breath Of The Wild
  </em>

  <em>

  with ease. It features many of the same mechanics from before integrated with new ones, such as new abilities like Ultrahand, which can allow players to create anything from machines to silly structures.

  The first Spider-Man game already borrowed heavily from the
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  games with its use of free-flow combat and gadgets.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  goes even further by giving both Peter Parker and Miles Morales access to the web wings, allowing them to glide through any part of the open-world map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Web-swinging through Marvel’s New York City will always be a highlight of any Spider-Man game, but Insomniac Games delivered with the web wings. Not only is it simple to use with different challenges to have fun with, but it makes getting to the next destination faster, especially when hitting jetstreams that allow the Spider-Men to fly.

  Gliding has been in every

  title since
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  , but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Batman: Arkham Knight
   </em>
  </strong>
  is where it was perfected. Not only was the grapnel boost kept from
  <em>
   Arkham City
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Arkham Origins
  </em>
  , but it was also improved upon with the various upgrades that can be purchased throughout the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only are the grapnel boosts upgraded, but the gliding mechanic is built into the Batmobile’s ejection system. Now Batman can shoot into the sky and, if upgraded enough, he can glide and dive across entire islands of Gotham City without stopping. As fun as the Batmobile is, gliding remains a go-to traversal method in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight
  </em>
  .

   Open-world
  </strong>
  games are usually very vast and complex, as developers have to pack in a lot of elements, including NPCs, missions and items, to keep them interesting. Some titles even allow for deep exploration of the wilderness to complement the experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some stories in open-world games are driven by companions, whereas others focus on the main characters and build relationships around them. In any case, one of the most interesting aspects of this genre is that there are also usually secrets awaiting players at every turn in the world. Here are some of the

    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
   </strong>
  </em>
  is, without a doubt, the best installment in its series, as it not only has the best graphics, but also the best combat mechanics and the most main and side quests. Throughout the game, players will have the chance to discover a lot about The Continent and how monsters and other creatures came to be in the world of humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the lore secrets present in the game will be made available to players throughout the story, whereas others will have to be discovered through exploration, as they remain hidden away, only to be found by the most curious of Witchers.

  franchise is great, many players agree that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring

  </em>
  is FromSoftware's best work to this day. Not only does this title feature amazing weapons, powerful bosses, and tons of different armor sets for players to take on their enemies with, but there’s also a ton of lore hidden away in The Lands Between.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many secrets will be unveiled as players progress naturally through the game, but others will require in-depth exploration and a keen eye to be found. The lore behind this magical and dangerous world is fascinating, mostly consisting of the story of Marika, Radagon and Godfrey. Those looking to farm Runes might want to take on the bosses who drop the most Runes in

   <strong>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  is, without a doubt, one of the best titles ever released in the history of gaming. Not only does it have many of the elements that have made the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  franchise so popular, but its American Wild West setting makes for a perfect experience that most players will want to enjoy more than once.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game has very interesting mechanics, including weight gain or loss depending on how Arthur is fed. The narrative is also extremely compelling, and players will get to appreciate the beautifully-crafted rendition of 19th-century America in this period, which has inspired a wide berth of content in the media.

      Naoe in

  Naoe is one of the leads in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows;
   </em>
  </strong>
  a ninja out for revenge. Besides her assortment of ninja tools, including a grappling hook and Kunai, Naoe can equip three different types of weapons. The Katana needs no explanation and neither does the Tanto, as it’s just a short knife.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players may be more unfamiliar with the Kusarigama, which is a sickle attached to a chain. The easiest way to get the best versions of these three weapons is to invade castles, search Kofuns, or track down high-ranking targets in side quests within
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  . Legendary gear levels alongside players, so finding these weapons for the late-game may be more beneficial. Here are a few key examples of
  <strong>
   the best weapons Naoe can equip in
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
   and why they’re great based on power.

  are like little mini tomb-raiding adventures, and some of the more fun side quests in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Scarlet Fate’s Impact skill can knock enemies off their guard more easily and increase the push the weapon can have against armor. It’s far from the best Tanto in the game, but it will do some nice damage for players when push comes to shove.

 <p>
  The

   Artist’s Tear Tanto
  </strong>
  can be found in the Harima region inside Takagi Otsuka Fort. Forts are just like castles in the game, in that players have to kill a set amount of Daisho to unlock legendary chests. Tantos are the fastest weapons in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  between Naoe and Yasuke, which makes sense given their size.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Artist’s Tear, players can make use of this speed to strike more effectively and build a combo which will increase the weapon's attack power the more they keep their momentum up.

 <p>
  For a change of pace, let’s look at a Katana via the
  <strong>
   Yami no Kage,
  </strong>
  which can be acquired in the Harima region inside Hiraiyama Fort. Katanas are Naoe’s strongest weapon type, balancing speed and power to create a deadly combo.
 </p>
 <p>
  When enemies shine with a white glint, players can deflect their attacks and, if they are fast enough, they can even counter. If players successfully counter after a deflect, that attack will be multiplied by 100% thanks to the Yami no Kage's skill, which is one heck of a counter rate for any game.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Masked Death Katana
  </strong>
  is a great name for a ninja weapon. This blade can be found in the Iga region within the Shimagahara Valley. The name makes it sound like it should be a scythe-type weapon or cause instant death, but that is sadly not the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  This Katana is still powerful though, as it keeps its charge even after players dodge an enemy’s attack. Normally, a dodge after a full charge would revert the weapon’s stance back to normal, which is frustrating. Thankfully, this weapon eliminates that issue.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Death Whisperer Kusarigama
  </strong>
  is another deadly-sounding weapon, and this time, it is technically scythe adjacent. Kusarigamas are Naoe’s slowest weapons because the weighted chain attached to the sickle takes a bit to swing around and build momentum. As slow as it can be, Kusarigama are great for dealing with crowds, especially when surrounded.
 </p>
 <p>
  This particular weapon can increase damage if players successfully toss enemies into each other. This weapon will be automatically unlocked during "The Wounded" main mission in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , but players can increase the Death Whisper’s level later at The Forge, like with all legendary weapons.

  <strong>
   The Bloodletter
  </strong>
  is another good Kusarigama, and this one can be acquired in the Iga region within Kashiwara Fort. The Iga region, of course, is where Naoe is from, and there is quite a bit of good ninja gear in this area for both early-game and late-game builds in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The Bloodletter sticks to its name and can cause Bleed to occur on enemies if players wrap their chains around them during combo attacks. Bleed will cause damage over time, and it’s one of the game’s main and most effective status effects.

   The Shinobi’s Fury
  </strong>
  is definitely one of the best Tantos players can find in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows,
  </em>
  and it can be acquired easily by completing a main mission: "The Golden Teppo". To make this weapon competitive in the late game requires some upgrades, but it will be well worth it once players get into the thirties or forties level range.
 </p>
 <p>
  When players destabilize an enemy through a myriad of ways, the enemy will flash yellow. That means they are Vulnerable, and in this state, the Shinobi’s Fury can essentially get a second attack in to make double use of this weakness.

  is one of the deadliest Kusarigama in the game, and it can be found within the Omi region inside Kashiwabara Fortress. Again, Kusarigama are best used when battling multiple enemies, so they are good for storming forts or castles.
 </p>
 <p>
  If players get a good combo going against a group, this weapon’s attacks will act like they are charged even without the player’s input. It’s best to use Naoe stealthily in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , but sometimes an all-out brawl cannot be helped, and that’s the perfect time to equip a Kusarigama like the Featherstorm.

   <strong>
    Location
   </strong>
   : Kawachi Kaza-ana Cave (Omi Region)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Last, but not least, the incredible
  <strong>
   Violet Night Katana.
  </strong>
  The design of this blade is great thanks to its purple color scheme and poison-tipped edge. Like Bleed, the Poison status effect in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  can cause damage over time. If players hit any enemy, even a boss character, with it, they will surely go down in no time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Violent Night Katana is a bit tricky to acquire, as players have to get to the Omi region and find the Kawachi Kaza-ana Cave. Inside, they will have to deal with a Yuki Onna as part of "The Yokai" questline, which is one of the most interesting and challenging in the game.

       While the Messenger is revealed after killing the Tsutsui Agent, completing his sub-quest at Koriyama Castle reveals another target: The Blacksmith Agent. You can get more information on him by eavesdropping on two blacksmiths in
       <strong>
        Uda Town, Yamato.
       </strong>
       Ultimately, you'll have to head to
       <strong>
        Miyataki
       </strong>
       , at the eastern end of the river north of Yoshino. There, you'll find The Blacksmith Agent. He is in the same building as the Gear Vendor.

  The team behind
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  just dropped the patch notes for Season 3, packing in new content, gameplay upgrades, and balance changes. They’ve also tackled a bunch of bugs to make the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  experience smoother.
 </p>
 <p>
  Earlier this month, Activision, the game’s publisher, said
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 3 was getting pushed back two weeks. As the release date got closer, fresh details started popping up - like Treyarch Studios confirming the Firing Range map is coming back. Now, the full patch notes are out, giving players a clear rundown of everything headed their way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Season 3 of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is rolling out a ton of new stuff, starting with three multiplayer maps: Barrage, Nomad, and Firing Range. Two fresh modes, Sharpshooter and Demolition, mix things up with new challenges. Sharpshooter switches weapon loadouts every 45 seconds and gives bonuses for kill streaks, while Demolition brings back tactical action where attackers need to take out two bomb sites. Players also get a new batch of weapons, like the Kilo 141, CR-56 AMAX, HDR Sniper Rifle, and Nail Gun, some tied to the Battle Pass or special in-game events. The update adds new attachments too, like the Monolithic Suppressor for better stealth and the C9 10mm Auto Mags for increased stopping power.

 <h2 id="black-ops-6-season-3-expands-zombies-mode">
  Black Ops 6 Season 3 Expands Zombies Mode
 </h2>
 <p>
  The Zombies mode in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is getting a major upgrade with the Shattered Veil map, bringing new enemies, perks, and Wonder Weapons. Players head into a strange mansion in Liberty Falls, teaming up with S.A.M. to uncover the secrets of the Sentinel Artifact. New threats like the Elder Disciple boost nearby zombies and speed up their changes into tougher versions, while Toxic Zombies run at players and explode into acid pools. The Double Tap Perk-A-Cola is back after a long wait, raising fire rate with strong add-ons like Double Jeopardy, which takes out weak zombies right away, and Double Impact, which increases damage from repeated hits.

  Season 3 brings new updates to RICOCHET Anti-Cheat, as the team keeps working to stop cheaters and boost security.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Ranked Play sees some changes too, including Retroactive SR Adjustments that give players back their lost SR when cheaters get banned. Players can now jump back into matches that have already started without getting penalized. The update also changes several weapons, tweaking damage, fire rates, and handling to make the game feel more balanced and fair.

   <strong>
    Firing Range (6v6)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Firing Range makes its glorious return in Black Ops 6 in a faithful remaster of the fan-favorite map. Watch for crossfire down the long center Road as Operators fight for control of the vantage points in the Tower and the upper levels of the Shoot House and Garage. Shooting targets move back and forth on their tracks behind the Office and several other spots adding a useful diversion while preparing for the next fight. Avoid the center chaos by branching off to the Dirt Road, keeping your guard up against ambush as you pass the Storage unit along the way.

   <strong>
    Barrage (6v6)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Revisit 1968 Vietnam as you follow Hudson’s clues surrounding one Summit Watch at the front lines of battle. The trees have been cleared and the landscape flattened to make room for this base housing an artillery battery in active combat. The area has taken hits with large chunks blown off buildings including the Command Center and Barracks, the damage opening new pathways through the map.

    Nomad (6v6, 2v2)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The Pantheon moles were in Afghanistan, too, when Woods fought there in 1986. Fight in the ruins of a fortified settlement commandeered for the ensuing battle, a parked missile carrier facing out over the valley where a convoy lies in ruins on the narrow road leading up to the map.

  New Multiplayer Modes
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sharpshooter
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Flex your skills in this classic Black Ops free for all party mode where every Operator is assigned the same Loadout which changes every 45 seconds. Each cycle introduces a new Primary and Secondary Weapon from scoped Sniper Rifles to akimbo Pistols, plus a new Dedicated Melee weapon and Tactical and Lethal Equipment.
  </li>
  <li>
   Use everything at your disposal to eliminate enemies while unlocking bonus abilities for going on a streak:
   <ul>
    <li>
     1st Elimination: Increased movement speed.
    </li>
    <li>
     2nd Elimination: Increased reload speed.
    </li>
    <li>
     3rd Elimination: Increased sprint recovery speed.
    </li>
    <li>
     4th Elimination: Increased ADS speed.
    </li>
    <li>
     5th Elimination: Earn double score for eliminating enemies.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Keep the streak going to unlock double score and make a run for the top three. When you’re taken out, respawn and build up those bonuses again. A short countdown precedes each weapon swap. Adapt and win.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Demolition
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Alternate between attacking and defending two bomb sites. The attacking team must destroy both bomb sites to win the round, gaining a time bonus after detonating the first site. All attacking Operators spawn with a bomb and respawns are active for both teams throughout the match.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Defense is all about running down the clock. Defuse planted bombs right away, as the match timer pauses whenever a bomb site is in active countdown. If one of the sites is destroyed, regroup and throw everything you have into defending the last one.
  </li>
 </ul>

  New Weapons (Multiplayer &amp; Zombies)
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Kilo 141 - Assault Rifle (Call of Duty: Warzone Login Reward)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Fully automatic assault rifle with an ergonomic design that improves handling, and a steady fire rate helps stay on target.
    </li>
    <li>
     The Kilo 141 is back and ready to tear it up across Multiplayer and Call of Duty: Warzone. The weapon’s smooth handling, manageable recoil, and steady fire rate give it room to shine in a variety of combat situations, leaving no doubt as to why the Kilo 141 was a favorite in Verdansk. Now that the location is back, it’s time to relive the glory days with this hard-hitting Primary Weapon.
    </li>
    <li>
     Players will automatically unlock the Kilo 141 for use in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone after logging in to Call of Duty: Warzone at the launch of Season 03.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    CR-56 - Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     This lightweight 7.62 x 39mm full-auto assault rifle is compact and powerful. Built exclusively for military use, the standard issue rifle is deadly at mid-range combat and easily configured for a variety of assault tactics.
    </li>
    <li>
     Combining high-damage hits with a fast fire rate and good handling, the CR-56 AMAX is the perfect mid-range weapon for downing targets fast. Eliminate enemies in three to four shots up to 25 meters out, leaving plenty left over to chew through equipped armor. Quick reloads get you back into the action fast, a helpful trait no matter how you choose to customize the weapon via Gunsmith.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    HDR - Sniper Rifle (Battle Pass)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Anti-material bolt action sniper rifle chambered in 12.7 x 108mm ammunition. Bullets have a lower muzzle velocity but remain devastating even at very long ranges.
    </li>
    <li>
     Veterans of Verdansk know the power of the HDR and the havoc a sniper can inflict with it when stationed in high vantage points like the infamous Airport Control Tower. The weapon’s long reach and heavy damage make it a favorite of sharpshooters, its distinctive firing sound sending squads running. Add the Reinforced Barrel attachment to further extend your damage range and bullet velocity, and don’t forget to hold your breath for difficult shots.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Kali Sticks - Melee (Event Reward)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Two-hit kill. Extremely fast attack speed. Short range.
    </li>
    <li>
     The infamous Kali Sticks return, dealing out damage with rapid swings that’ll take down your target in a flash. Smack them with fast follow-up hits using the weapon’s light attack or take them out in a more dramatic fashion by unleashing the heavy attack. Use Kali Sticks in Multiplayer with the new Close Shave Perk to deploy a quick whack against enemies without having to manually swap to your Dedicated Melee slot first.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Nail Gun - Special (In-Season)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Full-auto Nail Gun. High damage at close range with fast handling speeds and very low muzzle velocity.
    </li>
    <li>
     Stick it to them with this handy tool configured with a magazine of 15 nails that fires at full auto. The damage drops off quickly after 25 meters and performs best up close. The Nail Gun’s low muzzle velocity can make it difficult to land shots against fast moving targets, so get them in your sights and unload before they know what hit them. This armament is a reward earned during the Black Ops Tribute Event.

    Ray Gun Mark II (+ 3 Variants)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Drop multiple zombies at once with the upgraded and modestly unstable Ray Gun Mark II. Recovered from the Dark Aether by Project Janus, this powerful laser armament delivers three-round bursts of energy, can be Pack-a-Punched, and doubles as a bludgeoning instrument if you’re running low on ammunition.
    </li>
    <li>
     Then there’s the three new variants.
     <ul>
      <li>
       Provided you’ve [[REDACTED]], you can experiment with an additional three variants of the Ray Gun Mark II:
       <ul>
        <li>
         Ray Gun Mark II-W: Offering similar bullet patterns to a submachine gun, this also has a random chance to ignite enemies.
        </li>
        <li>
         Ray Gun Mark II-P: Shooting ammunition like a shotgun, with a chance to spawn a sigil with the ability to grant invulnerability to the player standing on it for a limited time.
        </li>
        <li>
         Ray Gun Mark II-R: Dropping zombies with a Marksman Rifle-like discharge, expect a chance to spread a plague infection that can inflict area-of-effect damage.

   <strong>
    Elder Disciple
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Strange, floating apparitions have been seen flitting about the sprawling gardens and rambling mansion estate. Known to some as Elder Disciples, these powerful enemies likely spell trouble for the crew.
    </li>
    <li>
     Elder Disciples gain strength as they empower the zombies around them while summoning more undead to join the battle. Using their dark magic, these fetid, floating carcasses can force their allies to evolve more quickly, allowing a lowly zombie to more rapidly transform into a Doppelghast or some other sinister form.
    </li>
    <li>
     Eliminate the Elder Disciple before their forces grow too powerful, keeping it at a distance to avoid the scream it lets loose against players who draw too close. The deadly enemy grows more agitated as it takes damage, so try to get the job done fast.

   <strong>
    Toxic Zombies

     As a sickly yellow fog descends across the mansion, expect the inhabitants to take on an even-more revolting pallor. Easily identifiable due to their greenish hue and more skeletal exterior, Toxic Zombies seem to have lost all but their base perambulatory functions and seem intent on sprinting toward their prey before exploding, leaving a damaging pool of acid in their wake. Listen for their telltale shriek and get the jump on them before they can close the distance.

  This season, the focus remains on our commitment to taking down cheat makers, banning bad actors, and ensuring a great player experience. Our roadmap for anti-cheat extends beyond this season, but in the latest Progress Report we’ll focus on recent results and security-focused updates coming in Season 03.

  Console Cross-Play Settings
 </h3>
 <p>
  In Season 03, we're giving console players more granular options by separating the MP Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each of these three settings (Multiplayer Ranked Play, Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play, and Multiplayer Unranked) will include the following options:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in the selected playlists.
  </li>
  <li>
   On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in selected playlists.
   <ul>
    <li>
     <em>
      May negatively impact matchmaking queue times.
     </em>
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Off: Restricts matchmaking to your current gaming platform only in selected playlists.
   <ul>
    <li>
     <em>
      Will negatively impact matchmaking queue times.
     </em>
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Additional details on how these settings interact with party members who are on different platforms.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Players in a party who all belong to the same console platform will matchmake with the party leader’s preferred cross-play settings.
  </li>
  <li>
   Players who have selected "Cross-Play Off" and create a mixed platform party that includes a different console platform will have their cross-play settings temporarily adjusted to "Cross-Play On (Consoles Only)" to enable matchmaking. This temporary adjustment enables matchmaking for the duration of the mixed platform party, and disbanding this party will result in preferred matchmaking settings being restored.
  </li>
  <li>
   Players who have selected "Cross-Play Off" and create a mixed platform party with a PC player will have their cross-play settings temporarily adjusted to "Cross-Play On." This enables matchmaking for the duration of the mixed platform party, and disbanding this party will result in preferred matchmaking settings being restored.
  </li>
  <li>
   Reminder: Adjusting Cross-Play settings may negatively impact matchmaking queue times.

  Weapons
 </h3>
 <p>
  Multiplayer &amp; Zombies
 </p>
 <p>
  A major focus of our weapon balance changes in Season 3 is to enable more gameplay variety. Almost every attachment that modifies the core behavior of a weapon is receiving an improvement to help with its viability in the meta. It is our goal to ensure that all existing and future weapon mods feel fun and powerful to use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Semi-auto weapons are another broad target for buffs this patch. The changes aim to make these weapons more accessible and competitive, as well as create more distinct gameplay feel between the faster semi-auto primaries.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a last top-level note, the Season 3 patch includes adjustments to the Jackal PDW. More details on the thinking behind the change can be found below. Our weapon balance philosophy is to be conservative with nerfs, and to always consider whether there is an opportunity to elevate other weapons instead. In this case, we feel strongly that tuning down the Jackal PDW will be good for the health of the weapon meta going forward.

   <strong>
    Ray Gun Mark II (and Variants)
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Drop multiple zombies at once with the upgraded and modestly unstable Ray Gun Mark II. Recovered from the Dark Aether by Project Janus, this powerful laser armament delivers three-round bursts of energy, can be Pack-a-Punched, and doubles as a bludgeoning instrument if you’re running low on ammunition.
    </li>
    <li>
     Then there’s the three new variants.
     <ul>
      <li>
       Provided you’ve [[REDACTED]], you can experiment with an additional three variants of the Ray Gun Mark II:
       <ul>
        <li>
         Ray Gun Mark II-W: Offering similar bullet patterns to a submachine gun, this also has a random chance to ignite enemies.
        </li>
        <li>
         Ray Gun Mark II-P: Shooting ammunition like a shotgun, with a chance to spawn a sigil with the ability to grant invulnerability to the player standing on it for a limited time.
        </li>
        <li>
         Ray Gun Mark II-R: Dropping zombies with a Marksman Rifle-like discharge, expect a chance to spread a plague infection that can inflict area-of-effect damage.
        </li>
        <p>
        </p>
       </ul>

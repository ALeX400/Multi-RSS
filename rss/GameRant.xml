 <p>
  There are quite a few maps in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and all of them offer different kinds of experiences. Some provide long corridors where a sniper can thrive, while others close the walls around players to help the SMGs and shotguns come to life. It is somewhat of a split opinion among the game's community on which kind of map is best for the game, but the fast-paced feel of the gameplay certainly makes the smaller maps shine. One of these maps is Subsonic, which isn't the smallest of the maps but still feels close enough to warrant some close-quarters gameplay.

 <p>
  This map is designed around a fighter jet hangar, where players can duke it out indoors or take their weapons outside, where they can run around the central building to find some stragglers. It's a solid map in terms of design, providing a few different ways for gamers to play on it. Of course, those playstyles are only as good as the weapons that a person brings in with them. For those looking to thrive here, these are the
  <strong>
   best weapons for the Subsonic map in
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

  There are a lot of corners that players will have to go around on Subsonic, and this poses a huge threat to people. Campers can be around any of them, and if the player isn't ready, they can easily be taken out in no time. This means that it's important for players to have something that can take out an enemy quickly.

 <p>
  The Saug is perfect for this, as it offers one of the best time-to-kills in the entire game thanks to
  <strong>
   its rapid rate of fire and excellent accuracy
  </strong>
  . It's not going to give players a ton of range, but if the player wants to hang out in the central hangar, they can pretty much lock it down with this SMG.

 <p>
  The XM4 may be one of the first weapons that players can use in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , but it has persisted as one of the best options in the game and serves as the best assault rifle so far. It can
  <strong>
   provide excellent damage
  </strong>
  from just about any range in the game, which means that it is useful in any situation. That's not something that can easily be replicated by other weapons.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Subsonic features plenty of areas and different scenarios that players will need to survive. This is why the XM4 works so well for the map; it gives its user
  <strong>
   the chance to succeed no matter where they are
  </strong>
  in the environment. Players can win a fight in the central hangar or even take out a target from a distance around the outside. The XM4 just delivers from any distance and makes it very deadly on Subsonic.

  While the Saug may be the pick for best SMG in this guide, the KSV is right up there with it. It does a lot of what makes the Saug so good,
  <strong>
   providing excellent mobility, good accuracy, and the chance to dominate up-close
  </strong>
  . Because of this, it becomes a dealer of death when used with the right attachments and loadout.

 <p>
  So to dominate that central hangar, the KSV is a great option. Combining it with some
  <strong>
   mobility boosting Perks and accessories
  </strong>
  , the player can move around with ease. With its time-to-kill, it can down an enemy and allow the person to move on to the next target. All of this combines into a player who is hard to take down and keep track of, which is always a good thing.

  Everyone wants to act like they're above it, but camping is
  <strong>
   a legitimate strategy in
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and plenty of players use it. It's just the fact of the matter, and that's okay. Using the right weapon can make camping truly one of the best ways to win a match, and one of those weapons is the Model L.

  Another assault rifle, it's not the best option in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  (XM4 holds that spot), but it is
  <strong>
   one of the most popular guns available
  </strong>
  . This is due to its good recoil and mobility, though it is held back by its sub-par time-to-kill. Which is why getting the first shot off is important for success with it. If a player can wait for another player to come around a corner, unaware, they can gun them down and then use that mobility to escape before their friends show up.

  Now, Subsonic isn't necessarily one of the best maps for long-range fights, but that doesn't mean it is completely useless. If a player wants to be an absolute threat on the outskirts of the map, then the DM-10 is going to be a great option for them. A marksman rifle is better than a sniper rifle because it won't limit a person with a slow rate of fire. Being able to get more shots off quicker is great for keeping the shots coming at a target.

 <p>
  The DM-10 is the best marksman rifle in the game as well, bringing a burstfire shot that can
  <strong>
   down a target in one go
  </strong>
  . If this is missed, then the player can quickly get another one off to take their opponent out. It's a forgiving weapon that can be a real treat; players should just remember that it's best used outside the hangar where the user can hit more enemies.

  Now, a lot of players are going to gravitate towards the SMGs for much of the close-quarter encounters in the game, leaving shotguns by the wayside. Shotguns haven't had a ton of love in the series over the past several games, but that doesn't mean they can't be useful.

  The Marine SP is the best shotgun in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , serving as a fast weapon to use when in a bind. It may not boast the most powerful of shots, but it makes up for it with its high rate of fire. When running around the hangar, this shotgun can be a real treat to use.

  SMGs are becoming more and more dominant in the meta of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  , and when there is a gun like the Jackal PDW, it is easy to see why. It has some of the best mobility in its class, can shred through opponents, and is easy to use.

 <p>
  The only downside is that it does not come with the best time-to-kill of all the SMGs, which means that, if shots are missed, a player runs the risk of having their opponent counter them effectively. However, this is far from a deal-breaker and shouldn't keep anyone from trying it out on Subsonic.

 <p>
  Rounding out this list is the PP 919, another SMG that does things a little differently. At first glance, its subpar time-to-kill may seem like a big drawback, as it doesn't have a very strong punch to its shots.

 <p>
  However, this is made up for by its effective range, which is one of the best in the SMG category and turns it into a surprisingly effective tool from a distance. With it, players won't have to worry about getting as close as possible to their target and can stay back to pepper them from afar.

  has shared the first official look at Rinascita, the second nation of Solaris-3 coming in Version 2.0. Kuro Games also confirmed the release date of

  Since its launch in May 2024,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  has consistently grown in popularity among players. Not only has the game become a strong contender in the open-world gacha genre, but
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  has also been nominated for The Game Awards in the Best Mobile Game category. Earlier this month,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  released its 1.4 patch with the debut of Resonators Camellya and Lumi. There were rumors that Version 1.4 would be the last update set in the Huanglong nation. Now, Kuro Games has confirmed these speculations, as a new region is coming to the game.

  Through a video shared on social media,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  has revealed a first look at the nation of Rinascita in Version 2.0. Developer Kuro Games confirmed that the update will arrive on January 2, as soon as Version 1.4 wraps up. Some details were also revealed about Rinascita's main plot. Rover's companion, Abby, is showing strange symptoms of sleepiness and hunger. To cure Abby, the main character will leave Huanglong and The Black Shores and travel to Ragunna, a vibrant city in Rinascita that is marked by masked carnivals. Finally, the video showed some of Ragunna's scenery, creatures, and two new characters. Although leaving Huanglong so early is a double-edged sword for
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , fans may be excited to know that Rinascita has in store for them.

  According to Kuro Games, Rinascita's Sentinel is anticipating a Carnevale, an event that might intertwine with Rover's arrival. The developer has not confirmed who Rover will confront in the next update, but earlier
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  leaks about Phrolova hinted that she might be the main antagonist of Version 2.0. So far in the game's main story, players have discovered very little about Rover's identity, but the Rinascita quest might answer more questions about the main character's past.

  Two mysterious new characters can be seen in Rinascita's trailer. The first is a short female with a blue and pink outfit whose Tacet Mark can be seen on her right leg, which would confirm her as a future playable character. The second character seems to be a tall female in white and red clothes but without a visible Tacet Mark. However, both of the character's models have previously been leaked within the
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  community, with their names rumored to be Roccia and Carlotta, respectively. Other leaks reported that Roccia's name could also be Rococo.

  Farming Simulator 25 is a major step forward for the series, ensuring players have access to a wide range of new features and improvements. The game features 25 new crops, 8 new species of livestock that include baby animals, town and construction projects, and new maps. These new maps are Riverbed Springs, Hutan Pantai, and Zielonka.

  <strong>
   Zielonka
  </strong>
  is a humble and well-designed map, following the standard sizing and based in Central Europe, likely inspired by Polish farmland. It is relatively simple in design, but also very uniform and visually pleasing as a result. The map features a large main road through the center of the area that contains fields, and has a series of narrower roads in order to navigate to the fields. Zielonka was already featured in
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 22
  </em>
  as the fifth map (included in the premium expansion). This means that Zielonka isn't wholly unique to players who are familiar with
  <em>
   Farming Simulator
  </em>
  and its previous entries.

 <p>
  Zielonka contains a lot of plots, nearly 100 in total. It isn't the easiest to navigate, given the narrow roads and the separation between the farmland. This means that travel time is higher than average, and newer players may find it inconvenient to get from field to field. Despite the inconvenience of navigation and traversal, Zielonka does feature highly uniform and geometric fields that offer a great deal of visual coherence to the area. This, coupled with the flat terrain, means that experienced players will be able to excel and use the high number of fields to their advantage, be it through planting crops or managing livestock.

  <strong>
   Hutan Pantai
  </strong>
  is the first-ever
  <em>
   Farming Simulator
  </em>
  map to be set in Asia. Great care was taken in its design, with there being more built-up areas that reflect the nightlife of Asian cities, with markets and restaurants. The general farmable landscape, and the terrain that surrounds the fields, are very authentic and rendered beautifully with the graphical improvements of
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  . The dichotomy of the farmland, compared to the city area, then again compared to the humble temple area, allows for a varied and authentic East Asian setting. Players can progress on the Temple Grounds construction project on Hutan Pantai, allowing them to restore some of the cultural identity of the map.

 <p>
  Hutan Pantai has a variety of plots, uniquely placed to fit the theme. This does mean that some fields and plots are awkward to get to, sometimes split over two elevations, especially as seen with the rice paddies. Despite this, many players find this adds to the overall immersion and design of the map, as many real East Asian rice paddies are laid out in this way. Hutan Pantai also features classic and authentic East Asian farming equipment and techniques, seen with the older style water pumps on the rice paddies and some of the farming equipment itself. As aforementioned, despite its beauty and solid design, some newer players may find Hutan Pantai slightly awkward to navigate given its uneven terrain, although the design and setting of the map is wholly unique and likely to attract many players for that reason.

  <strong>
   Riverbed Springs
  </strong>
  is a classic American
  <em>
   Farming Simulator
  </em>
  map. It contains the second-largest number of fields on an American map in the series, ranking third overall in the number of fields (at 76 total). The map has a picturesque river that crosses through the location and can be crossed using a ferry fit for transporting farming equipment. These water elements are a core design feature of the map, merging classic American farmhouses and fields with a unique trait that allows for it to stand out among other American maps in the series. It includes the highest number of construction projects in the game, featuring four in total, compared to the one that each other map has.

  Riverbed Springs is great for both new and returning players, mostly due to its large, easily farmable fields and friendly topography that facilitates ease of navigation. Riverbed Springs is mostly flat, and thus it is easily navigable, appealing to newer players. It is especially good for newer players, given the fact that there is an optional tutorial that takes place only on Riverbed Springs, acting as a solid introduction to the series. Veterans of the series will be thankful for the ease of navigation on Riverbed Springs, as well as its large number of sizable fields that allow for solid crop and livestock diversity. These large, well-laid-out fields also massively increase the ability to organize effectively. If those elements weren't enough, all players can work towards the many construction projects on the map, allowing for a plethora of content that ensures Riverbed Springs is the most well-rounded map in the game.

    <ul>
     <li>
      The Witcher 3 presents players with morally complex decisions that lack clear good or evil outcomes.
     </li>
     <li>
      Key decisions in the game involve sparing abusive figures, sacrificing for the greater good, and navigating political alliances.
     </li>

      Players face dilemmas like choosing between harsh pragmatism and patriotic romanticism, questioning the impact of their choices.

 <p>
  Very few games succeed at making players feel the weight of moral decisions like
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
   </em>
  </strong>
  does. Players can expect to deal with a variety of complex decision-making situations, including political manipulation, human-monster liaising, and relating to ordinary human struggles. The game doesn't always draw a black-and-white line in certain scenarios, and players will frequently find themselves walking a gray moral path with neither of their choices making any significant impact on the situation.

 <p>
  As players take on the role of Geralt of Rivia, they must also balance personal loyalties and professional obligations as they play through the gripping main story and equally exciting side quests.
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  stands out for its ability to keep the player questioning the impact of their choices, and sometimes these decisions aren't simply good or evil.

  The Bloody Baron is one of the first main NPCs players can encounter upon arriving in Velen. The initial interaction eventually leads to the baron asking Geralt to help find his missing wife and daughter. As the quest unfolds, players will uncover the baron's abusive past and the mistreatment of his wife and daughter.

 <p>
  As Geralt gathers evidence on the whereabouts of the baron's family, he learns that his wife, Anna, is cursed and trapped by the Crones, and his daughter, Tamara, has sought refuge with the Witch Hunters. The outcome of the quest varies depending on how players choose to deal with the baron, and as a result, they could witness Anna succumbing to the curse, Tamara never reconciling with her father, or the baron ending up dead. So, it's up to the player to decide whether an abusive man like the baron deserves a shot at redeeming himself or leaving his family in shambles.

 <p>
  In the Whispering Hillock quest, Geralt encounters a spirit trapped in a large tree, and he's given a choice between saving or slaying it. Unfortunately, choosing either to kill or save the spirit results in negative consequences, with the primary difference being the severity.

 <p>
  What makes the situation with the Whispering Hillock delicate is that this spirit offers Geralt an option to save the orphans that have been taken hostage by the crones. However, setting the spirit free will lead to the massacre of Downwarren village. So, it's up to the players to choose between the lesser and greater evils.

 <p>
  One of the first familiar faces Geralt meets in Velen is Kiera Metz. Geralt's engagement with the sorceress unlocks a series of new quests, which both provide exposition on the politics of the land and highlight her motivations. As the game progresses, Kiera considers a bargain with Radovid in hopes of absolving herself from the Logde's association. She decides to move forward with this plan despite knowing all too well the Redanian king's hatred for mages and sorceresses.

 <p>
  Choosing to support Kiera in her decision to seek an alliance with Radovid results in her barbaric death later in the game. Rebuking her from turning over the notes to the king turns her into an enemy, resulting in a bitter battle. However, Geralt can also convince her to seek refuge at Kaer Morhen, which turns her into a formidable ally during the Battle of Kaer Morhen. What makes this decision morally gray for the player is the inability to judge the potential consequences of their choice, with two of them unraveling in mid-game and one immediately.

  The
  <em>
   Blood and Wine
  </em>
  expansion in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  culminates in Geralt having to choose between killing or sparing Dettlaff, a serial-killing higher vampire. After Geralt pieces together the evidence regarding the mysterious murders, it becomes apparent that Dettlaff was both a victim and a murderer. He was manipulated and forced to carry out the brutal murders by a woman that he presumed to love him.

 <p>
  If the player chooses to kill Dettlaff, they risk severing their relationship with Regis, but if they spare the higher vampire, the Duchesses' sister dies. At this moment, players must tread the thin ice that separates humans and non-humans and navigate the dynamics of both species.

  Gaunter O'Dimm is an enigmatic character who plays a central role in the
  <em>
   Hearts of Stone
  </em>
  expansion. However, after a few interactions with this man, it becomes evident to the player that he isn't just an ordinary merchant and there's something more sinister about him. In the expansion, Gaunter O'Dimm traps another key NPC, Olgierd von Everec, who trades his soul for immortality without understanding the deeper consequences of his decision.

 <p>
  Throughout the length of the expansion, Geralt learns about Olgierd von Everec's horrid past and the mistreatment of his now-late wife. However, Olgierd in the present is a broken man who constantly regrets his past actions and wishes to see a peaceful death. It is up to Geralt to decide whether to save a man who wishes to absolve himself of his past actions and get a second shot at living his life, or walk away and let the devil play by his twisted rules.

 <p>
  In the Reason of State quest, Geralt must decide the political future of the North by assassinating King Radovid V. Players must choose between Sigismund Dijkstra, a cunning strategist who can offer stability and pseudo-independence while ruling with an iron fist, or Vernon Roche, a loyal patriot who concerns himself with liberating Temeria at the cost of Northern independence.

 <p>
  Supporting Dijkstra ensures that the North remains independent albeit with civil liberties suppressed, while backing Roche promotes his ideals of resistance against tyrannical rule but leaves the North under Nilfgaard's rule. This choice can have players ponder the difference between harsh pragmatism and patriotic romanticism with no perfect outcome in sight.

  In the Ghosts of the Past quest, Geralt encounters Letho of Gulet, an infamous kingslayer, who is on the run after being used and disowned by the emperor of Nilfgaard. Geralt finds Letho hiding from bounty hunters who are after his head, and at this moment, the player can choose to either help Letho or leave the witcher to attend to his problems.

 <p>
  Choosing to save Letho involves faking his death and then asking him to seek refuge at Kaer Morhen, where the infamous witcher can live a life free from his bloody past. Letho's fate is determined by the player's choice between justice and compassion, questioning whether a man who threw the Northern kingdoms into chaos and turmoil should walk away without facing any consequences.

  In Novigrad, Geralt can pick up a contract to hunt down an elusive thief, and tracking it down leads the White Wolf to uncover the thief's identity as a Doppler. Threatening the thief to reveal the motivations behind the recurring thefts highlights its struggles at surviving in a society that won't think twice before damning it to death.

  While Doppler's actions are criminal, they haven't caused bodily harm to anyone. So,

  it's up to the player to decide whether the impostor should be warned and set free or exact justice by handing it over to the authorities, leading to its potential execution.

  Tamed Monsters can only be used in the Arena, and can't jump into battle like in other
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  games. The Monster Arena is a great source of rewards to make your main party stronger; here's how it works and how to get the most out of it.

  It's important to know that all monsters that are tamed have a set level, stats, and skills. This means you'll need to progress the game and
  <strong>
   find monsters in later areas in order to take on the more challenging fights
  </strong>
  . Each monster has its own Attribute pages which can be seen at Monty or when making your team at the Arena Host. These attributes have the same effects as those on the main party, with spells and abilities also working the same.

 <p>
  The main gimmick when fighting in the Monster Arena is that
  <strong>
   all monsters only act only based on tactics
  </strong>
  and not direct commands. Before each round of combat, you'll be given the chance to change the tactics of each monster before proceeding with that round of combat. There is no way to alter how your monsters fight, so you'll have to pick the strongest options, pair them up right, and pick the right tactics for their attributes and attacks.

 <p>
  Each rank of fights will have multiple bouts, with your
  <strong>
   HP and MP not regenerating between battles
  </strong>
  . This furthers the importance of finding a good support monster with decent healing, otherwise, the multiple fights in a row will slowly wear down your party.

  Rewards For The Monster Arena
 </h3>
 <p>
  Rewards from the Monster Arena will gradually increase as you take on higher ranks. These rewards will always contain
  <strong>
   gold but also have very powerful accessories and gear
  </strong>
  that usually aren't obtainable until later in the game. Overall the Monster Arena is completely optional, though the rewards make it well worth the time if you can track down the right monsters.

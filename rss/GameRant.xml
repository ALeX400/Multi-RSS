      <title>NBA 2K25: 5 Best Playbooks</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/nba-2k25-best-playbooks/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  An NBA team is only as good as the plays they run. They can have some of the best players in the league, but without running the proper plays, they won't be very successful. This applies to
  <strong>
   <em>
    NBA 2K25
   </em>
  </strong>
  as well. Knowing which plays can best help bring your team to life can be the key difference between victory and defeat. This is why some of the best teams in the history of the NBA have some of the best playbooks.

  Luckily, the game
  <strong>
   brings a ton of these playbooks
  </strong>
  for players to choose from. This way, players won't have to worry about constructing the perfect playbook for themselves, though that is still possible. This guide is here to lay out which playbooks are the best options for players to bring with them as they create their perfect roster and players.

  The Celtics dominated the 80sm for a reason and this playbook shows players exactly why. It gives players plenty of scoring options from just about any range, and has a good amount of movement to
  <strong>
   keep things interesting
  </strong>
  . It can spread the defense out to create any kind of play you could want.

  Using this playbook will make sure that players can get their shooters open
  <strong>
   through either passing or isolation plays
  </strong>
  . Gamers can expect to find plenty of plays that work for them regardless of if they are going for a three-pointer or even posting up down low.

 <p>
  Alongside the Celtics, the Lakers saw an incredible run in the 80s with the likes of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar leading the way. This playbook brings the best of that team to life through a diverse array of plays that can help players get the right people open.

 <p>
  Further, if the talent of the point guard can meet that of Magic Johnson,
  <strong>
   this playbook can truly shine
  </strong>
  . Much of the Lakers' success in the 80s was because Johnson proved why he is one of the best point guards in history. Doing the same means that players can expect the same results.

 <p>
  The Bulls had a dynasty in the 90s for a reason, and their playbook from 1996 shows exactly why. While the book is designed to give plenty of isolation opportunities for Jordan, there are also a handful of games that offer others the chance to shine. Utilizing Phil Jackson's famous Triangle Offense, this playbook
  <strong>
   has some great movement and opens up the court
  </strong>
  for scoring from any position. It makes sense to have one of the playbooks for one of the greatest teams in NBA history.

  There's not much that can be said about the 2001 Lakers that hasn't already been said by countless people. The team was incredible, using the talent of Kobe Bryant and Shaq to their full potential. They won the championship due to skill
  <strong>
   and the right plays being called.

  The 2013 Heat was something else,
  <strong>
   offering electric scoring and just dominant play
  </strong>
  . Erik Spoelstra dialed up an incredible playbook that used his players to their full effect. This included sharp shooting from Dwyane Wade, physical dominance from LeBron James, and incredible inside play from Chris Bosh. Using this playbook is pretty easy to understand, and it can work for a variety of different teams and their compositions. It's easy to learn and can
  <strong>
   make your team so much better
  </strong>
  .

  Photography is one of the finest arts in the world, as it has allowed people to record pieces of history and beautiful moments ever since it was invented. While it's always better to experience things first-hand, having a snapshot of an iconic moment is priceless—and with the Photo Mode in many open-world games, that's now possible in players' favorite titles.

   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

  is famous for its beautiful landscapes across the kingdom of Hyrule. There are high towers, large green areas, mysterious ruins and tons of fantastical elements that players can enjoy and take photos of. To take photos in the game, players will first have to obtain the precious camera Rune, which isn't too hard to come by and is well worth it.

  Set in a post-apocalyptic version of Earth, centuries after technologically advanced humans destroyed one another,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon: Zero Dawn

  presents the ideal scenery for a wide range of different photographically-oriented opportunities. One of the most interesting visual aspects of this game is the incredible contrast between a world that's mostly been reclaimed by nature and the mechanical animals that inhabit it.

 <p>
  As opposed to
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  , this title does not require players to unlock a specific ability or item to be able to take photos, as the Photo Mode is already built in from the start of the story. Guerrilla Games did an outstanding job with the game's graphics, which, in turn, results in players being able to take wonderful photos without having to struggle too much to find the right angle or thing to capture.
  <em>
   Horizon: Zero Dawn
  </em>
  also has great weather variety, so players have a wide range of options between warm, sunny weather, and snowy, cold environments to choose from.

  Most people who've ever watched an anime or a documentary filmed in Japan know how beautiful the country is and how perfect its landscapes are for taking amazing photographs that could win a contest.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Tsushima
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the perfect representation of the real-life Japanese island of Tsushima in terms of its rich vegetation, open environments, and beautiful green prairies. There's also traditional Japanese architecture that is not only historically accurate but also a great complement to the title's overall appearance.

  One of the things that make
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  great is how realistic its particle effects and vegetation movements are, reacting with the wind in a very believable and natural way. This, along with the great horseback riding physics and the game's detailed graphics make for the perfect photography setting that players can take advantage of through the built-in Photo Mode feature. Whether players choose to take pictures of Tsushima's beautiful natural landscapes, a small town, or an epic standoff between Jin Sakai and an enemy, one thing's for sure—there will always be a nearly endless set of possibilities.

   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not only regarded by players as one of the greatest games Rockstar has ever released, but one of the greatest games of all time. This is due to its incredible story, amazing game mechanics, vast open world, and, of course, complete Photo Mode.

  's map is so big, that players can explore a big part of US territory from that era. From the French-influenced city of Saint Denis (based on real-life New Orleans), to the mountainous regions of Valentine, which is said to be modeled after Valentine, Nebraska, players will never have a shortage of locations to use as scenery. Depending on players' preferences, they might opt to use Photo Mode to take pictures of Arthur Morgan as he rides through US territory on horseback, or to capture heart-racing moments where bullets are flying through the air.

   <em>
    The Witcher 3

  </strong>
  is arguably one of the best open-world RPGs set in medieval times, and certainly the best installment in the franchise so far. Not only does this title have the right amount of fantasy, but it also has an incredible story that works well with all the side quests available and its two wonderful DLCs. Both horseback riding and on-foot exploration feel very exciting, and the combat game mechanics are very well-designed, offering enough control for skilled players to be able to complete the game in Death March, the hardest difficulty available.

  Sony has updated its list of games that are getting
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5 Pro
  </strong>
  upgrades. The upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro boasts a hefty price tag, but for some, it may be worth the investment. For a whopping $699.99, the PlayStation 5 Pro offers gamers significant performance enhancements, like letting them play games at 60 frames per second while not sacrificing graphical fidelity.

  The PS5 Pro has been hugely controversial since it was first announced. Many fans balked at the PS5 Pro's super high price, though it's worth pointing out that it's not the most expensive PlayStation console when adjusted for inflation. Others came around a bit when they saw the PS5 Pro's 30th Anniversary edition. It will be interesting to see how well the PS5 Pro does when it's all said and done, and if enough games get PS5 Pro-specific upgrades to justify buying it.

  Sony confirmed the PS5 Pro upgrades in a sizzle reel that showcased the previously-confirmed titles with the new batch of games coming to the system. The trailer made clear that the new console will definitely let players get the most out of their games, but the jury is still out on whether the upgrades justify the PS5 Pro's incredibly high price point.

  As customization options in video games have grown as a key selling point for fans, the ability to alter the cosmetics of the hardware those titles are played on has also become more popular. With offerings such as the exclusive
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  controller, the 30th Anniversary Collection, and now the Chroma Collection, PlayStation seems keen on helping fans get the most out of their
  <strong>
   PS5
  </strong>
  gaming experience.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Horizon Zero Dawn
   </strong>
  </em>
  is officially being remastered for both the PlayStation 5 and PC. Featuring a graphical update that brings the game up to the level of its sequel,
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  is available worldwide on October 31.

  When it was first released in 2017 for PlayStation 4 – and in 2020 for PC –
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  began a brand-new sci-fi franchise centered on Aloy, a quick-thinking huntress of the Nora tribe. Fans explored the apocalyptic ruins of the United States as they uncovered the truth behind the end of the old world, saving the new one in the process. The game received a sequel in the form of
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  in 2022, with a third and assumedly final
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  entry expected to be revealed in the next couple of years.

  However, it seems like players will have the chance to experience the series’ beginning in a whole new way well before that. During the recent Sony State of Play, Guerrilla Games officially revealed
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  is coming to both PlayStation 5 and PC on October 31. This revamped version of the original game features hours of re-recorded motion capture, graphical fidelity on par with
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  , and improvements to take full advantage of modern PC and PlayStation 5 features to enhance both visuals and performance.

  The remastered version of
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  will also include accessibility features introduced in
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  , including remappable controls, haptic cues, and assist toggles. What’s more, the remaster can read old save data, meaning players can pick up in the new version of
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  exactly where they left off in the original.
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  will also be available on PlayStation 5 Pro when it releases on November 7.

  Were that not exciting enough,
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  – a light-hearted spin-off of the main series – is coming out on November 14, just a couple of weeks after
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  . These two new releases are certain to be great refreshers ahead of
  <em>
   Horizon 3
  </em>
  and its likely conclusion of Aloy’s epic adventure.

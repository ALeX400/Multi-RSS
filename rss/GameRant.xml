  player historic_alien shared a look at their space-themed island map layout, putting a unique sci-fi twist on the often "cottagecore" aesthetic of
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  . Terraforming, or the ability to alter the geographical layout of a landscape, is a new feature introduced in
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  , making it a massive addition to the
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  series. For players wanting to control their island map layout in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  , the terraforming feature can be a game changer. As showcased by historic_alien, players can redirect waterways, alter terrain types, and raise or lower landforms. In doing so, fans can customize their island map layout, offering up exciting creative opportunities, such as terraforming the land to look like stars, moons, planets, and even flying saucers and rocket ships.

  Terraforming in Animal Crossing: New Horizons
 </h2>
 <p>
  To unlock terraforming in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  , players will need to complete the main story of the game. This requires building and finishing the Museum and Nook's Cranny, bringing more residents to the island, and achieving an overall island rating of three stars. Once the story is complete, K.K. Slider will visit the island and perform the game's main theme song. After the performance, Tom Nook gifts the player the Island Designer app. With the Island Designer, players are then able to start terraforming in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  , letting their creativity run wild across their island.

  Released in 2004,

  There is never a shortage of things to do in

  In truth,
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  share very few things in common. The former is a crafting and survival game that focuses on PvE. Players will spend most of their time exploring biomes in search of resources they can use to develop their bases and craft better items. It is a straightforward concept that works very well, and
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  is one of those releases that can easily consume someone's life for months on end. Despite combat being fairly prominent, the early-access game is surprisingly relaxing, and players are generally encouraged to do their own thing. Co-op is also supported.

 <p>
  So,
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  is a different beast than
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  ; however, it can deliver a comparable feel to Blizzard's MMO, even if its components are different. They both present immersive worlds that players can get happily lost in, and their controls and movements are somewhat similar too.

  A multiplayer looter-shooter that is absolutely brimming with content,
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  is a game that needs no introduction. This title is essentially a perfect sequel that improves on all the mechanics of its predecessor, and a free-to-play version is available for newcomers who are not sure if they want to invest in the expansions.

 <p>
  As a result, the volume of content in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  is off the charts, with the weapons in this game being quite fresh and engaging to use. Suffice it to say, fans who love World of Warcraft and want to combine its gameplay elements with that of a robust first-person shooter will be more than well-serviced by the uninhibited brilliance of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . Players who are on the fringe when it comes to such titles should definitely give
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  a chance — they won't be disappointed in the slightest.

  <em>
   Kingdoms of Amalur
  </em>
  has had an interesting life. Originally released in 2012, the action RPG garnered a mostly positive reception thanks to its versatile hack and slash combat, which was arguably among the genre's best at the time. However, behind-the-scenes issues caused the game to disappear for a few years, at least until a remaster was published in 2020. The latter even received an expansion.

 <p>
  A single-player experience,
  <em>
   Kingdoms of Amalur
  </em>
  takes place in Faelands, a vibrant realm that does just enough to differentiate itself from most other fantasy kingdoms. While the story is nothing amazing, the gameplay is a great deal of fun, even if it does feel a bit dated by modern standards.

  The initial release of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  was nothing short of a disaster. However, Square Enix had the hindsight to pull the plug on this title and re-release it after all the kinks were sorted out. The result was
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn
  </em>
  , one of the greatest MMORPGs of all time. It fixed almost everything wrong in the previous iteration, with its expansions being universally beloved by fans. Players seeking out
  <strong>
   games like
   <em>
    World of Warcraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  will certainly be well-serviced by this title.

 <p>
  Now, it should be said that while both games fall under the general MMORPG bracket, they are not actually all that similar in terms of gameplay and mechanics.
  <em>
   FF14
  </em>
  shines in its storytelling, slower-paced combat, job combo build variety, housing system, and a less intensive endgame. These elements combine to create a gameplay loop that feels very different from
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  , with neither project being necessarily better than the other. They are also both significant time sinks.

  Larian Studios crowd-funded this now smash-hit top-down RPG in their
  <em>
   Divinity
  </em>
  series. But this game takes place long after the events of the first
  <em>
   Original Sin
  </em>
  title. It places players as a custom character or one of 6 pre-made people with unique stories and plenty of ways to derail the main narrative.

  The game harbors hundreds of choices from what order to do quests to whether or not that Magister who spoke down to the player lives to see nightfall.

  Inspired by
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Neverwinter
  </em>
  has been around since the early 2010s, and Crytic's free-to-play MMORPG has had an up-and-down life since then. While "new" compared to
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Neverwinter
  </em>
  is cut from the same cloth as Blizzard's eternal project, especially in terms of quest design and combat. Containing 12 playable races and an array of classes, the MMO gives players a respectable range of customization options to allow them to craft the hero best suited for them.

 <p>
  Although grinding is undoubtedly part of the overall package,
  <em>
   Neverwinter
  </em>
  provides a decent entry-level experience by streamlining the main campaign's early hours, permitting new players to reach the level cap quite quickly. However, once that point is reached, the focus shifts to item level, which is quite a time investment.

  No single-player project can scratch the same itch as
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  . Much of the latter's appeal rests on its multiplayer and community, and solo titles cannot replicate that element. However, a few developers have tried to translate the MMO blueprint into a standard single-player campaign, and none have arguably done it better than Monolith Soft. The
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles
  </em>
  games are ambitious open-world RPGs that (usually) tell engrossing stories while featuring combat systems that gradually layer a billion mechanics on top of each other.

  While some entries are more divisive than others, they are all fantastic in their own right, including the underappreciated Wii U spin-off,
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles X
  </em>
  . Newcomers who are not sure where to start should go with either
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles 3
  </em>
  . The former is an all-time classic, while the latter represents the series at its most accessible since it actually explains its battle system in a way that makes sense.

  Another dungeon crawler like
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  , this game expounds upon the genre with dozens of possible builds. It might not be an MMORPG, but the game's breadth of content isn't exactly lacking. It's a nice alternative for MMO players who want something a bit more personal.

  Though a fantastic co-op game,
  <em>
   Grim Dawn
  </em>
  makes for a challenging and fun solo game, as well. It's a little less hardcore than
  <em>
   Path of Exile

  , too, so players who might be new to the genre or hesitant to pay a subscription fee for an MMORPG can get their feet wet.

  <em>
   Black Desert
  </em>
  is established as a cornerstone of the MMORPG sphere, and it is even set to get a successor in
  <em>
   Crimson Desert
  </em>
  . While waiting for the latter to become a reality, newcomers can jump into Peal Abyss' active game, which is not free-to-play but is regularly on sale for very low prices. Now, it should be noted that
  <em>
   Black Desert
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  are wildly different experiences, and fans of the latter should only check out the former if they are craving a change of pace. More importantly, the endgame is entirely devoted to grinding gear and can be a money sink, so ignore this one if that does not sound remotely appealing.

  <em>
   Black Desert
  </em>
  shines in two main areas: combat and graphics. The world is arguably among the most beautiful in the genre, and the game's high production value is evident throughout the campaign. The combo-driven combat system is flashy and exciting as it leans into character action territory, and it is more than enjoyable enough to keep someone entertained while they are grinding to level 60.

  Whether players choose to play
  <em>
   OldSchool RuneScape
  </em>
  or the new
  <em>
   RuneScape,
  </em>
  there is much incentive to get into this free-to-play game. It's one of those games with a subscription option, but it's not required.
  <em>

  heavily influenced later massively multiplayer games.

  Though the graphics are basic, almost everyone agrees that the gameplay is phenomenal. One can fish, mine, blacksmith, cook, and more. The Steam release has crossplay with mobile users and makes a relaxing game to play with friends.

  BioWare's
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  is one of the biggest IPs in the Western RPG genre. All three games are good-to-great in their own right, and while
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  is generally regarded as the franchise's peak,
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  is the best pick for
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  fans. The 2014 game opts for a more action-oriented battle system than earlier entries, and the combat does have an MMO feel to it.

  After creating a character from a range of races, players step into the role of the Inquisitor as they are tasked with stopping a continuous invasion of demons.
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  is split into self-contained but fairly open maps, each of which contains side quests along with plenty of loot.

  <em>
   Star Wars: The Old Republic
  </em>
  was Electronic Arts' most expensive video game to develop and market when it was released. This expansive game takes players to various worlds in the
  <em>

  </em>
  universe. The ability to play as a Jedi or Sith gives this game much replay value. One can also choose to be a commando as they participate in group quests as well as single-player ones.

  Even if it struggled to live up to its initial promises, the
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  franchise mostly consists of decent-to-great action RPGs that are overflowing with personality, humor, and whimsy. Admittedly, the trilogy might hit differently with people who did not grow up on them, but they are still charming adventures with decent personality customization, simple combat, and semi-open worlds. The first two games are particularly worth trying, while the third one was and still is polarizing for a reason.

  Obviously,
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  are very different in most areas, and the latter is only for people who are craving self-contained single-player RPGs. That said, they both give players quite a bit of freedom in crafting their characters' journeys and dispositions, with
  <em>
   Fable
  </em>
  allowing the protagonist to act pretty evil if that is the direction someone would like to go.

  The Jatayu's nest is located in the northwestern corner of the West Shinbashi region, with a small path leading up the mountain to the creature's nest above. The path up is narrow, making it impossible to dodge the Jatayu should it fly at the player from above. If you want to just run past the creature,
  <strong>
   lure it lower to the ground where you can run around it
  </strong>
  and up the path. Once past it, the Nahobino will run faster than the beast can fly.

  Jatayu has a high base Agility, and will often buff itself using Sukukaja to further its accuracy and evasion rate. Instead of trying to debuff it, increase your party's accuracy and evasion rate with Sukukaja to nullify the bonuses Jatayu is getting. Jatayu will often use Zanma, and
  <strong>
   having a demon that blocks Force, such as Fortuna, will end Jatayu's turn whenever this move is used
  </strong>
  .

  Jatayu also has Critical Wave, which it will often use after gathering Magatsuhi energy to deal massive damage. When you see this happen,
  <strong>
   make your whole party guard to make sure they survive the incoming attack
  </strong>
  . Jatayu has a very large health bar, and MP management will be key throughout this long fight, so be sure to bring a few powerful backup demons.

  One of Jatayu's
  <strong>
   weaknesses is Dark, making Legion a great option for this battle

 <p>
  Graphic adventures have struggled to attract mainstream attention since the 90s. Games like The Secret of Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, and Day of the Tentacle captured the imagination of players throughout the decade, but the genre had a sharp fall out of relevancy in the 2000s, largely due to its inability to innovate and keep up with ever-changing trends. 12 Minutes, however, is a 2021 adventure game that has no problem feeling fresh and innovative.

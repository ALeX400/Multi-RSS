  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
   </em>
  </strong>
  throws Captain America and Black Panther deep into the conflict of World War 2, forcing the two characters to team up against Hydra. There have been some great Marvel-based games in recent years, like Insomniac's
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  franchise and
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   Marvel 1943:
  </em>
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  takes a new turn by diving into how the titular terrorist organization came to life.

 <p>
  There may not be much known about
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  at the moment, but based on what bits and pieces can be gathered from the trailer, the Howling Commandos are set to play a major part in the story. In Marvel canon, the Howling Commandos were an elite force of soldiers tasked with taking down Nazis and other threats from the Axis powers during World War 2. This era provides plenty of opportunities for
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  to feature some great Marvel characters, but one of the main questions revolves around the Howling Commando's leader; Nick Fury Sr.

  Nick Fury is Currently Missing From Rise of Hydra
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Howling Commandos were a force to be reckoned with in World War 2 under Nick Fury's command, but he's nowhere to be seen in the trailer. There is a lot of speculation about what characters could make a surprise appearance in
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  , and Nick Fury almost seems like a given. Not only is he an iconic character, but as the head of the Howling Commandos, it would be surprising for him to not be in the game. However, it looks as though the special squadron may have its main representative through the character of Gabe Jones.

  Gabe Jones' Role in the Story
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the trailer for
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  , there were only a few glimpses of Gabe Jones, but it's clear that he will play an important role in the overall story. As one of the four main characters players will get to know, Gabe Jones has been featured in both Marvel Comics and
  <em>
   Captain America: The First Avenger
  </em>
  . It's clear that he will be the main face of the Howling Commandos, but that doesn't mean Nick Fury's presence will be completely left out.

 <p>
  There are bound to be plenty of surprises in store for
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  , and Nick Fury being given at least some sort of cameo is a direction that the game's story will likely take. However, there is still the real possibility that Nick Fury remains nowhere to be seen, leaving Gabe Jones as the sole member of the Howling Commandos featured. Nick Fury being left in the shadows could actually prove to be an interesting way for a new character to present insight into the special forces group.

 <h3 id="the-howling-commandos-in-the-spotlight">
  The Howling Commandos in the Spotlight
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Howling Commandos are clearly one of the main points of focus in the game, but this can still be done without Nick Fury's obvious presence. Captain America and Black Panther are already iconic Marvel characters, who will get most of the attention in the game, and featuring Gabe Jones and Nanali presents the opportunity to further explore lesser-known characters. Throwing Nick Fury into the mix could potentially overshadow Gabe Jones and his role in the Howling Commandos.

 <p>
  Nick Fury is one of Marvel Comics' most beloved characters, but
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  could be the perfect opportunity to give other characters a chance in the spotlight. If Nick Fury is eventually revealed in some capacity, it may be best for the character to play a less prominent role in the overall story. This leaves
  <em>
   Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  with an important choice to make about how it handles the Howling Commandos, and it will be fascinating to see which route the game takes.

  Beginning June 18,
  <em>
   Knightfall: A Daring Journey
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  will be free to keep on
  <strong>
   Steam
  </strong>
  . While free game giveaways are harder to predict on Steam than the Epic Games Store, Steam users are still treated to free games on a semi-regular basis.

 <p>
  Last month was an especially exciting time for Steam users, as even more free games were given away than usual.
  <em>
   100% Orange Juice
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Endless Legend
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Machinika Museum
  </em>
  were just a few of the free Steam games given away in May, and while it doesn't seem like June is going to exceed May's offerings, there are still freebies for fans to claim this month.

 <p>
  One such freebie will become available to Steam users starting Tuesday, June 18. On that day, Steam users will be able to claim
  <em>
   Knightfall: A Daring Journey
  </em>
  completely free of charge. For those unfamiliar with the game,
  <em>
   Knightfall: A Daring Journey
  </em>
  is a 28-player battle royale game where the goal is to team up with one other player to reach the castle and pluck a rose. The game has a "Very Positive" overall reception on Steam, but its more recent reviews are "Mixed." This is because it's become increasingly more difficult for fans to actually get into games of
  <em>
   Knightfall: A Daring Journey
  </em>
  , which is something that will hopefully be rectified by making it a completely free download.

  Unlike many other free games, there will be no time limit on when Steam users can claim

  free indefinitely starting June 18 because the game's servers are not populated enough for people to actually play it. By making it free, the hope is that the game's matchmaking problems will be a thing of the past and there will consistently be enough people for fans to enjoy the game. Those that may have purchased
  <em>
   Knightfall
  </em>
  recently are encouraged to ask for a refund through Steam, though they may not be eligible if they've played too much.

 <p>
  <em>

  won't be the only free Steam game when it drops its price tag on June 18. From now until July, Steam users also have the chance to claim

  Fans of Ubisoft's new first-person shooter
  <em>
   <strong>
    XDefiant
   </strong>
  </em>
  discuss the most unfair faction abilities to play against.
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  was released just last month and is Ubisoft's long-awaited
  <em>

  competitor. Players can pick from five available factions to play as, each hailing from one of Ubisoft's own popular franchises, with a total of ten different abilities to use across the game's five game modes.

  Having just launched,
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  is currently in preseason. Though that hasn't stopped Ubisoft from revealing the game's first season at its Ubisoft Forward event a few days ago. Landing on July 2, Season 1 of
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  will introduce an all-new faction to play as, GSK from Ubisoft's other hit multiplayer FPS,
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  . Clubhouse, Daytona, and Rockefeller are Season 1's new maps, each set to go live at different points in the season's three-month span. The Season 1 update will also add three free weapons and the exciting new Capture the Flag game mode.

  On Twitter, Ubisoft_UK playfully took the temperature of the
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  community, asking which of the five launch factions are the most annoying to oppose. Surprisingly, only two of the factions were mentioned: the Cleaners from
  <em>
   The Division
  </em>
  and Dedsec from
  <em>
   Watch Dogs
  </em>
  . With the latter, players took issue with the faction's Spiderbot ability, which deploys a small spider-like bot that seeks out opponents and stun-locks them for several long seconds. One player ran into a nightmare of a ranked match which saw the opposing team running four Spiderbots at once.

  Another player's bone to pick was with The Cleaners, who have a passive ability that turns all their bullets into damage-over-time-dealing incendiary rounds, no matter the gun. The player expressed how this passive seems unfair and suggested making the incendiary rounds a limited ability in place of the faction's Incinerator Drone, which they feel is underpowered. It's important to note that while The Cleaners' Incendiary Rounds passive may seem like an unfair advantage, it is countered by decreased damage range. It's surprising that nobody brought up the
  <em>
   Ghost Recon
  </em>
  Phantoms' Blitz Shield, or either of
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  Echelon's very powerful abilities that let players go invisible or see opponents through walls.

  With Season 1 of
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  less than a month away on July 2, Ubisoft has yet to officially divulge the exact set of abilities Team Rainbow's GSK faction will bring to the table. Judging by the trailer, though, it seems Blitz's flash shield from
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  will be one of them.
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  will undoubtedly serve as a wealth of ideas for new factions and abilities Ubisoft can bring to
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  in the future.
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  fans should expect to learn more about GSK's kit, and whether their abilities will cause as many headaches as the Cleaners or Dedsec, during
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  's XDebrief on July 1.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  is showing off Peni Parker, pilot of the high-tech SP//dr armor, in a brand-new gameplay trailer ahead of the game’s closed beta test next month. Back in March, NetEase Games and Marvel Games announced
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , an upcoming free-to-play hero shooter that blends the frantic multiplayer action of titles like
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  with the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe. The game’s roster contains a mix of classic fan favorites and lesser-known Marvel characters as they battle to stop dueling Doctor Doom variants from conquering the multiverse.

 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ’ 21 confirmed playable characters is Peni Parker, an alternate universe version of Peter Paker/Spider-Man who fights crime in a specialized mech suit known as SP//dr. First appearing in the 2014 crossover event
  <em>
   Edge of Spider-Verse
  </em>
  , Peni and her trusty robot battle suit gained greater exposure in recent years due to their appearances in
  <em>
   Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
  </em>
  and last year’s
  <em>
   Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
  </em>
  . Gaming-wise, Peni has been featured as a playable character in mobile titles like
  <em>
   Spider-Man Unlimited
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Marvel Contest of Champions
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Marvel Snap
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Now Peni Parker is stepping into the virtual arena of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , and a new trailer from IGN provides a greater look at her SP//dr mech suit in action. Peni is a Vanguard character, meaning that she will serve in a traditional “Tank” role that can take more damage and protect their teammates. To this end, SP//dr comes equipped with powerful laser cannons and thrusters that allow Peni to slide away from danger. She also has an alternate form that can slash at opponents with spider-leg-like appendages, and it seems to be based on the previously rumored VEN#m Suit from the comics.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  version of Peni Parker might feel familiar to
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  players, as she is a spirited young hero piloting a mech just like D.Va. However, the game’s take on Peni is noticeably older than the one from the
  <em>
   Spider-Verse
  </em>
  films that fans are more familiar with, and it seems she will remain within her SP//dr entirely during
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  matches.

  Gamers have already gotten to try out some of Peni Parker’s abilities for themselves during the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  alpha test back in May, and they will soon get the chance to take the young Spider-hero’s mech for another spin during the recently announced
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  closed beta that will take place in late July. It will be interesting to see how Peni’s Tank-like Vanguard abilities play out in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which still doesn’t have an official release date as of this writing.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   open-world
  </strong>
  genre has become an overwhelmingly popular structure for games of all kinds. From RPGs to TPS and FPS games, even many formerly linear franchises have moved to open-world settings. A good open-world gives players the opportunity to explore and then fulfills that exploration with interesting discoveries. There's vast potential in open-world games, and we still see innovative games that move the genre forward.

 <p>
  Some of these games focus on solo action heroes, while others use the open-world setting to tell the stories of multiple characters. A popular setup for an open-world structured game is assembling a team, maybe to perform a specific job, or maybe to unite against a world-ending threat. There are many takes on this formula, and some open-world games have really nailed the feeling of building a powerful team under the player's command. These are the best open-world games that focus on building a team.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Watch Dogs Legion
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the third installment in Ubisoft's open-world hacking-action franchise. Set in London, the game focuses on assembling an underground Dedsec team from members of the local populace. Different citizens have different professions, sorting them into different archetypes that offer different skills in combat or in the open world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game features the option to play with permadeath enabled, meaning that any team members who die are lost forever. This adds a layer of tension to the gameplay, as team members with valuable skill sets can be difficult to replace quickly. Unfortunately, the game doesn't fully fulfill its promise of an ever-changing urban army, with too many characters falling into similar archetypes and lacking real personality.
  <em>
   Watch Dogs Legion
  </em>
  is still a fun team-building open-world game though.

  One thing that
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Godfather 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  does well is baking the mafia crime family theme into its gameplay systems. Recruiting and promoting
  <em>
   Made Men
  </em>
  is a major part of the gameplay, which mostly revolves around taking control of illicit businesses from other syndicates. Players can recruit four low-level goons, and eventually, they can promote their favorites, creating an underboss with two capos underneath them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Promoted units gain new skills depending on their specializations, and players can take three men with them on missions and when roaming around. Building and developing these additional squad mates is essential as players fight to take control of the various businesses under a rival family's control, with a final showdown at the rival family's compound being the goal.

   <em>
    State of Decay 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a unique take on recruiting and managing a group of survivors in an open-world zombie apocalypse scenario. Survivors have various traits that affect both their attributes in the base and their combat effectiveness. Players have to take care of the survivors' needs, like morale and hunger, and develop their base to keep their survivors safe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can control any survivor, and they can take an AI-controlled companion with them when scavenging or doing missions. That means knowing a survivor's strengths and weaknesses can have a meaningful effect on how players approach a challenge. There's some encouragement to use different survivors too, as accomplishing tasks can improve survivor's skills and their standing in the community. The team is an important part of
  <em>

  </em>
  's gameplay loop.

 </p>
 <p>
  Building an army of orcs under Talion's control is also essential to undermine Sauron's armies from within, and topple the various enemy strongholds around the game's map. With the game's original microtransaction system removed, and the process of building an orc army rebalanced,
  <em>
   Shadow of War
  </em>
  is a satisfying army-building open-world game, and the Nemesis system can keep it fresh for multiple playthroughs.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first game in the franchise to put building a cadre of assassins in the player's hands. As a follow-up to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Brotherhood
  </em>
  tasked Ezio with recruiting a whole new guild of assassins to help with taking down the powerful Templars. Players do this by first liberating Borgia Towers, then recruiting from the local populace, usually by saving citizens from being harassed by guards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recruited assassins are used for both assistance in gameplay and for completing side-tasks via the
  <em>
   Brotherhood
  </em>
  system to gain experience and minor rewards for the player. While the characters all basically performed the same functions and lacked personality, the implementation of the
  <em>
   Brotherhood
  </em>
  system was unique for its time. It influenced many other team-based open-world games going forward.

  The open-world sandbox of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kenshi
   </em>
  </strong>
  puts progress and goal-setting in the hands of the player. A big part of a player's overall strength is determined by the allies they can gather and the community they can build from them. Depending on their allegiances, players can have teammates as diverse as robots, fishermen, and samurai assassins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kenshi works on a practice-to-improve basis for gaining experience and abilities, so players are in charge of how their recruits train and develop. For example, if players want to be stealthy, they have to practice sneaking around, picking locks, and so on. That means that players can build a team with unique specialties to help survive in the harsh open-world, and eventually build a wasteland outpost of their own to rule.

  The pawns of

  </strong>
  may be disposable characters, but building a team to fit around the player's own job choices, and being able to change this as the player wants to try new roles, can be one of the most fun parts of the RPG's gameplay loop. Despite the ever-changing rotation of pawns the player can end up using, they are injected with personality by their barks and voice lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second game in the
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  series also adds a complication to the pawn system with the addition of the Dragonsplague, an ailment that can only afflict pawns and comes with some devastating consequences. Since the ailment affects a pawn's attitude and behavior, it means that players have to be extra mindful of the quirks of their team.
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  is also a very solid action RPG with a reactive and creative open world.

  The overarching plot may contain world-ending levels of threat, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is really all about the player's companions and the party they assemble. Players only need to look at any wider discussion of the game to see how much these party members have resonated with fans, and that's a testament to the well-written characters and their reactivity to the player's choices.
 </p>
 <p>
  The average player may not love every member of the ensemble cast, but it's hard to go through the game without picking some favorites. Choosing to dig into each of these characters' stories can reveal more aspects of their personalities too, and will certainly cause some players to gain a new perspective on their companions as they progress through the game. The game complements the well-written story and characters with a well-designed turn-based battle system that translates D&amp;D into video game format effortlessly, making it one of the best open-world team-based games.

  The recently launched co-op action-adventure title
  <strong>
   <em>
    Split Fiction
   </em>
  </strong>
  from Hazelight Studios has already been off to a massively successful start, and the major milestones continue to pile up, as the early preparations for a full film adaptation of the game are now in the works.
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and audiences, and the sci-fi fantasy adventure is looking to quickly make its way to the silver screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Released on March 6,
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  sees players taking on the co-op roles of Mio and Zoe, two writers who have been thrown into a surreal simulation of their wildest stories. Players are tasked with working together to overcome a number of challenges and enemies, while also learning more about the two protagonists and the journeys that have led them to their present situation. A number of video game film and TV adaptations have found success in recent years, and it would seem the early high marks for
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  have proven promising enough to spur a leap to Hollywood.
 </p>
 <p>
  Revealed to Variety by sources at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the media company Story Kitchen is currently in the process of compiling a cast, writers, and director for a film adaptation of
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  . Story Kitchen is offering these teams as a "package," and offers for the rights to the movie are "coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios." The game itself features split-screen cooperative gameplay and transitions between medieval high fantasy and futuristic science fiction, with many fans already keeping their fingers crossed that the present bidding war will result in a big budget adaptation. There are currently no details on whether the adaptation will be live action or animated, leaving audiences to speculate whether
  <em>
   Split Fiction
  </em>
  could become the next
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Movie
  </em>
  or if it will follow a similar path to
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  .

      <title>Twitch Accidentally Sends Award to Wrong Person</title>

 <p>
  A
  <strong>
   Twitch
  </strong>
  streamer was stunned to discover that the Bleed Purple award they had received from the streaming platform wasn't intended for them. The odd moment has fans scratching their heads as to how the Twitch mix-up occurred.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitch offers its streamers awards when they reach certain thresholds, similar to YouTube Play Button awards. For Twitch, the hours viewed are what count, and users can get rewards for reaching 5 million hours watched, followed by 50 million and 250 million. The Bleed Purple statue is awarded to streamers who reach 5 million hours, but this streamer got an award that wasn't intended for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  A French streamer, Ponce, received an award from Twitch and showed it on-stream while taking a closer look at it. Initially, he seemed to just be admiring the award, before looking at it more closely and realizing that the channel name on his award didn't match his. Instead, the award had the username "DaigotheBeasTV," which confused Ponce. Having no affiliation with the second streaming channel, he looked it up to discover that DaigotheBeasTV is a fighting game streamer named Daigo ‘The Beast’ Umehara, who was apparently supposed to get the award instead.

 <h2 id="who-is-daigothebeastv-and-how-did-this-twitch-mishap-occur">
  Who is DaigotheBeasTV and How Did This Twitch Mishap Occur?
 </h2>
 <p>
  DaigotheBeasTV, for the unfamiliar, is a Japanese fighting game pro that has been crowned an Evo champion six times. According to TwitchTracker, he has 448,000 followers, and he's been active on the platform since 2016. DaigotheBeasTV's viewers have racked up 20.4 million hours, meaning he's more than earned the Bleed Purple award.

 </div>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, Ponce's account also got its start in 2016, but he's accumulated 75 million hours watched by his viewers. There's no official answer as to what went wrong with the Twitch awards. Presumably, the two popular Twitch streamers met the necessary thresholds and submitted their award orders around the same time, and something went wrong during the shipping process. Still, it's a rather major mistake to make, considering that the names are clearly visible on the awards themselves. Ponce didn't comment on whether it was the correct award otherwise, as his channel has enough hours viewed to qualify for the Marble award, which is granted at 50 million hours viewed.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this time, it's not clear if either streamer has reached out to the other, or if Ponce has contacted Twitch about the mishap. Ideally, Twitch should pay for Ponce's return shipping to get the award back and then send it to its proper owner. However, it also begs the question whether DaigotheBeasTV received Ponce's award, or if it was even actually produced. Things may get more complicated if DaigotheBeasTV doesn't have Ponce's award, as that could mean a third channel is tangled up in the mess.

  Bandai Namco Entertainment has announced
  <strong>
   <em>

  <em>
   Digimon Alysion

  franchise. In addition to confirmation that it will be coming to mobile devices, a new trailer has been shared.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are several
  <em>
   Digimon
  </em>
  games, with some being well-known, such as
  <em>
   Digimon Rumble Arena
  </em>
  (2001),
  <em>
   Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth
  </em>
  (2016), and
  <em>
   Digimon Survive
  </em>
  (2022). When it comes to games for Android and iOS, the franchise has released nine games, the first being
  <em>
   Digimon Collectors
  </em>
  (2011), and the most recent being
  <em>
   Digimon New Century
  </em>
  (2021), an exclusive title for players in China. Now, this list is about to get longer, as the 10th
  <em>
   Digimon
  </em>
  mobile game has just become official.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Digimon Alysion
  </em>
  has been announced and will be released for Android and iOS at an undisclosed date. The new
  <em>
   Digimon
  </em>
  trading card game was recently teased and has now received a new trailer showing how players will view the collected cards, a match search screen, and what appears to be a screen showing the cards pulled by the player. The video also revealed a battlefield with a similar design to
  <em>
   Hearthstone
  </em>
  and a type of inventory in which the player's Digimon appears in pixelated graphics.

  Bandai Namco Entertainment's announcement indicates that the cast of the game will be female, giving the first glimpse of the characters Kanata Hondo, Futre, and Valner Dragnogh, as well as an all-new Digimon called Gemmon. Another piece of information that hasn't yet been officially confirmed, but the trailer hints at, is that
  <em>
   Digimon Alysion
  </em>
  will combine elements of trading cards, monster-raising, and story. As for what fans already know, it will be a free-to-play game and will have in-app purchases. Players eager to play
  <em>
   Digimon Alysion
  </em>
  will have to wait, as, according to Gematsu, a closed beta is planned, with details to be announced at a later date. The site also reports that the game will feature new cards and Digimon.

      Key dinosaurs like the Therizinosaurus, Beelzebufo, and Griffin offer valuable skills like wood collection, flight, and combat strength.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Ark: Survival Evolved
   </strong>
  </em>
  immerses players in a terrific world filled with every kind of danger. One needs to turn to the dinosaurs to survive in such an environment. If there is one thing that the fans of this game love, it is the ability to ride and tame these ancient creatures. Each beast has a unique function, different methods of taming, and usefulness to the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  When tamed, the
  <strong>
  </strong>
  dinosaurs in the
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  can complete tasks like guarding possessions, fighting, carrying items, and riding on. Since taming these creatures is very challenging, players need to know which dinosaurs to prioritize.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated March 20, 2025 by Mati Kent-Nye:
   </strong>
   With the release date of Ark 2 still a mystery to fans, it's doubtful that this highly anticipated sequel will hit screens for at least another year. Ravenous fans need not fear though, as Ark: Survival Evolved is still a fantastic dinosaur-filled adventure. Nearly eight years after its release, this game still offers beautiful prehistoric environments to explore, grand bases to build, and monstrous goliaths to tame and kill.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dinosaur taming is one of, if not the best feature, transforming the game from a simple hunt and be hunted to one of risky taming strategies, careful calculations, and cheer-worthy success. With the right dinosaurs under their command, players can conquer this land.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Docile but powerful dinosaur.
  </li>
  <li>
   Best fought and tamed from a distance.
  </li>
  <li>
   Useful for gathering, transportation, and defense.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Players shouldn't be fooled by the Ankylosaurus' calm demeanor and choice to only attack in self-defense. This dinosaur is dangerous, with a wrecking ball-like tail that will quickly dispatch most dinosaurs or players foolish enough to provoke it. These armor-clad giants are best admired from a distance. Players looking to tame or kill them should use long-range weapons only, lest they wish to meet a quick death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ankylosauruses make fantastic additions to any tribe. As gatherers, they are incredibly skilled at mining, whether on land or in the sea, and they can collect large amounts of berries thanks to their vegetation-clearing tail sweeps. These tanky dinosaurs also make for great, albeit slow, transporters that can hold their own against most predators.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Anyone who has played
  <em>
   Ark: Survival Evolved
  </em>
  is familiar with this dinosaur. They will come in contact with this creature at the initial stages of the game. Therizinosaurus
  <strong>
  </strong>
  is not only one of the deadliest dinosaurs in
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  but also one of the best to tame. With it, players can collect wood, pick berries, and thatch.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therizinosaurus can use its
  <strong>
  </strong>
  claws to hit several times in a single fight, which makes it an outstanding creature when battling. Since taming this dinosaur can be dangerous, players should ensure that they have enough narcotics and tranquilizers. Also, they shouldn’t come close to it.

  Beelzebufo is an enormous amphibian found in swamp biomes. When tamed, this creature can be used as a medium of transport due to its quick movement, incredible hopping skills, and swift swimming. Additionally, its tongue is useful in torpor-preying other predators. Beelzebufo’s tongue also produces a cementing paste when consuming insects that can be used to repel insects such as
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Meganeura.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taming this
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  creature can be made easier by using an
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Argentavis to keep out of reach of Beelzebufo's dangerous tongue attacks that can knock the player unconscious amid battle. Bolas can also be used to lock this dinosaur in place, allowing players to fire tranquilizer darts at it from a safe distance. Its favorite foods include kibble, cooked chops, and raw mutton.

  This ancient mythical power boils down to four great attacks. A Griffin can dive through the air to damage any player or enemy. With its strategic position in the sky, this creature can shoot Tranq Arrows with ease. Griffins can be used both on land and in the sky. Its inconceivable speed when diving and amazing combat make this creature one of the most useful taming options in
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Griffin is used to collect Wyvern Eggs and tame other creatures. The only challenge one may experience with Griffin
  <strong>
  </strong>
  is that it’s not easy to command and tame. Applying skillful taming techniques and Exceptional Kibble is the best approach.

 <p>
  Along with being a great catch in general, Giga is one of the easier dinosaurs to tame (and a tamed Giga loves Exceptional Kibble as its food). By using its Gnash attack, Giga can reduce the health of an enemy by 1% within five seconds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Depending on the circumstances under which the player is, Giga
  <strong>
  </strong>
  can be a useful asset. That said, owners should ensure this dinosaur's rage meter doesn't overflow as failure to do so will cause it to destroy anything it comes across, including the player. It's for this reason that Gigas are best suited for secondary base defense, as taking them out into the wilderness runs a high risk of them going berserk and turning on their rider.

  For those taking part in PvE fights, Gacha is a must-have. Thankfully, it is one of the easiest to tame. Gacha is useful in general since it produces resources on its back, and depending on the current needs of the player, they can specify the resource. In the dangerous wilderness of
  <em>
   Ark
  </em>
  , having access to resources without needing to leave the base is incredibly beneficial. Not only does it make for quicker collection times, but it also helps players, and their accompanying dinos, avoid being torn to pieces by vicious predators.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gacha is tamed by dropping items, preferably snow owl pellets, close to them so that they feed on them. Other foods that this creature prefers most are greenhouse and tek structures.

  creatures. Some players even build a movable base on their backs. With Brontosaurus, one can ride on them as they travel.
 </p>
 <p>
  A player should be very careful when parking this beast since they shake everything near it. It is advisable to park slightly far from the base. Brontosaurus feeds mostly on mejoberries and kibble. During the taming process, Tapejara, which carries a player above it, is the best option to knock out Bronto.

   Incredibly fast and agile carnivore.

  <li>
   Tamed by feeding it other tamed animals.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Everyone loves a secured base, which is why players should tame at least one pack of these dinos. Troodon are incredibly fast, small, and hard-to-hit predators, making them perfect base guards whether in PvP or PvE. Where the Troodon shines is in its highly poisonous bite which will quickly knock unconscious any dinosaur or player struck by it, leaving them utterly defenseless.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes this creature particularly unique is the way it is tamed, since they feed on tamed animals, meaning taming a Troodon comes with making a sacrifice. Most players prefer taming at night since they feed on roughly 40% fewer animals than during the daytime. Players must be ready to part with some beloved dinosaurs if they are to snag one of these agile hunters.

  It’s both dazzling and dangerous in equal measure, and its white color can camouflage cold places. Snow Owl has the power to heal players while in the air, specifically in PvP. Their pellets can be also fed to Gatcha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Snow Owl is a fast dive-bomber since it can dive into the ground creating an explosion that damages the enemy. This skill is crucial for raiding other bases or battling rivals in open areas. Since Snow Owl flies in small groups, taming them can be tricky, although players can use an arrow with tranquilizer darts.

  's map. They have high health and stamina to facilitate longer flight sessions. Though they have poor speed, their damage output is good. With its ability to carry small animals, this dinosaur can help transport unconscious creatures to taming points. Generally, Argentavis makes back-and-forth traveling easy.

 <p>
  Food such as raw mutton is the best for a tamed Argentavis. To catch it, one needs to erect chain traps. For beginners who find it hard to get them, they should look around Far’s Peak at the farthest corner of the map.

  players will recognize the Wyvern as one of the most highly sought-after dinosaurs in the game. Highly aggressive and possessing great stats, Wyverns come in various tameable elemental variants, including poison, lightning, and ice, depending on the map and location they are encountered in.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to taming, things don't get much easier where the Wyvern is concerned. Taming these beasts requires delving into the depths of a Wyvern nest and stealing one of their eggs, an action that is sure to have every adult hunting the player down. That's if the player can even get into one of these heavily guarded nests.

  Rex is, unsurprisingly, one of the strongest dinosaurs in the game. Since it has a high melee attack, it is useful in PvP and PvE fights. Also, this dinosaur doesn’t disappoint when taking over bases during raids, especially if equipped with the Tek Rex Saddle. Their roar threatens enemies whenever they attack as well. Most players use this creature while moving around unsecured areas because of their “quick” nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Rex is usually tamed by luring the dinosaur into a trap, although some people have had success with tranquilizers. Rather than easily-damaged wood, stone should be used for the trap.

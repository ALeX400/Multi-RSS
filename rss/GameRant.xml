  <strong>
   Storage Deck Upgrades (SDUs)
  </strong>
  determine the number of items and ammo you can carry in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Borderlands 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  . However, they are extremely expensive! They start out fairly cheap, but triple in cost with every upgrade. Hence, maxing out an SDU means spending millions of
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  dollars.

  With several types of SDUs available for purchase, and not enough money to go around, your best course of action is to know which SDUs net the most value. Your final objective should, of course, be to max out every SDU in the game, but here are the ones you should unlock first.

     SDUs can be purchased from Marcus' Munitions Store on the upper level of Sanctuary III. He becomes available after you have completed the first few missions of the main campaign. However, once you beat
     <em>
      Borderlands 3
     </em>
     , you can create a new max-level character that skips the tutorial section.

 <p>
  Maxing out backpack SDUs should be your first priority in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  . They increase your inventory space, allowing you to carry more weapons, mods, and other items during missions. Like every other
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game; the more loot you can carry, the more you can sell at vending machines for money to buy more SDUs. This is how you farm a ton of money in
  <em>
   BL3
  </em>
  . If you are not looting and selling first at the start of your playthrough, you will have a hard time unlocking all the upgrades by the time you reach the end-game missions.

  While new players might ignore purchasing bank SDUs for some of the other upgrades, increasing your bank slots should always be an important priority. They allow you to store more items in the bank vault, becoming a secondary backpack shared between all characters on the same account. If you find a legendary weapon for Amara while playing as Zane, for example, you can save it in the bank for your second
  <em>
   BL3
  </em>
  playthrough.

  Most end-game builds in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  rely on assault rifles and submachine guns to shred enemies. Both weapon types have increased fire rates and often end up with weapon mods that consume multiple ammo per shot. Hence, they can easily eat through ammunition, especially against Mayhem 10 enemies and bosses that do not go down easily.

  <em>
   Borderlands 3

  allows you to equip various augmentations to change how your action skill behaves. However, it can take around 30–40 hours to advance two skill trees for your favorite action skill augments. Therefore, for the first dozen or so hours, you have no choice but to rely on your grenades.

  Do not take them lightly though. Grenades come with their own mods and do massive explosive damage. Some special grenades can clear whole groups of enemies. They are also useful for specific characters. For example, Zane's Digi-Clone action skill consumes grenades to boost your damage, health, fire rate, reload speed, and skill duration. Investing in some grenade SDUs early on can help you maintain that buff multiple times during a fight.

  As for increasing the number of items you get from the Lost Loot vending machine, its priority level remains the same as grenades. Take the first few levels, but do not go overboard. Having some weapons to sell for extra cash every time you return to Sanctuary is fine for the main campaign.

 <p>
  Unless you mod your
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  experience, shotguns and sniper rifles will always have the lowest ammo capacity. Since they are single-shot weapons, easily overshadowed by other weapon types when pitted against enemy swarms, you might not find it overly important to carry more ammo for either your shotgun or sniper rifle. That said, they also pack the most punch in the game, doing some of the highest damage with head-ripping, body-dismembering shots.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":992} -->

 <p>
  Shotguns are especially great against Maliwan troopers. You might even want to build your Vault Hunter around legendary shotguns like the Doom-inspired Hellwalker. Snipers, on the other hand, can destroy enemies with a critical headshot. They can even be lethal against armored bosses, especially if you roll mods that let you handle a sniper rifle like an assault rifle with insane fire rates.

 <p>
  However, that all means you need to have enough ammo in your backpack. As such, do not shy away from spending your hard-earned dollars on the first six or seven levels of shotgun and sniper rifle SDUs.

 <p>
  Pistols are one of the most versatile weapons in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  . Depending on your preferred
  <em>
   BL3
  </em>
  weapon manufacturer, your favorite pistol can pop heads like a sniper rifle, blast faces at close range, or pepper enemies like a mini-SMG. You will likely never run out of bullets, especially if you aim for precision with a Jakobs pistol. The ones from Maliwan, however, can consume a whole clip for each enemy. Hence, take some pistol SDUs as needed. This can be considered a higher priority depending on how you are building your character.

  The rocket launcher is pretty underwhelming until you reach Mayhem's versions of the Plaguebearer or Backburner. The rocket launcher also pairs well with Moze's splash damage skills. Its highly situational usage makes heavy weapon SDUs one of the lowest priorities in

  Some of the upcoming events in Season 18 of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  are fairly self-explanatory, but some events warrant an explanation. Given the newfound popularity
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  gained after the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  show, there’s likely a large group of players who might be experiencing some of these events for the first time.

  Holiday Scorched, Spooky Scorched, and Trick or Treat Event

 <p>
  During the Holiday Scorched and Spooky Scorched events, players can hunt down Scorched wearing festive Christmas or Halloween costumes for themed loot bags. These special Scorched can be found at any location where Scorched normally spawn around
  <em>

 <p>
  For the Trick or Treat event, players can grab a free candy bowl from the Atomic Shop for their CAMP to give out candy earned from the Spooky Scorched loot bags. Then, for the Holiday Scorched event, craftable versions of the Holiday loot bags can be purchased from NPC vendors, and there will also be a Collectron that passively collects Holliday loot bags when placed in a CAMP or Workshop in

  Treasure Hunter Weekends are another event where players will be hunting down enemies across the wasteland for a special loot bag, this time it will be a unique mole miner variant. These treasure hunter mole miners have a chance of spawning at most outdoor locations with other enemies, regardless of whether mole miners naturally spawn there. Craftable versions of mole miners' treasure pails can also be purchased from NPC vendors.

   Inspired by the classical Chinese novel

 <p>
  A Reddit thread started by user AutomaticTap3004 details why they feel the level design in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is hugely flawed. While they believe the first two chapters of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  are fine, it all goes downhill from Chapter 3 onwards. Their big complaint comes in the Pagoda Prison, where they claim that "Having my heath cut and essentially having to avoid enemies in order to get to the top in order to stop it is just not fun." This is compounded by the fact that "this area has ledges you can fall off of and die from, which wouldn’t be a big deal except for the fact we couldn’t fall off of high places in the game until now."

  Many gamers in the thread agreed, sharing their frustration that even constructive criticism is often shut down by other fans. Throughout the thread, many
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  players shared their frustration with invisible walls, a complaint that has come up often in criticism of the game. There was plenty of agreement about the sentiment of Chapter 3, with one player describing it as "a ridiculous downgrade from the first 2 which were goty material."

  It's important to remember that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is Game Science's first title of this scale. Its last title,
  <em>
   Art of War: Red Tides
  </em>
  , was a strategy game made for both PC and mobile, so
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is sure to have been a big lesson in many areas of game design. A recent rumor suggests that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  could have two DLCs on the way, so hopefully the studio is able to apply those lessons in the content to come.

  The desert has made for an evocative setting across all kinds of media, from the expansive, mesmerizing desert environments of
  <em>
   Lawrence Of Arabia
  </em>
  , to the often-visited sands of Tatooine in
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  . However, it could be argued that no desert is quite as iconic - and as memorable - as that of Frank Herbert's
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Deserts don't have to be based on pre-existing IPs to be successful, however, with indie developers such as Lo-Fi Games creating their own desert wasteland world with their game,
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  . From digital board games like
  <em>
   Dune: Imperium
  </em>
  to the desert planet of Kharak in the lesser-known
  <em>
   Homeworld
  </em>
  title, strategy fans are spoiled for choice when it comes to desert settings.

  This minimalist indie strategy game features charming pixel art and a desert setting that tasks players with skirmishing in procedurally generated maps. The game's mechanics are as minimal as the visuals, making its systems easy to learn and friendly to newcomers, though there is room to strategize throughout each match.

 <p>
  <em>
   Desert Kingdoms
  </em>
  is a low-budget affair and, despite its use of procedural generation, it features little in the way of replay value. However, it's a great low-effort strategy game for lunch breaks and short play sessions.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Homeworld: Deserts Of Kharak
  </em>
  lacks the deep space combat that
  <em>
   Homeworld
  </em>
  is known for, its desert warfare is surprisingly intense and often strategic. The game's dusty environments and open-field combat encounters are frequently tactical and offer a solid challenge, with a mobile base that gives the gameplay a unique twist.

 <p>
  If the aforementioned mobile base is destroyed, the mission is lost, and this presents a unique challenge because the mobile base is also the player's main source of power. What's more, players also have to worry about the temperature of their base, as overheating can be dangerous and even lead to the base's destruction. It may not be as timeless as Relic Entertainment's flagship title,
  <em>
   Homeworld
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   Deserts Of Kharak
  </em>
  offers immersive desert battles for fans of more grounded combat.

  This strategic sandbox gives players complete freedom to explore its unique, utterly strange, and wholly unforgiving world.
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  is a brutal game that's unafraid to treat the player unfairly and, as a result, it's a relatively inaccessible experience. However, this also works in the game's favor, offering a deeply immersive world that feels genuine.

 <p>
  In the game, players control one or several adventurers attempting to make their way in a world that mostly comprises desert wastelands. Combat can be avoided, but players will often find themselves in fight-or-flight situations. Encounters make use of auto-attacks, but players are able to micromanage their squad members to increase their effectiveness, and the real-time-with-pause gameplay makes this relatively painless.

  Lacking the deep base-building mechanics and economic management that real-time strategy games are known for,
  <em>
   Starship Troopers: Terran Command
  </em>
  makes up for its simplicity with high-octane combat encounters that have players commanding large squads of zealous marines against hordes of alien arachnids. The game takes place in the iconic setting of Paul Verhoeven's film,
  <em>
   Starship Troopers
  </em>
  , and manages to stay relatively loyal to the source material.

 <p>
  For fans of action-orientated strategy games that enjoy fussing over the positioning of their units,
  <em>
   Starship Troopers: Terran Command

  is likely to please. However, veteran RTS players may be somewhat disappointed by the game's lack of deeper systems.

  This digital adaptation of the tabletop game of the same name is a turn-based strategy game with solid AI opponents and a great deal of variety.
  <em>
   Dune: Imperium

  combines elements of popular board game mechanics such as worker placement and deck-building, offering a truly unique gameplay loop that tickles the brain in a number of ways.

  <em>
   Dune: Imperiu m

  is dense with strategic options, but its tutorial does an admirable job of easing players into the experience. The game's community may be relatively small, but players who can't find a game easily can always battle against competent AI opponents.
  <em>
   Dune: Imperium
  </em>
  also features a variety of leaders that encourage their own play-styles, and the game's recently released DLC,
  <em>
   Dune: Imperium - Rise Of Ix
  </em>
  , adds even more replay value to the game.

  Developed by Shiro Games, the very same team behind the Viking-themed RTS,
  <em>
   Northgard
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  is a real-time 4X game set in Frank Herbert's iconic
  <em>

  </em>
  universe. More specifically,
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  takes place on Arrakis and features a slew of thematic mechanics and systems that take full advantage of the source material.

 <p>
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  is an incredibly methodical and slow-burning strategy game that takes patience to learn and play, with a focus on tactical timing and positioning. The game also features a great deal of faction variety, allowing players to command everyone from the Fremen and the Atreides, all the way to a band of organized smugglers. Furthermore,
  <em>
   Dune: Spice Wars
  </em>
  features an array of victory conditions that allow for diverse play, offering plenty of opportunities for comebacks along the way.

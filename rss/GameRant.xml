  Gameplay footage depicting

  's upcoming land vehicle has leaked online. The newly emerged video reveals a few previously unconfirmed features related to the way driving around will work in

 <p>
  Fans received the first sneak peek at
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's land vehicle in early May 2024, as part of Bethesda's video overview of what's next for the game. Around the 4:44 mark in the clip, the company showcased footage of a four-wheel space buggy braving a desert. The developer has yet to clarify when exactly this vehicle is planned to arrive in the game, and whether it will be the only such mode of transportation to do so.

  Starfield Land Vehicle Will Feature Thrusters, Leak Suggests

 <p>
  And while that radio silence continues, some new gameplay footage of the space rover leaked online on August 10, having reportedly originated on 4chan. The 29-second clip shows one player driving around on what appears to be Jemison, the third planet in the Alpha Centauri system and the home of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's New Atlantis. The video indicates that the upcoming land vehicle will be equipped with thrusters, which will allow it to propel itself off the ground for short intervals. This should lower the chances of getting stuck in the rough terrain of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's 1,000-plus planets, which weren't exactly designed with land vehicles in mind, at least not initially.

 <p>
  The space rover will have some kind of stamina-like meter governing the thrusters. The meter itself will replenish automatically when the vehicle isn't flying, with the entire mechanic thus being similar to how the game handles jumping. The leaked footage also confirms that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's land vehicle will be drivable from the first-person perspective, in addition to the third-person camera that was already confirmed back in May 2024.

 <h3 id="starfield-companions-will-have-new-voice-lines-while-driving">
  Starfield Companions Will Have New Voice Lines While Driving
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another revelation from the clip is that Bethesda has apparently recorded new companion voice lines to accompany this upcoming mode of transportation. Namely, the video starts with what sounds like Sarah yelling at the protagonist to "hold on tight." Curiously enough, while the space rover does seem to have a passenger seat, she does not appear to be sitting in it, so the voice is presumably coming from the vehicle's enclosed trunk compartment.

  Aside from the gameplay footage, the same source also shared an image of the rover seemingly taken with
  <em>
   Starfield

  's photo mode. Its doorless design and white-and-red paint job both match the appearance of the vehicle that Bethesda teased back in spring. Finally, the source of the leak claimed that the much-anticipated space buggy will finally debut as part of the next big
  <em>

  </em>
  update in August 2024.

  Players have plenty of options when it comes to customizing the difficulty of a new server or playthrough in
  <strong>
   <em>
    7 Days to Die
   </em>
  </strong>
  , including a creative mode, and a zombie-free survival mode. However, there are little to no options for altering the services provided by the different NPC traders in
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  , and future updates for the game should consider changing this.

 <p>
  Considering the impact that traders have in

  , the game could arguably benefit from experimenting with new features related to traders, which is the perfect opportunity to add new traders who are distinct from the traders currently in the game. More specifically,

  </em>
  should consider adding a nighttime trader, as well as a traveling trader.

 <p>
  Even after the recent rework that made traders in
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  ’s 1.0 update less rewarding, these NPCs still play an important part in overall progression. Consequently, since strictly sticking to the available trader quests is one of the most reliable ways to progress in the game, it’s natural for players to prioritize completing the trader’s quests instead of freely exploring the map or any nearby POIs.

 <p>
  With this in mind, a traveling trader could encourage players to explore the new Remnant POIs in
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  . Since these Remnant POIs aren’t questable locations, many players might unknowingly miss out on the loot from these locations by strictly following wherever the next trader quests take them. So, one way to incentivize players to explore Remnant POIs is to introduce a wandering trader who can show up in these locations with some worthwhile deals on rare resources and items.

     Remnant POIs can be identified by their missing difficulty indicator once players enter the location. The orange skulls on the player’s screen indicate a biome’s overall difficulty, while red skulls indicate a POI’s difficulty. Remnant POIs won’t have a red skull difficulty indicator.

  As helpful as the traders are though, they are all closed at night. Therefore, a nighttime trader could fill in the gaps for the existing traders by opening for business after the other traders close for the night. Players can still do any quests that they already initiated before nighttime, but players will be unable to retrieve their completion rewards or access a trader’s inventory until morning. Considering that, by default, zombies in
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  will move faster at night and Feral variants of zombies will naturally spawn, sometimes it's best to put off doing quests and tend to other survival and base-building needs for the time being.

  Finding ways to stay productive after the traders close is crucial in the early game so that players can be prepared for their first Blood Moon horde. Hence, why a nighttime trader could be a useful feature in
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  . Not to mention, nighttime traders and/or wandering traders could also be the key to adding new types of quests, like escort missions, hunting a certain number of animals, or defending a particular POI.

 <p>
  Nighttime traders and new quests are all things that community mods for
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  have explored before, though these are only available for PC players for now. The studio behind
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  , The Fun Pimps, has discussed the possibility of bringing mod support to console players, but this remains uncertain for the time being. So, in hindsight,
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  should consider adding new trader NPCs, considering that they already have the perfect blueprint for two new types of traders – a nighttime trader and a wandering trader.

  A huge appeal to the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts

  </strong>
  games is the ability to explore a variety of different locations in the form of iconic Disney universes. Often, players will encounter familiar friends and foes from these universes, complete story-based missions, and earn a few rewards along the way.

  One of the more common rewards in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  is Keyblades, the type of weapon that each protagonist wields. Each Keyblade has its own advantages and disadvantages through stats which may influence which one you decide to wield. Or, you may simply just wish to know which Keyblades are available from each universe so you can prioritize obtaining your favorites. If you're seeking details regarding every Keyblade in the first

  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto Online
   </strong>
  </em>
  has many different types of vehicles you can cause mayhem with. The
  <strong>
   Cargobob
  </strong>
  is a military helicopter made for transporting troops and cargo, in which you can carry up to 10 other players. It also has a very fun feature where you can hook onto cars and other items, allowing you to fly away with other player's cars or tactically drop friends into a fight. However, the Cargobob can be a bit hard to find in online free roam if you don't know where to look. This guide will show you where to find a Cargobob in Los Santos and how to use its retractable hook.

  The Cargobob was made available for purchase as part of the Finance and Felony update. Open your cellphone or use a computer to access the in-game internet. Go on the Warstock Cache and Carry website to purchase a Cargobob. The Cargobob Jetsam is another model with a different paint job. Click on "Buy it Now" to get one for yourself. Both models can be pretty expensive for new players.

  Once you've purchased an aircraft, you must call it in to fly it. Open your phone and call Pegasus in the contacts. Select the Cargobob, and it will be delivered to the nearest airstrip/helipad. Look for the
  <strong>
   golden yellow personal aircraft icon
  </strong>
  on the map to find it.

  Once you reach at least Level 22 in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  , the Cargobob can randomly spawn at helipads all throughout Los Santos. The most likely place to find one is at the
  <strong>
   Los Santos Naval Port,
  </strong>
  a dock located in the middle port area of Elysian Island. You will have to make your way through the Merryweather guarded warehouse or the dock from the ocean side.

  The Cargobob will spawn right by the warehouse area at the end of the dock. You will probably have to fight some armed guards either way. If the Cargobob doesn't spawn, you can leave the immediate area and return to cause the helicopters to cycle.

  Nintendo’s
  <em>
   <strong>
    Animal Crossing
   </strong>
  </em>
  games have become well-loved for their laid back interpretation of the Life Sim genre, but with the genre in a boom, it might be time for a change.
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  can remain an experience for those who want a simple cozy game, but one mechanic might do better with a more in-depth gameplay system.

 <p>
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  is one of the most popular games in the Life Sim genre, and with good reason. Starting with the earliest entries on the N64 and Gamecube,
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  has become known for its slow-burn gameplay style, which at the time was a big departure from what players were used to. But as the genre has grown, players have come to expect more from each new game in the series. Rumors suggest that the next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  game will add plenty of new content, but those additions shouldn’t come at the cost of existing game mechanics. One activity that many players focus on is planting just the right kinds of plants and flowers in their garden, town, or island. While the current gardening system in the game works fine, an overhaul of the mechanic could lead to a better overall experience for players focused on their plants.

  Over time, farming and gardening have become arguably the most popular activity in the Life Sim genre. Games like
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Harvest Moon
  </em>
  , and the upcoming
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  have placed more of an emphasis on the work that players do while enjoying their cozy life. While
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  has avoided the work element, a wise choice given its emphasis on relaxation, it has slowly made its gardening mechanic better. But the current system simply doesn’t work as well as it should. Though
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  is a game parents and children can enjoy together, the gardening system is at times too simple, and at times too hard.

 <p>
  Currently, in order to find the perfect kind of flowers, players need to cross-pollinate them by planting certain colors of the same species near different ones. After planting, they are left to water them daily and wait for them to grow in order to find out if they’ve succeeded in creating a new variety. With all the combinations, a guide to cross-pollination in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  is almost required to achieve the desired result. And yet, once the flowers have grown, the job is done. The contrast between the difficulty of breeding new plants and the simplicity of their upkeep leads to the mechanic not quite feeling complete. If players want to reap the reward of excellent plants, they should be required to put in a bit more work for them.

  What Animal Crossing's Gardening Can Learn From Other Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  Even the smallest of Life Sim games now seem to feature gardening or farming mechanics. Sometimes they are a key part of the gameplay loop, like in

  , and other times, like in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  , they are mostly there to create decoration, but even games with less emphasis on growing things have a cohesive system for doing so. Since
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  is one of the first games to pioneer the Farming Sim genre, it might be difficult for Nintendo to admit that it needs help from its predecessors, but newer games offer plenty of inspiration for a new gardening system. Of course, new mechanics are always in development, but
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  can’t forget about improving its existing systems to keep the game fresh.

  For an example of a new Life Sim mechanic done right, players need look no further than
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  , which has embraced cooking in a way other Life Sims have neglected. It also seems to feature quite an extensive gardening system, as crops are needed in order to cook. Perhaps
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  can learn from
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  ’s cooking and gardening systems and use that game's advancements to further its own mechanics. In this way, by looking to the future,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Animal Crossing
   </em>
  </strong>
  can improve upon its past.

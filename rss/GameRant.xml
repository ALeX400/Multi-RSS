    Key Takeaways

    <ul>
     <li>
      Shovel Knight was an excellent indie game that didn't receive a GOTY nomination in 2014, showcasing The Game Awards' lack of indie representation at the time.
     </li>
     <li>
      Undertale, which became a viral hit in 2015, deserved a GOTY nomination due to its unique mechanics and story, and yet it lost to Rocket League for Best Independent Game.
     </li>
     <li>
      Dark Souls 3 was surprisingly left out of the 2016 GOTY nominee list, despite being a FromSoftware project that won over fans and critics with its quality.

  <strong>
   The Game Awards
  </strong>
  is a world-renowned awards ceremony that celebrates the best that the gaming industry has to offer each year, with its most prestigious award being the Game of the Year (or GOTY). Since its 2024 edition is just around the corner, now it’s a good time to reminisce about all the excellent titles that were sadly not nominated for the show’s grand award in previous years.

 <p>
  It’s important to note that these video games should not have replaced the existing nominees at their respective ceremonies; they simply could have ended up on the final list if The Game Awards had space for at least one more nominee. After all, every single year was filled to the brim with excellent video games on all platforms, so it makes sense that some of them couldn’t make the cut.

 <p>
  The very first edition of The Game Awards was held in a competitive year with multiple high-quality video games, so a lot of the best ones were sadly left out of the final GOTY nominee list. Furthermore, one of the most egregious examples of this was Yacht Club Games’ excellent 2D side scroller,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shovel Knight
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  This is an incredible and super fun indie platformer that made a huge impact on gamers because it had the essence of some of the best classics from the NES era. While
  <em>
   Shovel Knight
  </em>
  did win the award for Best Independent Game in 2014, the final GOTY nominee list seriously lacked some much-needed Indie representation. Nevertheless, The Game Awards have changed a lot ever since, and a game like
  <em>
   Shovel Knight
  </em>
  would definitely be nominated for the grand award today.

  This is yet another case of a unique Indie game that made a huge impact on the industry, yet it didn’t get its deserved recognition. There’s no denying that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Undertale
   </em>
  </strong>
  was one of the biggest video games of 2015, since Toby Fox’s brilliant take on the RPG genre became a viral sensation that everybody was talking about during that time.

 <p>
  With creative mechanics, mind-blowing plot twists, a charming sense of humor, and an incredible soundtrack,
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  has all the elements of the typical GOTY nominee. Weirdly enough, it didn’t even win Best Independent Game, which it was nominated for but lost against
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  . This is not much of a surprise, though, since
  <em>
   Rocket League
  </em>
  was also extremely popular during that time.

  The Game Awards 2016 remains one of the most controversial editions of this awards show, mainly due to the fact that many people believe that a multiplayer game like
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  shouldn’t have won GOTY over single-player adventures like
  <em>
   Uncharted 4
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  (2016). But there’s another great single-player game that is oddly missing from that final list, and it’s
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dark Souls 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  It’s funny because, nowadays, The Game Awards is famous for always awarding and recognizing FromSoftware and its high-quality releases, but
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  didn’t get a single award in 2016, even though it was yet another excellent entry in an iconic series that was received very well by both fans and critics alike. At least it was nominated for Best RPG, but it still ended up losing to
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  's DLC.

  2017 was an incredible year for gaming, and thus, it was also a great year for The Game Awards. Not only did many excellent PlayStation exclusives come out in 2017, but this was also the debut year of the Nintendo Switch, meaning that it was almost impossible for anything other than
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  to win the grand award. Nevertheless, it's still quite weird that
  <strong>
   <em>
    NieR: Automata
   </em>
  </strong>
  didn’t even get a GOTY nomination.

  Square Enix and Platinum Games’ action RPG became an instant hit among players and critics, due to its instantly recognizable characters, incredible boss fights, magical soundtrack, and surprisingly deep story and themes. And yet, it was not nominated GOTY nor could it win in the Best RPG category. On the bright side,
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  won the award for Best Soundtrack, not to mention that it’s still fondly remembered by many to this day.

  2019 was yet another highly competitive year with a solid lineup of GOTY nominees and tons of great games that were sadly left out of it. And one of the most beloved titles that didn’t make the cut was
  <strong>
   <em>
    Devil May Cry 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which at least managed to win Best Action Game but could have easily been nominated for the grand award as well.

  With the great Hideaki Itsuno in the director’s chair,
  <em>
   Devil May Cry 5
  </em>
  was a much-needed return to form for the franchise, especially after the release of the controversial
  <em>
   DmC: Devil May Cry
  </em>
  in 2013. With its impressive graphics, deep and satisfying combat system, memorable characters, exciting boss fights, and challenging battles,
  <em>
   Devil May Cry 5
  </em>
  is without a doubt one of the best games in the hack-and-slash genre.

  The 2021 edition of The Game Awards is particularly interesting because, in a year with nominees as prestigious as
  <em>
   Metroid Dread
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  , the GOTY award was given to
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  , a more unconventional co-op game made by a smaller studio. This was a different and reasonable final choice, but a lot of other solid titles were still left out of the nomination list, with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy
   </em>
  </strong>
  being at the forefront.

 <p>
  After the monumental failure of
  <em>
   Marvel’s Avengers,
  </em>
  this game was a breath of fresh air that proved that single-player adventures based on classic superhero teams not only could work but that they could be extremely fun and creative.
  <em>
   Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  did for this team what Insomniac had done for Spider-Man a few years prior, and it’s quite unfortunate that a sequel never materialized. Thankfully, it deservedly won the award for Best Narrative.

  It’s easy to forget that the beginning of 2022 was a great time for
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans, because
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Legends: Arceus
   </em>
  </strong>
  came out, and it finally changed the formula of the franchise in fun and creative ways that fans had been asking for. Tragically, a few months after it came out, Game Freak and Nintendo released
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , a game that, while far from bad, was extremely divisive due to its many bugs and glitches.

 <p>
  <em>
   Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  was not eligible for GOTY, but
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  was. Sadly, it did not make it in, possibly due to the fact that the former was damaging the reputation of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  IP around that time. This is still one of the best modern console JRPGs, and it proves that the gameplay of the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  franchise can be effectively retooled for a more modern audience. The Game Awards was aware of its importance, because it was nominated for Best RPG, even though it lost to the star of that year’s event,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  .

  Many people consider 2023 to have been one of the best years for gaming in decades, and as a result, multiple high-quality video games deserved to be nominated for GOTY but didn’t make the final list because there wasn’t enough space for them. Among a sea of examples, Square Enix’s
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 16
   </em>
  </strong>
  was one of the most unexpected omissions.

  This action RPG is far from perfect, but it did so many things right that it managed to leave a huge impact on those who played it all the way through. It has many great qualities, like a dark and engaging storyline, complex characters, incredibly realistic graphics, an addictive combat system, some of the absolute best boss fights in the entire industry, and a beautiful soundtrack, which deservedly won its respective award.
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  was, for many people, their first glimpse at a true next-gen AAA experience, and it definitely deserved a spot among all the other GOTY nominees in 2023.

      <title>The Best Action RPGs To Play If You Like Dark Souls</title>

  When one talks about some of the greatest games of the past decade, it goes without saying that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Souls
   </em>
  </strong>
  would be an inevitable part of the conversation. Released during a time when AAA publishers were becoming more and more averse to adding a substantial level of challenge in their games,
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  made a resounding wave in the gaming industry with its highly effective combination of old-school gaming along with modern sensibilities to create something truly unique and revolutionary to boot.

  It was only a given that this game would spawn a franchise, and the trilogy is considered by many to be one of the best video game franchises of all time. So, it's understandable that finishing
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  would leave a void that most games simply won't be able to fill. However, the popularity of this franchise has spawned a number of Soulslikes, some of which are worth playing. So, for the people who wish to experience the same feelings they got when playing FromSoftware's modern classic for the first time, there are many great
  <strong>
   games like
   <em>
    Dark Souls
   </em>
  </strong>
  they can check out,

   Dark Souls remains one of the most influential games of all time, spawning a whole new genre of games after it came out. Slow, methodical combat with a stamina bar, health pots, and respawning enemies were not things Dark Souls invented, but these concepts have become synonymous with the game nonetheless. Action RPGs that take inspiration from Dark Souls are extremely common, but identifying the ones worth the buy can be a bit difficult. It would be easy to choose the best and most prominent Soulslike for this list and call it a day, but ARPG is a big umbrella that a lot of different types of games fall under. These range from traditional Soulsikes with RPG elements, to action-adventure games, to 2D platformers, to isometric titles. Over time, elements of the Dark Souls formula have seeped into every subgenre imaginable, and the games that call themselves ARPGs are no different, even if they don’t
  </em>
  <em>
   fall directly under the moniker of Soulslike

  is a near-perfect sequel that fans of the first game absolutely adore. The improvements made to the formula coupled with the game doubling down on the gritty aesthetic that made it such a blast to play through was a huge win for the title as a whole, with

  The game's dark themes are a blast to play through, with the bloody combat and engaging gameplay making this title a must-play in the eyes of many. As long as players don't have a queasy stomach, players will love what

  Most people who loved Moon Studios' work on the two
  <em>
   Ori
  </em>
  games didn't expect the developers to pivot into a bold direction that combined the Soulslike genre with various elements to make for a tantalizing combination. It may still be in Early Access, but the amazing storytelling and gameplay elements present in
  <strong>
   <em>
    No Rest for the Wicked
   </em>
  </strong>
  have made it clear that this title has a ton of promise that is just waiting to be unleashed.

 <p>
  The entire reason why this title is in Early Access is to ensure that its myriad of gameplay systems work together in harmony, and players know that there's still a way to go before the game enjoys a proper 1.0 release. As long as developers are open to fan feedback, they'll develop a game that can potentially be the biggest indie release in 2024 by a country mile.

  Most people assumed that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Another Crab's Treasure

  </strong>
  was nothing more than a joke game trying to capitalize on the Soulslike moniker to earn a quick buck. However, it didn't take long after the title's release for players to realize that this title has more to it than most people would assume. A single boss fight is all it takes to show just how tight and engaging the combat system is.

  Players must hone their combat skills and not underestimate a single enemy if they wish to get through the many challenging encounters in the genre.

  The grotesque imagery in

 <p>
  The reliance on dodge rolling can make certain bosses slightly easier to defeat, but that shouldn't take away from the challenge of some of

  Deck13 has been reviled time and time again as pretenders to the throne that FromSoftware sits on following their immense success with their Soulsborne
  <em>
  </em>
  games. 2013's
  <em>
   Lords of the Fallen
  </em>
  is widely considered one of the first Soulslike games ever made, and many people found the combat to be a bit too stiff for their liking. Following this title, Deck13 continued to release more titles in the same vein, perfecting their take on this genre.

  This eventually led to the release of

In comparison, this title is touted by many as a near-perfect sequel, featuring excellent level design, combat, and storytelling. The boss fights can be a bit lacking, but most players won't mind once they get lost in the riveting atmosphere of this game and how it does justice to the legacy of

  While
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lords of the Fallen
   </em>
  </strong>
  appears a run-of-the-mill Soulslike at first glance, it is one that puts its own spin on the genre in a way that’s unique enough to allow it to stand out from the crowd of similar titles that have come out in recent years. Still, players looking for a game that closely follows the Dark Souls formula will find themselves right at home in
  <em>
   Lords of the Fallen
  </em>
  , though it has more similarities to DS3 than DS1.

 <p>
  The core mechanic that makes
  <em>
   Lords of the Fallen
  </em>
  different is the interplay between the Umbral and Axiom realms, two worlds that exist layered on top of each other. Any time a player dies in the Axiom realm, instead of returning to a Vestige (the game’s version of the Bonfire), they revive in the Umbral realm, a world of the dead and spirits. Only after dying in this world do they lose their souls and return to the Vestige. Multiple traversal puzzles and secret items are hidden in the Umbral, giving players plenty of reasons to dip in and out between the two realms.

  Most people would find it odd to consider
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </em>
  </strong>
  to be a game that
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  vets will like. If anything, this game has more in common with the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  series, but most people who have checked out
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  for themselves know just how challenging this game can get if players don't time their dodges and blocks properly, something that this title shares in common with FromSoftware's action RPGs.

  Combat is easily one of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  's strongest aspects that, along with its beautiful rendition of the
  <em>
   Harry Potter

  universe, makes this title such an easy recommendation for fans of the magical universe. There's a long way to go before this title's formula is perfected, but fans of skill-based combat coupled with a wealth of unique and powerful spells will love what
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  brings to the table.

  An isometric ARPG similar to
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Path of Exile 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the much-anticipated sequel to the extremely popular ARPG, PoE. It inherits many of the core elements from its predecessor like an absolutely gigantic skill tree, multiple classes and subclasses, leveled loot tables, and huge, procedurally generated maps filled with monsters to kill. The graphics have been massively upgraded, the skill system has been revamped, the crafting system has been stripped down and simplified, and a lot of quality-of-life features have been added to make the game feel significantly different from the original, even if the building blocks are the same.

 <p>
  But by far, the biggest change in
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  is the combat, which has been tweaked to become drastically more challenging. As if straight out of the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  playbook, button-mashing is an easy ticket to an early death because when monsters attack, it
  <em>
   hurts.
  </em>
  While players can eventually get to the point of clearing the screen in a matter of seconds in the late game, the journey to get there is fraught with peril. Dodging and blocking are core mechanics, and boss fights are brutal affairs that often require multiple tries.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Remnant: From the Ashes
   </strong>
  </em>
  was an ambitious mix of third-person shooting, roguelike elements, and Soulslike combat that was a huge success. The sequel had some huge shoes to fill... and Gunfire Games didn't disappoint. They developed a sequel that was bigger and better in almost every department.

  Level layouts weren't the only things that switched out in each run — now, NPCs, quests, bosses, and other such elements were randomized in each run, making its roguelike design more apparent. This, coupled with engaging combat and amazing visuals, makes for a sequel that any fan of the first game should check out.

  The game's over-the-top nature can work against it sometimes, with the exhaustive nature of the title's many bosses feeling rather uninspiring after a point. However, that's a small gripe in what is otherwise a masterful experience that Soulslike fans should try out!

  Alucard is a great protagonist who has a wealth of weapons and abilities that he can use to dispose of his enemies. The title is pretty challenging but accessible at the same time, and players can always grind if they feel like they've hit a brick wall. Of course, the real solution may just be to uncover a secret passageway, but getting stronger is never a bad thing.

  The tale of revenge told in this game is pretty riveting if somewhat simplistic, and Talion is a great protagonist to root for. His Wraith powers feel extremely satisfying to use in battle, with combat being a gory dance of blades as players get used to the same fighting mechanics that made the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games so beloved. As a cherry on top of this wonderful experience, the game has a Nemesis system where players can create unique stories with the many orcs that stand in their way, leading to memorable rivalries and betrayals that are a joy to see play out firsthand.

  Many players were elated by the fact that the legendary
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  would finally be remade for modern systems after what felt like eons of waiting. Square Enix took extra care to make sure the game could convey the epic scale of the adventure present in the first game.

 <p>
  This required a ton of work, and the company decided to take a risk and split the game into three parts, fleshing out the experience with their unique additions along the way. The result was
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 7 Remake
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a bold attempt to retell the story of the game that paid off pretty well. The game received a DLC that focused on Yuffie, allowing players to try out this character for themselves before she would join officially in the next title.

  Speaking of Soulslikes, another great title that comes to mind is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Thymesia
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The game takes place during a plague that is rocking the game's world, forcing players to fight against monstrosities and other humans that have been affected by the plague.

 <p>
  The plague doctor aesthetic of the game is carried off pretty well, with the game featuring several tight encounters and enough combat nuances to keep most Souls veterans satiated for the longest time. It might not be the most unique title around, but
  <em>
   Thymesia
  </em>
  does more than enough to keep fans happy till the end.

  fans are speculating that classic titles, such as 2007's hugely popular
  <em>
   Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
  </em>
  , could soon be coming to Xbox Game Pass after suddenly appearing on the Microsoft Store for PC. When Microsoft finalized its acquisition of Activision-Blizzard back in 2023, one thing fans were hopeful to see was
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's extensive library of shooters make its way to Xbox's popular Game Pass subscription service.

 <p>
  While there has been no confirmation by Activision or Microsoft that older
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles will be making their way to Game Pass anytime soon, the companies wasted no time in adding the latest entry,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , to the service. The newest
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  game launched on day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, allowing subscribers to check out the shooter's full campaign, multiplayer, and Zombies mode at no additional cost. The only other
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  title available on the service is 2023's
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  , which joined Game Pass back in July, 8 months after the title's release.

  As spotted by CharlieIntel on Twitter,
  <em>

  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Call of Duty 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
  </em>
  were all added to the Microsoft Store for PC on December 9. The addition of these classic titles came with no prior announcement from Microsoft or Activision, which has led to speculation that the two studios are gearing up to release these classic
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles on Xbox Game Pass. While some fans remain cautiously optimistic about the addition of the aforementioned titles, others have pointed out that many older
  <em>

  titles have some pretty severe security issues that would likely need to be rectified before their arrival on Game Pass.

  Classic
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles coming to Xbox Game Pass has topped many fans' wishlists ever since Microsoft's acquisition of Activision-Blizzard crossed the line back in October 2023, but over one year later there still seems to be no official word from either studio that there is any intention to bring the popular shooters to Xbox's lucrative service. However, Activision has slowly been bringing more and more of its other IPs to the service, such as
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Spyro Reignited Trilogy
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  . Alongside
  <em>
   Call of Duty,
  </em>
  there are still plenty of other Activision titles that fans want to see added to Game Pass, including
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
  </em>
  series.

  Many fans speculate that Activision may be reluctant to bring older
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles to Game Pass as it would deter people from playing the series' latest entry.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  has reportedly been a massive success for both Activision and Microsoft, bringing in a new record for day one players and Game Pass subscribers, according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who described the shooter as "the biggest
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  release ever."

  <strong>
   <em>
    Batman: Arkham Shadow
   </em>
  </strong>
  is for Blackgate Prison what
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  is for Arkham Asylum. As Irving “Matches” Malone, players get to observe or interact with tons of inmates and characters who were introduced in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate
  </em>
  , and the pool of antagonists or bosses players encounter is purposefully cherry-picked from fellow prisoners or individuals working at the prison. This keeps
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  ’s narrative air-tight as Matches and Batman hunt the Rat King, and high-profile villains are never made more important for the sake of fan service.

  Of course, it’s interesting to see what
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Origins Blackgate
  </em>
  ’s characters are up to as
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  is a direct follow-up to those installments. Hearing Lonnie Machin’s Anarky speak to Vic Sage is enlightening, for example, and the notable absence of Oswald Cobblepot’s Penguin is explained as him feigning reformation and exchanging immunity for incriminating evidence on Carmine Falcone. However, one antagonist who’s made at least some sort of appearance in nearly every other Arkhamverse game so far is nowhere to be found—the Riddler, whose absence comes as a relief.

  Before
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  , Riddler was undoubtedly the most prominent Arkhamverse villain besides Joker and permeated each game—other than
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate
  </em>
  —with his signature green collectibles and challenges, both of the physical and cerebral variety. He’s the easiest Arkhamverse villain to despise by a mile, excessive trophies notwithstanding, and yet it’s tough to overstate his significance in the franchise.

  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  debuts a soft origin story for the conundrum artist, known then as Enigma. Here, Enigma presented Batman with intercepted GCR comms towers to put back online, network relays to destroy, and datapacks to obtain, but his threat level is markedly low compared to his machinations later on in the timeline. Interestingly,
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  takes place only half a year later and Enigma himself is nowhere to be seen or heard of beyond an incredibly subtle reference in the Riddle of the Minotaur payphone puzzle and Gotham Herald newspaper report, though his handiwork and environmental puzzles are clearly inspirations for the Rat King’s wide catalog of destructible collectibles.

 <p>
  Batman still has a wealth of meticulously strewn-about collectibles to hunt down in
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  , but without a bowler hat-clad egomaniac like Riddler to taunt and berate him the whole time it hardly seems like arduous or grating work. Indeed, radios can be torn away and broken before much of their Rat King propaganda can reach players’ ears, and even then it is greatly appreciated that the Rat King’s digitized voice isn’t perpetually mocking Batman or the player.

 <p>
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Shadow
  </em>
  is proof of how full-length Arkhamverse titles don’t need Riddler in order to fill out a game with collectibles and that’s an exciting prospect since it opens a door to many other super-criminals taking on that role instead. The Rat King’s rodent-shaped idols substitute question mark-shaped trophies while radios, bombs, and maps litter maps with more to collect or destroy (all before even considering Echoes of the Past, ancient runes, or patient session tapes), diversifying the pool of oddities, puzzles, and items players may be tasked with optionally seeking out in the future.

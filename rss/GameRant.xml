  Released in 2011, the original
  <em>
   Space Marine
  </em>
  introduced players to a war-torn galaxy in the 41st century, or as referred to in the game as the 41st Millennium. In this period, humanity is in a dystopian future,
  <strong>
   locked in war and conflict with other species in the universe
  </strong>
  . Humanity has also made impressive advancements in space warfare and genetic engineering, which also resulted in the
  <strong>
   creation of power soldiers, known as Space Marines
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The game is set in a period when the planet called the
  <strong>
   Forge World Graia
  </strong>
  , a critical planet for the
  <strong>
   Imperium of Man
  </strong>
  , is
  <strong>
   invaded by the Ork forces
  </strong>
  . The Imperium of Man is a vast and dystopian human empire,
  <strong>
   led by a god-like figure known as the Emperor
  </strong>
  . The force of the invading Orks compels the Imperium of Man to deploy a small group of Space Marines to contain the situation. This group consists of the main protagonist,
  <strong>
   Captain Demetrian Titus
  </strong>
  , alongside
  <strong>
   Sergeant Sidonus
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Leandros
  </strong>
  .

  The quest to eliminate the Ork forces eventually leads the marines to meet a scientist named
  <strong>
   Inquisitor Drogan
  </strong>
  , who unveils the existence of a
  <strong>
   powerful artifact called the Psychic Scourge
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   Drogan tricks the marines
  </strong>
  into thinking that the artifact is a powerful weapon of mass destruction and capable of eliminating the Orks. Titus, along with his crew, follow Inquisitor Drogan's instructions and
  <strong>
   insert the Psychic Scourge into a spire
  </strong>
  , opening a portal to yet another army of hostile invaders called the
  <strong>
   forces of Chaos, led by Lord Nemeroth
  </strong>
  . Now, the Space Marines are up against both Orks and the forces of Chaos, but ultimately manage to stop Nemeroth and save Planet Graia for the Emperor.

 <p>
  However, Captain Titus' ability to resist Warp energies (Psychic Scourge and Nemeroth's powers)
  <strong>
   raises suspicion from his ally, Leandros
  </strong>
  , leading to the arrest and interrogation of Captain Titus by the Inquisition.

    The Bulwark is definitely a popular one because the Chapter Banner skill is super helpful for not just you, but your squad mates. In saying that, I like the Vanguard. I find the Grapnel Hook ability super satisfying when you latch on and give a swift boot to a fellow super soldier.

  In
  <em>
   <strong>
    Space Marine 1
   </strong>
  </em>
  , players step into the shoes of Captain Titus,
  <strong>
   one of the members of the Ultramarines Chapter (division) of the Space Marines
  </strong>
  . Titus is a veteran Ultramarine and a former captain of the
  <strong>
   Ultramarines 2nd Company
  </strong>
  . He excelled at every challenge thrown his way during his recruitment and training,
  <strong>
   eventually turning into a powerful warrior and an inspiring leader
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Titus led the Ultramarines to defeat the forces of Chaos and the Orks,
  <strong>
   saving the Forge World Graia
  </strong>
  , but he was
  <strong>
   arrested by the Inquisition on suspicion of harnessing Warp energies
  </strong>
  . Titus was incarcerated for over a century following his arrest. During this time, he was both physically and mentally
  <strong>
   tortured to determine his potential connection to Warp and Chaos forces
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Feeling that he had brought shame upon the Ultramarines,
  <strong>
   Titus enlisted himself in the Deathwatch as penance
  </strong>
  . The Deathwatch is a military division of the Imperium that specializes in alient combat. You'll find Titus still serving under the Deathwatch during Space Marine 2's prologue, before his return to the Ultramarines.

  <em>

  is a direct sequel to the first game in the series, where you'll once again play as Titus,

   but this time as the Primaris Lieutenant instead of a Captain

  . Titus must once lead his band of
  <em>

  It isn't strictly necessary to play the first
  <em>
   Space Marine
  </em>
  game to enjoy
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  . Despite being a direct sequel to the first game,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2's
  </em>
  story is self-contained and provides enough exposition for players to enjoy the experience.

 <p>
  At the same time, playing
  <em>
   Space Marine 1
  </em>
  can definitely enhance your experience,
  <strong>
   enabling you to understand Captain Titus' character, motivations, and challenges
  </strong>
  . The first game also does the majority of world building, such as introducing iconic locations, exploring the conflict between the Imperium of Man and the forces of Chaos, and drawing the distinction between a Space Marine and a regular soldier, all of which lay the foundation for
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  to build upon.

 <p>
  Additionally, if you wish to experience the continuity of the
  <em>
   Space Marine
  </em>
  story, skipping the first game may not be ideal as the sequel may leave you with answered questions or make references to the first game, which you may not catch up on.

 <p>
  Finally, if you've been following the
  <strong>
   Warhammer 40K
  </strong>
  universe and enjoy action-packed third-person shooters, it's highly recommended to play
  <em>
   Space Marine 1
  </em>
  before jumping into sequel since it's a great game for its time. You can complete the game's main story in under eight hours and understand the plot better.

      <title>How Ghost of Tsushima's Role in Secret Level Could Foreshadow a Sequel's Path</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Tsushima
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been one of the most praised titles of the 2020s, which has left many hoping for a sequel on the horizon. After a successful PC port was released earlier this year, the audience for
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  has only expanded, making a follow-up entry feel inevitable.

 <p>
  Despite the PC port, there hasn't been much fresh
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  news or content -- until now. This year's Gamescom was filled to the brim with major announcements, but one of the most compelling was from Prime Video. During the opening night of Gamescom, Prime Video announced
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  , a 15-episode anthology series based on a variety of gaming titles.
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  helps make up the series roster, and it could give insight into what a potential sequel may hold.

  Potentially Setting the Stage For a Ghost of Tsushima Sequel
 </h3>
 <p>
  Hopes have been high for an official
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima 2
  </em>
  announcement, but Sucker Punch and Sony have yet to make those dreams become reality.
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  may not be a full-blown sequel, but if one is planned, it is likely that the
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  episode will lay the groundwork for the franchise's future. As of now, there is no clear plot for what
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  story will be about. Despite the mystery, it would be surprising if a new story focused on Jin Sakai didn't inspire the potential sequel at least a little bit.

 <p>
  Of course, there is the very real possibility that
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  could just be a one-off thing. There is a diverse list of games being featured in episodes, like
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sifu
  </em>
  . It is unlikely that every episode is going to be a teaser for future games, so it's possible that
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  is simply a fun way to explore franchises further in a singular narrative. Between
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  and the live action
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  movie currently in development, the property could just be branching out into other avenues instead of looking towards a sequel. However, the timing of
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>

  There have already been a massive number of great gaming events this year. From the various showcases to the huge events, like Gamescom, many developers and titles have had huge stages to make announcements from. However, there is still a major event on the horizon that makes the release date for
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  seem highly intentional.
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  is set to premiere on Prime Video on December 10, while the 2024 Game Awards go live on December 11.

 <p>
  Having this series and event premiere back-to-back is unlikely to be a mere coincidence. If a
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima 2
  </em>
  is on the horizon, the combination of
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  and the Game Awards would be the perfect opportunity for Sucker Punch to make an official announcement. It has now been four years since
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  was first released. If Sucker Punch has any intentions of making a new chapter, it is better for a reveal to come sooner rather than later.

 <p>
  Since
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's release, there have been several games based in feudal Japan, and Sucker Punch will want to continue riding the wave it helped start before it risks fizzling out. As the wait for
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima 2
  </em>
  continues, many are wondering why Sucker Punch has yet to make it official. However, the impending arrival of
  <em>
   Secret Level
  </em>
  and the Game Awards may give some long-awaited answers to questions about a new
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  .

   <em>
    Red Dead Online
   </em>
  </strong>
  brings the cowboy experience directly to the hands of the players. No longer will players be bound by a single-player experience with
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  . Now,
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  will allow players to explore the Wild West, either with friends or against enemies. This wild frontier is ripe for outlaws, bounty hunters, cowboys, and those just trying to keep to themselves. The question is, what should players do in their first 10 hours of
  <em>
   Red Dead Online?
  </em>

 <p>
  There are plenty of activities and important additions that players should make note of during their opening hours of
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  . The game can offer players plenty of fun if they know where to have it. However, the game also offers a variety of goodies, such as the best horses in
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  , and the best guns, which players will surely want, and fast.

   </strong>
   Sometimes, there's no greater feeling than embarking on an adventure in the Old West. Even if Red Dead Online doesn't have the best amount of content updates, new players can still ride into their own Western adventure with a new set of weapons and a horse by their side to make a name for themselves. With Red Dead Online being rather expansive and letting players do what they want upon their new beginnings, there are a few helpful tips that might give players ideas of what to do in Red Dead Online upon their first start.

 <p>
  It might be a costly expense so early on, but it's something to save up for. Players should keep their money safe and ensure that it's best used for saddles. Saddles help with horses by increasing their stamina and health cores, ensuring players can run for longer with their steeds. They should also invest in stirrups, which will increase the sprint speed of the horse.

 <p>
  With these two purchasable items in mind, players should be sure to go through the stables and make sure they are only buying the best, or at least the ones they can afford at the level they are currently at. Having a fast horse is vital for navigating the large map.

  Costing 15 Gold Bars, players can acquire the Bounty Hunter License when they begin their journey. Whilst it's essential to complete the tutorial, leaving the criminal life behind to fight on the right side of the law is going to be a great idea, as hunting down violent criminals provides new and exciting missions against some villainous outlaws, whilst also giving players XP, money, and gold nuggets.

 <p>
  Bounty Hunting is a great way to start out in
  <em>
   Red Dead Online

  , so feel free to spend Gold Bars on this role before the others, especially when it offers the most content outside of simply collecting things and being peaceful.

  Up to four players can work together to protect the frontier's most troubled settlements and towns from villains in a wave-based survival mode. With up to 10 waves of increasingly challenging enemies, Call to Arms will see players fight to protect their land and their allies, which will increase their XP gains and their experience throughout the dangerous world ahead of them.

 <p>
  Completing waves of Call to Arms is great from early access, as players will earn hundreds of dollars, plenty of XP, and even a gold bar. Repeating Call to Arms is a great idea, and for the most skilled players, it won't be too hard.

  Although this open-world has an adoration for harshness, there is also much beauty worth uncovering. In the main campaign, some players might have left behind the sights and wonders of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  to continue through the thrilling yet tragic story of Arthur Morgan, forgetting that this world is filled with different environments worth exploring.

  Whilst it may not earn players any in-game cash and treasures, it's still something players should take in. After all, there's no need to rush the experience, so take a break in those first ten hours to avoid being overwhelmed and just admire the many beautiful locations found within the world.

  If players are looking for something a tad easier for their time, and for those who are playing solo, Telegram Missions are great, as they will put players in a solo lobby so that they can complete the objectives available once they have accepted the Telegram Mission from a post office or camp lockbox, which will contain a letter.

  There are a few different missions, and a range of difficulties to try, with more rewards for those who try things the hard way. These missions can range from delivering wagons, stealing horses, and robbing homes, providing unique opportunities for cash early into the careers of new players.

  In the frontier, players can stumble across all sorts of strangers just looking to survive, or attempting to thrive by manipulating others to do their work. There's a fair mix of both of those categories in
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  's NPCs, and players can stumble across many different characters that they might recognize from previous
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  games, whether in the past or the future of the series.

  Strangers can often set players on specific quests so that they can earn some sweet cash and XP, and it also helps to learn the different sets of missions available in the game's world. These quests are great for new players to familiarise themselves with the content, and enjoy the few cutscenes of familiar faces.

  When players enter the Wild West, it's going to be clear that this is more of a survival game than they are used to, and their cores are going to deplete pretty quickly, especially every time they respawn after death. With depleted cores, players will be affected in many different ways, such as the inability to run, and the lack of health.

  It's always best to scrounge a few dollars and purchase some cheap food supplies that will keep the most important cores in shape, as both the health and stamina cores are essential to survival, whether it's roaming or fighting across the West.

 <p>
  As players are given the keys to their freedom in
  <em>
   RDRO
  </em>
  , they will find themselves with little choice when it comes to weaponry. They are going to be armed with a basic revolver, and one that isn't exactly going to see them rob people and thrive in shootouts. When players get some cash, they should head to any gunsmith in the quiet towns and start investing in weapons.

 <p>
  There are many different weapons players can claim, and each of them has their own advantages. Players will not just want a revolver to do their dirty work, as an abundance of rifles, repeaters, and shotguns will certainly help with the heavy lifting of taking out armies of enemies.

  Once players can freely explore the world, they can take a look at the map for Gang Hideouts. These are often marked with a red blob and skull on the map, and they can be found across the large map of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption Online
  </em>
  . Every Gang Hideout has an iconic location, complete with an army of enemies, and a boss fight with a Gang Leader in need of putting down.

 <p>
  Whilst this may not be easy alone, it is certainly doable, and it will see players earn new weapons from looting, as well as XP, cash, and perhaps even a Treasure Map once they find the Leader's body or a lock box. There are plenty of rewards stashed in a Gang Hideout, and if players are lucky enough to find a Treasure Map, then they are well on their way to earning Gold Bars and cash. Gold Bars are useful in
  <em>
   RDRO
  </em>
  due to the fact that they act as currency within the game that can (optionally) be purchased with real money.

  Players shouldn’t be afraid to spend some time creating a character that they are happy with. When they start their
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  adventure, they will have to create a character, and they should choose wisely. Players are going to be stuck with this character until they delete it, or spend gold to change it. Changing faces is expensive, and will set players back a whopping 10 Gold Bars, so it's best to start an adventure in
  <em>
   RDR Online
  </em>
  with a face players are happy with.

 <p>
  It’s best to make sure that the player is happy with their online character and their visuals, as they are going to spend a fair amount of time with them. It’s also best that they check the create a character screen for any additional bonuses before embarking out to the West.

  There’s a dedicated story in
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  . Players can expect to find new and familiar faces around the states of
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  , and they will be venturing through the wilderness and towns to complete some fairly intense missions, all with the company of choice, an integral aspect of these early story missions.

 <p>
  Completing story missions should be a priority of players, as not only will it net them some great XP and cash for their first time completing it, but it will also help assist their honor path, and help players choose where they want to go from here.

 <p>
  Choosing a horse is no easy task. A horse will be the life of a
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  player, and the way that they traverse through the wild. Players should pick their horse carefully, as although they will be able to buy the best horse in
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  eventually, they are going to want to use a decent starting horse.

 <p>
  It’s best to get the horse quickly and to buy horse insurance alongside it. This way, when the horse dies, it can whistle for a brand new variant of the same horse. However, if they do not have horse insurance, they will instead, summon a scrawny nag, which will be far slower than their normal horse.

  After getting set up in the Wild West, players should venture off to find their camp. Here, they will meet a good friend and a loyal partner named JB Cripps. Cripps is in charge of moving and managing the campsite that the player will call home. Here, they can upgrade some items, like the theme, tent, and flag.

  It’s great to be set up at the camp, as players will have a steady supply of equipment and safety from other players and AI-controlled enemies. The camp is the new home of the player, and while it may not be a penthouse in Los Santos, it’s as good as it can be for an outlaw.

  Free Roam Events are entirely exciting and involve a great number of other
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  players. A Free Roam Event will occur at random, and when it does, players should opt-in to participate to net themselves some keen rewards, like gold, XP, and cash. Free Roam Events don’t take too long, and there is a fun competitive element to them.

  The Collector Role is by far the best role for making money and claiming XP. Players will need to locate Madam Nazar and her caravan, which moves around the map daily. Although purchasing the Collector’s Bag to start the Collector Role in
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  will set players back 15 Gold Bars, it is well worth the price.

  Players can spend their time looking for treasure alongside a trusty amount of important tools like a metal detector and a shovel. Players can expect to find new treasures every day, and trade sets to Madam Nazar for a brilliant amount of cash and XP, ensuring that they will not remain a

  noob for long.

  One of the earliest things players should do in
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  is the story missions so that they can choose an honored path. Once players have committed to either being good or bad, they will unlock more story missions to further progress the
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  campaign, thus granting them more money and XP to evolve and upgrade their character and stats.

  As well as outfits, Ability Cards are the most expressive way for players in

  to show their skills. Ability Cards help players stay unique, as each of them will commit to a different ability that assists players against other players or AI enemies. Multiple different cards do a variety of different things, so it’s best to find the best Ability Cards in

  </em>
  to maximize combat efficiency.

 <p>
  Following a trend for September,
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  is adding another title that lures players into the virtual outdoors, this time with Ubisoft’s open-world
  <em>
   Riders Republic.
  </em>
  Xbox Game Pass will be undergoing some major changes in the near future, including another price hike that kicks in for current subscribers on September 12. The most notable upcoming change will be the addition of a Standard tier, which will be like Ultimate but without cloud gaming or day-one launch titles.

 <p>
  An Xbox Game Pass subscription offers a gamut of benefits, from being able to play some games right when they launch to discounts on purchases to awesome perks like a free Discord Nitro membership. In addition to its rotating library of games, the service also regularly offers “Free Play Days,” when gamers can spend a fun weekend checking out titles they might otherwise not get to try.

 <p>
  <em>
   Riders Republic
  </em>
  was one game offered via Free Play Days back in September 2023, and now the title has been added to the Xbox Game Pass catalog so that players can enjoy it for longer than a weekend. Originally launched in October 2021, the open-world sports game currently has a “Very Positive” review rating on Steam and a 78 aggregate score on OpenCritic.

  So far, Xbox has only confirmed seven of the titles coming to Game Pass in September, and after
  <em>
   Riders Republic,
  </em>
  there are three more on the way, all launching day one on the service.
  <em>
   Train Sim World 5,
  </em>
  arriving on September 17,
  <em>
  </em>
  will appeal to all the management sim fans out there.
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2,
  </em>
  set 30 years after the original highly rated game, will be added to Game Pass on September 20. And Oxide Games’
  <em>
   Ara: History Untold
  </em>
  will offer more strategy gaming to subscribers when it launches on September 24.

  In the age of live-service games, where popular online titles constantly evolve with years of support, new updates, and seasonal changes, single-player titles often fade from the spotlight just weeks after launch, soon overshadowed by the next big release. However, a few developers continue to go above and beyond for their fans, releasing regular updates with new content for years, often at no extra cost to those who already own the game.

  While long-term support for single-player games is more common in the indie scene —
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Factorio
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dwarf Fortress
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Deep Rock Galactic
  </em>
  are prime examples — some AAA developers have also adopted this practice. Sometimes, this extended support is part of an effort to fix a rocky launch, with studios aiming to win back fan goodwill as they prepare for their next big release. Below are some of the most well-known single-player titles that have received free updates over the years, as a gesture of appreciation from developers who strive to deliver the best possible experience for their fans.

  's launch in December 2020 is a textbook case of how things can go terribly wrong, damaging a developer's reputation and leading to the game being pulled from console storefronts due to its unplayable state. To CD Projekt Red's credit, they took full responsibility and set to work immediately, spending months fixing and patching the game. But that was only the beginning.

  By the time the massive 1.5 update was released in February 2022,
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  was in much better shape. Yet, the team wasn't done. In the lead-up to the
  <em>
   Phantom Liberty
  </em>
  expansion, the game received numerous free updates, including new content, missions, items, and reworked features. The final major update, 2.1, released in December 2023, fulfilled the promise of a working metro system and, alongside the massive 2.0 update, went far beyond mere bug fixes. This three-year journey of constant updates successfully restored fan faith and gave the game the conclusion it deserved.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dying Light
   </em>
  </strong>
  set a new standard for Techland — and the industry at large — by demonstrating just how extensively a single-player game can be supported post-launch. Over seven years, the game received a continuous stream of updates, culminating in the release of
  <em>
   Dying Light: Definitive Edition
  </em>
  in June 2022. Throughout its lifespan,
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  saw six free bundles featuring blueprints, items, cosmetic skins, new missions, quests, and challenges. Additionally, 11 content drops introduced a brand-new location, game mode, new weapons, bounties, and enemies.

 <p>
  Techland went even further by offering all base game owners a free upgrade to the
  <em>
   Enhanced Edition
  </em>
  , which included the
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  Year One Season Pass, bundling several paid expansions. By adding new game modes for free and delivering such consistent and meaningful updates, Techland created one of the most extensive long-term support models ever seen for a single-player title.

  The

  <strong>
   <em>
    Hitman 3

  </strong>
  (also known as
  <em>

  For more than two years, the developers have consistently updated the game with free content, including seasonal events, new challenges, suits, weapons, items, and player-curated contracts. The elusive target events, exclusive and time-limited, add a sense of urgency to the game. A major highlight of
  <em>
   Hitman 3
  </em>
  's post-launch support is the introduction of the free roguelike mode, Freelancer. Additionally, new elusive missions, such as The Disruptor (featuring Conor McGregor), have drawn fresh attention to the game. For
  <em>
   Hitman
  </em>
  fans,
  <em>
   Hitman 3
  </em>
  is a dream come true. Its continued support sets a new benchmark for single-player games, and players can only hope that more titles will receive such long-term care and content.

  Since the game's release, every owner of
  <em>

  has received plenty of new content, including skin bundles, bounty events, new survivor missions with unique rewards, and even new music. One of the latest additions is a new activity known as Tower Raid, where players clear floors of enemies to obtain new rewards. With the team showing no signs of slowing down, Techland may eventually follow their own precedent, perhaps even giving away paid expansions to players as a token of gratitude.

  While not exactly a AAA title (nor strictly single-player),
  <strong>
   <em>
    No Man's Sky
   </em>
  </strong>
  shares similarities with
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , having launched in a troubled state that led to widespread disappointment. However, what followed was remarkable: Sean Murray's team went above and beyond expectations, regularly delivering content updates and patches to bring the game closer to its original vision. From adding a proper multiplayer mode to enabling galactic exploration with friends to introducing dozens of new features,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  has significantly expanded its appeal. Its journey has become so unique that it stands in a league of its own.

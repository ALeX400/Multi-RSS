  <em>
   <strong>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </strong>
  </em>
  players have expressed their continued disappointment with the Switch version of the fighting game, this time with regard to how Homelander from
  <em>
   The Boys
  </em>
  looks. NetherRealm recently released the Homelander update for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  , which adds
  <em>
   The Boys
  </em>
  ' iconic Homelander as a playable character, alongside new skins for various characters. Homelander is the fifth DLC character in the game's Kombat Pack 1, alongside other guest stars like Peacemaker from DC Comics and
  <em>
   Invincible
  </em>
  's Omni-Man. This update was made available for all versions of the game, including the Switch version, which has again started drawing heat from fans.

  The developers released
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and the PC, with each version and character model looking incredibly realistic. However, the game was also ported to the Nintendo Switch, a console that is much less powerful than the other three platforms and has a reputation for third-party games running poorly.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  on Switch is no different, as it has garnered a lot of heat from fans, with many writing it off as "unplayable." The latest frustration drawn from the game is how Homelander looks in the Switch version.

 <p>
  Posted on the r/gaming subreddit by user ewelumokeke, they showed off some comparison shots of how Homelander looks in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  . While the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC versions all manage to realistically capture Anthony Starr's likeness of the character, the Switch version's character model takes a big hit in quality. Blemishes include less polished lighting, hair textures, and facial expressions.

 <p>
  The Switch version of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  continues to be lambasted by fans, as comments underneath the post mocked the quality of the model. Some comments note that the Switch is capable of making models look much better than this version of Homelander, with some being comparable to the other versions of
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  . As such, this might be an individual case of the QA team not double-checking the quality of this model for the Switch version.

However, the Switch version has also been criticized for its long load times and slowdown when compared to the other platforms.

  One of the key characteristics of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Final Shape expansion is the nostalgia-inducing reimagining of everything players have experienced during their time in
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . As players journey into the Pale Heart of the Traveler in pursuit of The Witness, the landscape begins to take shape, eventually becoming an abstract representation of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's most iconic images and locations. This is all due to the Pale Heart's ability to be transformed according to the memories and imagination of those who enter it, so as Guardians step inside, they begin to see the world they've spent a decade with taking on an entirely different appearance but still maintaining its identity.

  The location many players have most been looking forward to visiting in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Final Shape expansion is the Tower from the first game. Those who had the privilege of experiencing
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  in its earliest years know the Tower all too well, as they likely spent a significant amount of time there, much like they now have in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Tower. However, the version of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's Tower that is now present within The Final Shape's Pale Heart is a bit different, not unrecognizably so, but just enough to set it apart from the home base players became familiar with in the first game. As such, it's worth examining how this new Tower compares to the original in its layout, structure, and appearance.

 <p>
  As far as the overall structural layout of the Pale Heart's Tower goes, it's almost identical to the original
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  Tower. From a layout standpoint, everything is exactly where it was in the original Tower, to the point that it's possible to take screenshots of the Pale Heart's version and line them up exactly with the original Tower. Of course, there are plenty of things missing from this version of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's Tower that were in the original.

  There Are Several Things Missing From The Pale Heart's D1 Tower
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the Pale Heart Tower's Tower Watch plaza, veteran players will find that everything is exactly where they left it, but with a massive cosmetic overhaul now. There is still one Vault available via a console embedded into the base of one of the trees growing out from where the old Vaults used to be, but the others are inaccessible. The Postbox is exactly where the Postmaster used to be in the original Tower, but the Eververse store that used to be on the other side of that building is missing. Players can find Cayde-6 standing near where Xander 99-40, the Bounty Tracker, once was, and trees have grown over where Master Rahool's stall and Banshee's shop used to be. Furthermore, the Tower Hangar has been completely closed off due to vegetation growth.

 <p>
  Traveler's Walk, which was the large courtyard on the east side of the original
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's Tower, has been made permanently inaccessible in the Pale Heart's Tower. Players can venture downstairs to where the Hall of Guardians was in
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  , but a tunnel of tree roots leading to the Tower's exterior has replaced it in the Pale Heart's version. Tower North is still open in the Pale Heart's Tower, and this is actually where players will meet Cayde-6 during The Final Shape's campaign. Here, veteran players can revisit the Speaker's platform where they were directed to shortly after the first
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's prologue mission. Unfortunately, every other area in Tower North is blocked off.

 <p>
  For the most part, the Pale Heart's Tower in The Final Shape stays true to the original. Its structural layout is nearly identical to the first, but it is missing some of the original's key components. However, this is all understandable, as it fits in with The Final Shape's narrative and what has now been made available to players in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Tower.

  <em>
   Night Springs
  </em>
  is the first DLC for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alan Wake 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This shadow dropped DLC consists of three episodes that aren't particularly long. For the first episode, you play as Rose. In the second episode, you play as Jesse Faden from
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  . Only in this DLC, she is simply referred to as "The Sibling". While the second episode of
  <em>
   Night Springs
  </em>
  isn't particularly long, it does have some brain-teasing puzzles. If you find yourself stuck, here is how you can complete Episode 2: North Star.

  With the gate now unlocked, enter Coffee World. Ignore the shadows and walk past them. Just past the two shadows, you will see a cooler on the ground that can be opened, and it contains ammo and batteries. From there, take a right when you see a sign for the Tasting Room. When the path splits, take a right toward the lit up gazebo. Make sure to loot the cooler to the left of the shadow while you are heading there.

  The warehouse is blocked by a barrier made out of darkness. Just like in the base campaign of
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  , you use the flashlight to get rid of the barrier. Be ready though, as the moment the barrier goes down you will be swarmed by a group of Taken. Once the Taken have been dealt with, go toward the warehouse.

  Approach the intercom on the left and interact with it. Eventually, you will be given some dialogue options for guessing the passkey. None of the options listed work. The intercom does mention an orientation video which contains the pass key. To find it, go back to the central plaza of Coffee World and follow signs for the Welcome Center.

  Inside the Welcome Center, you will find a TV with a VCR next to it. Interact with the VCR to discover that the videotape is missing. Head back to the gazebo and talk to the sheriff. While he is reluctant to give out information about the tape, he does eventually tell you that he hid it in the Ferris wheel.

  Take the key and head up toward the Ferris wheel, which is called the Slow Roaster on the map for Coffee World. It's the biggest landmark in Coffee World, making it almost impossible to miss. There will be a couple of Taken lurking nearby, so be vigilant. Approach the terminal that controls the Ferris wheel and use the key to operate it. Each kart is labeled.

   Wait for cart four to come down and then stop the Ferris wheel

  Interact with the cart, take the video, and head back to the Welcome Center. Use the VCR to learn the password, which is
  <strong>
   "Truth"
  </strong>
  . Head back to the warehouse and use the intercom. While the password is correct, it needs another one. None of the dialogue options you are given work. Go back to the central plaza where the Roasting Bar is. There will be three posters on the wall that provide hints on the optimal temperature for roasting the coffee. There is also a note on the nearby table with crossed out numbers.

As players went through the campaign, many were attempting to gear up for the coming raid known as Salvation's Edge, an event that would herald another World's First race to see which Fireteam could come out on top. Prior to the launch of The Final Shape and its accompanying raid, Salvation's Edge, Bungie teased that more content would be coming to the game once the World's First race was concluded. As it turns out, players now have more to do in-game.

  At 1pm ET, the World's First race for Salvation's Edge kicked off, pitting fireteams all over against one another to see who could overcome the puzzles, challenges, and bosses first. As many in the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  community looked on, it was ultimately Team Parabellum who managed to take down the raid before anyone else, with a Fireteam made up of Astro, bravo, DrakathShadow, Ham, Jake, and Tyrake. As promised, the 6-person squad will now be memorialized with World First raid belts, along with gaining access to other rewards that include a jacket, sling bag, and a couple of emblems.

  However, the completion of Salvation's Edge benefits all
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players, as new content has been unlocked for everyone. As Bungie indicates, The Witness has retreated following the events of the raid and now, it is up to all players to finish the fight for the fate of the Sol System. Bungie announced the addition of a new activity called Excision, which can be activated from the Pale Heart destination for those who have finished the main Final Shape campaign in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . Unlike typical PvE activities, Excision is the first-ever 12-player activity pitting players against The Witness once and for all. No other details were provided, but considering this is the final battle against the villain that has orchestrated the events of the Light and Darkness saga these past 10 years, expect it to be an epic ride.

  This isn't the first time a raid has been used to unlock additional content following the completion of a raid race. Most famously, the Last Wish World First Raid Race back in 2018, which took over 18 hours to complete, had a major impact on the
  <em>
   Destiny 2

  world. Once Riven was taken down and the completion confirmed, the 3-week curse cycle that the destination has been known for began in full, corrupted from Riven's final wish and giving players access to new missions and events.

      <title>Why 7 Companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard Should Be The Sweet Spot</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-7-companions-good-party-size/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The long wait for news about the next
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age
   </em>
  </strong>
  game is finally over. Some of the first information revealed is that there will be seven companions in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . This means that
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  will have the smallest group of companions in a
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game to date, comparable to the first
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  's six. Furthermore, rather than bringing three companions with them as a party on quests and to explore Thedas, players will only be able to bring two companions with them at a time.

 <p>
  BioWare hasn't revealed the reasons behind these changes, and being limited in bringing two party members on quests will likely dramatically change strategy and combat. Seven companions will likely also change the rogue-mage-warrior composition of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's party, making it a very different game from its predecessors. However, every
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game has changed its formula in similar ways, and the decrease in companions could be a very good sign from BioWare in the confidence of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  .

   : 10 companions, with 1 optional companion (Loghain) and Dog.

 <p>
  Dropping the companion count by as much as three may seem like a bad move, but it's one that some have advocated for in both
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  and other similar games, such as
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  which had ten possible companions. Having so many companions offers variety, but resources when designing and creating a video game are limited, and some characters will often have stories that aren't as fulfilling as others. Some companions in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  have significantly less content than others, with Wyll being a prominent example alongside Karlach, whose story sometimes feels unfinished at times.

 <p>
  Limiting the number of companions to seven hits the sweet spot of providing variety, while being able to give each character the resources, time, attention, and content that they deserve. Shortening the party roster by just two means that the resources that would have gone to other companions will now be used to create richer, interactive, and fulfilling stories. This will likely also lend itself to
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's combat system, which BioWare has confirmed to be limited to just two party members alongside the player character.

 <p>
  What's also encouraging about the decision to keep the companion count at seven is that it signals a confidence from BioWare in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  that has been sorely needed. Rather than flooding
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  with many characters in the hopes that some of them will resonate, the move to limit the number indicates BioWare's confidence in the writing and design of what is to come. Character stories are one of the core components of BioWare games, and this move could hail the developer's return to form.

 <p>
  After the critical reception to
  <em>
   Mass Effect: Andromeda
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  , BioWare needs
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  to succeed on a number of counts. Creating beloved characters is one of the best places to reignite faith in its fans, and to bring in new players passionate about the world, the characters, and the lore.

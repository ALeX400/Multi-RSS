  A massive update will soon be hitting
  <strong>
   <em>
    Apex Legends
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans everywhere, with its 22nd season promising major changes. Coming hot off the heels of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  ' biggest debacle, Shockwave's shifts in direction will need this dramatic weight and more to win back the fanbase.

  ' just narrowly escaped a huge controversy, an outcry so sweeping that the game is still reeling from the exodus of players and content creators it provoked. Respawn's attempts to gate its game's battle pass exclusively behind real currency was the straw that broke the fanbase's back; major hacking incidents, overbearing monetization, and a game full of glitches turned
  <em>
   Apex
  </em>
  's community into a tinderbox. Fortunately for Respawn, Shockwave offers a chance for redemption.

  The city-scape of Fragment is one of the most popular hot-drop spots in

With high heights and new grav-cannon launchers, players will be able to duck and dive across the map in spectacular rooftop combat.
  <em>

  ' new E-District is also rife with

  Akimbo Pistols, Battle Sense, and New Loot Bins
 </h3>
 <p>
  Akimbo pistols have finally come to
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  . Now players can dual wield two P2020s or two Mozambiques. While the player can't aim down sights in this mode, as doing so will only tighten hipfire spread, this snazzy method of gunfire has an increased rate of fire, mirrored attachments, and a doubled mag size. LMGs also have their own big change, as a new shield hopup will give fans a regenerating shield similar to Gibraltar's passive. All light weapons also benefit from better ammo storage (stacking in units of 72 in the inventory), and shotguns have been buffed with a tighter spread, higher damage, and their own storage improvement.

 <p>
  Many changes have also been made to keep the game's momentum up. This includes loot bin tweaks; not only have different rarities of loot bins been added—including a single mythic bin per match—but loot bins will now close and refresh their contents partway through the match. Healing items have also been given their own row in death boxes and Loba's ultimate, a quality-of-life feature that goes nicely with the automatic callout for ammo that will activate when players run out of reserve supply. Most controversial of these is
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  ' new Battle Sense feature, which will show an enemy's health in a close-quarters fight. It won't reveal a foe's position or highlight them from a distance, but otherwise it will display health and shields similarly to Seer's tactical.

 <h3 id="new-modes">
  New Modes
 </h3>
 <p>
  A number of new modes are coming alongside the launch of
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  Shockwave, including Revival—a battle royale mode that will allow players to instantly respawn, so long as one teammate is still kicking. Bot Royale is designed for new players, allowing for a quick battle royale match where a squad of humans, or one human and some bots, can take on a small lobby of bots. Also for new players will be the Welcome Pass: a set of challenges to guide them through the early game.

 <h3 id="balance-changes-and-bug-fixes">
  Balance Changes and Bug Fixes
 </h3>
 <p>
  A healthy heap of bug fixes are coming to
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  , alongside balance changes. Alter, Ballistic, Crypto, Lifeline, Rampart, Seer, Vantage, and Wattson have seen tweaks, but more sweeping changes include a nerf to aim assist (specifically for controller players on PC; console lobbies will remain unaffected) and buffs to certain class perks. Recon characters now have a limited form of threat vision when they aim down sights, while Controller legends get shield overcharge when playing in the zone—as well as the ability to remotely regain undamaged tacticals.

  When you first start your farming journey in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fields of Mistria
   </em>

  <strong>
   ten slots for carrying items

  Recent rumors have implied that
  <strong>
   Warner Bros.
  </strong>
  may be looking into selling a large stake in its video game business as part of a company-wide division of financial debts and an attempt to increase its share price. While nothing is confirmed as yet, Warner Bros. has faced significant turmoil in recent years as a result of various financial shortcomings on both the film and video game fronts.

  Warner Bros. has been a major player in the gaming industry for a long time, having acquired TT Games, the developer behind the popular LEGO video games, in 2007, as well as
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  studio Rocksteady. It is also the owner of NetherRealm Studios, of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat

  The company faced a massive loss of an estimated $200 million after Rocksteady's

  Just weeks before rumors that it would be selling off a good chunk of its gaming stakes, Warner Bros. purchased
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  developer Player First Games, which already enjoyed a close partnership with the company beforehand. Another
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  spinoff called
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is also currently set for release later this year, leaving some room for speculation as to the game's ultimate fate.

  The rumored decision to sell off its gaming stakes is just one of many proposed plans from Warner Bros. in recent years to rack up its stock prices for investors following its 2022 merger with Discovery, which spawned from an effort to compete with the likes of Disney and Netflix. It has seemingly been an uphill battle ever since for the company, and it remains to be seen what may happen to many of its previously announced projects, such as the mysterious
  <em>
   Wonder Woman
  </em>
  video game set to release next year.

   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  is one of Bethesda's biggest games to date, and it recently had a mod release called
  <em>
   Fallout London,
  </em>
  which is the biggest mod to date for the game. This mod takes players through the streets of London, England as the Wayfarer, the mod's equivalent of the base game's Sole Survivor.

  Along the way, players will meet several different companions, join some factions, and even start some settlements. Just like in the base game, settlements are where players can build their own place in the game, finding different NPCs to join their settlement, and create an oasis among the horror that is the world post-Great War.

  Settlements in the mod are done just like settlements in the base game. Thankfully, just like in the base game, players can access these pretty early, which helps tremendously with getting started within London's world. Here's a breakdown of all the settlements, what Workstations they have, and how to get access to them as a settlement.

 <p>
  When looking at settlements in Fallout London, players will want to get the Local Leader Perk since this Perk not only lets players get the London Bridge settlement, but it also just helps with settlements overall. Additionally, players should consider which one of the settlements they want to spend the most time on, because working on all of them at once can really spread resources thin. A lot of players have noted that the Covent Garden or Vuaxhall Grove Construction Site are the two best settlements. Additionally, Camden Lock already comes pretty furnished, which is nice.

  The newest trailer from Steel Wool Studios shows off
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's Secret of the Mimic
  </em>
  , with a short 42-second video teaser, detailing a music box and an animatronic peeking out from inside it. As the footage burns away, the date 1979 can be seen, and combining this with the video description stating that "to see the future sometimes you need to understand the past,"
  <em>
   Secret of the Mimic
  </em>
  seems to be a prequel. If the game is set in 1979, it will be the earliest any
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy
  </em>
  game has been set in the timeline. If this is the case,
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's
  </em>
  <em>
   : Secret of the Mimic
  </em>
  could be a goldmine for hidden lore previously unknown to fans.

  The Mimic is a character in
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's
  </em>
  canon that was initially introduced in
  <em>
   Tales from the Pizzaplex
  </em>
  , an anthology series of short horror novels set within the
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's
  </em>
  universe. The Mimic was an antagonist in one such novel, and his story culminated in the
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach - RUIN
  </em>
  as he reappeared again as the primary antagonist. With
  <em>
   Secret of the Mimic,
  </em>
  fans are not only getting more insight into the Mimic but also the entire franchise as a whole, as the exact date the game is set could open the game up to explore stories previously unavailable.

    The First Descendant
   </strong>
  </em>
  is not a unique shooter, but it brings a lot of new things to the table to separate itself from the competition. The looter shooter offers a lot of weapons and mods to keep players returning for more. However, players will have their work cut out for them if they go against difficult enemies. When facing unsurmountable odds, players will find the HP Collector Module to be right up their alley.

  The HP Collector Modul, also known as the HP Concentration Module, is an ultimate mod that will give you an edge on the battlefield. The Module allows players to instantly recover 9% of their Max HP after defeating an enemy. However, the Module has an 11s Cooldown. The good news is you can decrease the cooldown duration by upgrading the Module.

  The HP Collector Module can be found as a drop from completing events. Like most drops, it depends on the Random Number Generator when the Module will drop for you. All is not lost, though, as there are some locations where you can increase your chances of obtaining the Module and maximize your farming.

  To get the HP Collector Module, your best bet would be to complete the Lost Supply Depot: Vulgus Strategic Outpost located in Vespers. The drop rate may be low, but you can repeat this mission quickly without waiting for the timer to reset. Essentially, this is what you need to do:

  <li>
   Teleport to Vespers.

  <li>
   Head to the Lost Supply Depot: Vulgus Strategic Outpost.
  </li>
  <li>
   Eliminate all enemies and pick up the loot.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you do not get the HP Collector Module, return to the gate for The Ruins at the south and change zones.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now, return to the previous zone and play the mission again.
  </li>
  <li>
   Rinse and repeat until you get the HP Collector Module.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout
   </strong>
  </em>
  series from Bethesda has always challenged players to try and survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Much of this survival involves defeating dangerous enemies, finding useful weapons, or saving other survivors. The wasteland in this series has always been a fun place to explore, but the development team made things far more interesting by adding the settlement feature in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
   .
  </em>

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The settlement feature allows players to find certain locations in the game and build a safe sanctuary for other survivors with the junk they have collected. These settlements must provide food, shelter, water, and power for their inhabitants, and they can even be attacked by enemies. Of course, every settlement in the game is different, and players will find running and building in one is far more enjoyable than others. Some locations make for fantastic settlements, but unfortunately, there are also not-so-good settlement locations. Some settlement locations on this list are solid but come with huge drawbacks; some are mediocre or boring, and some are just downright bad

  <em>
   <strong>
    by Benjamin Joe
   </strong>
   : Fallout 4 is seeing a huge spike in player count despite being released back in 2015. This is partly down to the release of the hit Fallout TV series. Whether the player is completely new to the game or returning to another playthrough, settlement building is something that all players will spend a fair amount of time working on while playing.
  </em>
  <em>
   Most players will have their own personal favorite settlement that they will use as their main base of operations. That said, while each player will have a favorite location to build in, they will also have some settlements that they don't enjoy building in.

  When players first stumble across Covenant, it is obvious that something weird is going on in the town. The Sole Survivor must answer a questionnaire to enter this settlement, and everyone inside is overly friendly. To be able to use this town as a new settlement,
  <strong>
   players must uncover the conspiracy within Covenant
  </strong>
  and complete its quest by wiping out all the current residents. It's a surprisingly detailed side quest that allows the player to make a fairly meaningful decision towards the end.

 <p>
  The settlement is mostly a set of ready-built houses, which means that building in this area mainly involves placing furniture. Plus, these houses can make wiring up power in the settlement a real pain. What's worse is the fact that there is little green space in the center to plant enough food for all the settlers who will come flocking. It can be a great place for those who aren't a big fan of building from scratch. But for those keen builders, Covenant probably isn't the best place to call home.

  The Castle becomes the main settlement for the Minutemen faction during one of the main quests in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . Clearing this location isn't easy. This quest requires the player to successfully wipe out a Mirelurk Queen and its eggs to progress. It's a big fight that the player needs to be well prepared for. At first glance, The Castle looks like an ideal settlement for someone looking to provide shelter for other survivors. There is plenty of space in the center to plant crops or build generators, but much of this structure has already been built.

 <p>
  The old castle ruins are great places to put furniture, but that's as creative as players can be. The only other thing for players to do here is plug up the gaps in the walls to make it harder for enemies to attack. While it is possible to build in the castle's central area, because of the radio tower in the middle,
  <strong>
   building can be a little tricky
  </strong>
  . Unfortunately, while the settlement-building ability is pretty detailed, it can also be quite buggy, especially when trying to place down items in very specific areas.

  Any player that sides with The Brotherhood of Steel faction in
  <em>
   Fallout 4's
  </em>
  main questline will eventually be given access to their Boston Airport settlement. While having an airport to build on may seem exciting at first, it really isn't much to look at.

  The Boston Airport does provide players with a good amount of scrap, as there are lots of cars in the place to delete.
  <strong>
   However, much of this airport is just one solid square of tarmac
  </strong>
  that players cannot use to grow crops or purify water. As a result, it isn't a good idea to use Boston Airport as a main settlement. Fortunately, it does provide enough space and resources to build the teleporter into the institute for players who do not want this eyesore in any other settlement.

 <p>
  It can be a good place for those looking to create a somewhat lazy build, but avid builders may find this settlement a little bit boring.

  Greentop Nursery is a settlement that players will encounter when doing quests for Preston Garvey of the Minutemen.
  <strong>
   It is unlocked as a settlement once players solve the kidnapping quest
  </strong>
  for the people who live here, but the place is only comprised of a single house and a greenhouse. Therefore, this small space provides a great place for players to grow food, but it isn't really good for anything else.

  Its only real saving grace is that the area is void of tall buildings. So, if the player wants to build a tall structure, they won't be impeded by existing items that can't be removed.

  Hangman's Alley is a raider settlement that players will find on their way to Diamond City. Obviously, players will need to clear out the raiders inside to be able to use this location as a place to build and attract settlers.

 <p>
  As its name suggests, Hangman's Alley is a small alleyway that is narrow and tall. As a result, many players will struggle to build any worthwhile structures inside. It is best to build a lot of platforms between buildings here to store things rather than trying to build a functioning town. Plus,
  <strong>
   Hangman's Alley is often attacked by nearby raiders,
  </strong>
  so players will need to put a lot of resources into defending this settlement.

 <p>
  It can be a fun area for players who enjoy a challenge, as it is technically possible to build some fairly complex structures in this small area. But, overall, this place doesn't offer much to those wanting to build something large and lavish.

 <p>
  Players will start
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  in a settlement called Sanctuary Hills. This ruined suburban town is where they will learn all about settlement building, and it is one of the best places to build in the game. However, the second settlement that players will come across in the main story is Red Rocket Diner.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":10,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":10,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1036} -->

 <p>
  This location is memorable for being the place where players first meet Dogmeat, but not much else. Red Rocket Diner is far too small a location to build a proper settlement, and the small, exposed restaurant always seems to attract attacks from raiders.

 <p>
  If players really want to build here,
  <strong>
   then the best thing to do is work from the roof and build upwards.
  </strong>
  But even then, with Sanctuary Hills being just a stone's throw away, most players will spend very little time working on this settlement.

  For many players, Spectacle Island is one of the best places to build a settlement in
  <em>
   Fallout 4.
  </em>
  This wide-open and secluded area is great for building a big town, and it is rarely attacked by enemies. Unfortunately, clearing out this settlement is a huge task.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":12,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":12,"nbrPlacementsScanned":12,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":263} -->
 <p>
  Firstly, players need to build up a significant resistance to radiation damage to even get to the island. Secondly, Spectacle Island is
  <em>
   infested
  </em>
  with Mirelurks, and players must find a hidden switch to get rid of these creatures. Plus, the land they are left with is so big that
  <strong>
   it is difficult to build anything of value without using mods.
  </strong>

 <p>
  This settlement is great as a testing area due to its size. But, aside from that, it doesn't offer that much to players. Also, it does have a couple of small central structures that can't be removed, which makes building a little tricky.

  The Mechanist is the main villain in the
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  DLC, and their aim is to build robots to try and bring some control to the wasteland.
  <strong>
   When players finally beat their robots and finish the entire questline, they will be given The Mechanist's Lair as a settlement to build in.

 <p>
  At first, having a former robot-building factory seemed like a great gift. However, the novelty quickly wears off once players realize how boring this settlement is. The Mechanist's Lair is just an empty building, one that cannot be used to grow food. Plus, settlers cannot be called to live here, which is one of the best aspects of building a settlement, so The Mechanist's Lair is easily the worst settlement in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  as it serves no purpose.

 <p>
  Many players were underwhelmed after completing the Mechanist questline. While the Mechanist's armor was a cool addition to the game, the lair is fairly pointless.

  Over the years, Bethesda has added several new weapons to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  While some of those weapons haven't been well-received, some of them have become massively popular and very valuable among the
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  community.

 <p>
  One of the game's most popular newer weapons is the Cremator. This heavy weapon was brought into the game with the America's Playground update. This untradable weapon has become the weapon of choice for lots of players. It's hard-hitting, it has a fantastic range, and its modification options are great. If the player is lucky enough to roll some decent legendary effects, then the Cremator can be a truly devastating weapon.

  How To Get The Cremator
 </h3>
 <p>
  Originally, the Cremator was one of the rewards available during Season 16. The weapon itself and all of the mods could be unlocked by ranking up through the season. However, because of how popular this weapon has become, players who weren't able to get it during Season 16 can now purchase the Cremator and all of the mods from Mortimer in The Crater.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1022} -->

 <p>
  To buy the Cremator plan from Mortimer, the player will need to complete the main Wastelanders questline. After that questline has been completed, Mortimer will arrive at the Crater Core. However, players will need to have reached the rank of ally to be able to purchase the plan to craft the Cremator. Mortimer sells the plan for the Cremator for 750 Gold Bullion. He will also sell the mods for around 150 Gold Bullion each.

  While the Cremator does a lot of base damage, with the right perks and mod combination,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  it's possible to use the Cremator to take down bosses with relative ease. The options a player chooses will depend on their perks and legendary effects. The modding options can be seen below:

 <p>
  There are also a handful of paint options that players can unlock. So, not only can the Cremator be modded to suit most playstyles, but there are also colors and themes to suit all tastes.

  While the Cremator is powerful when used as a standard flamer, if the player attaches the Slow-Burning Tank modification, then this weapon can take down tough enemies in just a single shot. The Slow-Burning Tank will cause targets to lose large amounts of health over time.

 <p>
  Should the player shoot a tanky enemy like a Fog Crawler or a Glowing Ghoul, then the creature will continuously lose health every second for a total of 12 seconds. That said, even without this mod, the Cremator can still take down tough enemies with just a couple of shots.

  Outside of V.A.T.S., The Cremator has a pretty good range
  <strong>
  </strong>
  when compared to some of the other weapons in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  .
  <em>
  </em>
  With the right build and setup, this weapon can fire further than many of the automatic rifles, like The Handmade and The Fixer.

 <p>
  By being able to hit enemies that are far away, players won't really need to worry much about melee attackers, as they won't get close enough to the player to cause any damage. The Cremator is perfect for events like Eviction Notice, as the player can just sit on top of a cliff and fire down at the enemies from a distance.

 <p>
  While it is pretty costly in V.A.T.S., it is also pretty accurate. Not only that, but the weapon is also accurate when firing from the hip or aiming down the barrel. Since the bullets fired are pretty large, it makes hitting a target a little bit easier. Also, if the player is using the Grenadier perk, then they will be able to cause damage over a larger area.

  The Cremator's area damage isn't as far-reaching as explosive weapons, but it can tag some enemies who are close to the initial target. This makes it a great weapon to use during events like Radiation Rumble, as the player will be able to gain lots of XP for tagging enemies.

 <p>
  Just like most of the other flame-based weapons, the Cremator works with the perk card Friendly Fire.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  This perk allows players to heal fellow teammates and event NPCs. This can come in very handy during events like Fasnacht Day, Radiation Rumble, and Riding Shotgun, as the player can use the Cremator to keep the NPCs alive.

 <p>
  It is worth noting that it will take a little longer to heal NPCs when compared to the standard flamer. This is because the Cremator has a much slower rate of fire. That said, it can be a nice bonus for events where keeping NPCs alive is crucial.

  Unlike some of the other weapons in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  the Cremator doesn't have a lot of recoil when fired. While it does have some recoil, it is much more manageable than some of the other weapons in the game.

 <p>
  Weapons like the Railway Rifle are incredible inside V.A.T.S. but borderline useless outside of V.A.T.S. The Cremator can be fired from the hip without the player having to fight against lots of recoil. This makes the Cremator a pretty versatile weapon
  <strong>
  </strong>
  that can be used efficiently in various situations.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  player experienced a weird glitch that made it unclear if they'd caught a Family of Three or Four variant of Maushold. The moment has generated some laughs in the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  community, though it's not clear why this bug transpired in the first place.

 <p>
  Maushold is an unusual Pokemon in that it has different forms of its evolutions. Diglett, for example, evolves into Dugtrio, consistently changing from one head to three. However, Maushold can appear as Family of Four or Family of Three, with a different number of creatures making up the Pokemon.

  <em>

  player matphoto shared their experience with the community of not being sure if they'd managed to get the rarer Family of Three or if they had a Family of Four. The screenshot reveals what looks like a Family of Three Maushold, but a fourth can be seen lingering off to the side, separated from the rest of the family. According to the player, sometimes the fourth Pokemon would be there, while other times, it would disappear, leading them to wonder which they'd actually gotten.

 <p>
  Fellow
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans responded with both jokes and advice. Players mused about the fourth member of the Maushold family being the step-child, or the least favorite child, who was forced to stand off to the side for the family portrait. Others joked about the fourth Maushold being a neighbor's kid, or that they were simply shy. Players also offered advice on determining which kind of Maushold it was, suggesting that the fan check their
  <em>

  Pokedex.

 <p>
  In the end, the player reported that the fourth Maushold had "run away," as it simply stopped appearing with the rest of the family. This confirmed that they got the rare Maushold Family of Three, which other players congratulated them on. Whether fans seek it out in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , the Family of Three can be very difficult to acquire. Even without the Maushold's glitchy appearance, this is a pretty special find.

  Strangely, Maushold and its predecessor Tandemaus have a history of being glitchy, even outside of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . Early on in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  's release, players reported having weird moments of their Maushold being invisible, or one player receiving a single Tandemaus instead of the pair that it's supposed to come with. While these were ultimately just visual glitches that didn't impact gameplay severely, it's interesting that the unusual mouse Pokemon continues to have abnormal moments in
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games.

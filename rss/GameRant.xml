  A highly skilled
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has recreated a stunning replica of the alien blaster pistol, a close range weapon that can be found at a location within the Bethesda Game Studios game. Since its launch in 2015,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  players have applauded the open world post-apocalyptic title not only for its immersive environments and fun exploration, but also for its incredible attention to detail and unique secret locations.

 <p>
  The game continues to surprise even veteran players nine years down the road from its release with cool things like a hidden diamond city store detail in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  and none other than a painting of Todd Howard himself riding a horse. However, one of the most exciting elements to the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series is its dedicated and creative community, who love nothing more than designing and crafting amazing-looking items found within the game.

 <p>
  Over on Reddit, user Octolops098 has crafted an excellent replica of
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's Alien Blaster Pistol. The talented fan created the futuristic weapon by using 3D printing and then airbrushing the pistol's body with red paint, making sure to include a little bit of rust so it maintains a weathered appearance. Octolops098 also included LED lights on the Alien Blaster Pistol's sides and on the nose so that it glows, which is especially at night where the weapon really stands out. The pistol is one of the most powerful weapons in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , and fires blue bolts of energy, dealing around 50 damage to enemies without any pistol perks.

  For players who haven't played the game just yet,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's Alien Blaster Pistol can be found at a UFO crash site and obtained by finding an almost dead alien and then looting its corpse. The Alien Blaster Pistol uses AB rounds for ammunition, but players can change the weapon to use Fusion Cells by using
  <em>
   Fallout 4's
  </em>
  weapon modding system. Along with exciting alien stories,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  has a host of hidden locations scattered across its world that includes a haunted school, a recreation of the Titanic, and a robot-run American diner.

      <title>Best Games To Play If You Like Mass Effect</title>

 <p>
  When one talks about some of the greatest role-playing games ever made, it goes without saying that the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect
   </em>
  </strong>
  series would be a major part of this conversation. While the series might've ended on a frustratingly low note, there's no denying the fact that BioWare had created a rich, deep, and intricate sci-fi world that had enraptured fans from all over the globe.

  Be it through the original versions or the
  <em>
   Legendary Edition
  </em>
  remasters, Commander Shepard's story is always worth revisiting. Even
  <em>
   Andromeda
  </em>
  has plenty of positives. However, the wait for the franchise to produce something new could be very long, so here are some
  <strong>
   games like
   <em>
    Mass Effect
   </em>
  </strong>
  that fans can choose to play instead before this sci-fi epic finally makes its much-awaited return to the modern gaming market.

   <em>
    Updated September 23, 2024 by Mark Sammut:

  </strong>
  <em>
   At the end of October, BioWare will release Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which could be a great option for Mass Effect fans. Obviously, the setting and combat will be largely different, but the franchises have always shared similar writing styles and progression.

  In terms of non-BioWare games, September 2024 produced one project that might hit the spot, provided someone's priority is combat rather than story. Star Wars Outlaws is also an OK shout, but it does not share too much in common with Mass Effect beyond being a sci-fi game with multiple planets and third-person shooter gameplay. Still, anyone who enjoys Star Wars and Ubisoft should check it out.

  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  is pretty awesome and worth a recommendation for anyone craving a planet-hopping epic; that said, its strengths lie in different areas than the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  trilogy. BioWare's franchise shines the brightest in its universe-building, character-writing, and player choice. Conversely,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's crowning achievements are its crunchy combat and co-op implementation. That's not to say that Saber Interactive put together a terrible story, just that it is not the priority. The campaign tells a respectable tale over the span of about 10 hours, even finding the time to give its protagonist an arc; however, ultimately, it is just there to usher players from set piece to set piece, allowing them to demolish armies and armies of enemies along the way.

 <p>
  Still,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  is a blast that shares just enough elements with
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  to warrant a mention. Both games feature team-based combat, with players being sidelined by two NPCs. Fortunately, the 2024 release supports co-op, allowing other users to take control instead of AI. Although only featuring three planets,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  still has quite a bit of variety, all the while demonstrating an impressive sense of scale through its environments. The campaign nails the fact that players are engaged in an overwhelming war against a threat of cosmic proportions.

  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  has managed to remain relevant for nearly a decade, an impressive feat considering the game had a relatively rough launch. Digital Extremes' sci-fi action RPG started life as a fun but repetitive shooter consisting of linear missions. Over the years, the free-to-play title has greatly expanded its scope, even introducing open areas that emphasize exploration. Nowadays, the game also offers far more options when it comes to builds.

 <p>
  Naturally, this sort of project tends to be a grind, and
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  is no exception. While money can be spent to speed up progression, players who stick to the free version will not feel too restricted by their decision. More importantly, they can look forward to hundreds of hours of tight gameplay, slow but good storytelling, and a fair amount of customization options.
  <em>

  even expands into open areas after its initial hours.

 <p>
  Admittedly, this recommendation is mostly driven by a desire to promote
  <em>
   The Expanse
  </em>
  as a whole rather than specifically the 2023 prequel game, which is largely a middle-of-the-road Telltale-style experience. That said, the latter is a respectable addition to the show (or books) that also serves as a serviceable introduction to this universe, requiring no prior knowledge to appreciate or consume. Now, as the title implies,
  <em>
   The Expanse: A Telltale Series
  </em>
  is primarily a graphic novel with light gameplay, player-driven choices, and episodic content. Compared to other Telltale outings, this effort is a touch more interactive, granting players some freedom to explore their immediate surroundings. While welcome, these changes are fairly minimal and do not result in a particularly different experience than
  <em>
   A Wolf Among Us
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  For people already familiar with
  <em>
   The Expanse
  </em>
  , this prequel follows Camina Drummer as she leads the Artemis crew on scavenger runs. The inciting incident involves them finding a valuable item, and the rest of the story focuses on that fallout. Drummer is, by far, the best part of the game, and her writing is consistent with the version that shows up in the Amazon Prime Video series. The Artemis' crew is a bit underwhelming as they are not given enough screen time to shine, and the campaign is a bit too short. Still, the game touches upon Drummer's relationship with her crewmates, along with the general politics that define this universe.

  OK, this recommendation comes with a big disclaimer that
  <em>
   Fatal Bullet
  </em>
  should only be considered if someone is a relatively big fan of the source material,
  <em>
   Sword Art Online
  </em>
  . There are plenty of games based on anime that can be enjoyed without familiarity with the series;
  <em>
   SAO
  </em>
  's adaptations are not usually among them since they expect players to have some connection to the characters already.

 <p>
  Still, if someone likes the franchise and wants an anime third-person shooter that also emphasizes team building, they are likely to have a good time with this 2018 release. Overall,
  <em>
   Fatal Bullet
  </em>
  is one of the better
  <em>
   SAO
  </em>
  games on the market, and its gameplay shares some similarities with
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  . For one, players put together a 4-member party when they go on quests, each one filling conventional RPG roles. The combat blends gunplay and skills, both of which are executed reasonably well. Finally, the game dedicates a lot of time to socializing with the secondary characters, encouraging players to build their relationships with them.

  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  is a very different beast than
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  , but the two games overlap in a few key areas. For one, they are both third-person shooters with campaigns that revolve around visiting different planets. As part of a 4-member squad, players will find themselves shooting down a plethora of enemies using an assortment of weapons, and co-op is a big part of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  's core appeal (unlike
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  ).

 <p>
  Narratively, the games share almost nothing in common, except for generally strong writing. While BioWare's franchise focuses on character development and telling an overarching plot with long-reaching consequences, Arrowhead's game is a hilarious satire drenched in propaganda. Even though it does not prioritize its storytelling,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has great world-building.

  Few situations exist that allow for
  <em>
   The Bureau: XCOM Declassified
  </em>
  to be promoted ahead of the franchise's mainline entries, but this is one of those rare scenarios. A spin-off to Firaxis' turn-based tactical series,
  <em>
   XCOM Declassified
  </em>
  is a fairly typical third-person shooter, albeit one with a cool setting and some tactical elements. Set during the 1960s, the story finds America under siege by aliens, which naturally forces the eponymous Bureau to step up to take care of business.

  <em>
   The Bureau: XCOM Declassified

  shares quite a few things in common with
  <em>
   Mass Effect

  , including squad-based combat that forces players to constantly command two partners during shootouts. While most of the campaign consists of linear levels, these sequences are spaced apart by interludes set within the Bureau's headquarters, which acts as a hub area. Here, players can mingle with other characters, and there are even dialogue trees.

  's launch was a bit of a disaster, hurting the game's reputation. CD Projekt Red's title had plenty of problems on the PS4 and Xbox One, but it fared better on PC or current-gen hardware. The game has also come far since its debut, and it is now far better. A first-person shooter set in the detailed Night City, a futuristic urban hub dominated by corporations and overrun with violence, this RPG has a lot of positives, despite its technical issues.

  <em>
   Lost Planet
  </em>
  got off to such a promising start, only to fizzle out in the span of one console generation. While
  <em>
   Lost Planet 2
  </em>
  is an enjoyable multiplayer-focused experience, anyone looking for a single-player package should check out the original game in the series. The third-person shooter takes place on a hostile, frozen planet overflowing with bug aliens that can reach sizes that allow them to tower over buildings.

  While not lacking a story,
  <em>
   Lost Planet
  </em>
  is first and foremost about its gameplay, which does set it apart from BioWare's trilogy. Thankfully, Capcom knows a thing or two about crafting addictive combat, and
  <em>
   Lost Planet
  </em>
  is far from an exception. The game contains a satisfying assortment of weapons and gadgets (along with a mech suit) that combine to create a varied and flexible battle system that offers a surprising amount of depth. The casual enemies are good fun, but
  <em>
   Lost Planet
  </em>
  comes alive during its boss battles.

  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  is a live-service game and a good mid-tier option. The third-person shooter launched in a somewhat rough state, but
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  ' gameplay was generally well-received, and it has only improved since the title's launch. The shooter allows players to create a custom character in one of four classes: Devastator, Pyromancer, Technomancer, and Trickster. Along with skills to unlock, each of these classes has three sub-classes, freeing players to explore a wide range of builds.

  It might be starting to show its age a little now, but
  <em>
   Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines
  </em>
  still has more than enough about it to keep players engaged and entertained. It's an exceedingly well-scripted game with an interesting cast who each have their own distinct personalities and motivations. Like the game's visuals, the combat leaves a little to be desired when compared to modern titles, but those who can look past these minor blemishes will find a lot to love here.

  When it comes to games with meaningful choices, few projects offer as many as this one. Most of these choices fall squarely into that morally gray wasteland that lies between good and evil and so, as a result, the game lacks a traditional morality system. That doesn't make decisions any less important though and there's nothing stopping players from making up their own minds about whether their choices are right or wrong.

  OK, this is a weird one.
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  has almost nothing in common with
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  ; in fact, their settings are polar opposites. While both titles are third-person shooters, their systems only share some basic elements. Rockstar's project is also a proper open-world, and it moves at a slower pace than any of the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  titles.

  Admittedly, the combat mechanics found in
  <em>
   Anachronox
  </em>
  are a lot closer to a JRPG than an action RPG like
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  , but the game still deserves a mention on account of its brilliant storytelling and fascinating characters. It's smart, it's funny, and – best of all – it's wonderfully unique. It's certainly not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but what it does, it tends to do exceedingly well.

  The game does have its shortcomings, however, particularly when it comes to locations and general exploration. Much of the story unfolds in dull and desolate environments which can at times distract from the amazing writing, although this is but a minor annoyance in the grand scheme of things. It's hard not to like what
  <em>
   Anachronox

  has to offer even despite its flaws and now-dated visuals.

  The game features a fully fleshed-out morality system based on the one used in
  <em>
   KOTOR
  </em>
  and dialogue choices that are tied to the character's moral alignment. It still looks okay, has a fantastic combat system, and features one of the best RPG storylines of its era. It perhaps falls a little short of those Mass Effect levels of excellence that the studio would later go on to achieve, but it isn't too far behind.

  Although BioWare did a fantastic job of making it feel as though every choice mattered throughout the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  trilogy, the team could learn a thing or two from the studio behind
  <em>
   Alpha Protocol
  </em>
  . Pretty much everything that the player does prompts some kind of reaction and although they might not all be life and death, they're noticeable enough to make players think twice about every choice that they make.

 <p>
  The game certainly had its fair share of flaws at the time of its release and time hasn't done it any favors in this respect. The graphics are still below par, many of the characters are still weak, and the overall story is nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, the nearly endless amount of minor choices that the player can make throughout the game quickly add up to make a major difference when it comes to both their sense of agency and their enjoyment. Those who like
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  should love what
  <em>
   Alpha Protocol
  </em>
  has to offer.

  Obsidian's 2019 sci-fi shooter is traditionally compared to
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  is also an easy recommendation for
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  fans. Smartly written and witty, this RPG grants players a fair few creation choices that influence the protagonist's personality and, consequently, how NPCs react to them. Combat-wise,
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  is a relatively by-the-numbers first-person shooter, albeit one that emphasizes teamwork through its companions.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Outer World

  's story is not quite as epic as

  , but it is nevertheless a fantastic first effort. In fact, the 2019 game is not all that dissimilar from 2007's
  <em>
   Mass Effect

  , and Obsidian has a rock-solid foundation to use for the sequel.

  's brilliance lies in its characters, world-building, relationships, and story; Conversely,

  is all about gameplay. PlatinumGames took a break from hack and slash to craft a frantically-paced third-person shooter that demands players are always moving. The sci-fi game has a much steeper difficulty curve than BioWare's franchise, and it is more than fantastic enough to justify the effort.

  While not scary,
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  touches upon a few horror concepts; in fact, Reapers are a pretty great example of Lovecraftian monsters. Still, the games themselves are action RPGs and rarely try to terrify players. If someone wants that, they will need to turn to EA's
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  . Visceral Games' trilogy introduced the world to Necromorphs, terrifying cosmic terrors that are like a mix of zombies and
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  's Xenomorphs. In terms of gameplay and tone,
  <em>
   Dead Space 2
  </em>
  and particularly
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  are closer to
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  since they lean into action territory, and they are both fun (especially the second one).

 <p>
  Conversely,
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  is unquestionably a survival horror experience. Set predominantly in an abandoned spaceship, the story follows Isaac Clarke, a guy forced into a life-and-death situation that goes well beyond his area of expertise. 2023's
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  remake retains the original's vicious combat and nightmare-inducing atmosphere, all the while tweaking a few things to provide a fresh experience to franchise veterans.

  Exploring Strongholds is one of the main ways to make progress in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Not only do they contain useful scrap, but they also hide crates that contain blueprint fragments, equipment, and gear mods. Overlook Town is one of the earliest Strongholds in the game, and it has some very useful loot for new players.

  Exploring Overlook Town may not be as complicated as other Strongholds like Holt Town in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , though some new players may be confused as to where all the important crates in this place are. Here's a quick guide showing exactly where you can find them.

  The mystical crate here is
  <strong>
   found inside the supermarket
  </strong>
  . It's right in the
  <strong>
   middle of the main floor
  </strong>
  , and it should be hard to miss. Get rid of the monsters inside, and open the crate to find some BP fragments for the Blast Suit armor. This set caters to melee playstyles, giving players extra melee damage, attack speed, and the ability to regenerate Stamina and gain bonus Movement Speed after killing enemies with a melee weapon.

  The weapon crate is found
  <strong>
   in the outdoor cinema theater
  </strong>
  , just past the stairs/seats. Approaching the crate will
  <strong>
   cause a giant Glutton to spawn
  </strong>
  . While it might look intimidating, it's actually very easy to beat.
  <strong>
   Aim for the glowing spots around its body, and it'll fall to its knees
  </strong>
  . Once it's down, aim for its flower head to deal massive damage. Don't bother hitting it anywhere else early on, as Gluttons take greatly reduced damage to the rest of its body as long as its glowing bits are still intact.

  <strong>
   The gear crate is hidden underground

      <title>How Enotria's Story and Setting Embody the History of the Italian Renaissance</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Ahead of its release, much of the discussion surrounding Jyamma Games'
  <strong>
   <em>
    Enotria: The Last Song
   </em>
  </strong>
  centered around the title's Mask system and hot-swappable builds; something relatively unheard of in the Soulslike genre. Beyond the new tweaks it brings to the established conventions of Soulslikes, though,
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  is noteworthy for being an uncharacteristically bright game in a traditionally grimdark genre, and its story and setting only further serve to drive this point home. Taking inspiration from both Italian folklore and Italian history, the plot and atmosphere of
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  do a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to bringing the Renaissance to life.

 <p>
  Often referred to as the connective bridge between the Dark Ages and the Industrial Revolution that kicked off the modern era of human history, the Renaissance is one of the most important political and cultural movements of the last millennium. The period itself is marked by an increased appreciation of the arts, the development of new technological advancements and artistic techniques, and the embracing of classical philosophy and culture that saw society stray further from the oppressive theocratic rule of the Dark Ages. In terms of both the vistas in which its story takes place and the general themes of said story,
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  embodies the ideas of the Renaissance in a way befitting its Italian heritage.

  Before players can dive into the Soulslike gameplay of
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  , they are treated to a brief history of its world via an opening cutscene. Similar to the introduction to the original
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , this vignette introduces both the world and the cast of villains that the player will be tracking down, which in
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's case is a group of humans who seek to overthrow the gods. Interestingly enough, the villains' inspiration comes from a love for the arts and a desire to produce a world of neverending beauty, which happens to perfectly align with the view of the arts and culture held by many real-world Italians during the Renaissance.

  One of the byproducts of the creation of music and other art forms in
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's fictional history was the creation and subsequent destruction of a group of benevolent gods, which is a not-so-subtle metaphor for the turn toward secular life experienced by Italians as a result of the Renaissance's many world-changing innovations. While
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  doesn't expand much on this general setup throughout the game's runtime, it's at least a nice tip of the hat to anyone with a love of history or Italian culture.

  If
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's plot referencing the Renaissance wasn't enough to establish its real-world connections, then it's the game's setting that finishes the job. As an uncharacteristically bright and beautiful game in a genre populated with dark and brooding fantasy,
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's environments stick out like a sore thumb in the best way. That these settings take obvious real-world inspiration from Italy's infamous Amalfi Coast only serves to further emphasize both the natural beauty of the Italian coastline and the breathtaking quality of
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's biomes.

 <p>
  But more than just pretty set dressing,
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  's homage to one of Italy's most renowned locations also serves to connect the game back to the Renaissance. While the Amalfi Coast is recognized today as one of the country's most desirable vacation spots, the area was actually host to some of the most important innovations in navigation and trade during the Renaissance, connecting Italy to the rest of the world. And with
  <em>
   Enotria
  </em>
  serving as most of the globe's introduction to Jyamma Games, the spirit and real-world history of the area live on in the studio's breakout title.

  The Club Member Reward evolution in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  grants your chosen player a total of +2 overall stats. It’s a diverse evolution that equally increases your player’s stats since it adds +4 Pace, +1 Shooting, +3 Passing, +3 Dribbling, +2 Defending, and +2 Physical. The evolution also adds two new Playstyles, which are Rapid and Incisive Pass. The Rapid Playstyle is great for any RB to have, while the Incisive Pass is always good for a midfielder. Finally, the Club Member Reward Evolution also grants your player the Falseback++ role, which helps bring variety when creating your Tactics in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  .

  There are three ways to use the Club Member Reward evolution to your advantage in FC 25. First, you can upgrade RB players to enhance their ability in that exact position. To take full advantage of this upgrade, you must find quick players with high dribbling stats, such as
  <strong>
   Kadıoğlu
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Diogo Dalot
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Balde
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Molina
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":318} -->
 <p>
  You can go full defensive and find players that can operate as Center Backs in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  . With this Evolution, you can build them to stay behind or take the Ball-Playing Defender role and play a major part in building up your offense. Players like
  <strong>
   Süle
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Gomez
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Danilo
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Nacho Fernández
  </strong>
  can greatly benefit from the Club Member Reward evolution in FC 25.

 <p>
  Finally, you can take advantage of the Falseback++ and choose RB players that can operate as CDMs when you have possession. Players like
  <strong>
   James
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Mace
  </strong>
  can do a great job adding more depth to the midfield and ensuring you outnumber your opponent in that area.

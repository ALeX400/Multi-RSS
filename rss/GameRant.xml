  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur’s Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  saw massive success upon its release for the game’s broad scope and world building, not just within the video game franchise, but by incorporating new elements from
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  . Though a new game seems unlikely, a hypothetical follow-up to
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  should do the same as its predecessor and dive deeper into the world of
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  .

  With a vast history lasting fifty years,
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  has expanded its canon universe and many lands. A key expansion to the lore of the hit roleplaying game introduces a boundless wheel-shaped multiverse that
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  should be unafraid to explore.

  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  ’ 5th edition refers to its multiverse as the planes of existence. Most stories and campaigns take place on the Material Plane, including
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  , though it is sometimes referred to as the Physical or Prime Material Plane. The Material Plane is the core of the planes of existence, with all other planes being defined by their relationship to the Material Plane.

  The Feywild and Shadowfell are two parallel dimensions to the Material Plane and are therefore often referred to as Mirror Planes. Since they exist on the same level as the Material Plane, their appearances are seemingly similar, though they present a more mystical or twisted version of the plane most heroes are familiar with.

 <p>
  Surrounding these three dimensions are the Ethereal and Astral Planes. These featureless realms are called Transitive Planes as they primarily act as liminal spaces during travel. For example, a player that casts etherealness or astral projection can enter these planes to explore these dimensions or travel beyond.

 <p>
  Enveloping these Transitive Planes are the Inner Planes, sometimes referred to as the four Elemental Planes, as each dimension is tied to either earth, wind, fire, or air. Even beyond these realities are the Outer Planes, which house deities. The Outer Planes are inherently abstract and time has no meaning across the dimensions. This is similar to the Astral Plane or Sea, which separates the Inner and Outer Planes and acts as a graveyard for gods. Additionally, the Outer Planes are divided into the Upper and Lower Planes based on alignment. Creatures with good natures reside in the Upper Planes, while creatures with more evil alignments reside in the Lower Planes.

 <p>
  Several of these dimensions have been explored or discussed over the course of
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  . Namely, Githyanki are warriors of the Astral Plane. As one of the main companions in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  , Lae'zel acted as a key tie to the dimension. The game’s plot also forces players to explore the Astral Plane several times in Act 2 and Act 3, with combat even breaking out in some instances. This sets a precedent for planar exploration in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  installments moving forward. Similarly to the Astral Plane, Shadowfell has a key plot connection to
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  . Players enter the dark region as they try to either kill or save the Nightsong.

 <p>
  Other planes included in the franchise are the Elemental Plane of Air (
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate II: Shadow of Amn
  </em>
  ) and the Nine Hells (both
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3),
  </em>
  with Avernus specifically having relevance in the franchise’s latest installment. The Elemental Plane of Air is manifested in Irenicus’ Dungeon in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 2
  </em>
  , meaning players don’t literally travel to the Elemental Planes in the game. However, the Hells hold a much more concrete relationship to the franchise in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  with players engaging in combat with Raphael in his House of Hope in Act 3. The House of Hope is located in Avernus, which is also Karlach’s home.

 <p>
  The easiest option for the next
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  venture would be to keep focusing on the Hells and aspects of the Prime Material Plane. Expanding the lore of the Hells would beef up Karlach, Wyll, and Mizora’s storylines and could feature references to the
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus
  </em>
  module. Including Shadowfell would obviously tie into Shadowheart’s storyline. Even the Feywild feels like an easy way out, as hags, like Auntie Ethel, are a dominant species there. Instead, the next
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  installment should focus on the mysterious Outer Planes.

  There are seventeen Outer Planes in
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  5th edition. Some of these realms, like the aforementioned Nine Hells, Limbo, Elysium, and Pandemonium, have fairly discernible methods of being included in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 4
  </em>
  . If this next installment really wants to stand out, it needs to dive deeper.

 <h3 id="mechanus">
  Mechanus
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus falls under a lawful neutral alignment. This is baked into the very fabric of the realm, as everything is equal in the realm, such as amounts of light and dark, heat and cold, etc. Mechanus’ environment also lives up to its name as the realm is made up of country-sized circular interlocking gears. Modrons, and Maruts are native to the mechanical realm.

 <p>
  These creatures could act as great enemies for combat.
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  set a precedent for mechanical creatures as combatants during Act 3 with the Steel Watch. While Modrons and Maruts obviously wouldn’t feature the same exact mechanics, a twist on the Steel Watch could call back to preexisting game play while still requiring some puzzle solving. Mechanus could also act as an excuse for the artificer class to be officially introduced into the franchise.

 <h3 id="carceri">
  Carceri
 </h3>
 <p>
  Carceri, also known as Tarterus, is another plane that could be explored. The plane resides between chaotic and neutral evil and is situated in between the Lower Planes of Hades and the Abyss. Because of its location, Carceri acts as a plane of contention between demons and devils.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  This makes Carceri the perfect alternative to returning to the Nine Hells. Like the Hells, Carceri is a multifaceted Plane, with six layers instead of the Hells’ nine regions. Game play would likely be kept to the first layer of Carceri, Othrys, as the layer is accessible via the Astral Plane. With
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  already establishing planar travel through the Astral Plane, including Othrys specifically feels realistic. The layer also has portals to the Abyss, Hades, and the Concordant Opposition, which opens doors to even more Outer Planes to explore.

 <p>
  Despite another
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate
  </em>
  installment seeming unlikely, the franchise has plenty of source material to explore if it ever returns. Until that fateful day, players should explore beyond the Material Plane as much as possible in

  <em>
   <strong>
    Brotato

  </em>
  is the type of game that relies on its simplicity to be as complex as it needs to be. It doesn't have a lot of different mechanics, but when combined in different ways, these limited mechanics end up making a surprisingly in-depth system that can be difficult to parse for beginners.

  One of the main sources of progression during runs is through leveling ups, which lets the player choose which stats to increase. One of the most underrated stats that often gets overlooked is the luck stat, mainly because players don't understand quite how it works.

  Luck is a very simple stat that has
  <strong>
   long-lasting impacts
  </strong>
  on the player's run. It is a supplementary stat that doesn't directly affect the gameplay of the player, but it is important nonetheless. According to the in game text:

   You have X% more chance of finding items or consumables when you kill enemies. Also increases the rarity of items in the shop and level upgrades.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    X% chance:
   </strong>
   Here, X is the amount of the player's luck stat, which starts at zero. The consumables and items in question drop from some enemies when the player kills them. To increase this stat, players need to find the nose upgrade when they level up.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Consumable Items:
   </strong>
   The consumables are used to rejuvenate the player and recover their health, while the items are added to the player's inventory at the end of the wave, though players have the right to choose whether they want to recycle them or keep them.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Shop Item Rarity:
   </strong>
   The shop has different items and weapons that the player can buy. In fact, there are two main ways that players can increase their damage: by getting higher rarity weapons, or by upgrading their existing weapons. The higher the chance of a high tier item appearing in the shop, the better the chances that you get the item or weapon you need to perfect your build.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Level Upgrades:
   </strong>
   Level upgrades show up at the end of each wave if the player gains enough experience during the wave to level up. These upgrades are of four rarities; common, rare, epic, and legendary. The higher the rarity of an upgrade, the more stat points that upgrade will provide the player.
  </li>
 </ul>

  The PlayStation 5 has slowly but steadily racked up a decent collection of games. The console's technical capabilities, amazing haptic feedback, and a much-needed SSD ensure that players can have the best time possible with the games of their choice.

 <p>
  This console is full to the brim with games that try to deliver a hybrid experience, encompassing both single-player and multiplayer elements. With Sony's clear strategy of developing live-service games, it's easy to see why they'd want the games on their console to feature elements that will keep fans coming back for longer after they're finished playing through the single-player content.

  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is one of the greatest open-world games ever made. FromSoftware's amazing level design translated naturally into an open world that's a joy to explore. Players will love exploring this massive world on Torrent and finding secrets that help them get stronger, or surprise them by showing just how out of their depth they are.

 <p>
  Players can veer off the beaten path to enjoy a bulk of side content that helps them get stronger, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. As one would expect from a FromSoftware game, players can also summon for help from other players or be invaded by PvP veterans who want to establish dominance.

  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  is one of the best fighting games available for the PS5. The battling mechanics are tight and satisfying, along with the addition of a story mode that adds to the series' lore and satisfies long-time
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  fans.

 <p>
  Players who are up-to-date with the series' narrative will have a great time playing through The Dark Awakens, while Unforgotten Echoes serves as another great side story for players to sink their teeth into. This, coupled with the amazing multiplayer gameplay that's as solid as ever, proves why
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  is held in such high regard.

  Fans were salivating at the prospect of checking out a remake of
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  , a game that was criminally underrated and was stuck on the PS3 for the longest time. In the remake, beautiful visuals and iconic combat gameplay make a return in the most definitive manner possible.

  Players will love checking out the many bosses and levels that comprise this iconic title. The remaster does a great job of integrating the multiplayer elements that have become iconic in the series. Helping other players or invading their world to take them on in combat is a blast every time, and ensures that players will never be bored with this engaging title.

  An immersive sim that messes around with a time-loop mechanic,
  <em>
   Deathloop

  is an amazing title that forces players to get better with each run before they can take out all eight Visionaries. Players must learn from each death, quelling their growing frustrations by seeking out different paths to tackle any given objective.

  serve a return to form with few, if any, controversies plaguing its launch.

  Fans were glad to see that Sony wasn't just pushing mature gaming experiences, and was instead catering to players of all ages. This could be seen in
  <em>
   Sackboy: A Big Adventure
  </em>
  , a fun platformer with charming visuals and imaginative level design.

  Playing this game solo is more than doable, but there's also co-op available for up to four players. This turns every level into a chaotic affair as four players try to complete the game's challenges without being left behind.

  <em>
   WWE 2K20
  </em>
  was a wake-up call for the developer, choosing to take a one-year hiatus before ensuring that their wrestling games reached the standards fans expected. The games were a joy to play through from
  <em>
   2K22
  </em>
  onwards.
  <em>
   2K24
  </em>
  continued this trend of integrating a wealth of meaningful single-player and multiplayer content.

  MyRise features two modes, with Unleashed being arguably better than Undisputed. However, both Story Modes are worth checking out. The addition of other single-player content, along with fun multiplayer opportunities, ensures that players will have a great time clocking in numerous hours in the latest 2K game without getting bored.

      <title>Final Fantasy 16 Sets a High Bar for its Successor to Clear Regarding One Feature</title>

  The legendary
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series has long wowed fans with its rich storytelling, memorable characters, and, of course, its epic summons. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 16
   </em>
  </strong>
  , however, Square Enix has taken summons to a new level by fusing them deeply with the human experience. The game connects its Eikons—its term for classic summons like Ifrit, Phoenix, and Bahamut—with human characters called Dominants, who have the power to embody these godlike creatures in both form and force. This arguably philosophical approach has led to some of the most intense battles and character-driven narratives the franchise has ever seen.

  By blending massive, explosive Eikon battles with personal struggles,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  makes its summons feel less like distant mythical beasts and more like reflections of its characters' inner worlds. As a result, the next
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  installment will face a significant challenge if it hopes to improve on this groundbreaking feature.

  One of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16’s
  </em>
  most impressive achievements is how it humanizes the Eikons by linking them to Dominants. Each Dominant’s connection to their Eikon provides insights into their personalities and struggles, often representing their innermost fears and desires. Clive, the protagonist, is especially notable as the Dominant of Ifrit. As Clive confronts his past, the destructive nature of Ifrit reflects his inner turmoil, turning battles into physical manifestations of his emotional journey.

 <p>
  The human-Eikon connection also allows players to experience the power of these summons in a more personal way. Instead of simply calling forth Ifrit in a flash of fire, players experience the raw strength and fury of Ifrit through Clive, blurring the line between human and summon. This transformation is particularly significant for Clive’s character arc, symbolizing his path toward self-acceptance and resilience. Each Eikon and Dominant pairing reveals something essential about the human condition, making Eikons more than just tools for battle—they become integral to the story’s exploration of power, sacrifice, and identity.

  standout elements is its dramatic Eikon battles, which feature eye-popping visuals and a range of gameplay styles that showcase each Eikon's unique powers. From action-packed, on-rails sequences to showdowns reminiscent of
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , these fights aren’t just gameplay highlights—they’re central to the story. The iconic battle between Bahamut and Ifrit is a perfect example, combining cinematic visuals with thrilling gameplay to deliver a climactic, emotionally charged experience. Each encounter is as much about the characters involved as it is about the spectacle of the fight itself.

 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16

  also expands the lore surrounding Eikons, grounding them in the world’s mythos and political landscape. This, in turn, deepened the Summons’ mythos within the overarching
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  franchise. Each kingdom’s Eikon is tied to a Mother Crystal, a magical source of power that sustains its people, leading to conflicts as nations compete for control. Dominants, individuals who can harness the power of an Eikon, are viewed with a mix of reverence, fear, and resentment, as their abilities make them both invaluable and dangerous. Hugo Kupka’s role as the Dominant of Titan exemplifies this; his Eikon’s overwhelming strength allows him to become a powerful economic advisor.

  For the next

  , it will need to take the Eikon system even further, possibly by exploring new ways for players to interact with these powerful beings. Instead of stopping at mere transformations, the series could explore a more dynamic relationship between characters and their summons, perhaps allowing players to shape how their Eikons evolve based on the decisions they make in the story.

  Some of the most important cards in a
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket

  deck are Supporter cards, which activate effects once per turn and can help the player by healing damage, drawing more cards, or swapping their Active Spot Pokemon with another.

 <p>
  However, with Gengar EX, the player can disable any Supporter cards that the opponent wants to use, which can be a great strategy for decks that rely heavily on them. Additionally, with three Psychic energy, Gengar deals 100 damage to the opponent, providing consistent damage output.

 <p>
  Energizing is still a challenging task for many
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  players. Therefore, having Exeggutor EX on the deck can be a quick path to more consistent attacks. This card is straightforward: its Tropical Swing attack deals 40 damage to the opponent’s Pokemon, and if the player flips heads, the damage increases to 80.

 <p>
  While relying on coin flips isn’t ideal, since this attack requires only one Grass energy, Exeggutor EX is a great choice, a high-HP Pokemon that can disrupt the opponent's setup significantly.

 <p>
  A Basic Pokemon with 130 HP is always a solid choice to start the game. In the case of Zapdos EX, it has a simple attack that deals 20 damage to the opponent. However, where Zapdos truly shines is with its second attack, Thundering Hurricane.

 <p>
  Flip 4 coins, and the attack deals 50 damage for each heads. This means Zapdos can deliver up to 200 damage, potentially knocking out any Pokemon in one hit. With 4 coin flips, the chance of Zapdos doing no damage at all is only 6.25%, making it a very consistent attacker.

 <p>
  Whether in Pokemon TCG or
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket

  , Charizard cards are always strong choices. In Pocket, Charizard EX boasts an impressive 180 HP, along with an attack that deals 200 damage.

 <p>
  As a Stage 2 Pokemon, it’s an excellent finisher capable of delivering a one-hit KO to any Pokemon the opponent has in play. Its drawback is having to discard 2 energy after using the attack, but this won’t be an issue if Crimson Storm is used to end the game.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  , many decks face the challenge of building up energy quickly, and Moltres EX stands out as a solution with its first attack, Inferno Dance. This move allows the player to flip three coins and, based on the number of heads, attach an equal amount of Fire energies to their Pokemon.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Moltres EX becomes a strategic choice for early gameplay, providing essential energy acceleration to support powerful Fire-type attackers like Charizard EX and Arcanine EX, which demand significant energy to unleash their strongest moves.

  Articuno EX, like other cards, stands out for being a high-HP Pokemon, known as a big Basic. With its Blizzard attack, it can deal 80 damage to the opponent’s Active Pokemon and an additional 10 damage to each of their Benched Pokemon.

 <p>
  While those Extra 10 damage points may seem minor, they can often be the difference between winning the match or leaving the opponent with just 10 HP remaining, which may allow for a swift knockout in the nEXt turn. Articuno EX EXemplifies how strategic damage distribution can be crucial in competitive play.

 <p>
  Venusaur EX holds a reputation as a classic tank in the
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  game. While its attack power isn’t particularly high, it makes up for this with a built-in self-healing ability. Each time Venusaur EX uses its Giant Bloom attack, it deals 100 damage while simultaneously healing 30 damage from itself.

 <p>
  This healing effect makes Venusaur EX incredibly resilient, forcing opponents to work hard to knock it out. Its durability pairs well with support cards like Lilligant, which can accelerate energy for benched Pokemon.

 <p>
  Mewtwo EX is one of the most powerful and sought-after cards in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  . Its Psydrive attack deals 150 damage to the opponent, though it requires discarding two of its energy.

 <p>
  While this attack is slightly less powerful than Crimson Storm, Mewtwo is a Stage 1 Pokemon, making it quicker to play. Additionally, it can be paired with Gardevoir, which accelerates energy attachment to Psychic Pokemon, allowing Mewtwo to attack every turn.

  Sometimes, straightforward strategies shine brightest, and Starmie EX is a perfect Example. While it may appear less powerful than other Pokemon EX, its Hydro Splash attack delivers 90 damage with just two Water energies, making Starmie EX one of the game’s most reliable attackers.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":958} -->

 <p>
  Its simplicity allows it to consistently deal high damage without the drawbacks of energy discard or complex evolutions. With just two hits, Starmie EX can knock out almost any opposing Pokemon EX, proving that, in many cases, a dependable attack is all that’s needed to turn the tide of battle.

  This means Pikachu will almost always deal 90 damage with only two Electric energies. As a Basic Pokemon, this provides a significant advantage to the player using it, making it the best EX currently available in

      <title>Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail October Revenue Revealed</title>

  An interesting chart has revealed how well
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  performed in revenue during October. It's safe to say that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  have become HoYoverse's most popular titles, accumulating tens of millions in revenue each month.

  Both titles operate on a gacha-based system, meaning most of their sales come from limited-time in-game banners, which typically run for around three weeks. The most popular banner for both games is the Limited Character Banner, usually featuring two five-star and three four-star units per cycle.

  A Reddit user named numberlockbs has shared a chart revealing October revenue numbers for various mobile games, including HoYoverse's popular titles
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . The data, apparently taken from a credible business website called Sensor Tower, shows
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ’s October revenue at around $27 million, similar to its September revenue. In comparison,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's revenue dropped from $36 million in September to $24 million in October.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  maintaining high sales is not surprising, given that October featured three different banner cycles with popular characters.

  In October,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  introduced two new five-star characters, Kinich and Xilonen. Kinich is widely considered one of the most fun characters to join the roster in a long time due to his unique ability to use a grappling hook in the overworld. Meanwhile, Xilonen has greatly enhanced the viability of Geo users. She can adapt to almost any team composition, providing substantial buffs while also reducing enemies' resistance. A lot of fans agree that Xilonen is an improved version of Kaedehara Kazuha, a character who was widely considered the best neutral support in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  .

  t’s November revenue could rise even further, as HoYoverse is likely to introduce a new five-star Anemo DPS named Chasca. Previous leaks suggested that Chasca might become one of the best DPS characters in the game. While HoYoverse has yet to confirm her banner placement officially, Chasca is expected to arrive in the first part of
  <em>

  </em>
  's update 5.2.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  had a similar banner schedule in October, its 20% revenue drop might be attributed to September’s release of one of the most highly anticipated characters, Feixiao.
  <em>
   Honkai
  </em>
  ’s October banners featured the debut of two new five-star units, Lingsha and Rappa, along with re-run characters like Topaz and Imbibitor Lunae. The November schedule for
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  will include a re-run double banner featuring Aventurine and Acheron.

  One recurring archetype in the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  games should be up for a significant change of pace once
  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  comes out. The
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  games have a habit of upping the ante and being as over-the-top as possible, which is reflected in its gameplay. Naturally, the character classes available to the player should follow suit. At the same time, there is one that may need to be addressed ahead of
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  , lest it end up underperforming compared to the others. At the very least, there is one area that cannot be overlooked when it comes to its design.

 <p>
  There are typically four Vault Hunters in every
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game with the exception of
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Pre-Sequel
  </em>
  , which each had 6 due to DLC. The Vault Hunters are individual characters who all belong to a specific class, which determines their unique ability and the perks they can receive upon leveling up. While each game has had new Vault Hunter classes making an appearance, there is one that has appeared in every main numbered title: the Siren. At this point, it would be a surprise if the Siren of them missed out on
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  , but another character class also has a near-perfect attendance rate.

 <h3 id="borderlands-39-first-two-soldiers-had-extremely-similar-action-skills">
  Borderlands' First Two Soldiers Had Extremely Similar Action Skills
 </h3>
 <p>
  Early in the series, the main issue with the Soldier class in
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  was its unique ability. Roland and Axton, the Soldier and Commando of the first two games, essentially had the same ability in the form of a gun turret. This trend would be broken with
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  's Gunner, Moze, the latest Soldier character. Moze has the Iron Bear, a powerful mech suit that can fight on its own or be directly piloted by Moze. In practice, it's closer to Gaige's Deathtrap from
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  than the turrets used by the Soldiers. The Iron Bear was definitely a big step up as a skill.

 <h3 id="the-soldier-39-s-gun-turret-ability-was-one-of-borderlands-39-most-underwhelming">
  The Soldier's Gun Turret Ability Was One of Borderlands' Most Underwhelming
 </h3>
 <p>
  Axton and Roland's Action Skills held them back compared to
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  ' other Vault Hunters. While their turrets aren't exact clones, they are still extremely similar. Their similar classes and Action Skills robbed Roland and Axton of their uniqueness compared to the rest of the cast. In addition, most Action Skills in
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  are cool and flashy, so a pair of gun turrets can feel rather unimpressive, even when upgraded. Soldiers and Soldier-type classes are capable of much more than reusing the same basic ability type. In
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  , a Soldier character would need something new and innovative to keep up with the pack.

  Borderlands 4's Soldier Will Need Something Distinctive and Exciting
 </h3>
 <p>
  There is a plethora of potential powers for
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  's Soldier to possess. For an upgrade in
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  , they could perhaps have the ability to call in an airstrike or hidden artillery. Another option would be for them to have a signature weapon that they can only use for short bursts at a time, similar to Krieg's Buzz Axe Rampage or Salvador's Gunzerking. An ability that's both useful and distinctive is one of the biggest things that
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  's Soldier or its equivalent needs. After Moze's Iron Bear raised the bar, there's no going back to something like the old gun turrets.

  's Vault Hunters will have a lot to live up to, particularly any recurring archetypes. While the SIrens have had different powers every game, the first two Soldiers effectively recycled the same ability. Whatever Vault Hunter fills that archetype this time needs to take more from Moze than Roland or Axton in that regard. An excellent Action Skill can ensure that
  <em>

  </em>
  's Soldier-like Vaunt Hunter becomes a solid pick.

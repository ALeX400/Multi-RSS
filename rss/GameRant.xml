    Pokemon Red Rescue Team

  begins with a personality test that determines what Pokemon you will be. There are a total of fifty questions that will be picked to be asked, and your personality is determined by the results of that test.

  If you don't like the results and wish to play as a different Pokemon, you can close out of the game and take the test again, as many times as needed to get the Pokemon you like. After getting your Pokemon, you'll have a choice of some of the remaining options to be your partner; here are the best options you can choose.

  The decision you make for your Pokemon and your partner is final. While you can later recruit other Pokemon to join your rescue team, you and your partner will be front and center for every mission you go on until you beat the game. In total, there are 16 potential Pokemon for you to get, some from the first few generations start trios, and your partner will be chosen from a list of options from some of the remaining Pokemon, though you
  <strong>
   won't be able to choose a Pokemon of the same type as your own

        Most bosses in the game are part flying type including the final boss

       , making Pikachu's Electric moves very useful against all the hardest fights in the game. Early on he also learns Quick Attack, which can attack around corners and from behind you when in a hallway. Pikachu is by far the best starter and should be in every party for an easier playthrough.

       Overall Charmander does
       <strong>
        high damage with his fire attacks
       </strong>
       , especially against one of the more difficult bosses that is weak to fire found halfway through the game. Charmander also learns Smokescreen, which is great against bosses to protect your party while focusing on dealing damage.

       Much like Charmander, fire-type Pokemon are good options in this game. Cyndaquil's moveset is only slightly different than Charmander's, with a lot of the same early-game options. Towards the middle of the game,
       <strong>
        Cyndaquil will learn better fire moves earlier

       Squirtle comes with consistently better water attacks throughout the game, along with Bite to add some move variety on top of some basic normal attacks. Squirtle also learns
       <strong>
        Protect and overall has a good defensive stat
       </strong>
       , making it a great option for those worried about surviving in a dungeon.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Fire Emblem
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a widely popular series, with many becoming aware of it around the release of
  <em>
   Awakening
  </em>
  . This sudden increase in profile might leave some puzzled about the series' origins; namely, its first hero, Marth.

 <p>
  With the series' rise in popularity, Marth and his name are more known. They are often referenced in newer entries, and continually appear in
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros
  </em>
  . However, some may not know about the character and how he ties into the greater series. Here's a look at him and his various relatives.

  Marth was the king, and previously the prince, of Altea. He is an indirect descendant of Anri, the kingdom's founder. During the War of Shadows, the nearby country Gra betrays Altea and sides with the Kingdoms of Grust and Dohlr. Marth's parents are killed, and his sister is taken hostage. He is exiled into the Island Kingdom of Talys, until it is attacked by bandits. From here, he builds up his forces to take on the Earth Dragon, Medeus.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the resulting peace didn't last. Hardin, the ruler of the Holy Kingdom of Archenea and a former ally, declares Marth a traitor after being manipulated by Gharnef, the evil sorcerer. Gharnef's machinations result in the War of Heroes, where a resurrected Medeus is once again the final enemy. After the war, Marth is declared king of the continent of Archenea.

 <p>
  Throughout his adventures, Marth's characterization is a man who wishes to save as many people as possible. He is the first lord and wielder of the Falchion, a sword often used for slaying main antagonists in
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  games. He is persuasive and diplomatic, and finds many allies. He believes in punishing evil, but also in redemption.

  While her brother was exiled, Elice chose to stay with the people of Altea, and became a hostage to Gharnef. Marth later frees her. However, during the War of Heroes, she volunteers as a hostage to save her sister-in-law, Caeda. She is later one of four royal women brainwashed to be sacrificed to Medeus. She is freed again, this time by Merric, an Altean noble with feelings for her. It is later established that started a magic academy in Marth's palace and wed, possibly to Merric.

 <p>
  Elice is a healer. She wields a legendary weapon, the Aum Staff, which can resurrect a fallen ally from the grave. She is self-sacrificing, voluntarily becoming a hostage to save a loved one. This comes from a sense of pragmatism mixed with care. She believes Marth must survive to save the continent, and will sacrifice herself if she feels it furthers that goal.

  Caeda was the princess of Talys, the island nation where Marth lived in exile. She enlisted Marth to help defeat pirates plaguing the Kingdom, and remained by his side throughout the war. After its conclusion, she and Marth become engaged. On the planned day of their wedding, Marth is ordered to quell a rebellion, which turns out to be a distraction to occupy his kingdom. Caeda escapes with help from Elice, and aids her fiancé in battle. She and Marth finally marry when the War of Heroes ends.

  Caeda is a Pegasus Knight. She uses her power towards noble ends, notably saving a gladiator, Ogma, after he was beaten for helping another gladiator escape. She is an adept fighter, and her skill at diplomacy arguably overshadows Marth's, as she can frequently convert foes to their cause. She is also characterized by her affection for Marth, joining his army for the sake of staying by his side.

  As time passed, the alignment of power shifted and the names of territories changed. The Haildom of Ylisse was founded by a descendant of Marth, who slayed the Fell Dragon, Grima. However, his own descendants were less revered. One unnamed descendant's dedication to the war against Plegia gave him a negative reputation due to the resulting death and poverty. He was succeeded by his daughter Emmeryn, who was received much more warmly.

  After her presumed death, her younger brother, Chrom, became the Exalt in her place. He also led the Haildom's militia, the Shepherds. His travels led to him clashing with rulers of neighboring nations, eventually facing off against the Grimleal and their "god," Grima. With the help of his allies, Chrom defeated Grima and became a respected ruler.

  Like Marth, Chrom is a Lord, capable of wielding the Falchion. He tries to keep a serious but frank demeanor, treating his allies as equals. However, he reacts awkwardly in casual situations. Unlike Marth, Chrom does not have a fixed partner, and can wed one of six women according to the player's choices. He is the father of Lucina, and often has another child alongside her.

  Lissa is a Cleric, and much more jovial than most of her known relatives. While she lacks a sense of duty to her title, she shares a willingness to help anyone. She enjoys playing pranks on her brother, but still cares for him. She is willing to befriend anyone in the army, and can romance most of her male comrades. Each of these potential romances leads to the birth of her son, Owain.

  , she is captured by the Mad King, Gangrel, who attempts to use her as a hostage. This is an obvious effort to defeat the Sheperds by goading them into an unwinnable war. Knowing this, Emmeryn attempts to kill herself by falling from a cliff.

  Her presumed death makes Emmeryn a martyr, causing mass desertion in the Plegian army and leading to Gangrel's defeat. Emmeryn is recovered, on the run from the Grimleal, who are sacrificing young women to Grima. The former Exalt joins Chrom's unit, despite some brain damage from the fall. She has difficulty speaking and has lost most of her memories. After the war, she settles in Ferox, where she lives a life unburdened by her prior obligations.

 <p>
  Emmeryn is a sage, and is reminiscent of Marth's elder sister, Elice. However, her self-sacrifice is rooted in different qualities. Pacifism is one of her most steadfast beliefs, proving powerful enough for rivaling nations to revere her as a martyr. Even Gangrel, who also survived his "death," has a moment in a DLC map where he can apologize to her. While her memories fade, her warmth remains.

  Chrom's daughter is the first of the children born in
  <em>
   Awakening
  </em>
  , conceived shortly after the Ylisse-Plegia war. She was close with her father before he was killed by a former ally. This event became the harbinger for a greater destruction of her world by Grima, which led to Lucina traveling to the past to prevent this scenario. She enlists the fellow children of the Shepherds to aid her.

 <p>
  Donning a mask, Lucina travels back in time and calls herself "Marth," and introduces the idea of challenging fate to her father. She makes an effort to prevent events from coinciding with her future. After helping Chrom face Grima, she either leaves for parts unknown, marries her husband of choice, or some combination of the two.

 <p>
  Lucina wields a version of the Falchion from her own timeline, the Parallel Falchion. She is reverent towards Marth, as well as her parents. This can be awkward for Chrom, who respects her yet has no direct frame of reference for his awe-inspiring manner in her timeline. Like Chrom, Lucina is a capable leader and fighter.

  Owain is one of Lucina's allies from the future as well as her cousin, son of Chrom's sister Lissa. He is first encountered at the Sage's Halmet, warding off bandits. He wields a forged sword called "Missiletainn," a reference to Mystletainn in
  <em>
   Genealogy of the Holy War
  </em>
  . After the war, he goes on a journey to "stay his sword hand."

  Owain resurfaces in
  <em>
   Fates
  </em>
  alongside two of his companions from
  <em>
   Awakening
  </em>
  , with each taking a different name. His alias is "Odin" and he serves as a retainer to the Nohrian Prince, Leo. He also changes classes from Myrmidon to Dark Mage. Due to the branching paths of
  <em>
   Fates
  </em>
  , Odin's fate depends in part on the actions of the player.

 <p>
  Like his mother, Owain does not conform to the idealized manner of how royals should behave. He expresses reverence through his theatrics and is proud to be a descendant of the Hero-King. He is the first of Marth's descendants confirmed to use dark magic, the first to serve as a retainer, and the first who can consciously serve as an enemy to the player. (Elice can also be an enemy unit, but against her consent). His ending often involves him either departing (presumably to Ylisse) after the war, or writing records about himself.

  Ophelia is Owain/Odin's daughter, making her Lissa's granddaughter, and by extension, a distant descendant of Marth. Like the other army brats in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fates
   </em>
  </strong>
  , her early years are spent in the Deeprealms. These realms are meant to keep the children safe from war, due to consensus that the castle used by the army is unsafe. Time moves differently in these realms, causing children to rapidly age into young adults. Once they are reclaimed by the army, the children can join.

 <p>
  Ophelia, once she is a young woman, escapes her deeprealm to visit a town known for its rare tomes. However, the town is flooded by bandits. Ophelia attempts to find a tome she read about in her father's notebook, but learns it is just an idea book for weapon names. Odin gives Ophelia a tome of her own and encourages her to name it. She instinctively calls it "Missiletain." After the war, scholars claimed that she both researched and named spells and hexes for the remainder of her life.

  Ophelia is, like her father, a dark mage. Like much of her branch of the family, her mannerisms are not as reminiscent of her distant Altean ancestors. She does possess the brand, a genetic feature which Odin clarifies confirms her relation to the Ylissean royals.

  For every seasoned
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  player, succeeding on a Deity difficulty run is the summit. The AI opponents get massive boosts to improve their play, they are far more aggressive, and they are more than willing to wipe the player out in a matter of moments.

 <p>
  Grinding Deity can work, but a smart player will strategize before the very first turn. With a couple of sound strategies, experience, and a willingness to break out of old habits, anyone can beat
  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  Deity difficulty.

  The first city is crucial. This city will be the foundation for everything to come, so figuring out the best city start position is a major factor. RNG is inevitably a factor, but there are a few key indicators to look out for when choosing the location the first city.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1004} -->

 <p>
  First, it is worth moving the Settler to a river or a hill if it's convenient. A hill will provide defensive and production benefits, while a river enables key buildings later on. Generally, unless going for a wonder-focused run, try to move away from desert, tundra, and mountains for the time being. Sometimes, it's worth not settling a city on the first turn if it means getting a better location on the second turn.

  Once the first city is settled, venture out into the world as fast as possible as there's a lot to get done in
  <em>

  Next, build a couple of Warriors or Slingers. Deity barbarians and AI are very aggressive. If there's no competent defense, the run will be over in record time. Once the bare minimum is out to defend the city, get a Settler out fast to stoke the fire of the civilization's engine and settle another city before anyone else can.

  Although it might be boring, getting a Monument built in the first city as quickly as possible is really important. Cultural policies that come from generating culture can bring big playstyle benefits that can be combined with the starting location or leader's abilities.

 <p>
  After the Monument, it's time to supplement any weaknesses. No city is perfect - maybe production is low, so get a Builder out to improve some hills, or maybe the city isn't growing at a strong rate, so get a Granary built. Supplement the key weakness so it won't drag the civilization down later.

  There's no room for timidity in Deity. Like it or not, the AI will come after the player at some point. While some leaders are tailor-made for a Domination Victory, some aren't, so every advantage is crucial. So, when it comes to the second city, players need to be bold and strike an aggressive claim that takes valuable resources away from enemies and boosts the economy.

  It won't be long until the AI attacks the player, so a strong defense is key. Where possible, keep building up a primary army to guard against the AI with experience from rooting out nearby Barbarian Outposts and avoid the oft-times debilitating warmonger penalties that can be devastating in the early game.

 <p>
  In the best-case scenario, a defensive army will make the AI reconsider attacking the player. However, if not, a strong defensive army should be able to hold off the initial assault, permitting either a counterattack if siege weapons are built, or a peace treaty that has damaged the aggressor far more than the defender.

 <p>
  Though the AI is the player's greatest enemy, they can also be a great help. While a diplomacy victory is a distinct possibility in the long term, consider joining the wars of AI against each other if it means knocking another player out, or looting key resources for the player's own civilization.

 <p>
  It's better to gang up on the AI enemies than be ganged up on by them. Diplomacy on Deity mode is all about countermanding AI aggression against the player's civilization and redirecting that towards the enemies. Allies can turn to enemies quickly, but as long as the AI and player are on the same side of the war, they're not threats to each other.

  <em>
   Civilization 6
  </em>
  is a broadly well-balanced game with each leader's unique buildings, units, and traits catering to a particular kind of gameplay. Winning on Deity is all about understanding the unique mechanics of a leader and exploiting them as much as possible.

 <p>
  For example, if playing as Frederick Barbarossa of Germany, take advantage of the Holy Roman Emperor ability and use the massive combat buff against City-States to conquer them early in the game before others can start taking advantage of them. Every leader has a unique bonus that gives them an edge, and uing it is absolutely crucial.

 <p>
  As the game enters the middle and late stages, kingdoms stagnate if their economies aren't strong. Whenever not at war, building a strong economy is key, no matter how good the player's chosen leader is. It's well worth investing in buildings that boost Gold or Food generation because they can have major impacts later down the line.

 <p>
  Gold, Food, Production, and Science are all key to fielding a strong army in the mid and late game. Sometimes the answer to building a better army isn't building more units, but building a boost in a city that can get to the next tech upgrade, or economically sustain the army already fielded. Max out Industrial Zones, Campuses, and Commercial Hubs as best as possible.

  There are no friends in Deity mode. Every turn where the player isn't attacking is a turn where the player may be attacked. If the AI ever displays weakness, strike, especially if a powerful Hero has appeared.

 <p>
  The AI is no joke on Deity difficulty - with massive bonuses throughout their empires, weaknesses are rare. The key to winning is choosing the right moment to strike when the player's strong and the AI's weak. If the gamble pays off, the player will have a horde of new cities and resources, which can snowball into a dominant advantage throughout the rest of the game, ensuring the path to victory.

 <p>
  Crew members are necessary for completing as many missions as possible in a day to maximize your Reputation rewards in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Steamworld Heist 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Each crew member also has their own strengths and weaknesses, while all being very customizable, but will also cost Gallons to recruit.

  Recruiting as many crew members as possible will not only increase the amount of rewards you get from Reputation but can also give you more specialized options when tackling a difficult mission or boss fight. At the start of the game, you'll only have enough space for four crew members; here's how to increase your crew capacity.

   Crew Capacity is increased by getting the Bunk Beds Sub Upgrade

  These sub upgrades will require Fragments to unlock but are some of the most important upgrades you can get and should be done so right away. After increasing your crew capacity,
  <strong>
   look out for new crew members who have also become available from the same story progression milestone

  While some crew members are better than others, it is still important to recruit every crew member in the game to maximize your Reputation. Each crew member can only complete one mission in a day, and earned Reputation doesn't carry over to another day. With more crew members, you'll be able to
  <strong>
   complete multiple missions in a single day to maximize your Reputation
  </strong>
  and earn some of the later rewards in the options.

 <p>
  Missions can be repeated as many times as you'd like to farm Reputation even though the rewards are limited. This method will also help level up your crew in various jobs to let them use Cogs to pick out the best skills to equip and make them as strong as they can get.

      <title>Pokemon: 7 Hardest Mythical Pokemon To Catch In The Franchise</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/pokemon-hardest-mythical-catch-franchise/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  These days, it's relatively easy to catch Mythical Pokemon in the series of games, whether you're playing a mainline
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  game on the Nintendo Switch or wandering around with
  <em>
   Pokemon Go
  </em>
  . Before Generation 6, however, Mythical Pokemon were often not widely released outside of specific, limited event distributions, including some location-specific events, meaning they were often nigh impossible to get your hands on unless you were lucky (or knew how to hack the Pokemon into your game).
 </p>

 <p>
  Thankfully, Mythical Pokemon aren't quite as limited to attain nowadays thanks to online global distributions and the appearances of more Mythical Pokemon in newer, more accessible games, though that doesn't mean some of them are any easier to catch! This article will be covering the most difficult Mythical Pokemon to catch within the games, from early generation OGs to some newer Switch appearances.

  Celebi is a Mythical Pokemon that only really became easily accessible in the last few years, being incredibly difficult to get your hands on before that — even in its original Generation 2 titles — unless players had access to rare time and location-limited events, a Virtual Console release of
  <em>
   Pokemon Crystal
  </em>
  , or the very specific Japanese
  <em>
   Pokemon Colosseum
  </em>
  Bonus Disc and the associated Japanese console necessary to play it. Thanks to
  <em>
   Pokemon Go
  </em>
  — the usual success story for the boost in accessibility for Mythicals in recent years — Celebi is now fairly easy to get your hands on in
  <em>
   Pokemon Go
  </em>
  ... though this doesn't necessarily mean Celebi is still a walk in the park to get in full Pokemon games on console.

  While Celebi first became common within online distributions back in 2016 for
  <em>
   X and Y
  </em>
  , even these distributions weren't fully global events, and Celebi was only available to those in Europe and America. Even when it comes to online distributions now, the last time Celebi was obtainable in an event was in a 2022 event for
  <em>
   Sword and Shield
  </em>
  . That means Celebi is unobtainable in the last two main-series games,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  . Alongside this, the only way Celebi can be transferred into certain main-series console games through
  <em>
   Pokemon Home
  </em>
  from
  <em>
   Go
  </em>
  is if players somehow already have a Celebi in those games, defeating the point of transferring Celebi in the first place. All in all, Celebi is one difficult Pokemon to get your hands on, even today.

  Jirachi is yet another Pokemon that, until very recently, was a nightmare to get your hands on. Despite being a Generation 3 Pokemon, Jirachi was initially only available in
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire
  </em>
  to players who either had a US-exclusive
  <em>
   Pokemon Colosseum
  </em>
  Bonus Disc or to players with a Europe-exclusive copy of
  <em>
   Pokemon Channel
  </em>
  , a niche GameCube game that had players watch short videos. Both of these methods required players to both own and fully beat an entirely separate game. Beyond this, Jirachi was also occasionally available through limited events, some easily accessible and others very rare, though Jirachi had no distribution events whatsoever between 2018 and 2022.

  Unfortunately, even today, Jirachi still requires players to have purchased another game to be able to get their hands on it — at least in
  <em>
   Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl
  </em>
  . Players can only get Jirachi in a special
  <em>
   Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl
  </em>
  event if they have save data on their system from
  <em>
   Sword and Shield
  </em>
  . At the very least, this time, you don't need to have completed the entire game first.

  <em>

  </em>
  's Manaphy was an incredibly tedious Pokemon to obtain back when it originally came out if you weren't fortunate enough to be able to access its rare location-based events in Japan, America, or South Korea. To get their hands on a Manaphy, players would also have to own a copy of any of the
  <em>
   Pokemon Ranger
  </em>
  games and fully complete whichever game they have to get their hands on a Manaphy egg, which could then be transferred to
  <em>
   Diamond
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Pearl
  </em>
  . This still works now, except only the first
  <em>
   Ranger
  </em>
  game still allows transferring between games, and players are limited to one single Manaphy per copy of
  <em>
   Ranger —
  </em>
  even if they reset their
  <em>
   Ranger
  </em>
  game after transferring their first Manaphy.

 <p>
  In later games, Manaphy was somewhat easier to obtain through online events starting from
  <em>
   Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire
  </em>
  , though these events were still very limited. It wasn't until
  <em>
   Pokemon: Legend Arceus
  </em>
  ' release that Manaphy finally became easily obtainable in a main-series game;
  <em>
   Legends Arceus
  </em>
  features Manaphy (and its evolution, Phione, which can only be accessed in earlier games through breeding your
  <em>
   Ranger
  </em>
  -transferred Manaphy) in a certain quest that allows you to battle and capture several of these elusive Pokemon in one go.

  Mew didn't really become accessible until recently, but its availability is still surprisingly dependent on having played through certain side games. This included a strange WiiWare game called 'My Pokemon Ranch,' intended as a companion game for owners of
  <em>
   Pokemon Diamond, Pearl
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Platinum
  </em>
  . Even back in the 90s, it was especially shockingly hard to get — in fact, its first distribution event was limited to a tiny number of Japanese players through a distribution method that was then considered very experimental. Mew's scarcity was part of the reason why so many rumors appeared about how to get it.

  Getting your hands on Mew became a little easier with the introduction of Hoenn thanks to the Faraway Island event, though this remained an exclusive event in Japan and Taiwan. However, in 2007, Mew did get global distributions in select locations for short periods of time. Availability became a lot better in the 2010s thanks to games like
  <em>
   Pokemon Go
  </em>
  and the rise in online distributions in the main series of games. Nowadays, Mew can be caught in
  <em>
   Pokemon Brilliant Diamond
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Shining Pearl
  </em>
  if the player has save data from
  <em>
   Pokemon Let's Go: Eevee
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Pikachu
  </em>
  .

  Magearna is a slightly niche and somewhat forgettable Pokemon for most players, being a Mythical that first appeared in
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun and Moon
  </em>
  's Alola region. As a Mythical, it had the typical special release associated with most Mythicals, as it could only be accessed through a region-specific QR code that players would have to scan with their 3DS camera. Thankfully, these codes are still available to find and still work despite the 3DS' Wi-Fi functions being shut down. This is the only time Magearna has ever been distributed, still making it a fairly rare Pokemon to have in your Dex.

 <p>
  However, for hardcore Pokedex completionists, Magearna is something like the final boss of Pokemon catching. Magearna has a special 'Original Color' form that can only be received once every single Pokemon up to Eternatus is registered on
  <em>
   Pokemon Home
  </em>
  . Its special form only changes in color, with its coloration changing to resemble that of a Pokeball. Filling the Dex up to Eternatus is a difficult enough task as it is, as players will need to have access to event-exclusive Mythical Pokemon from years prior. That being said, this task used to be even harder — originally, players needed to have an entire living Dex saved in
  <em>
   Pokemon Home
  </em>
  before Original Color Magearna was unlocked!

  Darkrai was initially distributed through
  <em>
   Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum
  </em>
  . In
  <em>
   Platinum
  </em>
  , players could catch it by visiting Newmoon Island through a special Wi-Fi event item called the Member Card. Strangely, though Darkrai and its event were coded into
  <em>
   Diamond and Pearl
  </em>
  , the Member Card was never officially distributed outside of
  <em>
   Platinum
  </em>
  , leaving the event inaccessible in those games without cheats. Instead,
  <em>
   Diamond and Pearl
  </em>
  players could only get Darkrai through a movie-related, in-person distribution event.

 <p>
  Beyond the Gen 4 games, Darkrai could only be obtained if players could go to in-person events or receive physical distribution codes. It wasn't until
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  that Darkrai made an appearance in a main series game without being attached to a distribution event of some sort, meaning Darkrai was all but impossible to catch for over a decade. However, as with many other Mythicals covered here, this special appearance is once again only possible if players have save game data for
  <em>
   Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl
  </em>
  .

  Alongside all of this, Darkrai has one of the lowest catch rates of any Pokemon seen in the games, having only a 1.6% base rate chance of being caught.

 <p>
  Kalos' three Mythical Pokémon are some of the rarest Mythical Pokemon available to the series, even in today's era of readily-available Mythical and Legendary distributions. All three of them were originally only distributed through regional, limited events, and despite the emergence of online distribution events making once-rare Pokemon much easier to get your hands on, the only one of these three to have a relatively recent event is Volcanion, which was distributed in
  <em>
   Sword and Shield
  </em>
  back in 2022. Hoopa did have some special distribution events in
  <em>
   Sun and Moon
  </em>
  in particular, but Diancie has not had a single distribution event for nearly a decade, since Generation 7's
  <em>
   Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire
  </em>
  . This also means that Diancie is now impossible to trade out of
  <em>
   X and Y
  </em>
  due to
  <em>
   Pokemon Bank
  </em>
  closing down alongside the 3DS's Wi-Fi capabilities.

 <p>
  However, all three of these Pokemon are available in
  <em>
   Pokemon Go
  </em>
  , meaning that they can be traded from
  <em>
   Go
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Home
  </em>
  , and then into a mainline game. Of course, catching these Pokemon in the main series games is much different to catching them in
  <em>
   Go
  </em>
  . With the much anticipated release of
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  hopefully coming soon, maybe these three will soon make a reappearance for the first time in a very long time. We can only hope!

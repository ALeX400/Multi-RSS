  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
   </em>
  </strong>
  is, according to most fans of both the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  cinematic and video game universe, one of the best titles the franchise has ever released. While its graphics are clearly outdated, the game mechanics can be a bit clunky, and every enemy makes the same sound when dying, this title is still a masterpiece in every sense of the word.

  After escaping Taris, players will head to Dantooine to meet with the Jedi Council in the Academy there. After completing their trials, they will be asked which type of Jedi they want to be. Those who prefer lightsaber combat above all else will choose Jedi Guardian, a class that pairs very well with a few elements in the game. Here are the
  <strong>
   best feats for Jedi Guardians in

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Dueling
  </strong>
  feat is one of the most important that Jedi Guardians can unlock, as it not only provides a formidable Attack and Defense bonus from the base version, but when upgraded to the Master alternative, it's absolutely overpowered.

 <p>
  Since Jedi Guardians are constantly in close combat, it's important that they have the right Defense bonus and that they can deal as much damage as possible to dispose of their enemies quickly. The Dueling feat, along with a good lightsaber crystal, can be the difference between succeeding or having to restart from the last autosave.

  not only introduced new planets like Manaan to players, but also various Feats that they can combine with the different Jedi classes available. The
  <strong>
   Toughness
  </strong>
  Feat, for example, is ideal for Jedi Guardians as it not only allows them to take less damage, but also gain more Vitality every time they level up.

  Throughout the various main and side quests that players can encounter in the story of
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  , they will be constantly challenged by formidable enemies that will not go down without a fight. A great way to create an overpowered build and make quick work of such enemies is to focus on two-weapon fighting to maximize players’ damage output through Force powers like Burst of Speed (or better yet, Master Speed).

 <p>
  Two-weapon fighting has a default penalty that players can reduce by leveling up the
  <strong>
   Two-weapon Fighting
  </strong>
  Feat, which comes in handy, especially for Jedi Guardians.

  While the
  <strong>
   Weapon Focus
  </strong>
  Feat does not grant players as many bonuses as other Feats on this list, it's still great to pair with Jedi Guardians, as it grants a + 1 Attack bonus. That might not seem like much, but when combined with other Feats that already boost the efficiency and damage of players’ attacks, it becomes a great advantage to have.

 <p>
  Jedi Guardians should focus on unlocking the lightsaber Weapon Focus specifically, as it can be the difference between slaying the forces of evil or succumbing to the raw power of a Dark Jedi’s lightsaber strikes.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Force Jump
  </strong>
  power has been a big part of both the cinematic and gaming universe of
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  . Not only does it allow Jedi to reach extreme heights, but also cut major distances and get to their objectives a lot quicker.

 <p>
  For some reason, this isn't an actual Force Power in
  <em>
   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  , but rather a Feat. By unlocking it, players can jump towards their enemies, even if they’re several feet away, which is ideal for the lightsaber combat-focused individuals that are Jedi Guardians.

  Throughout the story, players will not always be facing Dark Jedi with lightsabers, but also powerful foes with blasters that can deal a lot of damage. By unlocking the
  <strong>
   Jedi Defense
  </strong>
  Feat, players will be able to deflect a considerable number of blaster bolts, reducing the damage they take.

 <p>
  This is extremely important and useful for Jedi Guardians who don't have enough Force Powers to heal themselves and don't want to rely on Medpacs and other healing supplies. The base version of this Feat does not grant any bonuses, but if players spend enough points on it, they’ll be reaping the rewards of their efforts soon enough.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Power Attack
  </strong>
  Feat is one of the most useful and deadly in any Jedi Guardian's repertoire. While it has an important Attack penalty, it also offers a massive Damage bonus, which ranges from +5 to +10 depending on the version players have already unlocked.

 <p>
  With the base and Improved version, players will hardly see any differences in terms of visual aspects. However, once they unlock the Master alternative, they will notice that their weapon becomes engulfed in this strange yellow energy field that looks amazing and hits like a truck.

  When combined with the Master Speed Force Power, Battle Meditation, and the highest version of the Two-Weapon Fighting Feat,
  <strong>
   Flurry

  is absolutely deadly and can deal with most enemies in a single attack. This Feat grants players an extra attack per round, regardless of the version they have unlocked.

  However, it should be noted that there are Attack and Defense penalties involved that players will have to take into account. At the beginning of the game, players will be able to use the base version of Flurry through Bastila.

  Bethesda is a titan of the gaming industry, creating some of the most iconic games in recent memory. Bethesda's in-house franchises, such as
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  , are household names, and they’ve published dozens of other titles.

 <p>
  One of the most prominent features of Bethesda’s games, both developed and published, are the bosses. The dragons of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , Icon Of Sin from
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  , or the Deathclaws of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  are all iconic in their respective franchises, becoming indispensable to their games. Endlessly replayable, infinitely explorable, and full of monsters and villains for players to defeat, here are some of the most boss-filled games Bethesda currently offers.

 <p>
  Only three bosses appear throughout the game: The Cyberdemon, Hell Guards, and The Spider Mastermind. They’re memorable, but there aren’t many of them. However, each fight can be brutally difficult, especially in the game’s higher difficulties, and appear meaning despite their low numbers, each boss is ingrained into the mind of anyone who has played
  <em>
   Doom (2016).

  bosses incorporate unique boss arenas and mechanical variety.

  keeps the series’ tradition of dungeon crawling, offering dungeons for players to explore, but stray too deep, with too little experience, and they may find themselves at the mercy of an overleveled, deadly boss.

  The first of Bethesda’s entries into the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise,
  <em>
   Fallout 3's
  </em>
  boss fights are rare compared to later entries. Calling many of the game’s tougher enemies "bosses" wouldn't be accurate. A majority are
  <em>
   Fallout 3's
  </em>
  regular enemies players will encounter later on or named NPCs that offer no real challenge.

 <p>
  But there are still dozens of bosses throughout the game: Super Mutant Behemoths, the Ant Queen, a simulated Chinese general. In
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  the player can discover bosses in a variety of ways, through world exploration, various side quests, and, of course, the main story.

  expansions, which feature some of the hardest fights in the franchise. However, the extensive options for extremely powerful builds and devastating weapon choices available make coming back to these bosses later on an extremely satisfying experience.

  keeps true to the series, featuring a bevy of dungeons and, of course, bosses. Unfortunately, we never get to fight Mehrunes Dagon, the game’s central antagonist, ourselves. That epic scale of a boss fight was still a few years away for Bethesda.

  Fortunately,
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  is full of entertaining, thematic, boss battles. Jyggalag and Umaril cap off some of the games most memorable questlines with epic boss fights. There's even a nod to the first
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  game that culminates in the 'Gray Prince' boss fight. Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Oblivion's
  </em>
  map offers over a hundred dungeons for players to fight their way through, dueling everything from feral vampires in their tombs, to goblin shamans in caves.

  With improved stats, randomized rewards, and regenerating health, a legendary enemy can turn what would normally be a standard encounter into a struggle for survival. These enemies are completely random, appearing among virtually any band of raiders or ghoul horde, and rewarding players with unique weapons.
  <em>
   Fallout 4’s
  </em>
  story and quest bosses feature bands of minions, massive health pools, or extremely high damage that can easily overwhelm even the most prepared player on higher difficulties.

  The director of
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  has given an update about the rumored Sony acquisition of FromSoftware’s parent company Kadokawa. Known for creating and popularizing the Soulslike genre of games, FromSoftware is responsible for developing
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>

  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , and the hugely popular open-world title
  <em>

 <p>
  At this year’s Game Awards, FromSoftware revealed it has been working on a new standalone title set in the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  universe. Set to release in 2025,
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  is a three-player co-op game that places players at the mercy of tough bosses. While development is continuing, the game’s director has spoken about the potential Sony buyout of FromSoftware’s parent company.

  The game director of

  , Junya Ishizaki, recently spoke to IGN about the details of the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  spin-off along with a potential Sony buyout of FromSoftware. When asked if a deal was likely to go ahead Ishizaki said, “To be perfectly honest, we just don't know right now at the moment where the discussion currently is at. If it's taking place, we're not privy to it.” Ishizaki’s answer indicates that any talks to acquire FromSoftware are being handled directly through the parent company Kadokawa.

  While the news may not come as a surprise to fans, rumblings of Sony’s eagerness to acquire FromSoftware’s parent company Kadokawa refuse to go away. Since the PlayStation owners acquired Bungie in 2022, the company executives have been keen to add to their portfolio to compete with Microsoft’s ever-growing Xbox Game Studios. FromSoftware has long been touted as a suitable studio to be snapped up by PlayStation, with Sony already owning a 14% share in the developers.

  The acquisition of From Software isn’t the only thing that could be beneficial for Sony. The Japanese company has been busy building its portfolio in the anime space, which includes the streaming service Crunchyroll. A potential Sony buyout of Kadokawa could be huge news for anime fans, as franchises like
  <em>
   Sword Art Online
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mushoku Tensei
  </em>
  could fall under the Sony umbrella.

 <p>
  It might be some time before the outcome of Sony’s acquisition of FromSoftware is known, but for now, fans have a lot to look forward to. Bandai Namco has confirmed that
  <em>
   Elden Ring Nightreign
  </em>
  will have a network test ahead of its launch. Registration to participate in the test will open on January 10, 2025, and it will give players their first taste of the three-player co-op game.

  The search for the perfect planet in
  <em>
   <strong>
    No Man's Sky
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an endless one thanks to its universe containing more than 18 quintillion worlds, but one player has found the perfect home for themselves after many hours roaming the galaxy. Many base building enthusiasts tend to seek out lush planets in
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  that are similar enough to the real world, but those who still haven't found their ideal home world may just be in luck, as this fan of the game has even shared the coordinates to this planet so that others can follow in their footsteps.

 <p>
  From scorching hot planets to freezing cold ones and no shortage of worlds that are far weirder than new players might imagine, there's a wide selection of different environments to discover in
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  's vast universe. Most veteran players will likely have found their preferred world and set up a permanent base of operations for their playthrough already, but with so many new players picking up the game thanks to
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  's consistent free updates, there's sure to be many newbies who aren't sure where to start in choosing a home planet among infinite possibilities.

  No Man's Sky Fans Can See This Planet For Themselves

 <p>
  Such players might want to look to this particular world as an example - a beautiful temperate-type planet in
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  that was recently discovered by the player JeanLucPicardNMS. This planet type tends to feature comfortable temperatures, plenty of foliage, and typically calm weather, generally making it the easiest type of planet to survive on. Fans will still need to keep an eye out for boiling rainstorms every so often, though, which do deplete hazard protection, but usually don't last long enough to pose too much danger. Players finding themselves captivated by this particular world may want to visit and even build a base there themselves, which they can do by inputting the glyphs found under the original post into any portal found in the game's universe.

 <p>
  This will first require
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  players to have unlocked the requisite portal glyphs, though, which can take a good bit of gameplay to discover. Players looking to set up shop on the planet should be aware that the world's name has already been decided by the one who discovered it, and cannot be changed. Visitors should also take care to build bases somewhere remote on the planet, as building next to another stranger's base is typically frowned upon within the
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  community.

  There's certainly a lot to consider when choosing a planet to call home, with environmental factors that can pose a challenge to survival often needing to be balanced against the availability and types of resources that can be found on any given planet. Ultimately, though, the definition of a "perfect" planet is up to the player, and finding it is part of the joy of exploring
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  's massive universe.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Funko Fusion
   </em>
  </strong>
  already features plenty of legendary heroes as playable characters, and now KFC’s iconic founder/mascot Colonel Sanders is joining its ranks. Announced back in 2022 and set for release on September 13,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  is an action-adventure crossover based on the popular Funko POP figures and contains characters from a variety of Universal-owned properties. Some of these properties include
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Invincible
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
  </em>
  , all of which have been featured in video games before.

 <p>
  Additionally, some of
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  ’s playable characters hail from video game franchises like
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy’s
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Team Fortress 2
  </em>
  , though the latter has drawn controversy from
  <em>
   TF2
  </em>
  fans who would rather Valve focus on updating the main game instead of licensing its characters to other titles. On a much lighter note, the beloved Mega Man will lend his Mega Buster to the battle against
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  ’s villain Eddy, having been confirmed as a playable character in August.

  He will be joined by an unlikely ally when
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  launches later this week, as developer 10:10 Games recently announced that KFC’s Colonel Sanders will be playable. The iconic fast-food mascot will be available in his traditional white suit, and KFC Rewards members in the US can redeem their reward points to unlock alternate costumes like Mecha Colonel Sanders (for 250 points) or Chef Colonel Sanders (for free) from the KFC and Funko websites. A
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  gameplay trailer of the Colonel in action was also released, showing him firing fried chicken at enemies from a makeshift bucket cannon.

  At first glance, KFC might not be a company players associate with gaming aside from a tasty snack between sessions, but the fast-food chain has had promotions with titles like
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  over the past few years. This isn’t getting into KFC’s own unusual gaming endeavors, such as a mock "KFC Console" (complete with chicken warmer) and a Colonel Sanders-themed dating sim that even featured Lady Dimitrescu from
  <em>
   Resident Evil Village
  </em>
  in a bizarre crossover promotion.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has had a solid first year since it was launched in June 2023. The fourth mainline game in the long-running Blizzard franchise may have had its various bumps along the way, but
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has proven to be a fun experience for many. The game has received its fair share of updates, but one of the biggest changes yet is just around the corner.

 <p>
  The game's long-awaited first DLC,
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  , promises a harrowing expansion. From the impending arrival of Mephisto to the never-before-seen class known as the Spiritborn,
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  could signal a new era in the game's life. As the DLC's launch date draws closer, there are many players wondering just how much the expansion will improve the game. It won't be clear until players get hands-on experience, but
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  needs to try to improve one of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's weakest points: multiplayer.

  Diablo 4 Fails to Incentivize a Social Experience
 </h3>
 <p>
  Despite the high points of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , the game's multiplayer is a massive blemish on the game. When comparing solo players against co-op players, the difference is staggering. It was recently revealed that a whopping 85% of
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's players prefer solo to multiplayer. Since
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is designed with in-game events and allows for co-op, it is clear that Blizzard wanted the game to be an online experience for players, but there still isn't much of an incentive to do so.

 <p>
  Not only is there no real incentive, but finding a party in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  can be a huge hassle.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has crossplay, which is great as it broadens the number of players one can team up with. However, it also seems as though the crossplay co-op wasn't as fleshed out as it should have been. If someone is playing on PC and trying to interact with a party of console players who don't use headphones, it completely destroys the joy of socializing with other players. This issue occurs in many crossplay titles, but it feels far more prevalent in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  . At that point, one might as well be playing with an NPC. It is expected that
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  will bring improvements to the game, and strengthening co-op needs to be at the top of the list.

  A Major Quality of Life Upgrade Could Be the Key to Diablo 4's Multiplayer

 <p>
  An all-new story and unique class are exciting enough, but the upcoming Party Finder is one of the most promising updates on the horizon.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has several points of frustration, and the hassle of finding a party to play with is definitely a struggle for those who prefer co-op. Just as the name suggests, the Party Finder feature will hopefully be the change that makes
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  a good experience for both solo and multiplayer lovers.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":920} -->

 <p>
  The Party Finder allows a satisfying amount of customization, too. Instead of pairing people with just any open party, players can get pretty specific with their preferences.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  still needs various quality-of-life features, and Party Finder is a promising step forward.

 <p>
  Although the Party Finder launches alongside
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  , it will be available to all players, so purchasing the expansion isn't necessary. As
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how Party Finder impacts the game's co-op.
  <em>
   Vessel of Hatred
  </em>
  could breathe new life into the game, and a resurgence in multiplayer love would be great to see.

  having been released in 2001, Konami has dubbed the feature the "90s filter," likely as a callback to the aesthetic that the series popularized with the first game in 1999.

 <p>
  Fans have been watching the development of
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  closely, as the game is one of the most highly-anticipated horror remakes since the immensely successful
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  While there has been some skepticism surrounding Bloober Team's track record, early previews have impressed the community, and many have expressed excitement about Konami seemingly getting in touch with the series' roots once again.

 <p>
  One way the company seems to be appealing to fans' nostalgia is with the "90s filter." The official
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  Twitter account revealed the feature to fans with a short video showing protagonist James Sunderland walking through the streets with the filter active. As he explores Silent Hill, fans can get a look at the filter in action, as it changes the color palette in the game to a greyish-brown hue, closely matching the look of the original
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  for the PS1.

 <p>
  Bloober Team has made a lot of promises to fans of the iconic horror series, as many worried that
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  would miss out on much of what made the original game so beloved. Not only will the upcoming title still have multiple endings, but the original
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  composer Akira Yamaoka is also remaking many fan-favorite tracks from the original game.

 <p>
  Horror remakes have been huge over the past few years, as the recent
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  reboot boasted impressive sales numbers and fans have continued clamoring for more information about the next
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  remake. Bloober's track record with
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  is mixed at best, with many of its previous games having lackluster critical receptions, but previews of the new game seem incredibly optimistic.

  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  is not the only franchise Konami is bringing back into the limelight in the near future, as it is also gearing up for the launch of the highly-anticipated
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.
  </em>
  In fact, much like
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  's new retro filter,
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Delta

  will also feature "legacy" options to match the original PS2 game, showing Konami's commitment to embracing the nostalgia fans have for these titles.

   Golden Loong Staff
  </span>
  is a Mythical weapon that can be crafted after beating Cyan Loong in the New West. This weapon has a decent 108 Attack, but it does not affect the Critical Hit Chance. However, the staff does have a special ability that gives it the edge over the Stormflash Loong staff in some situations.

 <p>
  The Golden Loong Staff enhances the damage dealt by Pillar Stance moves. Additionally, players are able to summon a Loong to deal Thunder damage to enemies. To use this ability, players must be in Pillar Stance, and they have to use a Heavy Attack that costs 3 or 4 Focus Points. This weapon is great for the first run in New Game+, but its power will no longer be sufficient in New Game+2.

   Stormflash Loong Staff
  </span>
  has the highest base Attack out of any weapon in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , making it extremely appealing. It also increases the Critical Hit Chance by 9%, which is a solid additional bonus.

 <p>
  However, the Stormflash Loong Staff's unique ability is extremely annoying. Players are required to be in Shocked State to be able to deal Thunder damage to enemies. This prerequisite is a dealbreaker, as the adversaries become a lot more challenging in New Game+. Players can still try this weapon if they want, but it is not suitable for tough fights.

  Upon successfully hitting an enemy with a Charged Heavy Attack, the Adept Spine-Shooting Fuban Staff will shoot spines to attack anyone in the vicinity. Additionally, it recovers Health based on the number of Focus Points consumed during the attack. This weapon's unique ability makes it a perfect fit for players using the Centipede Armor set.

   Tri-Point Double-Edged Spear
  </span>
  is a powerful weapon that players can only obtain after beating Erlang Shen, the secret boss of Mount Mei. He is a very powerful foe, so players have to be extra careful while fighting him.

 <p>
  The Tri-Point Double-Edged Spear is best for players who use Thrust Stance while fighting. Not only does it increase the attack of Thurst attacks, but it also releases multiple swords to attack the enemy (only while using forceful Thrusts). It is easy to master the Tri-Point Double-Edged Spear, and it has good stats, making it a solid choice for New Game+.

   Jingubang Staff
  </span>
  can be found in chapter six of Black Myth: Wukong. This particular weapon belonged to Sun Wukong, so it is bound to be powerful. Players will need to gather all four pieces of Sun Wukong's armor to get the Jinguband Staff. If they try to enter the cave without the full set, the Destined One won't pick up the weapon.

 <p>
  The Jingubang Staff is meant to be used with the Monkey King armor, as it requires five pieces to reach its full potential. The armor set has four pieces, and Jingubang acts as the fifth. The weapon by itself is not had, as it prevents the fourth Focus Point from depleting over time. However, players should equip it with the Monkey King's armor set to maximize its efficiency.

  The Dark Iron Staff has an Attack of 110, which does not seem too impressive, but its unique ability is what makes it special. The weapon's attack increases based on the Destined One's Defense. If players equip the Bull King's Armor Set, the Defense stat will be significantly boosted. When players use the Bull King's Armor set in conjunction with the Dark Iron Staff, the Attack will be off the charts. The only downside of this build is the inability to use Perfect Dodges.

      <title>Why Civilization 7 Could Be the Most Approachable Entry for New Players Yet</title>

  For fans of the iconic Firaxis franchise, the August 2024 gameplay reveal trailer for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Civilization 7
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  marked the end of a nearly decade-long wait to see the series’ latest sequel in action. While the gameplay on display largely looked to follow the familiar formula that long ago established the strategy series as a juggernaut of the genre, one new
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  feature could help it appeal to a wider audience than ever. By breaking up gameplay into distinct ages with an opportunity to course-correct at the end of each one, the game’s innovative Age Transition mechanic may make
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  the series’ most approachable entry yet.

  The introduction of
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  ’s Age Transition mechanic represents a major shake-up to the pace of play for the series. Whereas players of previous
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  games could easily find themselves trapped in a no-win situation thanks to decisions made hours earlier, this new feature should make it easier to bounce back from a strategic miscalculation. Offering the ability for players to not only reappraise their approach at the end of each era but also to see how their decisions so far have affected the world around them, Age Transitions look ready to break down one of the series’ biggest barriers to entry.

 <p>
  The strategic depth of the
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  series has been praised by players and critics for decades, but it has also served as a double-edged sword. While the ability to micromanage nearly every aspect of a civilization's growth has made the franchise a favorite of strategy fans and history buffs alike, this same complexity presents a significant barrier to entry for potential new players. The knowledge that one wrong decision during a match’s opening hours could leave them languishing in the game’s latter half likely served to keep many players from giving the
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  series a shot.

 <p>
  Now, with the introduction of Age Transitions,
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  has the chance to change that. Rather than leaving them unable to escape the consequences of their potentially poor choices,
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  ’s three ages — Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern — will present players with an opportunity to rethink their strategy as each one draws to a close. As a result, even major missteps won’t necessarily prevent players from being able to achieve victory, making
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  the series’ most accessible entry to date.

  Ages May Make Civilization 7 More Accessible Than Ever
 </h3>
 <p>
  As they near the end of each of
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  ’s three ages, players will encounter a Crisis that serves to shake up their civilization, with their response to these crises determining what form their society will take on the other side of the Age Transition. The most intriguing element of this feature is that, following each Age Transition, players can take control of a new civilization that has been shaped by their choices thus far. This means that making a poor choice early on won’t result in an unwinnable endgame scenario, just a different set of starting circumstances for the next civilization.

 <p>
  For players new to the franchise, the introduction of ages with
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  has the potential to be a literal game-changer. Freed from the pressure of trying to conduct a perfect playthrough, where one wrong decision could come back to haunt them hours later, players will now be able to experiment with different strategies throughout the course of a single
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  match. This should make matches much more forgiving, allowing players to course-correct as necessary with the dawn of each new age.

 <p>
  Thanks to the addition of Age Transitions to the gameplay loop for
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  , Firaxis is eliminating the pressure to play perfectly and putting the focus back on fun. And by offering the same strategic depth the franchise has become known for while still allowing enough flexibility to bounce back from blunders,
  <em>
   Civilization 7
  </em>
  looks poised to be the series’ most accessible entry ever.

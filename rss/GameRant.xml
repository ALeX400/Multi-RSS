 <p>
  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  games are full to the brim with epic storylines and high stakes as a group of heroes stake everything on the line to save the world from immense evil. There are many ways how this is achieved, with some games involving the heroes making a valiant sacrifice to ensure that a villain doesn't see their plans to fruition. This can make for an emotional moment as players see their favorite characters lose their lives or something just as important.

  It takes a ton of effort for these characters to make such valiant sacrifices, and fans will find these games to be all the more memorable for the altruistic nature of their protagonists. The scale of these sacrifices can vary quite a bit, but each and every character willing to give up everything to save the world deserves to be hailed as heroes.

 <p>
  The camaraderie shared between the main cast of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15
  </em>
  is incredibly endearing and does a great job of selling the bond shared between the friends. Noctis may seem a bit too edgy for his own good, but it's clear as day that the weight of the responsibility on his shoulders is weighing down on him. Thankfully, this support system ensures that he never feels alone, alleviating his burdens somewhat. However, after Noctis gestates the Crystal and learns how to banish Ardyn's influence, he realizes that he must say farewell to his buddies once and for all.

 <p>
  It's a heartbreaking moment as Noctis bids a tearful farewell to the group, reminiscing on the good times they spent together before engaging in a battle with Ardyn for the ages. After sacrificing himself to end Ardyn's true form once and for all, Noctis passes away, making a massive sacrifice to save the world before passing away. The dark presence threatening to engulf the world is over, with the prince leaving behind three loyal friends who will carry forward his legacy.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 5
  </em>
  is a pretty goofy game that leans heavily on its comedic chops. The title prioritizes gameplay over story which works for it, allowing players to switch jobs as they ascend to become the Warriors of Light and save the world from Exdeath. However, after traveling to a new world where it's revealed that Galuf had already served as a legendary warrior who saved this world once before, the villain manages to trap the main party and corners Krile, Galuf's grandson.

 <p>
  Seeing her on the brink of death forces Galuf into action, who unshackles his bonds and thwarts Exdeath's nefarious attempts, but this comes at a serious cost. He takes a ton of punishment and dies not long after, passing on his legacy to Krile in a surprisingly emotional moment that establishes Galuf as one of the most heroic party members of all time.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  is a narrative-driven game with a ton of characters that enter and exit the party as the story progresses. It takes a while before the final five members of the party cement their position, and players will love controlling other well-defined party members that embody classic
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  jobs with unique personalities of their own. However, the manner in which some of these characters exit the party is quite harrowing, and this is especially true in the case of Palom and Porom.

 <p>
  The magical twins may be young, but their prowess makes it clear that these characters are gifted magicians who can achieve great things once they hone their talents. So, it's heartbreaking to see these kids show a level of emotional maturity that is unheard of at their age, petrifying themselves to stop a trap from crushing the entire party. While the sequel to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  shows them alive and well, that takes nothing away from a sacrifice that is hard to digest.

  takes place in a world steeped in tragedy, with the Bearers of the world being cursed with the power of magic that slowly petrifies them as they use this power. In a bid to remove this conflict from the world, Clive leads a resistance that aims to improve the well-being of these people and figure out a way to undo the Bearer's Curse. After facing off against Ultima, he learns that this malevolent being is the reason why magic plagues the world of Valisthea.

 <p>
  After defeating Ultima and absorbing his power, Clive's body is unable to handle the might of this foreign magical presence, but he manages to use this power and destroy the nexus that serves as the source of magic in the world. His body starts petrifying, but players are left in the dark as to whether he survived or the Bearer's Curse petrified him for good. Regardless, there's no denying that Clive made the ultimate sacrifice and would've died with a smile on his face if it meant that the world would be freed from the curse of magic once and for all.

  Despite seeming like a mercenary who only looks out for himself, there's more to Shadow than what meets the eye. It's clear that there's a huge chip on his shoulder that haunts him all the time, and his backstory can be witnessed in a series of random flashbacks that may trigger if players rest with him in an inn. He's far from a hero, but he has no problems sacrificing himself for the greater good. This can be seen in the Floating Continent, where Shadow tries to stop Kefka on his own and implores the party to escape.

 <p>
  This is the first moment in the game where Shadow can potentially sacrifice himself if players don't wait for him. He may come back, but it was clear that he didn't intend to survive while trying to save the world. Thankfully, players who refuse to leave the Floating Continent before he comes back can recruit him in the World of Ruin. This time, they have no say in preventing his demise at the end of the game, with Shadow accepting his past and promising to meet his friend in the afterlife as he is finally able to move on.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
   </strong>
  </em>
  announced two Halloween-themed events for trainers to participate in. A Five-Star Tera Raid against Gengar and a Mass Outbreak of Ghost Pokemon such as Gastly and Misdreavus will go live in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  during the last days of October.

 <p>
  Known as the Shadow Pokemon, Gengar first appeared in
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  as the final evolution of Gastly and Haunter. As a Ghost and Poison dual-type creature, Gengar also received a Mega Evolution form in
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  and a Gigantamax form in
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword and Shield
  </em>
  . Though other Ghost-type Pokemon have been introduced in later generations, Gengar's popularity remains strong with Pokemon trainers. As a result, Razer introduced a Gengar-themed version of its popular Kraken V3 X headset. However, the Razer Gengar headset is exclusive to China at the time of writing.

 <p>
  Following two mid-October events in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , the land of Paldea will see an abundance of Ghost Pokemon during the month's final days. According to Serebii.net,
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  will have a Five-Star Tera raid event against Gengar, who will have the Ghost-type as its Tera type. In addition, a Ghost Pokemon Mass Outbreak featuring Gastly, Misdreavus, Shuppet, and Bramblin will include a boosted chance of encountering those four Pokemon throughout Paldea. The Ghost Pokemon Halloween event will start on Sunday, October 27 at 8:00 PM Eastern, and conclude on Thursday, October 31, at 7:59 PM Eastern. The 5-Star Tera raid battle will pit
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  players against a level 75 Gengar with the ability Cursed Body, which can randomly disable a move used against it for a few turns. Gengar can also use moves such as Shadow Ball, Dark Pulse, and Nasty Plot throughout the fight. However, a level 100 Dark-type Pokemon such as Incineroar should make quick work of it.

  As for the Mass Outbreak, it is unclear if a boosted chance of encountering Shiny Ghost Pokemon will be included. However,

  players can improve their odds by making Shiny Sandwiches that grant Sparkling Power: Ghost and Encounter Power: Ghost at the same time. One such sandwich can be made by using a Red Onion, a Salty Herba Mystica, and either a Spicy or Sour Herba Mystica.

  Treyarch has confirmed the exact release times for the Main Quests in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  Zombies maps.
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is bringing back the fan favorite co-op game mode and taking it back to its round-based roots. When
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  launches on October 25, fans will have two different Zombies maps to check out.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies maps available at launch are Terminus and Liberty Falls. Terminus is set on a prison island, while Liberty Falls is set in a small town in West Virginia. In true Zombies fashion, both maps will have Easter Eggs for fans to complete that will consist of multiple steps and culminate in some kind of story revelation. In order to give everyone a fair shot at being the first to complete the new Zombies Easter Eggs, Treyarch is waiting on having the quests go live.

  Besides confirming the release time for the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies Main Quests, Treyarch also revealed an interesting detail about Der Wunderfizz. Der Wunderfizz is a special Perk-A-Cola machine that gives players access to all Zombies perks at once.
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Zombies fans should note that Der Wunderfizz will only appear on the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies maps after round 25. Until then, they will have to utilize the specific Perk-A-Cola machines.

 <p>
  While there has been some controversy over the Liberty Falls map, overall, fans seem to be excited about
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies. The return to round-based Zombies has proven to be a hugely popular decision, and hardcore fans are interested in seeing where the Zombies storyline goes from here. Fan feedback has already been used to address complaints about Liberty Falls, and it's likely that further fan feedback could potentially lead to even more improvements post-launch.

 <p>
  Treyarch is expected to support
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  for at least a year with regular updates and new content, as is the norm for
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  . It's highly likely that new Zombies maps will be a part of that equation, so fans of the mode need to keep an eye out for
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's seasonal content drops.

  Spider-Woman can do it all! She's a hero, a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent, and a Private Investigator. Now? She's the queen of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  with a plethora of Victory Royales waiting with her name on them. Spider-Woman joins the ever-expansive roster of Marvel characters introduced to
  <em>

  </em>
  , and is welcomed with open arms into the Spider-Verse family for players to enjoy in their lockers.

  Jessica Drew has always been an icon in the pages of Marvel Comics, so to see Spider-Woman swing into the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  metaverse is a joy for many. Players can assemble their V-Bucks and Avengers to gather up what they need to grab Spider-Woman, available from October 20 in the Item Shop.

  Heading to the Item Shop in Fortnite or remotely through the web, players will be able to grab Spider-Woman as a new outfit for their locker to use across
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's various modes of Battle Royale, Rocket Racing,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Festival, and even
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  .
  <strong>
   The Spider-Woman outfit costs 1.500 V-Bucks
  </strong>
  , and those who just want the skin can see their purchase rewarded with two additional cosmetics: the LEGO Style for
  <em>
   LEGO Fortnite
  </em>
  , and the Venomous Web Back Bling.

      <title>Best PlayStation Plus Games (October 2024)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  On June 13, 2022, Sony launched its new
  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  in North America. Split into three tiers, this model combines the previous version of PS Plus with PS Now; depending on which level someone subscribes to, they will gain access to certain services and games.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Essential ($9.99/month):
   </strong>
   This tier is the equivalent of the old PS Plus. A subscription includes online access, monthly free games, and discounts.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Extra ($14.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential tier benefits, Extra provides access to hundreds of PS4 and PS5 games.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    PlayStation Plus Premium ($17.99/month):
   </strong>
   Along with the Essential and Extra tier benefits, Premium includes a library of classic games (PS3, PS2, PSP, and PS1), trials, and cloud streaming in certain regions.

 <p>
  <strong>
   PS Plus Premium
  </strong>
  has over 700 games covering more than two decades of PlayStation history. Such a huge collection can be overwhelming, and the PS Plus app does not make it very easy to browse through the library; as such, it can be useful to know this tier's highlights before investing in a subscription. Each month, Sony adds a handful of new games. While most of these are PS5 and PS4 releases, they are occasionally accompanied by a few classic titles.

 <p>
  All of PS Plus Essential's October 2024 games are great.
  <em>
   WWE 2K24
  </em>
  is the month's biggest freebie due to being 6 months old and (more importantly) a brilliant wrestling game with a lot of content. That said, if someone cannot tell their RKOs from their Pedigrees, they probably won't gravitate towards 2K's annual release.
  <em>
   Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!
  </em>
  is also available and is an all-around masterpiece that should be experienced by just about anyone interested in horror or visual novels. However, the game is quite infamous by this point, which means most people are probably already aware of its various twists and turns. Still worth a run, but a blind playthrough might be impossible.

  Finally, there is
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  , the 2023 remake. The 2008 original is one of the greatest sci-fi horror games of all time, if not just straight-up the best; consequently, a remake was a risky proposition. Fortunately, Motive Studio managed to find the sweet spot between reverence and redirection, crafting a new adventure built on its ancestor's timeless foundation. The result is a campaign that captures the magic of the original
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  while still offering a fresh experience that should surprise even long-time fans. More importantly, it is scary, intense, and gory.
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  is horror.

  The perfect October 2024 PS Plus addition for Halloween,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  is a B-movie gorefest in the best possible way. Despite spending a long time in development hell, this sequel managed to avoid going down the
  <em>
   Duke Nukem Forever
  </em>
  route, supplying a highly enjoyable romp that does justice to the original game and
  <em>
   Riptide
  </em>
  . Now,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  is pretty straightforward in most areas, with the campaign simply dropping players in a series of open-ish areas and (mostly) telling them to kill every zombie they happen to see. Some side quests are thrown in for good measure, but the story, characters, and RPG elements are relatively basic.

 <p>
  However, none of that matters because
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  is simply a blast to play. The first-person combat is responsive, visceral, and gloriously bloody, combining to create a satisfying gameplay loop that is more than strong enough to remain interesting for about 20 hours. While the campaign is fairly static, the game does offer multiple playable characters to encourage repeat playthroughs, along with supporting co-op.

  <em>
   Monkey Island
  </em>
  is one of the most important point-and-click adventure franchises of all time, with the first two early '90s entries holding up as two all-time classics. PS Plus Premium members have access to remasters of both
  <em>
   The Secret of Monkey Island
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Monkey Island 2: Le Chuck'sRevenge
  </em>
  , which should be the introductory points for newcomers to the franchise. Once they are done with those, they can jump into 2022's
  <em>
   Return to Monkey Island
  </em>
  , which is a direct sequel to the second game. A return to glory after more than a decade of inactivity, this sequel is both a celebration of
  <em>
   Monkey Island
  </em>
  's legacy and a smart modernization of the old-school puzzle-adventure formula, albeit one that very much respects tradition.

  once again finds Guybrush searching for the secret of the eponymous island, a journey that involves visiting fan-favorite locations and characters while also encountering plenty of new content. As always, the writing is witty throughout, all the while still retaining an element of emotion and gravitas. As a puzzle game,
  <em>
   Return to Monkey Island
  </em>
  shows its roots at times, which means there can be the occasional frustrating headscratcher. That said, most of the puzzles are clever and just on the right side of challenging.

  Some games are life-consuming, and
  <em>
   Two Point Campus
  </em>
  is one of these projects. As implied by its title, this release puts players in charge of running a university, which means building facilities, employing lecturers, and trying to raise the college’s prestige. As far as management sims are concerned,
  <em>
   Two Point Campus
  </em>
  is more accessible than most due to its lighthearted approach and fairly extensive scenarios mode that works well to introduce the core mechanics; that said, the game is extremely deep as well, particularly once players get used to the basics and can just let loose in their quest to build their version of the ideal university.

 <p>
  Anyone who has played
  <em>
   Two Point Hospital
  </em>
  will probably not be too surprised by its successor’s gameplay, tone, or presentation.
  <em>
   Two Point Campus
  </em>
  evolves its predecessor’s formula well, and the school setting can lead to arguably wilder creations, but it is still fundamentally the same experience. Just to be clear, that is a positive as both titles are fantastic.

  While not a common occurrence, PS Plus has steadily increased the number of Day One games. September 2024 had two such titles:
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  . The former launched directly on PS Plus Essential, granting subscribers one month to add the magical sports game to their libraries. Meanwhile, the latter is available to everyone committed to the Extra or Premium tiers, and it was the standout game of the month. All Possible Futures'
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  plays around with dimensions as it follows the hero of a storybook who jumps back and forth between their world and the real one. This whimsical premise lends itself well to an imaginative platformer that incorporates fun puzzles along with a bit of action.

 <p>
  Although someone's mileage may vary, this indie project has more than enough charm to warrant a quick try, and the campaign's opening hour should be enough for a player to determine if they want to sit through the whole thing. The PS5 does not have all that many platformers or top-tier family-friendly games, and
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  is among the console's best efforts in both categories.

  80% of PS Plus Premium subscribers will ignore
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  , and they might have no choice since it requires a PS VR2 headset. Consequently, one of the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus games
  </strong>
  will only be experienced by a very small group of players; however, anyone who has the required hardware should download Cloudhead's project ASAP. Sony has been steadily adding virtual reality games to the service since June 2024, and
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  is currently the top pick in this niche bracket.

  So, what is
  <em>
   Pistol Whip
  </em>
  ? Well, it is basically a modern take on the traditional on-rails shooter format, albeit with a beat thrown in for good measure. Across a series of stages, players will work their way through creative and fairly abstract levels filled with enemies that need to be shot down, all while a song plays in the background. While they don't have to shoot with the rhythm, players earn more points for doing so, and it is just satisfying to pull off.

  For most months, picking the biggest new PS Plus Extra game is just a matter of personal taste; however, August 2024 was not one of those months. That's not meant as a criticism of games like
  <em>
   Wild Hearts
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Watch Dogs 2
  </em>
  , but rather a celebration of CD Projekt Red's RPG masterpiece.
  <em>
   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
  </em>
  was a landmark release for the genre, establishing a new era that emphasized storytelling, secondary content, and world-building more than ever before. While not flawless, the 2015 game is arguably timeless, at least up to this point. Hard as it is to believe,
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  has been out for nearly a decade, and its shadow continues to loom large over RPGs and even CD Projekt Red specifically.

 <p>
  Due to its popularity and relative accessibility,
  <em>
   Wild Hunt
  </em>
  is probably not a new game for most PS Plus subscribers. Certain projects are so big that they stop being exciting additions to subscription services, simply since most people would already own them. Still, there must be a few exceptions who have never loaded up Geralt's final (full) chapter, and they can now experience the best console iteration since PS Plus Extra has both the PS5 and PS4 versions. They will find an ambitious and (at times) overwhelming open-world RPG with fully realized characters, immersive exploration, rich side quests, and a unique combat system.

 <p>
  Is this the cutest cult simulator of all time?
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  is an unapologetically dark roguelite that follows a Lamb as they diligently work to set the stage for their god's return, a process that involves defeating four bishops, recruiting plenty of followers, and the occasional sacrifice. Roguelikes are a dime-a-dozen nowadays, and the genre can be automatically written off if someone does not see the appeal of endlessly replaying the same loop.

 <p>
  In cases like this, roguelites can act as a fun middle-ground between the replayable nature of roguelikes and more story-driven adventures, and
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  walks this line expertly. While, for the most part, players will revisit the same four (randomly generated) dungeons to try and clear them out and take out their bosses, they will constantly be recruiting new characters for their town/cult, which will further unlock new mechanics and upgrades.

 <p>
  Most importantly,
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  is just an absolute sinister delight that revels in macabre imagery and ideas. Along with just being very dark, the humor frequently hits the mark as it constantly pushes the envelope. Furthermore, the gameplay is rock-solid as well, be it the dungeon runs or the town-management aspect. The latter is arguably the best part of the game, as the followers have a ton of personality and evolve alongside the Lamb and cult.

  While
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  was the biggest PS Plus game of August 2024, an argument could be made that it was not the most exciting. In a move that was a long time coming, Free Radical Design's
  <em>
   TimeSplitters
  </em>
  trilogy finally made its way to modern systems, with all three PS2 games landing on the PS4 and PS5. These are mostly straight ports of the original versions, and they do show their age in a few ways. However, they are still fantastic console shooters that represent the genre at its early best, especially
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  .

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":15,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":15,"nbrPlacementsScanned":15,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1127} -->

 <p>
  Both entries are great, and they also shine in somewhat different areas. In terms of pure gunplay,
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  is arguably the superior of the two games, and it still sits among the best shooters of all time. Although containing something resembling a plot, the story mode is mostly just a series of extraction-style maps, all of which are well-designed and a blast to master. As the franchise's title suggests, players travel through time, ensuring the stages have quite a bit of variety to them. Co-op is supported as well.

 <p>
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  has a far more robust and prominent story that creates a cohesive adventure rather than a loosely connected jumble of maps. While not high art, the campaign is fun in the way that a blockbuster can be. The gameplay is quite good, although it is notably less intense and frantic than
  <em>
   TimeSplitters 2
  </em>
  . Nothing wrong with that, but
  <em>
   Future Perfect
  </em>
  feels a touch less special in this area.

     The first
     <em>
      TimeSplitters
     </em>
     has charm as well, but it is rightfully overshadowed by both of its sequels. To be clear, the 2000 release is worth a playthrough, as long as newcomers prepare themselves for a somewhat rough experience. Also, its gameplay is not that similar to
     <em>
      TimeSplitters 2
     </em>
     or
     <em>
      Future Perfect
     </em>
     , so do not ignore the latter if the former fails to strike a chord.

  Rockstar's portfolio is not over-represented by PS Plus, but the developer's biggest names are on Sony's service. Added back in May 2024 after already being removed once,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is still a big deal, despite the game being more than 5 years old by this point. An ambitious prequel to 2010's decorated Western,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  brings to life a unique period in American history: the end of the Frontier. The Van der Linde gang represents the dying Wild West, and Arthur Morgan specifically finds himself ripped out of time and in an era that no longer wants his type.

 <p>
  Offering a 50+ hour campaign,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  is an immersive open-world game that emphasizes character-driven storytelling, both in its main quests and also the optional content found across the map. The latter missions tell personal and often emotional stories, and they play a part in shaping Arthur Morgan's personality and (ultimately) destiny. The writing is superb, but that means nothing in the face of unenjoyable gameplay, and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is a peculiar case. Rockstar prioritizes authenticity, delivering an immersive gameplay loop that highlights the tedium that makes up an outlaw's ordinary everyday existence. This decision can be somewhat polarizing, but it does make for a unique experience.

  While the PlayStation 3 had a somewhat slow start to life, the console bowed out in style. Naughty Dog's
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  is a haunting action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with infected creatures. The narrative follows the grizzled Joel and the immune Ellie as they travel across the United States in search of a group rumored to be able to craft a cure.

 <p>
  The journey is tough, brutal, and unforgettable. Both of the main characters undergo a great deal of development, particularly Joel, while
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  raises questions of morality through its ambiguous narrative. Even though PS Plus does not have the PS5 remake, the PS4 remaster of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  holds up well and offers a fantastic means to experience an industry-defining gaming story.

  FromSoftware has cornered the hard-hitting action RPG genre through its immaculate
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy, and that looks set to continue with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Out of all the studio's many great games,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  might just be FromSoftware's magnum opus.

  Boasting a Gothic aesthetic and reflex-based combat that demands aggression from players,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  delivers a kinetic experience that delights on a visual, auditory, and gameplay level. Naturally,

   Bloodborne

   PS Plus games
  </strong>
  that everyone with an account should play, and 2018's
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  should be at the top of that list. This "reboot" of the series sees Kratos living in a different part of the world, far from the Greecian roots players are used to seeing him in.

  Kratos' move to Midgard gave developers a chance to shine a spotlight on some different gods, tapping into the deep Scandinavian folklore surrounding the Norse Gods and their mythology. With RPG elements, an incredible story, breathtaking visuals, and some awesome combat mechanics,
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   must-play PS Plus game

  While not unheard of, Day 1 PS Plus arrivals are rare, with most months not featuring this type of release. Consequently, whenever an exception materializes, it is always a cause for celebration; more importantly,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is an exceptional exception. Technically, Mintrocket's indie darling has been around since 2023, but it had to wait until April 16, 2024, to make its PlayStation debut, so it still counts as a Day 1 addition. When this year comes to an end,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  will almost certainly be remembered as one of the best PS Plus newcomers.

 <p>
  Combining restaurant management with fishing, Mintrocket created a package that feels oddly unique, despite sharing similarities with many other projects. As Dave, players have two general responsibilities: catch and serve fish. The former takes up the protagonist's days, forcing him to constantly make trips into an evolving ocean in search of materials that can be used to create sushi at his restaurant. Naturally, the nights are spent running the establishment, making sure that customers are satisfied. While the management aspect is not as deep as some other titles on the market,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  gives players more than enough control to make these segments engaging. However, the fishing element is the game's highlight and adds the most replay value.

  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  is without question the most famous horror franchise in gaming, and it is eternally linked to the PlayStation brand. Premium subscribers can play through a healthy selection of entries from Capcom's license, including classics such as
  <em>
   Resident Evil Code: Veronica X
  </em>
  , polarizing sequels like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  , and HD remasters of masterpieces like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  . The Extra tier does not have quite as robust of a catalog, although it includes two notable projects in 2019's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  remake and its sequel. When the main entries successfully shifted to a first-person perspective with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  , some fans might have feared that could spell an end for classic third-person releases; fortunately, Capcom relaxed those anxieties with a couple of stellar remakes.

 <p>
  2020's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  is the weakest of Capcom's modern remakes, although it is still a solid action-horror game that does justice to the classic PS1 original. However,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is considerably more complete and satisfying, delivering a robust two-protagonist campaign that is consistently intense and terrifying. The controls are immaculate, the visuals are stunning, and the sound design is among the best in the genre – an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  is almost the perfect horror game.

  One of the
  <strong>
   best PlayStation Plus games
  </strong>
  to launch on Day 1,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is an inspired Metroidvania with simple but effective controls. For the most part, the game sticks very close to the genre's standard formula of unbound exploration, puzzles, platforming, and the gradual reveal of new items that provide access to different areas; however, Shared Memory succeeded in stitching these well-worn pieces together to create something that feels at least somewhat fresh. A big part of this comes down to
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  's haunting aesthetic and ambient music, which combine to create a campaign oozing in atmosphere and style, making up for a lack of a conventional story.

 <p>
  Although fun, the platforming sections are quite easy, with most of the jumps providing players with plenty of room for error. However,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is still pretty darn difficult due to its puzzles, very open nature, and clever boss fights. The game's brainteasers often require lateral thinking (and clever use of a slink), while the latter could cause players to feel lost on occasion. That said, the in-game map is detailed and useful.

  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart
  </em>
  is among the most high-profile PS5 games available on PS Plus Extra. As a console exclusive, this reveal seemed destined to transpire sooner or later, although almost two years from the game's debut had to pass for this moment to arrive.
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  might very well still be the most beautiful PS5 title on the market, a testament to Insomniac's mastery of technology and talent for creating vibrant and stunning worlds that would not look out of place in a Pixar movie.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  backs up its good looks with fantastic gameplay and an enjoyable story that allows its lovable characters to shine. Although Ratchet and his robotic companion take center stage, they are accompanied by a new playable Lombax in the form of Rivet, who also comes with her own partner. In combat, the characters largely control the same; however, the game does a great job of establishing Rivet's own identity through her personality.

 <p>
  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Ratchet &amp; Clank
  </em>
  lives and dies on the strength of its gameplay, and
  <em>
   Rift Apart
  </em>
  is right up there with the franchise's best efforts. Ratchet and Rivet have access to a wide assortment of fun weapons, all of which serve a purpose within the campaign.

  While the
  <em>

  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Builders
  </em>
  spin-offs that are on PS Plus Extra are enjoyable,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11 S
  </em>
  is on a whole other level as it is one of the best JRPGs on the PS4. Set in a vibrant world brimming with style and personality,
  <em>
   DQ11
  </em>
  delivers familiar but addictive turn-based combat, lovable characters, and a simple but effective storyline.

 <p>
  Rather than reinventing a wheel that has never been broken,
  <em>
   DQ11
  </em>
  opts to modernize mechanics and concepts that have been successful for decades. Ultimately, this game just proves that
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  is timeless. The version on PS Plus Extra expands on the vanilla release in a few neat ways too, including a 16-bit mode.

  Insomniac's
  <em>

  ended the PS4's life as Sony's main console on a high, and the
  <em>
   Director's Cut
  </em>
  is just a better version of that already great game. Taking place during the Mongolian invasion of Japan, This samurai epic tells a tale of revenge as Jin Sakai seeks to protect Tsushima Island.

  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  might be the most beautiful game on PS Plus Premium, and it is not just a looker. The hack and slash combat is a great deal of fun, managing to be deep and also cinematic. Narratively, the title does not do anything too out of the ordinary, but the unique setting helps set
  <em>
   GOT
  </em>
  apart from the many other open-world games on the market.

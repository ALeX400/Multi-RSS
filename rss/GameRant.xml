      Elden Ring's new update makes the DLC easier overall for players, addressing the challenging gameplay of Shadow of the Erdtree.
     </li>
     <li>
      Scadutree Fragments help players deal more damage and withstand attacks, essential for completing the expansion.
     </li>
     <li>
      After the update, the first half of the max Scadutree Fragments will provide a bigger boost, as will the final one.

 <p>
  FromSoftware has released a brand-new update for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  that should make the DLC slightly easier, especially in its early stages.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC has been released to widespread critical acclaim, but it has ruffled the feathers of even some of the most diehard Soulslike fans. While
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and the genre itself has a reputation for extreme difficulty, it seems many have been put off by just how challenging
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  is.

 <p>
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  has proven to be extremely difficult, to the point where some have started review bombing the game on Steam to voice their frustrations. There are those who feel as though
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  is simply too hard, especially compared to the base game, though there are others who appreciate the added challenge.

 <p>
  Perhaps in response to fan complaints about
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  's difficulty, a new update has been released for the open world game that looks to address its balance. Update 1.12.2 is available for
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  fans to download right now. It increases the amount of attack output and damage negation for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements when players utilize Shadow Realm Blessings like Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes, though the second half will be more gradual. Furthermore, the attack output and damage negation for the final level of Blessing enhancements "has been slightly increased."

 <p>
  The long and short of it is that after downloading the update,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  players will have an easier time with the early parts of the DLC, as well as the expansion's final moments. So, those that feel like they've hit a brick wall with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss may have an easier time winning that brutal fight, while those stuck on the final battle should also have a somewhat easier time. Of course, this all depends on whether
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  players are actually collecting and using Scadutree Fragments.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Publisher Bandai Namco actually had to release a message reminding
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  players to use their Scadutree Fragments, as it became clear that many were simply not utilizing them properly. Scadutree Fragments are a new collectible item that players can find by exploring the DLC. When used at a Site of Grace, they make it so players deal more damage and are capable of withstanding more incoming damage. Scadutree Fragments are essential for most people that want to complete the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC, and as of the new update, they should give players an even more significant advantage.

 <p>
  In the patch notes for the new
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  update, Bandai Namco also confirmed a bug where raytracing is automatically enabled when players on PC load saved data from previous game versions. This is what's been causing
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  's framerate problems for some players, and those individuals are encouraged to turn raytracing off. The patch notes conclude by confirming that more
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  updates are on the way that will fix bugs and make "other balance adjustments," though what those adjustments will consist of remains to be seen.

  2023 kept
  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  owners busy. The year produced
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  (remake),
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  , just to mention a few major releases. And, 2024 is mostly trying to do the same. The
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5
  </strong>
  library is consistently expanding, and the best is presumably yet to come for Sony's current console. In the meantime, the
  <strong>
   PlayStation 4
  </strong>
  continues to receive love with cross-generation titles, so people who have yet to upgrade still have plenty to look forward to.

  June 2024 is the month of expansions, with
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  all dropping new content. Each of these titles could headline a month on its own, so the fact their expansions are debuting so close is unusual.
  <em>
   The Final Shape
  </em>
  brought to an end
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's story, and while Bungie's shooter has not always hit home runs, the conclusion has landed quite well.
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  came out to a standing ovation, much like the base game received in 2022. Expansive, challenging, and filled with new ideas, this follow-up represents
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  at its best.

  Moving away from expansions, June 2024 has plenty to offer as well.
  <em>
   Killer Klowns From Outer Space
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Still Wakes The Deep
  </em>
  are interesting, even if the former did not garner a positive reception. The latter was received well. Meanwhile, June 14 saw the release of three ports that should entertain JRPG fans, particularly
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Slime Rancher 2
  </em>
  will be making its full debut after a fairly long spell in early access.
  <em>
   V Rising
  </em>
  has also made its PlayStation debut. Ubisoft also randomly announced and released an anniversary edition of
  <em>
   Beyond Good &amp; Evil
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  opted to wait until July to release its expansion, with
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  starting the month on a high note. The MMORPG has been fantastic for a long time, and there is nothing to indicate that a misstep is on the horizon. Otherwise, July 2024 is slowly shaping up to be a strong month, with
  <em>
   Bleak Faith: Forsaken
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Earth Defense Force 6
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak
  </em>
  all being major (albeit niche) releases in their own right.
  <em>
   Smite 2
  </em>
  will also be launching towards the end of the month, and it could very well prove to be among the year's most notable online multiplayer releases.

  Almost no games have been announced for August 2024; however, the few exceptions look pretty good.
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  has been gathering steam for quite a while by this point, and the action RPG could be one of the year's strongest newcomers.
  <em>
   Dustborn
  </em>
  looks set to be a fun character-driven genre-blender.
  <em>
   Core Keeper
  </em>
  's full debut is scheduled for this month as well, and the game has enjoyed a successful run in early access. EA's
  <em>
   Madden NFL 25
  </em>
  will launch halfway through August.

 <p>
  Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft have confirmed that
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  will launch at the end of August 2024. Set after the events of
  <em>
   The Empire Strikes Back
  </em>
  , the open-world game will tell a single-player story revolving around Kay Vess and Nix, as they try to pull off a major heist.

  It is still way too early to predict which games will headline September 2024, but
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2
  </em>
  will almost certainly be among them as long as the project is not delayed. A sequel to Relic Entertainment's well-liked 2011 hack-and-slash game, the sequel looks set to be a great evolution from its predecessor.

 <p>
  While the definition of niche,
  <em>
   Earth Defense Force: World Brothers 2
  </em>
  should be a decent co-op option.
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  could be a lot of fun as well, with the licensed game seemingly taking inspiration from
  <em>
   Lego
  </em>
  . Finally, Sony has announced
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , a 3D platformer sequel to
  <em>
   Astro's Playroom
  </em>
  .

  2024 currently offers endless possibilities, and there is a chance that the year's best game has yet to be announced entirely. That said, the year's catalog is slowly starting to take shape, and there are an array of projects that are tentatively expected to drop within 2024 but have yet to reveal release dates.
  <em>
   Blue Protocol
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ys 10: Nordics
  </em>
  are fairly safe bets for
  <strong>
   2024 PS5 games
  </strong>
  , although that could change at a moment's notice.

  As games spend years in development, plenty of projects are known to be in the works but have yet to announce anything resembling a release year.
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Infinity
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Beyond Good and Evil 2
  </em>
  are some of the biggest games in the works, all of which will attract plenty of attention once they debut. Most of these titles are presumably a few years away.

  Rumors should always be taken with a grain of salt; that said, speculating about what unrevealed titles are secretly in development for the PS5 can be a lot of fun. With the PS5 in full swing, rumors have started making the rounds as people begin to speculate on what games they would love to see make an appearance on the console. Could these releases take the form of long-overdue sequels? Much needed remakes? Or could there be some new IP in the works that will become the new
  <em>
   GTA?
  </em>

  invites players to create unique characters. And the further you progress, the more different abilities you can get. However, some bonuses become available during character creation. And, of course, we are talking about Races. Each of them has unique Talent Cards and Attribute bonuses, although some are more useful than others.

  Therefore, in this Tier List, we have ranked all the
  <em>
   Deepwoken
  </em>
  Races from best to least helpful. The right Race can make your progression a lot easier, as well as make your late-game build even stronger. But its re-roll is quite expensive.

  As we said, each Race in
  <em>
   Deepwoken

  has unique bonuses. Players automatically get one of the 12 available Races when creating a character. It is important to note that in
  <em>
   Deepwoken
  </em>
  , special Races can only be obtained directly from the developers, so we do not rank them in our Tier List.

 <p>
  In addition to bonuses, each Race has a certain drop rate, which makes them difficult to obtain. Plus, each reroll will cost you 150 Robux. Note that this feature is only available during character creation; after that, you will no longer be able to reroll the Race. Fortunately, during each reroll, you have the choice to get a new Race or keep the one you had before. For your convenience, we recommend using our
  <em>
   Deepwoken

   <strong>

   - This Race initially has natural armor, which reduces damage taken by 5%. It also grants +2 Willpower and +3 Fortitude.

   <strong>
    Felinor
   </strong>
   - Thanks to the Nightchild talent, you significantly increase your agility and Stealth. It grants +2 Charisma and +3 Agility.

   <strong>
    Capra
   </strong>
   - Besides the fact that this Race is the rarest in

   , it has several versions of talent. Three of them are the Mark of Nemit, the Mark of Jurik, and the Mark of Ku. And each of them will help you buff both yourself and your allies. In addition to this Capra, players receive +2 Willpower and +3 Intelligence.

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blasphemous 2 May Be in the Same Boat</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Despite its notoriously long development cycle,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hollow Knight: Silksong
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still highly anticipated. There may not be any release date in sight, but there are still plans to release
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  when it's finally ready. With its predecessor being one of the most successful indie releases in the past decade,
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  has a lot to live up to, but it also has the same problem to face as another indie hit.

 <p>
  <em>
   Blasphemous 2
  </em>
  may not be as much of a mainstream success as
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  , but it and its predecessor are fantastic indie titles with beautiful imagery and a fascinating world, giving both franchises common ground. Although
  <em>
   Blasphemous 2
  </em>
  has the benefit of being released, once
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  launches, the two titles are going to meet a fork in the road when it comes to the continuation of their respective franchises.

  <em>
   Silksong

  's developer, Team Cherry, and
  <em>
   Blasphemous 2
  </em>
  's developer, The Game Kitchen, now have a huge decision to make about the next move. The main question lies in whether both studios should continue with third installments or if these developers should introduce a new IP to their rosters.

  Blasphemous 2 is at a Crossroads
 </h3>
 <p>
  Following its fantastic first installment,
  <em>
   Blasphemous 2
  </em>
  launched to overwhelmingly positive reviews, bringing an even stronger Metroidvania experience to gamers.
  <em>
   Blasphemous 2
  </em>
  is a great balance of horror and action, and it's understandable how many players could be left wanting more. The Game Kitchen has now established itself as a highly capable developer, so there is a huge choice to make about what game it wants to produce next.

 <p>
  On the one hand, it would be fantastic to see a third
  <em>
   Blasphemous
  </em>
  chapter brought to life, but on the other hand, it would be intriguing to see The Game Kitchen take a swing at an all-new story.
  <em>
   Blasphemous
  </em>
  is a stand-out franchise in the Metroidvania genre, which would be sad to see end. However, The Game Kitchen could potentially have something even more unique up its sleeve.

  <em>
   Blasphemous 2

  could continue its franchise right now, but
  <em>
   Silksong'

  s long development could dictate Team Cherry's next move. At this rate, a third
  <em>
   Hollow Knight

  game would be at least a generous five years away after
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  . That means it's up to Team Cherry to decide whether it wants to pursue a simpler IP that could be developed quicker or invest fully in a
  <em>
   Silksong

  follow-up, regardless of how long or ambitious that development phase would turn out to be.

  When it comes to
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  's franchise,
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  's extended production has become the biggest talking point about the game. Delays and lack of updates aside, Team Cherry has a lot of weight on its shoulders for just a three-person development team, so it's important to remember the hard work being put into the game. Crafting a follow-up to such a beloved game like
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  is no easy task, but the team is hopefully considering what moves to make next when
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  makes its eventual debut.

 <p>
  Both games are some of the best indie releases of this generation, and they both deserve to live on. Still, it also may be the better choice for Team Cherry and The Game Kitchen to go back to the drawing board for something fresh.

  Incantations in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  are the primary source of damage for all Faith-build users. The sheer amount of Incantations in the game allows players to choose any that fits their playstyle. With the recent launch of the new DLC, a lot of new areas have been added to the game, including new Sorceries and Incantations.

   Rain of Fire

  is one of the weaker Incantations added into the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>

  expansion, with each of the fire that drops deals little to no damage. Despite this, the Spell can still be useful in PvP to provide support and poke at the enemies from afar. The guide below includes the details on the location of the Incantation and which builds can make it more viable.

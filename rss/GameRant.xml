  Set in a post-apocalyptic universe in which the Punishing Virus has driven mankind to extinction, Kuro Games’
  <em>
   Punishing: Raven
  </em>
  is an action-adventure hack-and-slash game that has become a favorite among gacha fans. Not only does the game deliver some insanely epic combat, but it also features a storyline and characters that are nothing short of outstanding.

 <p>
  <em>
   Punishing: Gray Raven's
  </em>
  characters come in two ranks: A and S. While A-rank Constructs are free, S-ranks are often not. Think of them like VIPs who are among some of the most coveted in the game. Fortunately for fans, the game throws in a free S selection now and then, packed with year-one units. It's the perfect boost for newcomers to find their footing and for seasoned players to power up their characters even more with the help of the best S-rank Constructs in
  <em>
   Punishing: Gray Raven.
  </em>

 <p>
  Vera - Garnet, a Lightning Tank type is the perfect choice to kick things off. For starters, she's got a pretty fascinating signature weapon in her arsenal: a banner spear called the Phoenix that amps up her Lightning damage. Mix in a Signature Move like the Shine Piercer, which deals
  <strong>
   750% Lightning DMG,
  </strong>
  and players have an S-rank character that can slice right through enemies' Lightning Resistance and Super Armor.
 </p>

 <p>
  Vera's charge attack, Garnet, is a real crowd-pleaser—
  <em>
   literally.
  </em>
  It pulls in a whole bunch of enemies, showcasing her top-notch crowd subjugation skills. As she rakes in those Lightning charge stacks with her normal strike, her charge assault cranks up the power, yanking all her foes into one tidy little spot for her fellow Constructs to attack.

 <p>
  So for anyone looking to maximize the potential of this amazing S-rank, don't forget to team her up with Bianca - Veritas or SSS-Rank Selena - Tempest to
  <em>
   really
  </em>
  pack a punch.

  The Ice Team got a much-needed upgrade with Ayla - Kaleido, an Ice Amplifier stepping in to fill Wanshi's shoes. Now while she might be an Amplifier only, she leaves her comrades, Lucia: Plume and Chrome: Glory, in the dust when it comes to some a dazzling display of damage dealt.

 <p>
  The best part of this specific frame is that Ayla's adorable and iconic flair is kept intact while proving it still can hold its own against even the most battle-hardened frames. In fact, it may even outshine Brilliance in every conceivable way when it comes to warfare as it can handle most ground conflicts like a pro.

  With her trusty Bean Gunlance in hand, Ayle - Kaleido can unleash a–frankly frightening– frosty damage, delivering a damning
  <strong>
   1100% Ice DMG
  </strong>
  to her enemies in her iconic Signature Move, the Omnichromatic World!, while simultaneously triggering her Time Lag Calculation. To put it simply, Ayla - Kaleido is one of the best S-rank Constructs on the Ice team, and that’s definitely no small feat.

 <p>
  A Dark Tank type, Karenina - Scire is great at two things: dealing mind-blowing damage swiftly, and reducing her enemies' Resistance like it's child's play. When it comes to
  <em>
   Punishing: Gray Raven’s
  </em>
  most powerful S-rank Constructs, Karenina takes the crown as the first to unleash Dark Element damage at a 100% rate. That's difficult to top.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Now, perhaps the most interesting aspect of this specific frame is it was created by Karenina to thrive in the Moon's low-gravity atmosphere. The heart of the power system boasts a sleek miniaturized gravitation device, giving players the thrill of short-term air mobility that they won’t find elsewhere.

 <p>
  But the best part of this S-rank Construct is her knack for swiftly launching her Signature Move, the Starshatter Horizon. This move rapidly knocks her enemies down a peg with her blast hammer, stirring up a storm of chaos and expertly triggering her Time Lag Calculation, all while stacking an impressive
  <strong>
   1200% Dark DMG.
  </strong>

  Think of Liv - Empyrea as the upgraded and bolder version of a Support Construct. With her impressive attacking and healing abilities and skills, Liv - Empyrea makes it a breeze for newbie players to snag a win. Liv - Empyrea can definitely deal incredible damage with her Burst skill, but that’s just a warm-up compared to her Signature Move, the Sea of Sangharama, where she deals
  <strong>
   1000% AOE Fire DMG
  </strong>
  on a massive scale.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":983} -->

 <p>
  Interestingly, Liv - Empyrea stands out as an S-rank for one really compelling reason: she boasts a unique frame that can "purify" the Punishing Virus. In theory, she can soak up the Punishing Virus and zap it away with the Omega Weapon tucked inside its frame. Sounds cool? It gets better.

 <p>
  To sweeten the deal, this frame comes with some seriously powerful wings that keep it soaring smoothly, even when cranked up to high power. They can whip up a shield whenever the moment calls for it which is pretty much always in this game.

  Lee - Hyperreal is set to dominate as the ultimate Fire Attacker for at least another year—if not longer. Believe it or not, a reliable fire attacker is absolutely essential for the Fire Team. Lee - Hyperreal boasts fantastic team synergy, keeps the gameplay lively, and can dish out damage even when he's chilling off-field. But the real showstopper about Lee - Hyperreal is his jaw-dropping specialty: Combo. With this move, he can fire off the 3-Ping Skill at breakneck speed, delivering a serious smackdown in the blink of an eye.

 <p>
  Not only that but his special Signature Move, Hyper Bust, can deliver anything from
  <strong>
   700% to 4400% Fire DMG
  </strong>
  , triggering his Time Lag Calculation simultaneously. So for anyone looking for the ultimate Fire squad, Lee - Hyperreal is a superb choice, especially when paired with Liv - Empyrea and Nanami - Starfarer. Because this trio promises an experience that's nothing short of unforgettable.

  Alisa - Echo is one-of-a-kind because she’s the sole Physical Amplifier and the ultimate pick for the Physical team’s meta moving forward. In her debut, Alisa paired up brilliantly with the fiery Bianca - Stigmata and the steadfast Rosetta - Rigor. In fact, the entire Physical team is a total game-changer for free-to-play players, packed with goodies that really put it in the spotlight of the meta.

 <p>
  On that note, Harmonization is the dazzling new gem that Alisa's patch brings to the table. Put simply, a Construct's Signature weapon gives players the chance to stack two extra memories, allowing them to score the four-set bonus from not just one, but two memory sets. Alisa's meta Construct is a brilliant mix of four distinct memories and four Da Vinci pieces, highlighting her talent for this function. And don't overlook her Signature Move, the Celestial Edge, which cases out no less than
  <strong>
   2660% Physical DMG
  </strong>
  in total when she's teaming up with Cecily.

  No. 21 - Feral is a Lightning Amplifier that’s got a fresh frame to keep No. 21's M.I.N.D. on lock. Now, here’s the thing about No.21 - Feral that shocked and delighted fans in equal measure. Her frame is a wonderfully unique build that fuses human-like features with some seriously cool bionic animal vibes. And to keep No.21's fierce attack game strong,
  <em>
   Punishing: Gray Raven
  </em>
  cranked up her new frame's durability, weapon power, and maneuverability to a hundred.

  With her Burst ability, she can unleash a whirlwind of damage in zero time flat. And just like her Signature Move implies, the Sky-splitting Arcflash deals a stunning
  <strong>
   3000% Lightning DMG
  </strong>
  with a Time Lag Calculation on top of all that.

  Bianca - Stigmata, an incredibly powerful Physical Attacker, leaves all previous Constructs in the dust, and it’s easy to see why. Her skills are off the charts—no other attacker even comes close. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration that thanks to Bianca - Stigmata’s addition, the Physical team has leveled up to become one of the best in
  <em>
   Punishing: Gray Raven.
  </em>

 <p>
  Right now, even with just a basic setup and a shiny 5-star weapon, she's the ultimate powerhouse character when it comes to physical attacks. Not only can she cause serious damage with her Burst ability (being an Attacker and all that) but she's also got this awesome Form Switch skill that lets her flip from a Sword form to her Staff form and back.

 <p>
  Plus, her Signature Move, the Blade Abyss packs a punch just like the rest of her arsenal, letting her trigger Time Lag Calculation and deal over
  <strong>
   600% Physical DMG
  </strong>
  to her target. So, she's definitely a smart pick to for players to pour resources into—whether they’re eyeing her Signature Move or planning to boost her to SS3 or beyond.

  Chapter 15 introduced the crafty boss, Lamia, who is a Dark Attacker type. Her enormous fishtail, exceptional camouflage abilities, and stellar effectiveness in underwater combat earned her the title of Ascendant.

  Thanks to Luna's improvements to Lamia’s frame, Lamia - Lullaby now possesses the unique appearance of the first and only Atlantis-altered S-rank Construct. Lamia's new frame, which is an enhancement of her previous frame, possesses Ascendant abilities and may easily transform between her human and mermaid forms.

 <p>
  As if that wasn’t enough, her special ability lets her transition between Attack Mode and her Signature Move, the Elegy of Atlantis. Using this move, she can deal around
  <strong>
   2500% in Dark DMG
  </strong>
  . So, it’s quite understandable that everyone in the
  <em>
   Punishing: Gray Raven
  </em>
  community is absolutely gushing over this S-rank character.

  Without a doubt, the top contender on this list is none other than Lucia - Crimson Weave, a Lightning Attacker type. She’s a formidable S-rank Omniframe who can effortlessly flip between her short and long swords, dealing devastating combo moves that pack a punch with both high burst and sustained damage.

 <p>
  Lucia - Crimson Weave’s skills revolve around complex mechanics, like stacking and orb-based attacks, turning her into a truly versatile fighter unlike any other on this list. She shines the best when it comes to staying power, expertly reducing damage, and executing defensive parries that elevate her presence in the heat of battle.

 <p>
  Most importantly, her Signature Move, the Weave of Voidness, has the power to cause over jaw-dropping

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  In 2022, Santa Monica Studio and PlayStation launched
  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War Ragnarok
   </em>
  </strong>
  for PS4 and PS5. A monumental achievement,
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  blew players away with its gripping story, jaw-dropping visuals, and visceral combat that successfully built on the groundbreaking 2018
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  game. Two years later, PC gamers have the chance to see what all the fuss is about with
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  , and I'm happy to report that the PC port lives up to expectations.

  There have been a couple of misfires, but for the most part, PlayStation's PC ports have successfully brought the company's best games to the platform.
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  is another of PlayStation's high-quality PC ports, and as long as one has a powerful-enough rig, they can get an experience on par or even better than what was achieved on PS5. The game is polished to a sheen, with near-perfect performance and the same incredible graphics as its PlayStation counterpart. Of course, the best graphics in the world don't mean much if the gameplay doesn't back it up, but
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  delivers in that arena as well.

 <p>
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  features similar hard-hitting action as the 2018 game, with an over-the-shoulder camera and up-close-and-personal hack and slash action.
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  expands Kratos' arsenal as the game goes on, with the titular God of War eventually able to wield an infinitely-respawning spear that shakes things up considerably. Kratos primarily uses his weapons to dispatch the many different enemies he encounters on his journey, but they are also used for puzzle-solving purposes, like when players have to freeze something using the Leviathan Axe, for example.

  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  's PC port introduces an awesome quality-of-life feature when it comes to puzzle-solving. Whereas the original PlayStation version of the game had Atreus and other characters quickly chiming in with puzzle solutions before players could really even take a crack at them,
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  gives players the option of turning off their help, which is a nice touch that really lets players tailor the experience to suit their own tastes.

  God of War Ragnarok is Best Played With a DualSense Controller
 </h2>
 <p>
  Otherwise,
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  on PC is basically the same experience as the PlayStation version.
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  has some PC-exclusive features, of course, like ultrawide support and the option of playing with a mouse and keyboard, but nothing that would necessarily make it worth double-dipping for those that already own the game on console. For that matter, I highly recommend PC gamers forget the idea of playing with a mouse and keyboard, and instead get their hands on a PS5 DualSense controller. While
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  is certainly playable with a mouse and keyboard set-up as well as a variety of other PC-compatible controllers (I mainly tested the game on PC using an Xbox controller), nothing beats playing the game with a DualSense. Haptic feedback and adaptive triggers add an extra layer of immersion to the game's fights, and it's simply the best way to play
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  .

  Those that have never played
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  are in for an incredible ride with the PC version.
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  sees Kratos and Atreus at odds with Norse gods Odin and Thor after the events of the 2018 game. What follows is a heart-pounding adventure that sees Kratos, Atreus, and their companions explore the Nine Realms in an effort to stop the prophesized apocalypse.
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  's story is truly engrossing and easily one of the best that the series has delivered to date. It's full of brilliant character interactions and shocking twists that will ensure players are completely enthralled from start to finish, minus some pacing issues here and there.

  I think
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  is a near-perfect game until a certain Atreus section. I don't want to get into spoilers for those that haven't played
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  before, but just know that the game loses a lot of momentum at a certain point where Atreus becomes the main playable character. This section of the game is dull and can make the runtime feel a little bloated, though I will say it concludes with one of the most memorable boss fights in the entire
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  series. It also introduces an interesting new character, so it's a shame that the gameplay for this section is rather boring compared to the rest of the game.

  That aside, it's hard to find fault with

  . It's an amazing, lengthy journey full of wonderful sights to see, memorable fights to partake in, and plenty of secrets to find. The puzzles are great and are even better in the PC version without Kratos' companions ruining the solutions, the worlds are fun to explore, and the story is one of the best in gaming history. However, there is one flaw with the PC version of
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  that fans should be aware of.

  God of War Ragnarok's PSN Requirement is Disappointing
 </h2>
 <p>
  Unfortunately,
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  requires a PlayStation Network account on PC.
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  is a strictly single-player game, and so it's unclear why it's necessary for Steam users to have a PSN account. It's true that it doesn't take too long to make an account or link an existing one, but it's still an inconvenience that seems like it could have been easily avoided, considering the previous PlayStation games that landed on Steam without such a requirement. One benefit to it is that it lets gamers play with a PlayStation overlay that unlocks trophies at the same time as Steam achievements, though.

  PC gamers that can look past
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  's PSN account requirement will have a tremendous time with the game. But there's even more to play once the main story is done.
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  's PC port includes the Valhalla mode at launch, meaning PC gamers can get the full experience out of the gate. Valhalla, for the uninitiated, is a special game mode that blends
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  combat with roguelike elements to tell a unique story set after the events of the base game. Valhalla was a free update for the PlayStation version of the game, so it's not like it adds extra monetary value to
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  's PC port, but it's still nice to get the entire package at once.

It's unlikely that Sony is going to let-up on the latter, so PC gamers that want to enjoy the company's games without buying a PS5 should keep that in mind.

      <title>Funko Fusion Review</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/funko-fusion-review/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  I've never been one to collect Funko Pops, but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Funko Fusion
   </em>
  </strong>
  still caught my eye. I was intrigued by its bizarre concept of mashing together completely unrelated entertainment franchises into a third-person shooter, and when it became clear that it was inspired by the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  video games, I was even more on board. But after playing
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  , I can say that Funko fans should stick with buying the vinyl figures instead.

  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's odd collection of random IP sounds like a fun idea on paper, but it doesn't work in execution. The list of franchises represented in
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  runs the gamut from
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Mega Man
  </em>
  , represented through unlockable characters and playable stages. Seven of the franchises get full-blown worlds where most of the action takes place, though it's like the IPs chosen to get this greater focus were pulled out of a hat. It's baffling that
  <em>
   The Umbrella Academy
  </em>
  , years from the height of its popularity and coming off a near-universally panned final season, has five levels dedicated to it while something with more cultural relevancy in 2024, like
  <em>
   Invincible
  </em>
  , only has one. And while I love Edgar Wright's hilarious 2007 action comedy
  <em>
   Hot Fuzz
  </em>
  , it's strange that it too has five levels instead of Wright's own
  <em>
   Shaun of the Dead
  </em>
  , which is easily the more popular film.

  Even so, it can be fun to find special characters like Chucky from
  <em>
   Child's Play
  </em>
  in
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  , and there is an absurdity to it all that at least makes things entertaining on a surface level. The developers clearly have a love for the IP featured in
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  , with clever touches like Number Five from
  <em>
   Umbrella Academy
  </em>
  teleporting instead of dodging like the other playable characters in the game. It's also neat to see the worlds of these franchises recreated and hardcore fans of the IPs will get some entertainment value from exploring certain levels.

  But when it comes to actually playing the game,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  is a disaster. Players will quickly forget the messy charm of seeing random franchises thrown at a dart board once they're in the trenches and trying to play the game. A typical
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  level is a mostly open-ended area where players walk around, solve simple puzzles with vague objectives, and shoot a lot of enemy Funko Pops. It can sometimes be confusing to know where to go next or what to do, and the game suffers from being extremely repetitive and buggy. Players won't know whether they can't advance the story because they haven't figured out what to do or because the game isn't working right.

  And even when everything works right,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  objectives can be incredibly boring. Multiple levels have escort missions, which are rarely fun. One particularly irritating escort mission can be found in a
  <em>
   Jurassic World
  </em>
  stage where players have to escort a gyroball through an area that they had already explored in a previous level. Players have to keep enemies away from the ball and stay close to it to make it move, but touching the ball knocks players down. This will happen a dozen times or so by the time players reach the end of the level. Combine this with the extreme lag that the
  <em>
   Jurassic World
  </em>
  levels seem to suffer from, and players will have no desire to replay them.

  Unfortunately, unlocking
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's secret characters and levels often means replaying already-completed stages, which only exacerbates the game's repetitiveness. Taking a page out of the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  game playbook, players are encouraged to replay levels using different characters with unique abilities that can then be used to solve puzzles that were impossible to complete on an initial playthrough. In theory, this would give
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  a great deal of replay value, but since the levels are already so miserable to play, the thought of replaying them leaves one with a deep sense of dread.

 <p>
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's biggest problems are on full display in its atrocious boss fights. Like its levels,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  boss fights are repetitive, buggy, and often take way too long. Many of the bosses rely on a ground-pound attack that sends a shockwave out for players to jump over, and in most cases, killing them is a matter of shooting weak points or tediously filling a pipe with purple goo. The bosses are annoying because it often takes too long for them to expose themselves to damage, and even then, it takes so long to kill some of them that players will begin to question if the game is bugged.

 <p>
  But while
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's boss fights are terrible, 10:10 Games has, to its credit, already made some big improvements compared to how they were when the game first launched. The latest
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  update has re-balanced some boss fights to make them more tolerable, mainly by doing away with the constantly respawning enemies. Prior to the update,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  players not only had to deal with the boss, but in some cases, an endless barrage of enemies that made it difficult to focus on the fight itself. These enemies would often interrupt drinking animations, too, which made healing or activating buffs far more frustrating than need be. Post-update,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's boss battles are definitely improved, though their core design is still lacking.

 <p>
  The final boss fights at the end of
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  worlds conclude with kaiju-like battles where players don't really participate and instead watch the action unfold, which is anti-climatic, to say the least. The stories being told in each world also suffer from a lack of proper pay-off, with
  <em>
   The Umbrella Academy
  </em>
  world being one of the worst offenders. Its first two missions tell the story of Season 1, but Season 2 is mostly skipped, and then the final couple of levels take place in Season 3. It's impossible to follow or care about.
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  tries to mimic the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  games' slapstick way of retelling stories, but it's a poor imitation.

 <p>
  From its unfunny cutscenes to its general concept,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  often comes across as an off-brand
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  game. It tries to replicate things like the fun of smashing every object in sight, but delivers something way less satisfying because most of the objects players can hit don't even break. Most of the time they bounce, spin, and shoot out little orbs that serve as
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's currency. Players can use said money on machines spread throughout the levels to get healing items and weapons, as well as generate important objects that are required to get through any given stage. I think this is supposed to be
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  's equivalent of the buildable objects in the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  games, but like the other ways
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  tries to copy the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  games, it doesn't generate the same excitement.

 <p>
  A defining feature of the
  <em>
   LEGO
  </em>
  games is co-op support. Predictably,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  confirmed co-op long ago, but it's not available in the game as of the time of this writing.
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  is getting online co-op in October, but to have such a major feature unavailable at launch is truly a head-scratching decision. Anyone interested in playing through
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  will have already done so by the time co-op is in the game, and the levels are not nearly fun enough to justify playing through them again with a friend.

 <p>
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  fumbles its interesting concept with bottom-of-the-barrel gameplay, and it's hard to see how co-op could make it any more tolerable. That being said, the game's latest balance update
  <em>
   has
  </em>
  made it at least a little better, and so perhaps future updates will make a bigger difference than expected.

  </strong>
  cycle, players are bound to play hundreds of matches in all of the game modes on offer. Like all sports games, keeping track of wins and losses in Career Mode or Ultimate Team is a surefire way of seeing how players are performing on the virtual pitch.

  The process of checking stats in Career Mode is slightly different to Ultimate Team. Ultimately, players still get their hands on the information needed to see if they're staring in the face of

 <p>
  All three options to check stats in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  are extremely similar. Once players get the hang of the shortcuts, finding up-to-date win, draw, and loss info only takes a few minutes, giving fans maximum time on the pitch and minimal time scrolling through menus.

 <p>
  Taking a look at stats in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  is an ideal way of comparing the performances of friends in Ultimate Team in addition to Career Mode as well. Some may prefer to look at them, while others might want to avoid them if they're on a poor run of form.

  Laws are a cornerstone of governance in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  , shaping the direction of your city and influencing the lives of its citizens. Much like in the first game, you'll frequently face decisions about approving or rejecting laws. If you want society to prosper, you need to propose and approve the right laws.

  All laws are determined by a vote among delegates from various Factions in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  . To effectively manage your city, you'll need to balance competing Faction agendas and skillfully negotiate with your opposition to secure votes. This guide will walk you through the intricacies of approving and negotiating laws in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  .

  First things first, you need to build the
  <strong>
   Council Hall
  </strong>
  in the
  <strong>
   Central District.
  </strong>
  You’ll unlock the Council and become familiar with the game’s lawmaking mechanics early in Chapter 1 in Story Mode, when the Council first debates whether you should stay Captain or not.

 <p>
  After the initial
  <strong>
   Vote of Confidence
  </strong>
  , you'll have the opportunity to propose and vote on future laws. For a law to pass, it must get enough votes in the Council. In
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  , you can
  <strong>
   propose new laws every 10 weeks
  </strong>
  . To gain approval, you'll need to
  <strong>
   secure at least 51 votes
  </strong>
  from the delegates.

     For certain laws, such as those in the Rule category, a

     is necessary to approve them.

 <p>
  You can propose laws from four categories:
  <strong>
   City, Society, Survival, and Rule.
  </strong>
  Once you choose the category, you’ll have to
  <strong>
   select at least two topics
  </strong>
  on which you want to pass a law. Next, click on
  <strong>
   Propose
  </strong>
  , and your proposed law will be presented to the Council of Delegates for their consideration. They can either approve or reject your bill.

 <p>
  Each law comes with a progress bar that indicates the chances of your law getting passed. The delegates may either be in favor of or against the law, or undecided and hesitant about voting. To increase your chances of getting the law approved, you can
  <strong>
   vote for the bill yourself
  </strong>
  by tapping on the

  button.

  If you don’t have enough votes to pass a law, you’ll have to negotiate with the different Factions in the Council. Click on the
  <strong>
   Negotiate
  </strong>
  button and focus on factions with a high number of people who are "mostly hesitant" about the law. These delegates are more likely to be swayed through negotiation. You don’t need to convince everybody to vote, just get enough votes to pass the law.

 <p>
  Some Factions aren’t up for negotiation at all, but those open to negotiation will have specific demands that must be met to secure their votes. Thankfully, you only have to
  <strong>
   choose one demand
  </strong>
  from their list. Your promises can influence hesitant delegates within a faction to support your law, and even sway those initially opposed.

  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  are two of gaming's most highly anticipated releases, both breathing new life into their respective, long-dormant franchises. Fundamentally, the games are extremely different, but both
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  make one similar narrative decision that could have a positive impact on both titles.

  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  is famous for its triple-protagonist structure, moving away from the traditional, solo hero formula that the series had been known for up until that point. But with
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , it looks like Rockstar is taking a slight step back, with only two protagonists, who appear to be a couple. For
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's part, it is also scaling back its cast of primary characters, featuring only seven companions in comparison to the ten of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Origins
  </em>
  and the nine of
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  . For both games, this truncation of the main cast may result in a more focused, well-tuned story.

     's male protagonist, referred to as Jason by the fanbase, is assumed to be on equal narrative footing as Lucia, the primary protagonist, because of leaks, rumors, and other various clues. The full extent of his involvement in the story has not been touched on by Rockstar in an official capacity.

  The Benefits of a Smaller Dragon Age Cast
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  will introduce new characters alongside some familiar faces, as is the series' custom. With new, important characters joining the roster, it will be good for the game to give them extra breathing room, which would be harder to swing with a larger party. Many gaming companies seem to make an assumption that bigger is always better, often feeling the need to up the ante and provide more content, across every category, for a new entry in a given series. But this can sometimes lead to a loss of focus, making the overall experience less impactful.

 <p>
  A good example of this would be the controversial
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   RE6
  </em>
  has the most playable characters of any single-player
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  game, and the result is a story that is stretched far too thin to be properly impactful or entertaining. For a franchise like
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , which thrives on the backs of its charming, likable characters, this is a fatal flaw. The
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series is in a similar position, as its many side characters comprise the heart of the games' narratives. With a slightly smaller cast this time around,
  <em>
   Veilguard
  </em>
  has a better chance of honing in on each character, rather than casting too wide a net.

 <p>
  It looks like
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  will be heavily focused on Jason and Lucia's relationship, which will lend a sense of romance and intimacy that is rarely seen in the series. In fact, relationship dynamics are almost never the main focus of any game, as they are usually relegated to side missions or sub-plots. By cutting down its protagonists to just two,
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is positioned to tell a unique and emotionally resonant story by keying into subject matter that is underexplored in gaming.

 <p>
  This is an advantage that it has over its predecessors, mainly
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  , whose trifecta of heroes made for an interesting story, but one that was slightly unfocused. A character like Trevor, for instance, is relegated to the position of an underdeveloped wildcard by virtue of the main group's dynamics. But with just two main characters,
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  could separate itself from
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  through a more intricate story of love and interpersonal relationships, free from the excess that can accompany games with larger casts.

      <title>Mortal Kombat Creator Shares Who He Thinks Deserves the Spin-Off Spotlight</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Mortal Kombat
   </strong>
  </em>
  creative director and co-creator Ed Boon has shared his thoughts on potential protagonists in a hypothetical spin-off title of the long-running franchise. Ed Boon often engages with fans online, usually sharing stories about how the series came to be, potential developments, or sometimes tease fans with cryptic hints about
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  or other NetherRealm Studios projects. Ed Boon recently commented on which characters he believes would receive the spotlight in a brand-new spin-off game, if NRS ever developed one.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  has traditionally been a 2D fighting game series, the franchise has branched out of the fighting game space a couple of times. The most notable of these spin-offs looked to expand upon the series' lore, steering away from a fighting game to single-player action adventure titles. While games like
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Special Forces
  </em>
  were critically panned for being poor translations of the
  <em>
   MK
  </em>
  formula to an action game, fans praised
  <em>
   Shaolin Monks
  </em>
  for being an excellent template of what the series could be if it was a co-op multiplayer action brawler. However, the series hasn't had a spin-off like that in quite a long time, and fans are hoping that NetherRealm could revisit the idea.

  A recent tweet by Jim's Retro Emporium asked fans which
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  duo deserves their own
  <em>
   Shaolin Monks
  </em>
  -styled spin-off game, listing off four of the most iconic pairs: Sonya Blade and Jax, Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Raiden and Fujin, and finally Kitana and Mileena, though there are plenty more other options that fans commented. Ed Boon directly commented on his pick regarding the protagonists of a potential successor to
  <em>
   Shaolin Monks:
  </em>
  the iconic rival duo of Scorpion and Sub-Zero. "Without a doubt, if (when?) we do one, it will be Scorpion and Sub-Zero," replied Boon on Twitter.

 <p>
  This wouldn't be a surprising choice, considering how Scorpion and Sub-Zero are the mascots of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  , but some longtime fans may also recall the canceled
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat: Fire &amp; Ice
  </em>
  , which was going to be a successor to
  <em>
   Shaolin Monks
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Fire and Ice
  </em>
  would have played like
  <em>
   Shaolin Monks
  </em>
  , but instead of Liu Kang and Kung Lao, Scorpion and Sub-Zero would have been in the leading roles. It appears Boon still wants to make that game happen, as evidenced by past comments regarding remasters or follow-ups to
  <em>
   Shaolin Monks
  </em>
  .

  As much as fans would likely love a

  follow-up, NetherRealm Studios is currently focused on post-launch support for

  A recent leak from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  could potentially be teasing the first in-game character skin for the sci-fi RPG, featuring five-star character Kafka. The massively popular RPG from HoYoverse has featured plenty of characters throughout the game's lifespan that have quickly become fan favorites, both for their gameplay and their in-game personality. Characters like Kafka, Ruan Mei, and the recently released Firefly have quickly endeared themselves to the game's community, often being among the highest-selling gacha banners. However, one aspect of character customization has yet to be fully introduced to
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Rumors have swirled about the potential addition of character skins to
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  since shortly after the game's April 2023 release. Starter character March 7th was among the first rumors surrounding character skins, with leaks and rumors teasing a skin for the character that never saw a full release. Multiple
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  characters have also seen entirely new alternate versions, including both Dan Heng Imbibitor Lunae and the upcoming March 7th Hunt variant. Now, however, the addition of skins to
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  is once again being teased.

 <p>
  A new update shared by prominent HoYoverse leaker HomDGCat is teasing the addition of a Kafka skin within
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . According to the leak, testers in the beta for
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's Version 2.4 update discovered a placeholder file assigning a name to Kafka's default skin. The unexpected change would signal that HoYoverse is planning to give Kafka a new skin in the game, implementing a way to differentiate between the two skins in the files. The post also suggests that the Kafka skin will likely not be released before Version 2.5.

  A Kafka skin being added to

  </em>
  in Version 2.5 would follow in the footsteps of both of its major HoYoverse predecessors.

  features several skins available for players to pick up, both as free rewards for the HoYoverse RPG's in-game events and through

  <em>

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's first skin heavily rumored for Version 2.5, the HoYoverse RPG is looking to bring players back to a previous world with its coming updates. Version 2.4 will see players return to the Xianzhou Luofu, with Jiaoqiu and Yunli featured as the world's two newest five-star characters. Leaks have also suggested that players will spend multiple updates in the Xianzhou Luofu, hinting at several patches worth of new characters planned. A potential Kafka skin in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  would surely excite plenty of fans, as well as entice new players to pick up the character.

  While it's a great way to earn money early on, many players let Foraging fall by the wayside once their crops start to make a lot of profit. However, with a little effort, players can still make heaps of gold from what the valley has to offer. Here are a few tips for

  Learning to live off the land and exist in harmony with nature is essential in this game, and foraging is a big part of the
  <em>

  lifestyle. Growing crops is central to the gameplay, but collecting what the valley already has to offer is an important skill, especially in the early game. For players hoping to gain mastery in Foraging, the tips below should be a step in the right direction.

  Foraging can be a tricky skill to level at first, largely because certain actions that would seem to grant EXP do not. Tillng for Ginger on Ginger Island and digging up Snow Yams or Winter Roots are great ways to forage for items; however, they don't raise the skill.

 <p>
  Picking up foraged items from the ground — including those grown from Wild Seeds — will raise Foraging, as will harvesting spring onions, picking berries, and collecting Truffles dug up by pigs. However, the most efficient way to level this skill is by
  <strong>
   chopping wood
  </strong>
  . Fortunately, as this is an essential resource for crafting, the player will be doing this a lot, and it's impossible to have too much wood and hardwood on hand. When leveling up Foraging by cutting lumber, keep an eye out for mossy trees, as players will also collect XP for each Moss they pick up.

  As mentioned above, chopping wood is the fastest way to level up Foraging. Upgrading the axe decreases the number of times a player must strike a tree to chop it down, meaning that the player will gain more resources and EXP for less energy. It also allows the player to break large stumps and logs, which grant more Foraging EXP than anything else. To purchase each level of upgrade, the player will need to bring the following to Clint:

  As players chop wood, they will inevitably find themselves in possession of a number of Maple Seeds, Acorns, Pine Cones, and Mahogany Seeds. In the early game, the first three can be used to craft
  <strong>
   Field Snacks,
  </strong>
  a reliable source of health and energy before the player has access to the kitchen. Once farmers are able to cook, they often come to view their tree seeds as useless. However, this is a mistake.

 <p>
  With Foraging Mastery, players get the crafting recipe for the Mystic Seed, which grows into the
  <strong>
   Mystic Tree.
  </strong>
  This recipe requires five of each type of tree seed. Once grown, players can then tap Mystic Trees to get Mystic Sap, which is used in some powerful crafting recipes.

  The Secret Woods, which can be found in the northwest corner of Cindersap Forest, contains six hardwood stumps that respawn each day. Returning every day to harvest these stumps will grant the player lots of XP towards their Foraging skill, not to mention 12 Hardwood per day — a resource that can be tricky to farm early in the game.

 <p>
  It's easy to forget that items picked up from the Beach provide the same amount of experience as picking up flowers, berries, and mushrooms. Foraging for shellfish and seaweed on the sandy shores still counts towards player experience. The items found laying on the beach are useful in several bundles and crafting recipes, particularly fertilizers.

 <p>
  It's always a good idea to head to the beach a couple of times a week, but be sure to dedicate some foraging time here between Summer 12-14. During this time, the color of the ocean will change, and huge amounts of forage — especially coral and sea urchins — will wash up onshore.

 <p>
  With this profession,
  <strong>
   all foraged items, including berries shaken from bushes, will always be of Iridium quality.
  </strong>
  This effect also applies to items the player picks up on the beach, such as coral, seaweed, and shellfish. This massively increases the amount of money players can earn by foraging, since Iridium-quality items are worth double the item's base price.

  To get this profession, choose the Gatherer option at level 5. This provides the possibility to collect two foraged items instead of just one. The Botanist option becomes available at level 10.

  Once the player's total earnings reach 25,000g, Demetrius visits the player and asks to use the farm's cave to attract research specimens. It turns out that these specimens are quite useful to a forager. Both the fruit and mushroom options for the cave provide their own benefits.

 <p>
  The mushroom cave grants Foraging EXP when its items are collected; however, these items are not affected by the Botanist profession. Still, some players like having a reliable source for relatively rare fungi. The fruit cave, while its items are more common, can provide high-quality items. Check the cave every other day to collect the items it provides.

  As the player levels up the Foraging skill, they'll unlock Wild Seed recipes for each season. These can be planted on the farm to grow even more forage items. Each harvest can then be used to craft even more seeds, resulting in dozens of wild flowers and fruits. The following recipes for Wild Seeds are obtained at the following Foraging skill levels:

  Each crafting recipe yields 10 seeds, which each have an equal chance to grow into any of the specific plants that went into crafting them. Wild Seeds come in handy early in the game, before the player has money to spend on vast amounts of seeds. It's also a great way to earn money during the barren winter season, during which the player can't grow normal crops.

  Building relationships is a core mechanic in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , and even Pelican Town's children prove to be valuable friends. Once the player reaches eight hearts with Vincent and Jas, enter the woods before 5pm on a sunny spring day.

  A short scene will play in which Jas and Vincent teach the player how to clean the spring onions that grow in the southeastern area of the forest. After this cutscene, the player receives the permanent buff
  <strong>
   Spring Onion Mastery
  </strong>
  , which increases the value of spring onions five times over.

  This hidden tip lies in Secret Note #23. Through the strange grammar and spelling of this message, players can make out a request to c
  <strong>
   ome to the Secret Woods with a jug of maple syrup.
  </strong>
  If they do so, they'll find a bear waiting for them, eager for the treat.

  After guzzling the syrup, the player's new animal friend teaches them some forest secrets, permanently increasing the sell price of blackberries and salmonberries to triple their base value. Like Spring Onion Mastery, this is a permanent foraging buff.

  Throughout Cindersap Forest, the Mountains, and Pelican Town, the player can find bushes that bear fruit in certain seasons. Salmonberries grow from Spring 15-18; from Fall 8-11, players can find Blackberries. These offer only a minor increase to the Foraging skill, at 1XP per berry. However, with all the berries available, it's easy for this to add up. As players increase their Foraging level, a higher skill means more berries shaken from each bush:

  With a little dedication, the player can collect hundreds of these wild berries. With the Botanist profession, these are worth a considerable amount on their own, especially if the player has the Bear's Knowledge buff. Players can also turn them into jelly or wine, highly profitable with the Artisan profession. With the 1.6 update, they are also excellent candidates for use in the Food Dehydrator, especially since players can get so many of them.

   Magnetism
  </strong>
  ensures the player doesn't leave behind any berries or pieces of wood, and can be achieved with Bean Hotpot or Crispy Bass.
  <strong>
   Speed

  is always a handy effect — a few cups of coffee can help the player cover more ground as they search for foraged items, especially when trying to find all the berry bushes.

  Plenty of foraged items make great gifts for several of the townsfolk. For example, Haley and Sam love coconuts and cactus fruit respectively, which can both be foraged in Calico Desert. Harvey, Leah, and Linus also like a lot of foraged items such as mushrooms.

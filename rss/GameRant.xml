  quickly gives players the ability to name the protagonist after seeing the opening cutscene and the short trip through Iwatodai to the dorms. The name you choose to give him will be seen throughout the game, and can't be changed later during a regular playthrough with your current settings outside of starting a new playthrough.

  While the name will be seen fairly often, it won't change any gameplay mechanics, though it's also done very early into the game if you want to start over and change it before getting further into the game. While there is a lot of freedom to name the protagonist whatever you want, many players may want to use his canon name; here's which one is correct.

 <p>
  There are two debated canon names for the
  <em>
   Persona 3
  </em>
  Protagonist: Makoto Yuki and Minato Arisato. While both names have some legitimacy to them,
  <strong>
   Makoto Yuki is the true canon name
  </strong>
  . This is found by starting a playthrough and changing the language of the game, which will prompt a message defaulting the protagonist's name to Makoto Yuki. This is also the name he is called during
  <em>
   Persona 3 Dancing In Moonlight
  </em>
  , which was developed by the same people who made the original game.
 </p>

 <p>
  Makoto Yuki is also the name used for the Protagonist during the anime movie adaptations of the original game.
  <strong>
   Minato Arisato is also a viable name though it only appears in the manga adaptation
  </strong>
  , which for the most part adapts the story exactly as is but with a few minor tweaks. The manga is also not directly handled by
  <em>
   Atlus
  </em>
  , giving more weight to the other name over Minato.

 <p>
  Overall, no the protagonist's name does not matter, and it won't alter your experience anyway, based on what name you choose. Players are incentivized to use their own name and treat the protagonist as more of a self-insert character since he often has few lines of dialogue outside of the ones you can control. During cutscenes or voiced dialogue, the protagonist will
  <strong>
   often be referred to as "this guy" or "leader" when in Tartarus
  </strong>
  , as there is no voice acting for any of the names that you choose.

      <title>10 Best Snow Biomes In Open-World Games</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-open-world-games-snow-biomes/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  A biome is a region which has a specific climate, be it hot or cold, sandy or icy. They are different from locations with seasonal gameplay as the landscapes do not change; it does not need to be winter for a snow biome to be snowy, as it does not need to be summer for deserts to exist. Biomes can really enrich a game as the player gets to experience different,
  <strong>
   visually stunning environments
  </strong>
  , especially in open-world games.

  While beaches, deserts, jungles, and forests all have their own appeal, snow biomes are often revered as one of the most beautiful, and are especially cozy to play at wintertime. From exquisite white mountains to freezing icy plains, these are some of the
  <strong>
   best snow biomes in open-world games
  </strong>
  .

  The snow forest biome in
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  is not only visually immersive, but also enhances the gameplay. While abundant with wood, the snow significantly hinders players' survival by requiring more food consumption to combat the cold. This, alongside tough enemies such as frozen lumberjacks and wolves, makes for an intense, atmospheric experience.

  On this journey, players can encounter the "Sheerside Mountains", a cold mountain range to the northwest. These mountains are a stunning backdrop for the related Trials and collectibles (being home to multiple data points and a Black Box), offering some supremely scenic moments.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  is one of the most beloved Nintendo franchises, simultaneously being one of the best-selling game series of all time. After the success of
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild,
  </em>
  Nintendo continued to venture into the realm of open-world with
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom.

 <p>
  Players can traverse every corner of a diverse map, impressively with minimal loading screens, on a mission to find Zelda and save Hyrule. Hyrule has some wonderful snowy zones, notably Hebra - home to the snow-blanketed Rito Village, as well as an abundance of quests, shrines, and caves to investigate.

 <p>
  As a relatively slow-paced game, it is only fitting that the scenery in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  should be exquisite so that players can take in the beauty of the world between objectives. While a lot of the locations are snowless, from the bogs of Velen to the built-up city of Novigrad, Skellige embraces the weather.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1116} -->

 <p>
  A northern archipelago and mountainous region, it is no surprise that there is an abundance of chilly peaks to traverse. It is a truly relaxing experience to walk through the ranges as snow gently falls, especially when the sun is setting. Players should definitely take their time when exploring Skellige.

  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  is one of the open-world franchises that boasts an impressive number of games. One of the reasons that it has remained so popular is the ever-improving environmental designs and
  <em>
   Valhalla,
  </em>
  the twelfth installment, is no exception.

 <p>
  Focusing on the Viking-age,
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  embroils the player in England and Norway's political landscape amid the Brotherhood-Templar feud. Unfortunately, this involves a lot of bloodshed. Fortunately, it means players get to explore the stunning fjords and snowy mountains of Norway, maybe even witnessing the northern lights along the way.

  Those who have played
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  will be familiar with the long, laborious struggle through the snow at the beginning of the game before getting to the nitty-gritty gameplay; despite its beauty and iconic snow physics,
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  establishes an aversion to snow very early on.

  This being said, if players are willing to forgive this introduction, the snowy areas are well worth revisiting once players are left to their own devices. Ambarino is home to the Grizzlies, where numerous
  <strong>
   legendary animals
  </strong>
  can be found. It's also very peaceful when willingly sought out, offering a stunning break from the daily dramas of the Wild West.

  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  is set in the context of the Mongol's first invasion of Japan, with the player taking on the role of samurai Jin Sakai to protect Tsushima Island. Developers took inspiration from the real Tsushima Island,
  <em>
   Shadow of the Colossus, Zelda: Breath of the Wild,
  </em>
  and samurai cinema, resulting in a stunning world with distinct biomes that are each uniquely beautiful.

  To the north of the map is Kamiagata, a snow-covered region of chilly mountains and frosty forests. Although a stark contrast to the bright golds, reds, and greens of the rest of the map, Kamiagata marks the passing of time and Jin's development with an artistic flourish.

  One of the appeals of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is the diverse landscapes and assortment of cities, each with its own histories that fuel the world-building of the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  universe. Some of the most beautiful scenes in the game can be found in the snowy regions; Winterhold, Windhelm, and the Throat of the World to name a few.

 <p>
  These areas are not merely cosmetic, but are host to different ingredients and enemies that can't be found elsewhere, from snow bears to ice wraiths. Many players will fondly remember their first encounter with a frost troll on the way to High Hrothgar. Very few games can compete with the beautiful snow-touched wild landscapes of
  <em>
   Skyrim.

  </em>
  is the game that most will associate with the term "biome". As a sandbox game, the biome is essential when determining where to build or explore; players looking to build elaborate treehouse might prefer to find a woodland biome, whereas players looking to reach the End might favor caves.

  Jagged or frozen peaks and snowy plains are just a few of the colder regions in
  <em>
   Minecraft.
  </em>
  Despite the abundance of risks - namely lack of trees or food and hostile Strays - these biomes can be a visual delight. Snow settling on a base and polar bear visits make for some truly cozy moments.

      <title>8 Open-World Games With The Best Atmosphere, Ranked</title>

 <p>
  Open-world titles are some of the most compelling games on the shelves today, promising a host of experiences utterly unique to video games as a medium. Whether huge and sprawling worlds or intimately detailed, small-scale titles, open-worlds satiate the player's wanderlust and are at their best when every moment of exploration and navigation feels compelling and engaging, not like a chore or task.

  The most immersive open-world titles are thus the ones that receive the highest praise. Few things can be as engaging as the open worlds that truly let players lose themselves and explore a setting unlike anything else. Atmosphere is key in an open-world title, and these games absolutely nail their respective atmospheres with grace.

  The world of the

  The fantastic visual design of this game is essential to its atmosphere. Each region of Tamriel, even within the same Kingdom, feels so unique and lived in. Players can find cultures and races realized in a way they could only dream of in the single-player titles, and traveling across Tamriel, doing quests, and slaying foes, has an amazing atmospheric feel to it unmatched by other open-world MMOs.

  A wholly unique setting, both by

  standards and for open worlds in general,
  <em>
   Far Cry Primal

  An idea that comes up frequently in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's world design is the Sublime. Romantic novelists (that's capital R Romantic, think Oscar Wilde, not Colleen Hoover) used the Sublime as a way to capture the unique, very powerful feelings of awe that nature could inspire within people.

 <p>
  Nature can make people feel small. Looking out over huge mountainous landscapes can grant a poignant sense of perspective. Few open-world games have managed to capture this feeling of the Sublime, beauty, and mild bittersweetness mingled together, like the atmosphere of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2

  A legendary open-world title that is still inspiring games today,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind
  </em>
  enthralls players with its atmosphere. Even with graphics that are over 20 years old, no game has managed to make the player feel as alien or foreign as
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  With the soft and wistful exploration music, the alien landscape, and the quiet threat of danger around every corner,
  <em>
   Morrowind

  is a somewhat ironic testament to the fact that million-dollar graphics and engines can't compete with strong worldbuilding and world design.

 <p>
  An
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has designed an impressive bundle for Venture that turns the Damage hero into a mole. Venture is a mole-like
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  hero with abilities that revolve around their drill weapon, and this bundle takes things further by turning them into a shrew.

 <p>
  As Blizzard has expanded on the foundations of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , new heroes, maps, and game modes have been added. Venture was introduced with the release of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 10 alongside the Hanaoka map, Clash game mode, and the limited-time Mirrorwatch event. Since their addition to the roster, Venture has become a fan-favorite character primarily thanks to the innovative gameplay they offer. As Venture isn't a launch hero, their cosmetic options are limited compared to characters like Genji, Mercy, and Torbjorn. One gamer has an idea to rectify this with their concept of a mole-themed bundle for the Damage hero.

 <p>
  Artist Epic Edster recently shared their concept of a mole-themed bundle for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  hero Venture. The impressive concept includes a skin shown from the front and back, an Icon, a Name Card, a Spray, and special voice lines. Unlike the dialogue that players can equip, these voice lines are reserved specifically for Juno interactions, standard respawns, and respawns after being eliminated by
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's Echo, Juno, Pharah, or Mercy. The skin places Venture in what appears to be a patched mole onesie, with a bow at the collar and atop their boots, and a mole and beetle backpack with a shovel.

 <p>
  The Venture Name Card shows a chibi version of the costumed hero hidden among three moles, while the Icon seems to focus on one individual shrew. The Spray shows the mole-like Venture emerging from the ground and saying "hiya!" The shape of Venture's weapon is impressively replicated by a mole-like weapon which features the creature's nose and claws as the drill. Although some details are specified, it's unclear what rarity this Mole skin for the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Damage hero would be. Given the detail, it would likely be Epic rarity or higher if it was released as an official skin. Many gamers have expressed enthusiasm for the bundle idea, but one highlighted a missed opportunity to offer more colors.

 <p>
  Given Venture's similarities to moles, this may be a fitting outfit for the Damage hero. It's unlikely that Blizzard would copy the concept, but it may be inspired by it. Other options may include earthworms, termites, groundhogs, or even burrowing owls. As Blizzard continues to update
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , Venture will likely get many more cosmetics through Shop and Battle Pass offerings.

  While
  <em>
   Phantom Parade
  </em>
  doesn’t have the most realistic or cutting-edge graphics compared to recent AAA mobile games, its commitment to the anime’s spirit and its strategic use of visual effects make battles immersive and engaging. The game successfully creates an interactive visual novel, allowing players to step into the roles of beloved
  <em>
   Jujutsu Kaisen
  </em>
  characters like Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki, and Satoru Gojo.

  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is one of the biggest gaming franchises of all time, and it's easy to see why so many people love engaging in tight multiplayer matches online as they try to improve their K/D ratio and attain victory at all costs. It was only a matter of time before this franchise would branch out to mobiles, with
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Mobile

  making this transition in a pretty smooth and effective manner.

  Coming with its fair share of iconic maps and the classic
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  action that fans have grown to love about this series, the game is a blast to play through from start to end. Perhaps the best thing about
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Mobile
  </em>
  is just how good it looks, with the game doing a great job of pushing mobile hardware to its very limits with cutting-edge graphics that seemed unthinkable on phones for the longest time. It's one of the most popular mobile games around now and continues to be downloaded to kingdom come even now.

  <em>
   Shadowgun
  </em>
  is a popular shooter game on mobile phones that has become pretty massive in its own right. The aesthetic of the title feels a lot like
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  with a unique spin of its own, and fans love the many ways they can tackle the missions in this game.

 <p>
  Of course, the multiplayer component is the biggest aspect of this game and a huge reason why
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  is so popular in the first place. The graphics of this title are truly incredible and look amazing even with the game being five years old at this point.

  HoYoverse’s
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  stands out among recent mobile games for a key reason: it avoids the typical copycat strategies. While the game is undeniably visually appealing, its charm goes beyond flashy graphics or detailed characters and locations.
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  crafts a distinct atmosphere inspired by early 2000s aesthetics, blending retro-futuristic cinematography with engaging visual storytelling.

 <p>
  Another standout feature is its accessibility. Unlike many high-end mobile games,
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  is not overly demanding on hardware. It runs smoothly on most mid-range phones and requires minimal storage space. Players have seen the pitfalls of treating mobile games like console titles—stunning graphics at the cost of endless performance issues.
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  sidesteps this problem, offering a polished, visually striking experience without turning your phone into a makeshift cooling experiment.

  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  is a game that got a ton of promotion courtesy of IGN's notorious plagiarism controversy, so it's great that the game itself is a blast to play through in its own right. The game combines elements of roguelike, Metroidvania, and Soulslike gameplay to make for a delectable and engaging combination.

  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  is available on mobile platforms and looks gorgeous courtesy of its unique art style. It's recommended to use a controller since precise input is downright necessary to get through this tough-as-nails experience. Players who are patient and slowly learn how the game works will be mowing through enemies in no time at all.

  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has been throned as the most successful gacha game for many years now. However,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  has become the closest title to threaten
  <em>
   Genshin
  </em>
  ’s throne in quite a long time. Not only has this new gacha been an immense financial success for its developers, but it has also managed to match up to
  <em>
   Genshin
  </em>
  ’s high visual standards.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The game’s lively open world map with secrets and interesting creatures lurking everywhere has been a major reason for its visual appeal. But the decision to make character designs as unique as possible (without following in the footsteps of games like Genshin) has also made
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  one of the best mobile games with top-notch visuals.

  Exploring the universe of
  <em>
   AFK Journey
  </em>
  in its isometric view proves that Lilith Games has done an excellent job of bringing the world to life. Players are likely to forget that the game is actually a gacha RPG title, and might treat it like a mini-scale open-world adventure game. Despite
  <em>
   AFK Journey
  </em>
  ’s map being huge for a mobile game, there are fascinating visual details in every corner, encouraging the player to check them out—even if no reward or secret is guaranteed.

 <p>
  Another strong point in
  <em>
   AFK Journey
  </em>
  ’s visuals is how the game treats character designs and cutscenes. All Heroes look incredibly sharp and well-drawn, and the professionally rendered 3D cutscenes that they participate in only add to their appeal.

  Part of
  <em>
   Solo Leveling
  </em>
  ’s webtoon success was certainly due to its appealing character designs. Now,
  <em>
   Solo Leveling: Arise
  </em>
  , the video game adaptation of the titular webtoon, has managed to surpass these visual standards by creating an immersive world of handsome and attractive Hunters. On top of the incredible character designs, Arise also excels at recreating iconic scenes and settings from the
  <em>
   Solo Leveling
  </em>
  webtoon and anime.

 <p>
  Of course, besides helping fans relive iconic moments of the series,
  <em>
   Solo Leveling: Arise
  </em>
  also manages to keep the combat as visually appealing as possible. The fast-paced battles make the player feel like a true Hunter straight out of anime who can defeat monsters gloriously.

 <p>
  With the success of TPS multiplayer games on mobile, the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  franchise decided to venture into the genre with a rather ambitious project:
  <em>
   Star Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  . If it were a couple of years ago, most players would have a hard time believing that
  <em>
   Hunters
  </em>
  is indeed playable on smartphones. But thanks to games like
  <em>
   Warzone Mobile
  </em>
  , Hunters is now an industry standard for many players.

 <p>
  Regardless,
  <em>
   Stars Wars: Hunters
  </em>
  does an incredible job of bringing console-level graphics to smartphones without overheating them. One aspect that
  <em>
   Hunters
  </em>
  shine in is weapon design. The devs have managed to keep all weapon designs creative while creating a nostalgic vibe every
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  fan would appreciate.

  <em>
   Life is Strange

 <p>
  Given the importance of every decision in

  <em>
   Telltale's The Walking Dead
  </em>
  is a title that not many people would think of when it comes to graphical fidelity. However, a game's visuals are dependent on the art style as well, and The Walking Dead's cel-shaded look helps it look amazing even now.

 <p>
  The story of Lee and Clementine as they struggle to survive in a world overrun by zombies is a riveting tale with an emotional conclusion. Players will find all the decisions in the game to be particularly nerve-wracking, which makes sense given the chilling setting of this title.

  <em>

  <em>

  is a game that pretty much everyone has heard of by now. This free-to-play battle royale has become all the rage, with its high-profile collaborations and intense gameplay turning it into one of the biggest multiplayer games around.

  It seems that most racing games on mobile platforms really push the bar when it comes to visuals in video games. This can be seen in the
  <em>
   Asphalt
  </em>
  series, which is easily one of the most popular arcade racers on mobile.

  Anyone who has played

  can confirm it is a PC/Console game. So the sheer fact that gamers can enjoy this on handheld devices like iPhone and Android phones is quite unbelievable. Not only does
  <em>

  The quality of this game is unparalleled to many other racing games on mobiles, which is what makes it stand apart. The best handheld version of

  This Epic Modern FPS for mobile devices is one of the best-looking games players can enjoy right now. From the outside,
  <em>
   Battle Prime
  </em>
  looks similar to
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  . After all, it offers similar gameplay mechanics, maps, and multiplayer modes.

 <p>
  However, the third-person perspective and extremely fluid animations are better than many mobile shooter games.
  <em>
   Battle Prime
  </em>
  has a colorful, bright, but unmemorable style. However, that doesn't mean it looks bad. This game takes the cake when it comes to visual variety and environments.
  <em>
   Battle Prime
  </em>
  offers snowy areas, urban jungles, deep forests, and desert maps.

  Layers of Fear is a pretty decent Psychological horror single-player game on major platforms. However, on mobiles, it has an edge unlike any. Most gamers would know that it is not easy to find a good horror game on Android or iOS, which is the gap
  <em>
   Layers of Fear
  </em>
  fills.

 <p>
  The mobile version offers a similar experience to the main game, with predictable graphical downgrades. However, even after being visually inferior to the Windows version,
  <em>
   Layers of Fear
  </em>
  manages to look excellent on mobiles. The best part about the game is its environment, which is extremely chilling due to how good it looks.

  Who would've thought that the cult-classic turn-based tactics game
  <em>
   XCOM
  </em>
  would make its way to mobiles? The
  <em>
   XCOM 2 Collection
  </em>
  is a console game made to work on mobiles and iPads. It has everything that makes the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows versions good, including but not limited to the graphics.

  The fans of the series know
  <em>
   XCOM 2 Collection
  </em>
  is one of the best turn-based tactics &amp; tactical role-playing games one can play. The fact that it is on mobile only makes it more accessible.
  <em>
   XCOM 2 Collection
  </em>
  can last up to 70+ hours of playtime, and for a $15 price, it is a steal.

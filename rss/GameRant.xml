      <title>The Best Local Co-Op &amp; Split-Screen Games You Can Play On Nintendo Switch</title>

  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  can adapt to most situations. While perhaps not the most powerful console ever, the system is the definition of flexible, and that goes beyond its hybrid selling point. The Switch library is incredibly robust, thoroughly covering pretty much every genre on the market. The same can be said for features, as the console has more than a few games designed around online multiplayer or
  <strong>
   local co-op
  </strong>
  . Even if it is no longer as popular as it was during the late '90s and early 2000s, couch gaming will always have a place in the industry.

  Due to the store having so many products (and clutter), it can be difficult to sift through the noise to find the diamonds in the rough. Consequently, this article will highlight the
  <strong>
   best couch co-op Switch games
  </strong>
  to try and simplify the process as much as possible.

   Nintendo Switch fans have a few new local co-op games at their fingertips. Lego Horizon Adventures is now available, and a 2023 RPG received a co-op update in November. Also, two major local co-op Switch games will launch in January 2025.

 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics
  </em>
  comes backed with some of the greatest fighting games of all time, all of which have been lovingly tweaked with new features that celebrate their legacy. As timeless as
  <em>
   Marvel vs. Capcom 2
  </em>
  is, it is not the focus of this discussion; no, the spotlight is squarely on
  <em>
   The Punisher
  </em>
  . Released in 1993 in arcades, Capcom's beat 'em up had grown quite obscure due to only receiving a single Genesis port, which was obviously a downgrade from the original version. Putting aside unofficial means, this cult classic was nearly impossible to experience legally for roughly three decades; however, that finally changed in 2024.

 <p>
  Admittedly,
  <em>
   The Punisher
  </em>
  feels slightly out of place in a compilation with "Fighting" in the title, but it is nevertheless a great bonus. Viewed through a modern lens, this beat 'em up can seem fairly typical, especially since it mostly plays like an evolution of Capcom's earlier entries in the genre. However,
  <em>
   The Punisher
  </em>
  's focus on weaponry was pretty novel for its era, and this system would go on to be replicated and (arguably) improved in 1994's
  <em>
   Alien vs. Predator
  </em>
  . Even nowadays, the gameplay and animation are still impressive, and the action improves when co-op is activated. Players can pick between Frank Castle and Nick Fury, although they control the same.

  While not the best
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  co-op game on the Nintendo Switch,
  <em>
   Splintered Fate
  </em>
  is nevertheless a decent option, particularly for groups fond of isometric hack-and-slash roguelikes. With flashy combos, fun playable characters who are all quite different, and a fairly steep difficulty curve, this project has quite a lot of replay value.

 <p>
  Solo players will get a lot of mileage out of trying to master the four Turtles, and they will need to do so since
  <em>
   Splintered Fate
  </em>
  does not hold its punches back. As with most roguelikes, repetition is the name of the game here, which does start to take its toll after a while. Fortunately, co-op can help in this regard.

  <em>
   WarioWare
  </em>
  is dependable. Sure, the franchise will probably never sit among Nintendo's most popular or mainstream productions, but not every game needs to be
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros.
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  . Sometimes, nothing hits the spot like a few dozen silly microgames that are surprisingly creative despite lasting only a few seconds.
  <em>
   Move It!
  </em>
  is reminiscent of 2006's
  <em>
   Smooth Moves
  </em>
  , almost to the point of being an exercise game rather than a conventional party game.

 <p>
  Crucially, the title leans very heavily into multiplayer, both co-op and competitive; in fact, it is quite light on single-player content, to the point of being difficult to unabashedly recommend to players who would like to focus only on solo sessions.
  <em>
   Move It!

  The third entry of Blizzard's famed dungeon-crawling epic is largely known for its addictive, robust online gameplay. Yet, the Switch version of this game makes for a streamlined way to enjoy
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  with three other players locally.

 <p>
  The game's convenient system of hotkeys and a palatable interface allows gamers to get the most out of the experience even amid chaotic four-player skirmishes with enemy hordes. A single-screen can be shared, but remote play – or a combination of TV and handheld play – is
  <em>
   also
  </em>
  available. And with such an expansive rendition – which includes the
  <em>
   Reaper of Souls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rise of the Necromancer
  </em>

  2013's
  <em>
   Risk of Rain
  </em>
  has been largely overshadowed by its 3D successor, but the first game is still a great and influential roguelike. 2023's
  <em>
   Returns
  </em>
  serves as both a 10-year celebration of the original project's debut and a revamp that irons out some of its rougher and more dated components. Nowadays,
  <em>
   Risk of Rain Returns
  </em>
  is arguably the best way to experience this seminal release, offering an addictive and challenging experience that can keep players engaged for potentially months on end.

  The remake pays quite a bit of attention to the multiplayer portion, and this is arguably the most improved area over the 2013 version. Online multiplayer is easy to set up and allows four people to participate together. While joining up with strangers is naturally an option,
  <em>
   Risk of Rain Returns
  </em>
  ' high difficulty and item sharing (or exclusivity, depending on the host's decision) demand a united front if players wish to get far in a playthrough. Couch co-op is also available, and it plays out largely the same as the online variant. As the action gets hectic quickly in single-player, co-op amplifies the chaos quite a bit; however, it is all part of the fun.

  Nintendo's pink, spherical mascot has shined since the SNES days when it comes to simultaneous couch co-op – and this charming rendition on Switch is no different. In a sense, the game takes on the feel of both
  <em>
   Kirby
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   New Super Mario Bros.
  </em>
  Up to four players can embark on this colorful adventure, which hovers somewhere in between a platformer and a party game.

  The game stresses the consumption of foes and the fusion of different powers and abilities. These attributes lend themselves to cooperative play, encouraging friends to work together and combine forces against the baddies, bosses, and puzzles in their path.

  Players looking for
  <strong>
   local multiplayer Nintendo Switch games
  </strong>
  with a horror twist have a couple of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  titles at their fingertips.
  <em>
   Revelations 2
  </em>
  is a great pick due to its co-op raid mode, which is a blast with friends; however, while two players can take on the campaign, one of them will feel like a passenger rather than a fully active participant.
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  has a fleshed-out co-op campaign, but the game itself tends to attract a fair amount of criticism. That said, fun can still be had with Capcom's title.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Ultimately, that leaves
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  , the first entry in the franchise to properly embrace co-op. The story mode supports two players, and they are both treated as equals in terms of gameplay. Even though it leans heavily into action, the 2009 release is still a polished and entertaining experience. The game's West African setting also sets it apart from most other action-horror projects on the market.

  The Nintendo Switch has a couple of Musou games that support co-op. While their quality varies to an extent, someone's preference is likely to come down to which license they feel most attached to.
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  fans should check out the
  <em>
   Warriors
  </em>
  sub-series, while
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  has a couple of decent entries. Koei Tecmo's
  <em>
   Samurai Warriors
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warriors Orochi
  </em>
  also have representatives on Nintendo's hybrid system.

 <p>
  Along with just screaming "Nintendo,"
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors
  </em>
  spin-offs are arguably the most impressive Muou games on the Switch, excluding
  <em>
   Persona 5 Strikers
  </em>
  since it does not support co-op.
  <em>
   Age of Calamity
  </em>
  gets the nod as it is a proper Switch project rather than a port of a Wii U release. Supporting split-screen, two players can take charge of Link, Zelda, and a host of other characters as they engage in a strange twist on the
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  mythos. While not free of the occasional stutter,
  <em>
   Age of Calamity
  </em>
  looks great and plays reasonably well.

  <em>
   Kingdom: Two Crowns
  </em>
  tasks players with developing a kingdom one pixel at a time. A beautiful indie RTS that largely resists the urge to hand-hold users, this Switch game comes with an initial learning curve, but it should not take new players too long to come to grips with its gameplay loop.

  Supporting local co-op, two friends can work together to usher in a new era of prosperity and growth, with each person using one Joy-Con to control their character. Unlike most local co-op Switch games,
  <em>
   Kingdom Two Crowns
  </em>
  does not tether players to each other, allowing them to do their own thing. At times, it can feel like they are sharing the world rather than specifically working together, although they will eventually have to co-exist (or not).

  Nintendo Switch owners have a few
  <em>
   Trine
  </em>
  games at their fingertips, and an argument could be made that
  <em>
   Trine 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  are the picks of the bunch. However,
  <em>
   Trine 5
  </em>
  is a very solid addition to the franchise and also the most recent project. Three adventurers who conveniently fit into fantasy archetypes find themselves having to go on another quest, this time to stop a power-hungry villain called Lady Sunny. As far as stories go,
  <em>
   Trine 5
  </em>
  does not try to be anything more than just passable, but it succeeds in reaching that standard. The game is entirely about its puzzles, and they are consistently engaging and creative.

  Solo runners have the option to swap between any of the characters at once, allowing them to use their unique skills to carefully work their way through each puzzling scenario. Meanwhile, co-op players can also pick any of the characters, so they won't be forced to commit to one class; as such, there could be four clones on the screen at any given time.
  <em>
   Trine 5
  </em>
  is a better overall experience in co-op.

  Originally released in 2013,
  <em>
   Rayman Legends
  </em>
  was one of its decade's best platformers. Featuring colorful visuals, creative levels, tight and fast-paced gameplay, and an awesome soundtrack, the game scores a homerun in nearly every area, and it is an easy recommendation for those seeking an engaging single-player package on the Switch. Even if it is not the definitive way to experience the campaign, Ubisoft's project also supports co-op, allowing up to 4 players to take on the roles of Rayman and his friends.

 <p>
  <em>
   Rayman Legends
  </em>
  ' co-op does not change all that much in the grand scheme of things, as it basically amounts to the group running through the standard levels as solo players (albeit with the introduction of a mechanic that allows someone to save their downed partners). However, the core gameplay loop is so strong that it applies seamlessly to co-op. Ubisoft needs to develop a new

  <em>
   Pico Park
  </em>
  is a small release that does not have that much of a presence, but if some friends are looking for a cute but challenging puzzle game, this project should be able to scratch that itch. The levels are generally quite simple, but they vary their mechanics just enough to ensure things do not get repetitive too quickly. The content is split into levels revolving around specific game styles, with each one being fairly different to allow players to pick and choose which activities best fit the group.

  Sometimes, nothing beats the classics. Despite debuting in 2024,
  <em>
   Contra: Operation Galuga
  </em>
  very much feels ripped from a bygone era, with the side-scrolling run and gunner largely striving to recapture the license's former glory while also implementing a handful of tweaks along with prettier visuals. This might not sound interesting on paper, but
  <em>
   Contra
  </em>
  games have been in short supply over the last two decades, and the franchise's previous decent entry came out in 2011. As such,
  <em>
   Operation Galuga
  </em>
  is a breath of fresh air that tastes nostalgic and sweet.

  While perfectly enjoyable solo, Wayforward's project shines far brighter in co-op, which allows up to four players to step into the shoes of the playable characters. The latter's basic actions are fairly similar, although they are complemented by unique abilities that grant them some individuality; as such, co-op won't feel like four clones are running around on the screen. In terms of content,
  <em>
   Operation Galuga
  </em>
  is both a sequel to the 1987 original and something of a rethread. The story blends classic reimagined stages with brand-new ones, creating a campaign that looks to the past but also does not completely ignore the present.

  An idyllic British village finds itself under siege by a feathered fiend determined to spread chaos with reckless abandon. And, just when the locals thought things could not get worse, the goose brings a friend along for the ride.
  <em>
   Untitled Goose Game

  is an absolute joy, particularly for those players who just want to mess around in a cute sandbox. The eponymous bird(s) slowly plow through the town's areas, ruining everyone's day in the process. Although they have a couple of objectives they need to complete, players are generally encouraged to experiment and do their own thing.

  <em>
   Snipperclips
  </em>
  is a charming puzzle game that feels tailor-made for the Nintendo Switch. Depending on the chosen mode, either up to 2 or 4 players need to work together to solve short but amusing puzzles. They control paper-esque characters who can have their designs changed, a process that requires coordination between the players. The puzzles largely fit on one screen and are self-contained, making them perfect for quick sessions.

  While accessible for all ages,
  <em>

  for parents searching for something to play with their kids.

  Despite persisting as a presence over the last two decades, Sega's
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball
  </em>
  's last 15 years were poor.
  <em>
   Banana Blitz HD
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Banana Mania
  </em>
  remastered or remade earlier entries, and neither of them was particularly great. The franchise was overdue a proper sequel that focused completely on recapturing the magic of the original two games, and
  <em>
   Banana Rumble
  </em>
  managed to accomplish just that and also offer a few modern touches.

  While the pre-release marketing emphasized the online multiplayer quite a bit, the 2024 Switch exclusive entry is, for the most part, a traditional
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball
  </em>
  experience. Players get to play through 100+ levels in
  <em>
   Banana Rumble
  </em>
  , tilting the screen to guide a ball-trapped monkey to the end point, picking bananas along the way. Simple as this concept sounds, all it takes is some slightly off controls to ruin the entire experience; thankfully,
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble
  </em>
  controls like a dream. And, the game gradually ramps up the difficulty, going from a relatively casual experience to a challenging puzzle-platformer that requires pinpoint accuracy.

  Along with PvP,
  <em>
   Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble
  </em>
  also includes local and online co-op, with both modes supporting up to four players. The gameplay loop sounds like a more natural fit for competitive rather than cooperative multiplayer, but the latter is implemented quite well, all things considered. Basically, players are charged with working through the same stage, with only one of them needing to complete it. While not interacting much within the level, players can coordinate their goals, ensuring they accomplish as much as possible as a unit.

  Sabotage's
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  garnered a largely positive reception when it launched in 2023. Like any project, the game received some criticism and, at times, threatened to be a victim of its own hype; however, at its core, this RPG is a loving throwback to the classics that still manages to find a fresh identity. More importantly, Sabotage has provided top-notch post-game support, beyond just announcing an expansion. Released in November 2024, the Dawn of Equinox update improved on quite a few elements, including revamping parts of the combat to provide a more satisfying and long-lasting experience.
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  ' vanilla version was and still is great, and the update simply improved on a winning formula.

 <p>
  Crucially, this release also introduced 3-player local co-op, a change that complements the story and gameplay surprisingly well.
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  ' co-op mode not only allows three players to share the screen at one go but also reflects the increased player count in things like the cutscenes. The update was well done and thorough, adding another dimension to the game that might inspire a replay from existing fans or encourage newcomers to finally give
  <em>
   Sea of Stars
  </em>
  a shot.

  <em>
   For the King

  is a good pick for solo players and a great one for a group of friends. As three adventurers, players explore a sizable randomly generated land to stop the approaching darkness, which naturally means completing the occasional puzzle, exploring dungeons, and fighting a lot of enemies.

  Popular streamer Adin Ross has recently hinted that he may have ended his association with
  <strong>
   Twitch
  </strong>
  rival Kick.com. Shortly after its launch, Stake-backed streaming platform Kick gained attention by signing several prominent content creators, aiming to challenge Twitch's dominance and grow its audience base.

 <p>
  Adin Ross joined Kick in February 2023, but just days later, he was permanently banned from Twitch. While the reason for the ban wasn’t initially clear, Twitch later explained that it was due to Ross allowing hateful and unfiltered chat behavior during one of his streams. Despite losing access to his 7 million followers on Twitch, the ban had little impact on Ross's career. Kick proved to be a strong alternative, where he not only found success but also became a vocal supporter of the platform, actively encouraging other prominent streamers to follow his lead and make the move from Twitch to Kick.

  Although renowned streamer Adin Ross is currently the second most-followed streamer on Kick with 1.4 million followers, recent posts have raised questions about his future on the platform. On Twitter, Ross teased a potential stream with UFC star Jon Jones, but left the platform for the event unclear, simply asking, "Whereeeeeee." A follow-up post on November 14 added to the uncertainty, as Ross admitted he wasn't sure when or where he would stream next. Despite these developments, nothing can be confirmed about Ross’s future on Kick at this time.

  In the comments, fans are guessing where Adin Ross might go next, with suggestions including Rumble, Twitch, and even Twitter. While it's still unclear whether Ross will leave Kick or which platform he might choose, his relationship with the Stake-backed platform appeared to be very strong previously. Last year, Kick’s CEO surprised Adin Ross with a lavish Rolls-Royce for his birthday, signaling a deep connection between the two.

  Should Ross confirm his departure, it would represent a significant shift for both his career and Kick’s place in the streaming world. Ross’s presence on the platform has been crucial in drawing attention and challenging Twitch’s dominance. For instance, a stream featuring an interview with a fake Kim Jong Un shattered Ross’s all-time viewership records, and his August 5 stream with Donald Trump was even more successful. Additionally, Adin Ross has repeatedly asked Twitch for a second chance, and it remains to be seen whether the platform will lift his ban.

   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a popular platform with over 40 million different games. While some of them offer a single-player experience, most are multiplayer. Often, this is to your advantage, since you can play with friends. But sometimes, you may want to play alone or without being disturbed by other players. So, this guide will tell you how to appear offline in
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  .

  At first glance, it may seem that this is easy to do, but in fact, it is the opposite. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  does not have a single button in the settings that would hide your activity.

  <em>

  Unlike Xbox, other devices require more complex actions from players. In simple terms, to appear offline in
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  on PC, mobile, or PlayStation,
  <strong>
   you must change all privacy settings to No One
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  It is worth noting that this is slightly different from the usual offline mode. In addition to the fact that other players and your friends will not see that you are online during the game, they will
  <strong>
   not even be able to chat, invite, or join you
  </strong>
  . So, this method is suitable only in cases where you want to completely fence yourself off from other players.

  At the beginning of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  players have the complete freedom to customize their own characters. You need to choose their Lineage, Playstyle, and Class to start your journey. Once everything is complete, players will get a notification that it’s possible to change their appearance later on in the game.

  After completing a few missions and exploring the world a little, you will stumble upon a mirror that will help them customize Rook. The process is not difficult or time-consuming as you will get introduced to the feature quite early on in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . However, keep in mind that not everything can be changed even if you gain access to the Mirror of Transformation.

  There is also the Finalize category, which allows players to change Rook’s name, Voice, and Pitch. Other options like Lineage, Class, Faction, and Playstyle are impossible to change unless you start a new game. For example, if you already chose an Elf that’s a Mage and has a talent for Necromancy, you can’t change it anymore.

  donuts have been introduced as limited collaborations just about every year, with series favorites like Pikachu, Psyduck, and Jigglypuff getting the donut treatment over the years.

  This year, Mister Donut and

  have revealed the latest collaboration, introducing a pair of Pikachu themed-donuts, Diglett-themed donuts, and a Pokeball donut. Per Siliconera, the varieties vary in price from roughly $1.44 to $2.12 USD. The Pikachu donut is shaped like PIkachu's head, including its ears, and is filled with whipped cream and covered in caramel custard-flavored chocolate. The Diglett donut resembles a round mochi donut, is covered with chocolate crunch and custard cream, and features a cute Diglett popping out of the middle that's a caramel cream puff.

  On the simpler side, a Poke Ball donut is available, which resembles a standard round donut with a hole in the middle. It's coated in white chocolate and strawberry sugar to recreate the appearance of the iconic red and white Poke Ball. Lastly, a pair of donuts more loosely based on Pikachu and Diglett are available, which are essentially yellow and brown donuts that are filled with custard and whipped cream. Pikachu's is custard-flavored, while Diglett's is caramel-flavored. The event featuring these donuts will get underway on November 6. The event doesn't specify when it ends, but based on the Christmas-themed advertisements, they will probably be available at least until December.

  Pokemon Donut Collaborations are Common, but Not in the West

 <p>
  Mister Donut isn't the only donut chain to offer
  <em>

  donuts in the past. Krispy Kreme has also had collaborations with
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  before, but oddly, despite being an American company, they haven't been available in the United States. This is likely disappointing to fans of the series, but as the years have gone by, there's been no move to bring them stateside.

  While
  <em>

  fans are out of luck in the US for official ones, fans have created

  donuts in the past to celebrate the iconic game series and its pocket monsters. While some hold out hope that a collab like this will come to the west, making one's own might be the best option for now.

  offers unique opportunities for players to guide their virtual characters through many exciting career paths. From adrenaline-pumping professions like Secret Agent and Astronaut to more intellectually stimulating ones such as Scientist or Politician, this beloved game caters to different player preferences.

   In The Sims 4, active careers offer a uniquely immersive way to engage with Sims' work lives, allowing players to accompany their Sims to the job site and manage tasks firsthand. With the addition of the new reaper career in the Life &amp; Death expansion, players now have another compelling, hands-on profession to explore. Whether revisiting old favorites or trying out this latest career path, players have plenty of options to enrich their Sims' professional lives.

  Several expansions and game packs allow players to create their own business in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Sims can own retail stores (
  <em>
   Get To Work
  </em>
  ), restaurants (
  <em>
   Dine Out
  </em>
  ), or vet clinics (
  <em>
   Cats &amp; Dogs
  </em>
  ). Players have total creative freedom to build and design the business of their dreams. They can personalize businesses by purchasing perks, hiring employees, and interacting with customers. Sims with a business can even choose their own hours and decide whether to travel to the store while it's open or let it run itself.

 <p>
  While the retail store owner career offers the potential for success and self-fulfillment, it is important to consider the challenges that come with it. Although the game offers several ways to customize and control one's business, it's just not as engaging as the other active available careers. It may be the career with the most bugs in the game, especially for restaurant owners with
  <em>
   The Sims 4: Dine Out
  </em>
  . It also requires a lot of financial investment to purchase a lot, decorate it, and stock the shelves. Players may find they are focusing more on trying to keep their employees well-trained and satisfied than anything else. Thankfully, there are many other active careers worth pursuing.

 <p>
  This career was the most enticing and promising to those considering the
  <em>
   Get To Work
  </em>
  expansion pack. The promise of a new medical career and the ability to diagnose and treat sick patients brought an exciting new concept to the game. Players follow their Sim to a hospital as NPC patients slowly file in. They are given tasks like conducting tests, treating illnesses, and attending to emergencies such as an unconscious Sim or assisting in childbirth.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the new active career did not live up to the Sims community's expectations. Compared to the other careers in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , players had to put a lot of time and effort into repetitive, mundane tasks with insufficient reward. Although these Sims work extremely long hours, players will have a hard time finishing enough tasks to fill the meter and have a decent work performance. After administering multiple tests, players must correctly choose the single diagnosis and treatment from dozens of options, or the Sim will leave without being properly treated. The unequal effort-to-gratification ratio is one of the main reasons this career won't be a
  <em>
   Sims 4
  </em>
  player's first choice.

  People often turn to video games to embrace being evil and cause mayhem and destruction when they are frustrated. That's why the idea of a law enforcement career path sounds so exciting. Imagine following thieves and unlawful Sims and throwing them in jail or discerning the details of a murder. Detectives are tasked with visiting crime scenes, interrogating suspects, and conducting research to make an arrest and solve crimes.

 <p>
  Much like the doctor career, the detective career is very demanding, and the Sim's job performance relies heavily on the player's effort and attention to detail. Similar to real life, players have to put up with completing tedious tasks when they first start their job. Unfortunately, this career becomes more enjoyable to play only after receiving several promotions in the career path.

  The most recent career to be added to the active careers list is the interior decorator career from the
  <em>
   Dream Home Decorator
  </em>
  game pack. Expanding upon the architectural designer career path in
  <em>
   The Sims 3
  </em>
  :
  <em>
   Ambitions,
  </em>
  players follow their Sims to clients' homes, listen to their desires, and re-design their living spaces. This career is especially intriguing for builders who already spend the majority of their gameplay in build/buy mode. Listening to the client's requests can help players diversify their building and decorating styles in the future.
 </p>

 <p>
  On the other hand, clients may not have the same taste as players do. It can be difficult to build extraordinary houses and stray from personal preference to meet Sims' expectations, especially when the client's budget is small and their vision is unclear. In general, this career is rather shallow and does not provide as much variety as the other careers, and the gameplay can become a little monotonous if it's played too frequently.

  The scientist career is often overlooked in terms of active careers. However, many fans consider it to be one of the best. Players with scientists can follow their Sims to FutureSim Labs and interact with the invention constructor, chemical analyzer, and chemistry lab. Sims can have breakthroughs by building intellectual skills and achieving certain emotions to unlock new inventions. In opposition to several other active careers, these inventions - including the SimRay, satellite dish, cloning machine, and wormhole generator - can be taken off the laboratory lot and used anywhere the Sim pleases.

 <p>
  Upward mobility, a variety of tasks, and the guarantee of exciting new inventions make the scientist career one of the best active careers in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . The mischievous aspect of the career, presented as opportunities for pranking coworkers with freeze rays and untested serums, makes this one of the most entertaining careers of all time. Not to mention, players can collect free plants, alien creatures, crystals, metals, and elements in and around the laboratory. These objects can be used to complete collections, decorate home spaces, or sold for a profit.

  The actor career is widely considered to be the best active career to date. Released in the
  <em>
   Get Famous
  </em>
  expansion pack, this career fast tracks Sims into the world-famous celebrity status by starring in commercials, TV shows, and movies. Players follow their Sims to a film set and take them through hair and makeup, wardrobe, and rehearsals with co-stars and directors before watching the filming first-hand. There are a total of 21 different gigs to choose from, each unlocked with promotions and the development of acting skills.

  This career offers everything players of active careers desire: a great variety of tasks, high engagement levels, and a relatively low number of bugs. It leads to celebrity accomplishments such as Starlight Accolades and nameplate tiles on Starlight Boulevard. It's the only career that transforms the employee Sim into a completely different-looking character. This career could have easily sent Sims down a rabbit hole, but the amount of effort and dedication
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  team put into this role deserves the highest of praise.

  The highly anticipated reaper career, introduced in the
  <em>
   Life &amp; Death
  </em>
  expansion, has quickly claimed the top spot among
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  's active careers. For years, players have requested a career that lets Sims step into the Grim Reaper’s shoes, and this role delivers an eerie yet humorous twist. As Grimterns, Sims can now clock in at the hidden Headless Quarters lot, a spooky headquarters filled with dark humor and mysterious charm, where they’ll receive daily assignments to help the Grim Reaper manage the recently deceased.

 <p>
  In this career, Sims are sent to scenes of unusual deaths, from cowplant mishaps to jokes gone lethally wrong, where they’ll investigate the cause of death and make a crucial choice: to revive or to reap. Each day brings new, escalating challenges as Grimterns face strange scenarios and higher-stakes decisions, keeping the job fresh and unpredictable. This active career captures the thrill of the macabre with a touch of comedy, making it a highly engaging experience and one of the best active careers for Sims to explore.

      <title>8 JRPGs That Are Great Despite Frustrating Combat</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  JRPGs have been around for a long time, with many monolithic titles that have defined the genre as one focused on story, worldbuilding, and compelling characters. Most JRPGs are narratively minded in this way, especially the many fantasy titles that have been crafted to give players a sprawling world to lose themselves in, one with its own cultures and customs, as well as its own threats that the player must work towards defeating.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":435} -->

 <p>
  But across all JRPGs, whether they're 16-bit titles on the SNES or fluid, dynamic releases on the PS5, gameplay and spins on typical turn-based combat have been paramount to a game's success and longevity. Some titles incorporate new ways to utilize turn based combat, like timelines that reflect characters' speed and mix up the order of allies and enemies, or a break from turn based combat altogether. Some titles, despite having excellent narratives and worlds to explore, have fallen short when it comes to iterating on classic JRPG combat.

  The
  <em>
   Star Ocean

  series has been a steadily thriving staple within the JRPG scene for decades now, with many consoles boasting one or two installments in this innovative sci-fi fantasy JRPG. This

  <em>

 <p>
  Rather than traditional turn-based combat, this game allowed players to experience real time gameplay when fighting enemies. Unfortunately, using both HP and MP as resources for skills, alongside targeting enemies' HP or MP, was a bit convoluted, and the game invited many criticisms that are uniquely centered around real-time action, such as the combat feeling weightless and awkward.

  Today, players can find
  <em>
   Paper Mario
  </em>
  titles standing among the best JRPGs on the Switch combining a fantastic aesthetic with novel, interesting turn-based gameplay. In the days of the Wii-U however,
  <em>
   Color Splash
  </em>
  was panned by many fans, which is a shame considering the title's vibrant world design is some of the best in the series.

 <p>
  There is some merit to fan complaints however, as the title doesn't really know how to implement the new, confusing card system into its combat, and at a certain point of the game, the player is so inundated with resources, they basically never need to fight enemies besides the bosses needed to progress.

  has two games under its belt now, and both of them are fantastic titles with much to offer.

 <p>
  This game does have a glaring issue with its combat to many players however, as trying to combine real time combat alongside the menu-based actions in this title is - in a word - overwhelming. Players who can look past this will discover a great game, but if people are having to 'look past' the combat in a JRPG, then something isn't right.

 <p>
  What holds it back, however, is a combat system that's very complicated, with four separate upgrade slots for players to put 'quips' in, as well as skills and normal attacks, but then special skills that activate after a certain number of attacks... it's a bit much.

  Perhaps the biggest gripe players have with combat is that they cannot target enemies. The AI automatically selects which enemies to target. This might work in games like
  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord
  </em>
  with skills designed around it, but this game was essentially just a standard menu based battle system but someone else got to play the game while the player watched.

  <em>
   Infinite Space

  has a cult following to this day for being a JRPG that takes on a fantastic sci-fi aesthetic and treats players to a space opera story seldom seen in this genre. The characters are all three-dimensional, and instead of recruiting them alone, players are recruiting their ships to add to a growing fleet among the stars.

  The game's combat does click eventually, but it only clicks once its many quirks have been identified and the player has gotten used to them. There are so many options in each battle and ship combat often gets cluttered with choices very quickly.

  Square Enix are in their element with this wartime JRPG that has a unique setting, an interesting magical resource to push the plot along, and an overall unique story with characters that are more somber and amoral than players have come to expect from the JRPG scene.

  The game's most touted feature, the new real time spin on SRPG grid-based combat, is not up to scratch, however.

  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered

  set out to bring updated visuals and gameplay enhancements to the acclaimed 2017 title, continuing its legacy as a fan favorite. Yet, many fans aren't entirely happy, especially due to the mandatory PSN registration requirement that has sparked considerable debate.

A hotfix comes as part of their ongoing efforts to refine the PC gaming experience and maintain player satisfaction.

  Following
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  's subpar reception upon release on PC, the latest update specifically targets issues that have been affecting gameplay and stability. According to Nixxes Software’s official announcement on Twitter, Hotfix 1.0.38.0 resolves a crash that some players experienced after running the in-game benchmark. Additionally, the update corrects problems related to the "Concentration" skill, which previously required multiple R3 presses to activate or deactivate after its initial use. Other notable fixes include adjustments to mouse and controller X- and Y-axis configurations and a solution for the Aim Toggle function on controllers, which occasionally malfunctioned following cinematics and disrupted the flow of gameplay.

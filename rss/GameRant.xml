  Real-time strategy games have been a staple in the gaming world for decades, with fast-paced gameplay demanding quick thinking, tactical expertise, and good reflexes. These games allow players to build empires, command armies, manage resources, and defeat their enemies on pre-made battle maps.

 <p>
  While some focus on macro-management and resource gathering, others place heavy emphasis on intense, frantic combat. The best RTS games are known for their fast-paced action, that challenges a player to keep up with events that are emerging on the battle map, whilst still controlling their own units effectively. Mixing defensive gameplay and base building with offensive gameplay and unit control.

  <em>
   Tooth And Tail
  </em>
  is something a little different as far as RTS games go. Rather than following the general trope of humanoid or alien armies battling it out for dominance, Tooth And Tail is set in a world full of animals, waging a devastating civil war.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  As the commander of various animal units, the player has to try and win each battle. The gameplay is fast and frantic, with matches being over very quickly. This means the player has to think fast, and be ready to adapt to emerging gameplay on the relatively small battle map. Overall,
  <em>
   Tooth And Tail
  </em>
  is worthy of a place on this list, due to its frenetic gameplay and fresh setting.

  <em>
   Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak

  is a prequel to the rest of the games in the
  <em>
   Homeworld
  </em>
  franchise. It steps back in time to cover the expedition to claim the crushed mothership that later becomes the technology base for developing the mothership in the later games.

 <p>
  Set on the ground, in a barren desert, gameplay is intensely tactical.
  <em>
   Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak
  </em>
  does things a little differently. This is not the kind of RTS where players build a defensible base, and then go on the attack. Instead, the player needs to control certain areas of the map, and be constantly on the move to gather resources. The pace of combat is often overwhelming, as the enemy AI has a habit of pulling flanking maneuvers and attacking lightly defended positions.

  Battles can be huge, with hundreds of units. Controlling this number of units can be difficult at best, and completely overwhelming in many cases. There are so many bullets, missiles, lasers, and explosions in large battles, that the main window looks more like a trippy screensaver than an actual game.

  <em>
   StarCraft
  </em>
  is a seminal strategy game. However, even though it is still worth playing this iconic game, it does look a little dated. Blizzard made a smart move in 2017 and remastered the game, adding HD textures, to make it more attractive to modern RTS fans.

 <p>
  The remastered version of
  <em>
   StarCraft
  </em>
  has the same crazy, chaotic gameplay as the original. Few games have managed to match the sheer panic that a player feels when facing a Zerg rush in StarCraft. Those terribly stressful few minutes waiting to find out if base defenses are up to the task of fighting off a massive surge of Zerglings. There is a reason why StarCraft was the backbone of competitive esports gaming for so long, as it takes real skill to keep on top of the frantic pace of the game.

  As RTS games go, few offer such expansive battle maps as
  <em>
   Supreme Commander
  </em>
  . In many ways, it is something unique, a real-time tactical game. Players need to be aware of what is happening in every part of the map, as the enemy AI is very capable, and has a habit of doing unexpected things. There is a special UI feature that allows the player to view a zoomed-out overview of the whole map to help with this.

 <p>
  Gameplay starts off quite slow, but as more and more units are spawned on the battle map the pace of combat ramps up. Eventually, there will be hundreds of units taking part in huge battles. The player has to react quickly to enemy movements, and make sure they never stop producing their own units, and gathering resources.

  <em>
   Company Of Heroes 2
  </em>
  is a frantically paced RTS game that is based loosely on World War II. The game has some pretty unique features for an RTS, and this includes a destructible environment and a combat system that enables the player to move units into cover.

 <p>
  The battle maps are quite large, and the enemy AI is dynamic, and able to exploit weaknesses in the player’s defenses quite ruthlessly. Therefore, this is not a simple RTS, with the player simply overwhelming the opponent with greater firepower. Instead, they need to make strategic decisions, and ensure that they defend as well as they attack.

To keep up with the pace of a skirmish map takes a lot of practice. No other game could have taken the top spot on this list.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Undisputed
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the first major boxing sim since 2011's
  <em>
   Fight Night Champion.
  </em>
  The team at
  <em>
  </em>
  Steel City has promised frequent updates to the mechanics and the more in-depth features in the game's career mode. The career mode is where you spend most of your playing time offline, as your created or licensed fighter works their way up the ranking to capture the world championship. Player-created fighters can change their fighting style, stance, and more to keep things fresh. However, if the options to change a fighter's style are unclear, this guide will demonstrate how to do it in
  <em>
   Undisputed
  </em>
  .

      <title>5 Nintendo Franchises With The Most Complicated Lore</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/nintendo-franchises-most-complicated-complex-lore/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Nintendo is a monolithic company. For decades, they've pioneered in the field of gaming, and in the process have wound up with some of the most recognizable franchises in the world. Their older consoles are filled with classics, and the Switch is still growing a healthy catalog of titles, even years after its release.

 <p>
  Most Nintendo titles released today have a fairly direct narrative to follow, but with such a breadth of franchises under its belt, and so many games within each, it's little surprise that some Nintendo titles have accrued a serious amount of lore over the years. Swapping between writers, directors, and gameplay philosophies means that some games have worlds too complicated to map, or timelines that start to look less like timelines and more like ambitious roller-coaster diagrams. These Nintendo series in particular have a wealth of complicated lore to keep up with.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  series is known for its engaging, iconic characters more than anything else. Also maybe for crowding out SSBU's roster of fighters, but that's an article for another day. What really makes the protagonists, their comrades, love interests, and enemies shine, however, is the story and setting they're involved in. Certainly, in some titles, the characters are doing the heavy lifting, while in others, such as
  <em>
   Three Houses
  </em>
  , a complex and engaging narrative keeps players coming back.

 <p>
  The complicated nature of
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  is found in how all these games interact.
  <em>
   Engage
  </em>
  , despite having a relatively one-note story, managed to open a huge can of worms with the emblem system. Manifestations of past
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  heroes and protagonists can be recruited into the player's group. These previous characters have the memories of their original counterparts, but are illusions? Or spirits? If all these games exist on the same world or plane, how do these emblems have memories of every potential story route the player could have guided them through? This one feature unwinds the tight, isolated nature of the other FE games into something vague and complicated, not really fixed by
  <em>
   Engage
  </em>
  .

  For a long time, the beloved Nintendo character Pit had fallen from favor and grace, left to malinger in obscurity while other, more successful franchises took center stage at Nintendo. Even today, the
  <em>
   Kid Icarus
  </em>
  series is not the first to come to many people's minds when they think of Nintendo's gallery of heroes, despite some very solid, open-ended games where players can take ahold of the upstart angel.

 <p>
  <em>
   Kid Icarus: Uprising
  </em>
  was one of the best games on the 3DS, but its open-ended nature has left a lot of fans confused about the nature of Angel World. How strong is Palutena? Is Icarus a source of her strength, or just her most reliable angel? How do the aliens from
  <em>
   Uprising
  </em>
  fit in with this Greek-mythology-inspired world's lore?

  The
  <em>
   Golden Sun
  </em>
  series has had entries that are frequently mentioned among the top titles of any console. Whether the GBA or Nintendo DS, these JRPGs hit the perfect balance of gripping, engaging gameplay with a detailed and intricately written setting that sparks the imagination. By the series' third title, however, there were more than a few questions being asked about the nature of this world in
  <em>
   Golden Sun
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The relationship between many of the magical concepts in this game is obscure. Psynergy, alchemy, and the lighthouses that control them are integral parts of the game, but how do they interact? The lighthouses can unseal alchemy, but how was the magic of alchemy sealed in the first place? There's a lot of frankly esoteric lore behind psynergy and alchemy in
  <em>
   Golden Sun
  </em>
  , and the wealth of writings on these topics asks much of the player.

  Since 1986,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  has been a massively popular series for Nintendo fans across the world. The sense of adventure and exploration, combined with a high-stakes, high fantasy story has been the perfect recipe for watershed titles on every platform. There's no shortage of difficult dungeons or scenic worlds for players to explore in almost every game.

 <p>
  The game has a habit of nonlinear releases and a timeline that fractures Link's identity into an adult in some entries, but a child in others, and a timeline where he's a defeated hero also exists. Nintendo won't open up on where the newer, open-world releases fit into this convoluted timeline, and retcons across new remade titles just add another layer of confusion to the mix.

  gradually arms players with melee weapons and firearms to help them keep up with the increasing variety of enemies. Although there aren't too many weapons, unlike the

  that players can find in the town which cannot be obtained before reaching a certain point in the story.

  Wooden Plank is the first melee weapon

  It is a weapon that you'll have on you for the first few hours of the game until you reach the Woodside Apartments. It's easy to use, helps you learn the attack pattern of enemies to help you dodge at the right moment, and doesn't break. Yes, no matter how many enemies you attack with this wooden board, it won't break.

  The Handgun is the first firearm players
  <strong>
   obtain when visiting the Woodside Apartments in Room 217
  </strong>
  . When entering the Woodside Apartment, players will find a note in the reception area about a complaint about gunshot noises heard from Room 217. So, where there are gunshot noises, there are guns. After entering Room 217, you'll find the gun sitting inside a grocery cart.

 <p>
  Handgun is one of the most versatile weapons which can do a decent amount of damage if you aim for the head. Its ammo is commonly available, scattered around the world, so players won't need to count their bullets before starting blasting.

  The Steel Pipe is the second melee weapon players will receive, which is
  <strong>
   obtained during a cutscene on Katz Street
  </strong>
  right after meeting Maria. Players will meet up with Maria in Rosewater Park right after exiting Blue Creek Apartments. After that, Maria will hint at a mysterious "Special Place" where James may find Mary. While going to that place, James and Maria are ambushed by Lying Figures. To escape from them, James bars the chain link gate with his wooden plank and pulls a steel pipe from a nearby car instead.

 <p>
  Even though the Wooden Plank was a good enough melee weapon, the Steel Pipe is a sure upgrade over it. It will replace your default melee weapon and hit enemies harder, staggering them more often.

  The Shotgun is the second firearm that players will
  <strong>
   obtain on the second floor of Brookhaven Hospital
  </strong>
  . After entering Brookhaven Hospital, James interacts with an empty gun cabinet and Maria asks why there is a gun locker in the hospital. After going through the Basement section of the Hospital, you'll gain access to the Hospital's second floor, where players will find the Shotgun inside the Women's Locker Room lying in a weapon locker.

 <p>
  Shotgun is by far the best firearm in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  as it deals a huge amount of damage with a single shot. As enemies run up to James to attack him, players can use the Shotgun to blast them back, as it's most effective at close range. The ammo for Shotgun is scarce, but not as rare as our next firearm on this list. However, it's best to save your buck shots for the bosses you'll encounter ahead.

  The Hunting Rifle is the last firearm that players will
  <strong>
   obtain in the Toluca Prison
  </strong>
  , where it's locked behind a weapon cabinet in the Armory. Players will arrive in Toluca Prison through the Silent Hill Historical Society building while making their way down a very long staircase and a few holes in the ground. After finally reaching the Prison, the first destination will be the Armory, where players will find the map of the Prison and the weapon locker.

  The Hunting Rifle is a devastating long-range weapon that can even one-shot minor enemies when aimed at the head. However, its ammo is very scarce so you'll have to make every shot count.

  The Chainsaw is a special weapon in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  that players can only
  <strong>
   obtain after completing the game once and starting a New Game+ mode
  </strong>
  . At the beginning of the New Game+ right after talking with Angela. Along the path to the town, players will find the Chainsaw lodged in a wooden log in front of the
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  Ranch.

 <p>
  The Chainsaw is a powerful melee weapon that can cut through enemies like butter, sometimes even taking them down in a single swipe. It makes your journey through the second playthrough of the game easier and quicker. It also doesn't require any refueling, so you can use it infinitely. However, it's noisy, especially when in use, so make sure you only equip it when there are enemies nearby.

      Some iconic quotes from Until Dawn come from unlikely characters like Sam and Matt.

      Characters like Josh and Chris provide comic relief with witty jokes throughout the game.

 <p>
  It's not entirely surprising that a story about a group of angst-ridden teenagers contains a lot of witty zingers. Tensions are unbelievably high in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Until Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  as the eight friends fight to survive against Wendigos and a masked Psycho, and it makes for a few wildly amusing scenarios with countless memorable one-liners.

 <p>
  Some of the better lines come from jokesters like Josh and Chris, whose oafish comic relief is a breath of fresh air during some particularly jarring scenes, but there are also a few iconic remarks from characters that one wouldn't typically expect, like Sam and Matt.
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  is brimming with
  <strong>
   unforgettable quotes
  </strong>
  , so here's a compilation of the very best of them, ranked by their significance, how funny they are, and the indelible impression they left behind — long after the game's end.

  As Sam and Chris are making their way up the mountain to the Washington Lodge, they hitch a ride on the ski lift. Here's where Chris tells Sam the story of how he met Josh in third grade, where Josh was moved next to him during class.

  Chris proceeds to explain that, if he and Josh had never met, Sam might have been riding to the Washington Lodge with someone else entirely, or they might not have been sitting in the ski lift at all. Yes, this moment sees Chris dumb down the chaos theory for the uninitiated, but it also showcases a glimpse of Chris' wiser side, which is always nice to see for a resident comedian.

  In Chapter 8, after the radio tower collapses, Emily awakens to find herself hanging upside down in the mine shaft, suspended from a cord wrapped around her ankle. She manages to swing to safety, but she receives a nasty incision from a falling rock for her troubles.

  Emily becomes quite the survivalist when she fashions herself a torch from the $600 top she's wearing. She finds a small plank nearby, rips off a strip of her shirt, and wraps it around the wood to set it on fire. Although doing this is necessary in order for her to navigate the dark depths of the mines, this fashionista isn't happy about ruining such an expensive item of clothing.

  According to Ashley, everyone is "freezing their buns off" once they arrive at the Washington Lodge, which is locked from the inside. Josh and Chris offer to break in and bust the lock to allow everyone in, which prompts an amusing interaction between the pair.

  Josh leads Chris to the side and helps him push a dumpster underneath an open window, thus allowing Chris to shimmy inside. Right before he leaves Chris to "hunt around in the dark" for a while, Josh tells him "Godspeed, pilgrim" with a mock salute. The quote is a direct reference to famous western actor John Wayne, who famously mentioned pilgrims in two of his movies:
  <em>
   The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   McClintock.
  </em>

  Leave it to Josh to have some of the
  <strong>
   best quotes in
   <em>
    Until Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Not only was the "Godspeed, pilgrim" line a nice callback to John Wayne, but Josh has another scene with Mike and Chris that's ripe with catchphrases. When Mike is interrogating Josh about Jessica's disappearance and presumed death (determinant), Josh treats their whole "good cop, bad cop" routine like a running gag, poking fun at them every chance he gets.

 <p>
  After losing his patience, Mike instructs Chris to return to the lodge and get the others up to speed, while he offers to stay behind and babysit Josh until morning. Josh — who has a few screws loose by this point — seems elated by the suggestion, even asking if Mike can order pizza for their "sleepover."

  It's expected for the jock character to fire off a few entertaining lines of dialog every now and then, and Mike is no exception. This quote is entirely determined by the player's actions during Chapter 10, as Mike will not say it (he won't need to) if Sam survives to set the lodge ablaze.

 <p>
  In the final confrontation at the Washington Lodge, if Sam fails any of the "Don't Move" sequences, she will die. If this happens, regardless of whether the others (Emily, Ash, and Chris) make it out safely, Mike will be forced to sacrifice himself by blowing up the lodge with himself (and everyone else) still inside. After he flicks the lighter open, Mike utters his famous last words: "How's that feel, ya f**k?" — spoken like a true martyr.

  In arguably one of the funniest scenes in
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  , Jessica and Emily start bickering the second they arrive at the Washington Lodge. Emily walks in to find Mike and Jessica canoodling on the couch and informs Jessica that "no one wants in on her territory," which prompts Jessica to retaliate.

  Jessica mentions being Miss Homecoming, but Emily bites back by flexing her academic prowess and her 4.0 GPA. She tells Jessica to "suck on that when you're trying to sleep your way into a job," but Jessica doesn't take that disrespect standing up, firing back with a comment about how no one would find Emily desirable enough to sleep with her, and she wouldn't be able to buy even a "moldy loaf of bread."

  Sam doesn't have too many iconic quotes, since she serves as the more grounded character out of them all and prides herself on her no-nonsense attitude, but even she loses her cool once it becomes clear that the Wendigos are not a threat to be taken lightly.

  In Chapter 10, Sam encounters Mike in the mines and steps in to save him from one of the Wendigos. She grabs a nearby shovel to take a swing at it, though not without delivering one of the most effortlessly hilarious (and totally unexpected) lines in the whole game. Whatever possessed Sam to call a grotesquely malnourished Wendigo "fatty"... can it do it again?

  It's clear that Ashley wouldn't last two seconds in a screaming match with Emily, especially not when her comebacks need work. In Chapter 6, Ashley and Chris search the basement for Sam, whom they assume to have been kidnapped by the Psycho. Ashley can interact with a few objects down there, including a dollhouse where she finds Hannah's diary, and this is also where Ashley can find a pair of scissors to stab the Psycho later.

 <p>
  It's an easy moment to miss, but if Ashley pushes aside a few cardboard boxes, she finds a video camera and exclaims that she doesn't like being watched. Chris will angle the camera away from her, but Ashley isn't immediately satisfied. She picks the camera up, leans right in, and says "Go suck an egg!" Nice one, Ashley. You sure told them.

  In the Sanitorium as Mike in Chapter 9, it's possible to find the Case Study Dossier clue, which shows multiple before/after photographs of a miner transforming into a Wendigo at the facility. Mike is able to identify one of the Wendigos in the Sanitorium using this clue, discovering his name to be Billy Bates.

  As Mike skims through the pages, his intrusive thoughts permit him to say a jumble of words aloud to perfectly encapsulate the entire night: Jesus hot sauce Christmas cake. He may not be the most articulate of the group, but he manages to perfectly summarize all the horrific happenings on Blackwood Mountain with these choice words.

  If Emily is bitten by the Wendigo in Chapter 8 and Mike doesn't shoot her, she confronts Ashley about her passivity in the face of Emily's potential demise. Ashley discovers in the Stranger's journal that the bites are harmless, therefore disproving the theory that Emily could turn into "one of those things."

 <p>
  If Ashley chooses to reveal the truth to Emily after the fact, Emily will get angry at her, claiming she stood by idly as Mike threatened her. Ashley begs Emily to understand her crippling fear in that situation, but Emily isn't having it. Here, she delivers one of the most
  <strong>
   memorable lines in
   <em>
    Until Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  along with a mean smack right across Ashley's face.

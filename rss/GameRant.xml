  The point of the Descendants is to keep humanity alive and well, and thankfully, players can do this with their friends. However, when playing with other people, you sometimes want to show them how you feel. Here's how you can use emotes to do just that.

  Players will automatically have the same list of default emotes and sprays when they first start the game. These will automatically be set up for you on your emote wheel and will be available right from the start. However, you can change them if you want to. If you have new emotes unlocked (or you just want to change what you already have), follow these steps:

   Navigate to the Customize option.

  <li>
   Move the emotes that you want to use onto the wheel, and remove the ones that you don't plan on using anymore.

 <p>
  There is a whole list of emotes that are available to players, and these can make letting your team know how they are doing pretty easy. In just a few clicks of a button, you can let your team know if they did great or if they fumbled it up. You can also emphasize things with the exclamation mark or question decisions by using the question mark. The emotes can make the game not only more fun but a lot more expressive.

  if you're on a PC or

   left on the d-pad
  </strong>
  if you're on a controller. This will bring up the emote wheel, which showcases all the emotes and sprays that have been selected by you in your settings (or the default ones if you haven't changed anything). All you need to do is select the one that you want to use, and your character will use it, allowing you to express yourself like never before.

  To get the Oppressor Mount in
  <em>

  , you will need to get started in the world of PvP. In particular, the Oppressor mount will become available to you when you get to

   PvP Profile

  . There should be a button on this screen that says
  <strong>
   'Series Malmstones'

 <ul>
  <li>
   Start by leveling up your character to around
   <strong>
    level 20
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Make sure to complete all of the Main Scenario Quests that you get, until you eventually unlock the quest
   <strong>
    'Hero in the Making'
   </strong>
   . This is a Level 20 Main Scenario Quest that will let you join a Grand Company.
  </li>
  <li>
   After you've joined a Grand Company, you will need to raise your character's level to
   <strong>
    level 30
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   You will then eventually get the quest,
   <strong>
    'A Pup No Longer'
   </strong>
   , which can be obtained from the character in charge of your Grand Company. As you navigate through this quest, you will take the ferry to
   <strong>
    The Wolves' Den
   </strong>
   , and you will be able to take part in PvP battles here after talking with the NPC in the area.

  Once you have met all of these requirements, you will now be able to take on some PvP battles, and get yourself an Oppressor mount once you get to
  <strong>

  in Series 6. It will take a bit of time and grinding before you can unlock the mount, but it is well worth the effort as it is one of the better mounts you can get.

      <title>Best JRPGs With Complex Crafting Systems</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  JRPGs have explored a variety of different gameplay mechanics over the years, and item crafting is one of the most frequently reoccurring. While many effective weapons and armor can be purchased in shops, many games offer an alternative that either allows players to get the same weapons at a lower cost or craft weapons that are stronger than the ones in shops.

  Item crafting has been a popular game mechanic in JRPGs for decades, and most games in the genre take different approaches to item crafting. While many item crafting systems are remarkably simple, many can be incredibly complex. Here are some JRPGs with very complex crafting systems.

  Despite being the godfather of JRPGs, crafting systems came relatively late to the
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  series. The alchemy pot in
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 8
  </em>
  was one of the first examples of crafting in the series, though it was relatively simple to use.

  <em>

  makes the process much more intricate with the Fun-sized Forge, a crafting system that requires the player to hammer out the item via a mini-game that requires patience, balance, and tactics. With this, players can not only make unique items but also more powerful versions of items as well.

  The
  <em>
   Baten Kaitos
  </em>
  games are unique hybrids of deckbuilders and role-playing games, where the characters use a variety of cards to define their actions in battle. There are different ways to earn cards, including beating enemies in battle, buying them from shops, and, of course, crafting them.

 <p>
  However, crafting cards in
  <em>
   Baten Kaitos
  </em>
  is a lot harder than it might seem. In order to craft a card, players must use a very specific card combination in the middle of battle. Other cards need to be aged, which can mean waiting from a few minutes to dozens of hours. Still, some incredibly powerful cards can be created with this method, so it can be worth it to try.

  In
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  , all weapons and armor have the same statistics. However, all equipment has two ability slots, which can be upgraded with items to add particular effects to them. These effects can add incredible effects to each weapon, and even change the appearance of the weapon entirely. While there is a limit to how much an item can be customized, nearly any piece of equipment can be transformed using this method.

  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  has always been a franchise where using materials of defeated monsters to create stronger equipment was a core part of gameplay, so their crafting systems are naturally very robust as a result.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter: World
  </em>
  is easily one of the biggest
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  games to date, so its crafting system is appropriately expansive.

 <p>
  Aside from being able to auto-craft items from ingredients found in the wild, players can also use materials from the monsters they defeat in order to upgrade their weapons and armor, which can branch out into completely new weapons and armor given the right materials. Making the perfect loadout in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter: World
  </em>
  takes quite an effort, but it's all worth it for Monster Hunter fans.

  The
  <em>
   Star Ocean
  </em>
  games are well-known for their unique crafting systems, as well as how easy it is to create game-breaking weapons early on in order to trivialize battles. Crafting systems are a core part of the series, though their complexity varies from game to game.

 <p>
  <em>
   Star Ocean: Till the End of Time
  </em>
  has the most complex crafting system in the series. While in other games, item creation can be done easily from the main menu, item creation in this game requires the use of a factory. By constructing lines of workers, which can include both party members and NPC workers, the workers will begin automatically crafting items based on specific plans or even original concepts. It's a lot to get a handle on, but some of the best items in the game can only be made this way.

 <p>
  While item or equipment crafting isn't really something that's focused on very much in most
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  games, demon fusion (which can certainly be seen as a form of crafting) is an incredibly important part of the game that can mean life or death for the player.
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance
  </em>
  is the most recent entry in the series, and its demon fusion system provides an incredible amount of functionality.

 <p>
  While it's relatively easy to shoot for a particular demon to fuse, it can be difficult to ensure that it inherits the skills necessary for it to be a powerhouse.
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 5
  </em>
  provides a variety of different ways to do so, whether it be manually fusing demons until the player reaches the desired demon, or using essences to inherit the skills that way.

  <em>
   Legend of Mana
  </em>
  is a rather odd game, not just in the
  <em>
   Mana

  series, but among JRPGs as a whole. It has a lot of very bizarre mechanics, and it can be very difficult to get a handle on everything at once.

 <p>
  Included in this is
  <em>

  's weapon crafting system, which can get incredibly convoluted very fast. While making the weapons themselves is somewhat simple, upgrading them through tempering is incredibly deep, as nearly any item in the game can be used to improve equipment. With a lot of patience and luck, players can create incredibly powerful weapons.

 <p>
  While most JRPGs have item crafting as more of a side activity, the
  <em>
   Atelier
  </em>
  games put their crafting systems front and center. Unlike in other games, players must engage in alchemy to progress in the game, and as a result, they are incredibly in-depth and extensive.

 <p>
  Alchemy is incredibly complex and requires not only obtaining high-quality ingredients but also manipulation of those ingredients to create powerful items. How exactly alchemy works varies from game to game, but it's certain that
  <em>
   Atelier
  </em>
  players will be spending hours in crafting menus trying to create the best items and weapons.

  Bungie announced the reputation bug affecting players during
  <em>
   <strong>
    Destiny 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  Echoes: Act 1 has been fixed, and the studio is planning "reputation bonus weeks" for all classes. Previously, the bug incorrectly gave Titans and Hunters big reputation boosts in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  core activities, while reputation gains for Warlocks were kept at their normal and intended rate.

 <p>
  Just one week after the launch of
  <em>
   Destiny 2: The Final Shape
  </em>
  , Bungie released Episode: Echoes as a continuation of
  <em>
   Destiny 2's
  </em>
  story. In Echoes Act 1, Guardians return to Nessus in order to pursue an Echo, a source of immense power that became known after the defeat of the Witness. Alongside new story missions, players gain access to new weapons and gear, new Exotics, and much more as
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  heads into a new saga. However, the release of the first Episode also introduced a reputation bug in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  that frustrated Warlocks for the past month. Warlocks felt like they were left behind by Titans and Hunters, as the latter two classes were able to gain reputation-based rewards much more quickly.

  should receive the same amount of reputation from core activities in Crucible, Vanguard Ops, and Gambit. Moreover, Bungie is planning "reputation bonus weeks" for all core activities in the game as compensation, granting reputation boosts for all classes. The studio did not give a timeframe for when players can expect the reputation boosts to go live, but Bungie teases fans to stay tuned for future announcements.

  Some
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players are disappointed that the accidental reputation boosts were fixed by Bungie, and others believe that the reputation boosts should have been permanent and given to Warlocks as well. However, it appears that many players in the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  community are still looking forward to the reputation boosts that will soon come to the game's core activities. These boosts will help players gain rewards more quickly from Grandmaster Nightfalls in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  and other high-level activities.

  Episode: Echoes Act 2 will be released on Tuesday, July 16, and the update will likely include more bug fixes. Like the first act, Echoes Act 2 will feature weekly story missions and content for players to explore. The reputation boost weeks could potentially occur sometime during Echoes Act 2 or Act 3, and Bungie will give fans an update once their plans are concrete.

  The development of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered
   </strong>
  </em>
  appears to be on-track for its 2024 release, as new details about the re-release have emerged regarding its ESRB rating.
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  is one of Grasshopper Manufacture's more underrated titles, released in 2011 on Xbox 360 and PS3 as a result of a collaboration between Grasshopper and Electronic Arts, with Suda51 at the director's chair. Despite creative clashes between Suda51 and EA, resulting in mixed reviews at launch, fans and Suda himself have come around to the game, with it accruing a cult following.

 <p>
  After the game was delisted from digital stores in 2021, Grasshopper and Suda51 bought back the distribution rights from EA, resulting in the surprise announcement of
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  being remastered. The game was fully unveiled as
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered
  </em>
  , and got a playable demo at PAX East 2024. Grasshopper also confirmed that the game will be launching sometime in 2024, though it didn't give a specific release date. Based on a recent ESRB rating,
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  's developmental progress appears to be on-track and will likely be released this year.

 <p>
  The ESRB rated
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered
  </em>
  M for Mature, which is the exact same rating the original game got in 2011. The ESRB's rating warnings for the game state that "Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Sexual Themes, and Strong Language," which all fit within the hyperviolent, gory, and over-the-top nature of
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned
  </em>
  's world. This is confirmed in the rating summary, which succinctly describes the amount of gore and sexual imagery in the game, from demons getting decapitated, along with an area that is a red-light district.

  Ratings from the ESRB usually indicate that a game should be coming out relatively soon, or that the game is potentially locked in for a release date and is content complete. It also gives some insight as to what to expect for the game as well.
  <em>
   Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered
  </em>
  is a multiplatform game, and will be launching on both the previous and current generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles, along with Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam.

  also has two new features that were not in the original game: a New Game Plus mode and more cosmetic outfits for protagonist Garcia Hotspur to wear. The original game was a rather short affair, clocking at around six hours long, and had no New Game Plus option for fans to run through the game again with their fully upgraded hero. The New Game Plus and new outfits should provide some extra incentive for fans to play it again.

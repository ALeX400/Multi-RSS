      <title>Rumor: Future Age of Empires Games Could Be Using Unreal Engine 5</title>

  A job listing online has sparked rumors that the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Age of Empires
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise could be following recent industry trends by moving to Unreal Engine 5 going forward. Epic's UE5 has become something of an industry standard of late, with many developers choosing to move away from proprietary engines in favor of it. Now, it appears that
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  could take the same route.

  Looking at the history of every
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  game is interesting. The first two titles in the series used the Genie Engine, while
  <em>
   Age of Empires 3
  </em>
  would use the BANG! engine, a proprietary engine created by Ensemble Studios. This would also be used for
  <em>
   Age of Mythology
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  online. The most recent game in the series,
  <em>
   Age of Empires 4
  </em>
  , used Essence Engine 5.0, yet another proprietary engine from Relic Entertainment. Old versions of the engine were used for games like
  <em>
   Company of Heroes
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  A job listing for a Principal Build Lead Engineer at
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  support studio World's Edge has sparked some rumors about a potential move to Unreal Engine 5 for the franchise going forward. Among the requirements is "6+ years of professional experience in AAA scale Unreal Engine game development," and one of the preferred qualifications is a "Deep understanding of Unreal Engine’s build pipeline and asset management systems." Given World's Edge exists solely (so far) to work on
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  , it's not a stretch to think that one of the best action RTS franchises will use UE5 going forward. Right now, though, this remains a rumor.

  At the moment, it seems as though there's a big industry shift towards Unreal Engine 5. Some believe this is a bad thing, as it can give games a similar feeling. However, this is mitigated by solid art design to distinguish one game from another. Having one engine so widely used means studios can hire individuals already familiar with the technology, and get them working on creative things quicker, rather than having to bring them up to scratch on in-house engine details for a period. The biggest franchise to make the move to Unreal Engine 5 so far is
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  , which last month revealed it will be using the engine for all its future titles. Don't expect UE5 to go anywhere anytime soon.

  A move to Unreal Engine 5 isn't the only rumor floating around about the future of the
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  franchise at the moment. It was recently rumored that
  <em>
   Age of Empires
  </em>
  could come to PlayStation, which would be a slight surprise given Microsoft owns it. Stranger things have happened, though. Gamers will have to wait and see if any of these interesting rumors come to fruition in the future.

      <title>Sega’s Newly Announced Classic Series Revival is Nearly 20 Years in the Making</title>

  Sega and Atlus have had an especially strong 2024 compared to many AAA publishers and developers right now, producing hits like
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sonic X Shadow Generations
  </em>
  , and more throughout the year. Its future prospects also look good, with
  <em>
   Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  due in early 2025, and a retro revival initiative underway to bring back franchises like
  <em>
   Shinobi
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Jet Set Radio
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Crazy Taxi
  </em>
  , and so on. Rumors have been circulating that a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Virtua Fighter 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  could be part of Sega’s plans, and, fortunately, there is indeed another
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  around the corner.

  In a recent interview with VGC, Sega's global head of transmedia Justin Scarpone revealed that
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  has joined the ranks of legacy series receiving new installments. While rumblings of a new
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  had begun as early as
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown
  </em>
  ’s launch in June 2021, leaker tweets and vague developer statements have only piled up since. As recently as the beginning of October 2024, Sega even tweeted a short video under the word “SE6A,” fueling speculation further. Outsiders are likely puzzled by the strong reaction to this news, but fans can't help but celebrate a nearly twenty-year dry streak being broken.

  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  has been a name to know in fighting games since its arcade debut back in 1993. While not exactly the first 3D fighting game,
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  set the standard for 3D fighting games to follow, directly resulting in
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  ’s creation a year later and serving as the template for
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  ’s three-button controls. It was extremely successful in arcades and made a competent leap to Sega’s consoles, becoming well-known for its gameplay and cutting-edge presentation. Unfortunately, global arcade popularity shifted toward consoles and Sega’s console line ended, foreshadowing an abrupt end to
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  ’s reign.

  Virtua Fighter 5’s Era Seemed Like The Series’ Final Stop
 </h3>
 <p>
  Most of the 24 named
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  titles came out before
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter 5
  </em>
  launched for arcades in 2006 and consoles in 2007, so the series subsisting on
  <em>
   VF5
  </em>
  iterations for a few years wasn't initially cause for concern. It was during the nearly empty stretch between
  <em>
   VF5
  </em>
  ’s 2012
  <em>
   Final Showdown
  </em>
  revision for PS3 and Xbox 360 and
  <em>
   Ultimate Showdown
  </em>
  ’s PS4 release in 2021 when fans realized the series was on its last legs. For years, the series was only kept alive through modern
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  titles incorporating emulated copies of
  <em>
   VF5FS
  </em>
  . Even after
  <em>
   Ultimate Showdown
  </em>
  drew in new fans, hopes were not high for
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  to escape its life support.

  Now, however, the end of
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter 5
  </em>
  ’s nearly 20-year reign as the last console
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  is suddenly in sight. Fighting games had a resurgence after
  <em>
   Street Fighter 4
  </em>
  ’s console launch in 2009, but
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  ’s flashy 3D fighter competition has, for better and for worse, mostly dried up.
  <em>
   VF
  </em>
  's arch-rival
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  rules the subgenre uncontested, but that's because
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  jumped back to 2D, while
  <em>
   Soul Calibur
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dead or Alive
  </em>
  failed to stay afloat.
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  ’s back-to-basics approach managed to survive its downtime thanks to its enduring qualities and internal Sega support, and it's ready to mount a comeback.

  The Present and Future of Virtua Fighter
 </h3>
 <p>
  The roadmap for what might be
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter 6
  </em>
  is, like many of Sega’s other IP revival plans, rather vague right now. Without early footage or a description to gauge completion, the new
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  could still be years away. Some veteran
  <em>
   VF
  </em>
  players are also concerned over scattered developer mentions of adding something to make a modern
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  stand out, as the series typically trades the fantastical visual flair of other fighting franchises for uniquely-
  <em>
   Virtua Fighter
  </em>
  consistency and efficiency. However it ends up, a new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Virtua Fighter
   </em>
  </strong>
  is officially on its way, and after this long, that's more than enough reason to celebrate.

  regularly debuts monsters like Mankey through events like the Mankey Community Day. Shiny variants of such monsters are precious, mainly when they perform exceptionally well in battles. Shiny Mankey is the same; with extraordinary fighting prowess, its evolutions are considered great collectibles for trainers.

 <p>
  Mankey and its Shiny variant have the same power level and stats in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , the only difference being their color. While Mankey is a potent fighter in its power level, its capabilities increase further after evolving into Primeape and Annihilape. Shiny Mankey first appeared in the 2019 Battle Showdown event and has been available for trainers to capture ever since. That said, one can acquire Shiny Mankey and its evolutions through various means, and this guide explains everything in detail.

  Shiny Mankey and its Standard variant are wild spawns usually featured in events like the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Mankey Community Day and more. Players can also secure their chances of getting a Shiny Mankey by completing Research tasks. When featured in events, monsters experience a boost in their wild spawn rate, and so is the case with Mankey. The increased spawn rate of Mankey may help trainers match its Shiny odds faster.

  Get Shiny Mankey As A Wild Spawn In Pokemon GO
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although getting a Mankey in the wild might be easy, encountering a Shiny Mankey is difficult. But while Shiny Mankey is rare,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players can take advantage of the boosted spawn rates during events that feature the monster. However, a Shiny encounter isn't guaranteed even with a boosted spawn rate. You can increase Mankey's Shiny odds by encountering as much wild Mankey as possible and matching its Shiny odds.

 <p>
  Use various
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  items and the Weather Boost feature to boost Pokemon's spawn rate in the wild significantly. The more you encounter a Pokemon, the quicker you might match its Shiny odds. Under specific weather conditions, the Weather Boost passive activates, increasing the spawn rate of monsters; you can also use Lure Modules and Incense simultaneously to increase the spawn rate of a beast further.

  Mankey spawns are increased in
  <strong>
   areas with cloudy weather
  </strong>
  . Players must search for a
  <strong>
   PokeStop in cloudy weather
  </strong>
  , attach a
  <strong>
   Lure Module
  </strong>
  , activate an
  <strong>
   Incense
  </strong>
  , and traverse the area. This method will stack the effect of all the used items, and using it during an event featuring Mankey can be worthwhile.

 <h3 id="get-shiny-mankey-through-research-tasks-in-pokemon-go">
  Get Shiny Mankey Through Research Tasks In Pokemon GO
 </h3>
 <p>
  There is a chance of encountering Shiny Mankey by completing specific Research quests in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . In-game events feature the monster as rewards for completing particular Research tasks. Players can also acquire various in-game rewards, such as Stardust, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, and the Shiny variant by completing some of the Research tasks. But the Shiny encounter isn’t guaranteed; unlucky players may get a Standard variant instead.

  <em>

 <p>
  Remember that you don’t have to defeat these monsters with their Shiny or Standard Primeape; you can use any Pokemon to win against the required types. Players need to keep their Primeape as the Buddy Pokemon while hunting for these monsters. There are several ways to meet the requirement: battle
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  friends with such monster types, find a Team GO Rocket Grunt with such types, etc.

  Beaver Creek’s Remake Map Beaver Canyon
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Delta Arena playlist, named after Installation 05 Delta Halo, features seven maps created by community Forgers based on classic
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  Slayer maps. No maps designed for Big Team Battle are included in this playlist. One of the maps players can battle on is the small Beaver Canyon made by UneeQ, Mr Greencastle, Azwilko 1997, and MikRips. Two small Forerunner outposts can be found in this cramped canyon with red and blue Spartan teams fighting for control of the entire creek. Beaver Canyon is a remake of
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  ’s Beaver Creek, which itself was a remake of
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved
  </em>
  ’s Battle Creek. This iconic canyon or creek was further remade in
  <em>
   Halo: Reach
  </em>
  as Battle Canyon from
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary
  </em>
  ’s map pack.

  Lockout’s Remake Map Canopy
 </h3>
 <p>
  Canopy is another Forerunner build map found in Delta Arena designed by UneeQ, Mr Greencastle, MikRips, and ArtNoob. Seemingly set in an overgrown jungle on Delta Halo, players can go head-to-head in this mysterious, windy temple made of weathered stone compared to the typical pristine metal of common Forerunner structures. Canopy is a remake of
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  ’s Lockout which would go on to be remade in
  <em>
   Halo 3
  </em>
  as Blackout and in
  <em>
   Halo: The Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  ’s
  <em>
   Halo 2: Anniversary
  </em>
  as Lockdown. Unlike Canopy’s tropical aesthetic, every other official iteration of Lockout is set in a frozen environment; players in Lockdown can even shoot down icicles on top of enemies.

  Sanctuary’s Remake Map Serenity
 </h3>
 <p>
  Serenity is another symmetrical map found in Delta Arena seemingly located on Delta Halo due to its structures resembling the stone ruins found on Installation 05. Designed by Uneeq, Mr Greencastle, and MikRips, Serenity will have red and blue teams fight for control of a center temple to achieve total control of the mysterious local temples. Serenity is a remake of
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  ’s Sanctuary which would go on to be remade in
  <em>
   Halo: Reach
  </em>
  as the Forge World map Asylum and in
  <em>
   Halo 2: Anniversary
  </em>
  as Shrine. All iterations of Sanctuary feature the iconic, mysterious stone structures unique to Delta Halo save for Asylum, which features more common Forerunner designs.

  Halo 2’s Ascension Remake Map in Halo Infinite
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another Forerunner map found in the Delta Arena playlist is Ascension, designed by bullet2thehead9, DISTORTED JAKAL, and MikRips. Set on a sandy, desert plateau, Ascension will have players fight from two Forerunner towers over an unknown central structure. Ascension is a remake of the
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  map of the same name, the only map in the playlist to feature its original
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  designation. Ascension was only remade two other times, as
  <em>
   Halo: Reach
  </em>
  ’s Pinnacle in Forge World and as
  <em>
   Halo 2: Anniversary
  </em>
  ’s Zenith. While
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  ’s Ascension was set on Installation 05,
  <em>
   Halo Infinite
  </em>
  ’s Ascension may be set on Installation 07 due to Zeta Halo-like Forerunner structures found on the map.

 <h3 id="warlock-rsquo-s-remake-map-conjurer">
  Warlock’s Remake Map Conjurer
 </h3>
 <p>
  Of Delta Arena’s remaining maps, two are made with a Covenant aesthetic, while one is made with human structures. The first map with a Covenant look is Conjurer, designed by MikRips, bullet2thehead9, and DISTORTED JAKAL. Featuring a distinctly Gothic architecture aesthetic similar to many medieval churches, Conjurer is a cramped temple filled with purple, glowing pillars and crystals reminiscent of Subanese crystals used in Needlers and Needle Rifles. Conjurer is a remake of
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  ’s Warlock, which itself was a remake of
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved
  </em>
  ’s Wizard. Beside Warlock and Conjurer, Wizard has only been remade one other time in
  <em>
   Halo 2: Anniversary
  </em>
  as Warlord.

  Midship’s Remake Map Inquisitor
 </h3>
 <p>
  Inquisitor is the most distinctly Covenant map featured in the Delta Arena playlist. Designed by UneeQ, Mr Greencastle, MikRips, ArtNoob, and WookieCookies, Inquisitor has players battle it out within an inner chamber found on a Covenant warship, curved, smooth, purple architecture and all. Inquisitor is a remake of
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  ’s Midship, which was later remade in
  <em>
   Halo 3
  </em>
  as Heretic and
  <em>
   Halo 5: Guardians
  </em>
  as Truth. Midship and Heretic are said to take place within the CCS-class
  <em>
   Pious Inquisitor
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  while Truth is said to take place within the CCS-class
  <em>
   Undiminished Entelechy

  Turf’s Remake Map Boulevard
 </h3>
 <p>
  The only clearly human set map in the Delta Arena playlist is Boulevard. Designed by UneeQ, Mr Greencastle, ArtNoob, and MikRips, Boulevard is presumibly set in the African city of New Mombasa due to its similar structuring to the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Halo Infinite
   </em>
  </strong>
  map Bazaar which is also set in the city. Here, red and blue teams will have to fight for control of a small street. Boulevard is a remake of
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  ’s Turf which was only officially remade one other time in
  <em>
   Halo Online
  </em>
  as Icebox, which itself was later ported to
  <em>
   Halo: The Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  . Boulevard is the only
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  remake map in Delta Arena that is based on a map found in
  <em>
   Halo 2
  </em>
  ’s Killtacular Pack DLC.

    Key Takeaways

   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      Open-world indie games offer dynamic gameplay with freedom and immersive experiences.

     <li>
      Combat is not the sole focus of open-world games, with dynamic encounters enhancing gameplay.
     </li>
     <li>
      Unique open-world games like
      <em>
       The Long Dark, STALKER,
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Kenshi

  <strong>
   Open-world games
  </strong>
  can come in all shapes and sizes, from the compact but varied open-worlds of games such as
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  to the expansive sandboxes of
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  . A quality that many of these games share, however, is dynamic gameplay, often facilitated through their open environments.

 <p>
  Many, but not all, open-world games feature combat as a core system.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , for example, is known for its well-tuned combat, but it could be argued that—while exploring—the player is in control of how these encounters begin and end, and very little changes during combat unless the player is fighting a boss. Some open-world games, however,
  <strong>
   feature dynamic encounters
  </strong>
  facilitated by simulation, wandering mobs, and/or emergent gameplay systems.

  Quiet, contemplative, and at times tranquil,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Long Dark
   </em>
  </strong>
  can be a frequently relaxing experience, bolstered by excellent sound design and a superb sense of place. While combat isn't a common occurrence in this title, nor a desirable one, each encounter with
  <em>
   The Long Dark's
  </em>
  wild animals is dynamic.

 <p>
  The tension brought on by a pack of wolves is palpable, especially when players are unprepared to deal with them, and stumbling across them is often a complete happenstance. Combat is often brief, depending on whether the player chooses to leg it or not, and can have serious repercussions long after it's over thanks to the game's affliction system.

  The combat encounters of
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade: Warband
  </em>
  are not only dynamic in their inception, but the battles themselves are often trapped in a constant ebb and flow. It's easy for a combat encounter to snowball in one direction or the other, but by allowing the player to control the pace of battle with strategic commands,
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade: Warband
  </em>
  is able to offer large-scale action with a dynamic flow.

   <em>
    STALKER: Shadow Of Chernobyl

  </strong>
  is a first-person shooter with a heavy focus on mood, atmosphere, and survival. Exploring the world of
  <em>
   STALKER

  isn't a seamless experience, as the game's open world is made up of several interconnected areas that are often treacherous to traverse, but it remains immersive thanks to excellent sound design, wandering mobs/NPCs, and dynamic combat encounters.

 <p>
  The dynamic nature of
  <em>
   STALKER's
  </em>
  combat encounters comes from the unpredictable nature of its enemies and environment alike, with anomalies sure to get in the player's way at some point during their playthrough. Often, combat will include multiple enemy types and even nearby NPCs, adding to the unpredictability of combat and ensuring that encounters are dynamic experiences every time.

  Focusing its efforts on simulation-heavy gameplay,

  The simple act of opening a bathroom door too haphazardly could result in a bite and, later, death. Hunger, thirst, temperature, and exhaustion, characters in
  <em>

  </em>
  are even more susceptible to "death by zombie" when their needs are not being met. Running upon a horde when exhausted will almost certainly lead to death, and they'll break down doors and smash windows with ease if their numbers are large enough.

  Many
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games are perfect for fans of dynamic open-world gameplay, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout: New Vegas
   </em>
  </strong>
  is just one example. However, this title plays host to a variety of distinctive, diverse environments populated by an ensemble of wandering mobs, memorable creatures, and unpredictable NPCs.

  It's not hard to get distracted exploring the wasteland of
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas,
  </em>
  and the dynamic enemy encounters that it facilitates are a large part of that. Encounters get even more dynamic when NPCs are involved, and the addition of VATS regularly changes the pace of the combat, interspersing the action with freeze-frames and slow-motion shots.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Xbox Series X/S
  </strong>
  family of consoles has achieved something impressive, passing the Nintendo 64 in sales. It's the latest in accolades that the Xbox Series has wracked up since its release back in 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  The N64 got its start way back in 1996, delivering Nintendo's first full 3D experiences to gamers at home. A strong lineup of N64 games like
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Donkey Kong 64
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Zelda: Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Majora's Mask
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  , and more helped to propel the third home console in Nintendo's lineup.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, according to VGChartz, the Nintendo 64 would move a whopping 32.93 million units in its lifetime. However, that impressive number has now been surpassed by the Xbox Series X/S, which together have sold an estimated 32.98 million units. That number was as of April 2024, so it's likely that the Xbox Series console sales have increased significantly since. Next up on the list to conquer would be the Sega Genesis with 34.06 million sales, and the Super Nintendo at 49.10 million.

  Xbox Series X/S Sales are Impressive, But Not Microsoft's Best
 </h2>
 <p>
  While these numbers may sound good on paper, there are a few caveats. The Nintendo 64 is actually one of the worst-selling Nintendo consoles, only outselling the GameCube and ill-fated Wii U. The original NES has sold 61.91 million, while the Switch, currently Nintendo's best-selling home system, has hit a stunning 150.52 million. The Xbox Series consoles would have to go a long way to compete with them, as well as their own predecessors, the Xbox One and Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 is still the king of Microsoft systems, with 85.73 million units sold, while the Xbox One sold a more modest 57.96 million, still presenting a tough number for the Xbox Series to beat.
 </p>
 <p>
  One interesting element, though, is that Xbox seems to be seeing some improvement in its sales in Japan since the last Xbox generation. The Xbox One struggled to move an estimated 120,000 units in the country. The Xbox Series X/S, on the other hand, has sold around 680,000 units in Japan. However, it still has a long way to go before it will meet the Xbox 360's numbers, as the 360 sold an estimated 1.66 million consoles in Japan. The improved sales of the Xbox Series consoles may be due in part to an increase in JRPGs available on Xbox.
 </p>
 <p>
  With all of that said, the PlayStation 2 remains the console to beat. While the PS2 has been dethroned as the best-seller in the US, it's still number one worldwide. With the Nintendo Switch 2 now out, it's unlikely that the original Switch's numbers will see a huge rise from this point forward, and it would need to sell 9.5 million more units to meet the PlayStation 2. Even PlayStation itself hasn't been able to beat that number, with its second-best system being the PS4, selling 117 million units, while the PS5 has only moved 76 million units. It seems likely that the PS2 will hold onto its crown for at least a few more years, depending on the success of the Switch 2 and future console generations.

 <p>
  Team Cherry has updated the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hollow Knight: Silksong
   </em>
  </strong>
  website to show all supported platforms for the game. With the release of
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  expected sometime in 2025, this latest website update has understandably excited many fans who have been waiting for years to play the title.
 </p>
 <p>
  First announced in February 2019,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  has been on gamers' radars for over six years. The game puts the player in control of Hornet, a character seen in the original
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  , and tasks them with exploring a new kingdom. While the game world appears different from 2017, the few looks Team Cherry has revealed show the game will include challenging boss fights fans have come to expect. Even though an official release date has yet to be revealed, gamers know the title is planned to release this year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ahead of its eventual launch, new updates for
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  have been rolling out. Recently, fans discovered that the official website has been updated. As highlighted by Primacon on social media, the supported platforms section now includes the PS4 and Switch 2 logos, revealing the list of systems that gamers will be able to play the game on once it is released. While it might not seem like a big deal, this update further suggests things are happening behind the scenes to make ready for the launch of the game.

  Hollow Knight: Silksong Website Updates Its List of Supported Platforms
 </h2>
 <p>
  Beyond this update to the official website,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  has received several recent updates to its Steam page. Some believed these previous updates indicated a potential announcement or shadow drop at Summer Game Fest. While this ultimately did not happen, they still suggest that the game could be coming sooner rather than later. For example, leaker Nate the Hate predicted the release date for
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  would be before the end of summer 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is worth noting that Team Cherry has recently commented on the release timing for
  <em>
   Hollow Knight: Silksong
  </em>
  . Following some confusion regarding whether its release was tied to the ROG Xbox Ally, marketing manager Matthew "Leth" Griffin said that the game would come sometime before the holiday season. "I confirmed BEFORE Holiday," he noted. Griffin went on to specify that he was talking about Christmas.

 <p>
  With this in mind, fans should wait to get their hopes up regarding a potential summer release date until an official announcement from the developer is made. Nevertheless, the amount of news about the game has increased since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct in April reconfirmed the 2025 release window. Hopefully, the wait is nearing an end for the
  <em>

  </em>
  community.

  Gamers will find various characters on the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  Battle Royale island, and each one provides a set of services that can be helpful during a match. This is why it's important for players to talk to each character as soon as they're introduced so they can complete the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  NPC Collection and have it as a resource whenever they start a game. This way, they know who's close to their current location and if they're worth talking to before moving on to the next looting spot.

   Fortnite
  </em>
  , knowing where to find friendly characters on the island could be crucial. This guide will show gamers where they can go in order to find every friendly non-playable character on the Chapter 6 Season 3 map.

 <p>
  With a rather large number of racing games releasing this year, many players are enthusiastically looking forward to putting the pedal to the metal with their favorite characters and franchises.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mario Kart World
   </strong>
  </em>
  has pushed the new era of the Switch 2 into overdrive and led the charge for the 2025 racing lineup with a strong start. Not only is
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  confidently leading Nintendo into a new console lifecycle, but it's also marking a new start for the kart racing franchise in general. It marks a lot of series firsts, adjustments, and improvements.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <p>
  The biggest first of
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  is most certainly its open-world approach. With an entire island to race, wall-ride, and rail grind around to discover surprises, this changes almost everything about what fans have come to expect from the
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  experience, even standard and Grand Prix races. There have also been a few tweaks to course design and gameplay balance that have had a great impact for the better on the experience as a whole. Items, the bane of most
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  players' existence, are now fun bumps in the road that keep the competition exciting.

  Mario Kart's Items Have Been a Blessing and a Curse For Years
 </h3>
 <p>
  For almost as long as the
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  series has been around, fans have known the pain of losing a perfect first place to a poorly timed blue shell and more. Every player knows the crushing defeat that's almost certain when enough items strike a racer at once, making it so they drop multiple places before they can even try to regain their lead. It's helped give
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  its chaotic and friendship-ruining reputation as a party game, but it's hard to imagine the franchise without it. After all, items are a key component to the kart racer sub-genre as they have plenty of advantages and disadvantages that are healthy for a fun competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Balance is key to making sure the items help give other players an advantage against their opponents while still allowing the ones who get hit to recover and have a chance to race. This is why first-place players get coins as their most frequent item to avoid them keeping their lead consistently with red shells, for example. Every
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  title handles its items and their effects differently.
  <em>
   Mario Kart World,
  </em>
  in particular, shortens the time items stun racers for, but that is only half the battle, as it also manages to balance its items efficiently as well.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-mario-kart-world-makes-items-fun-again">
  How Mario Kart World Makes Items Fun Again
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  takes great care of where item boxes are placed, making it so there won't be too many long intervals in courses without them, but there also aren't too many. The spacing between the item boxes feels just right when playing, giving players time to choose to use their item in the space between at just the right time before another one is up for grabs. Once again, certain items are only available in specific places to make sure things aren't completely out of control, and every item has its perks no matter where players get it if they know how to use it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Combined with how players no longer come to a complete stop and can easily pick up speed when an item strikes them,
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  offers some of the most unpredictable, chaotic, yet satisfying races in the series. This careful balancing act elevates so much of the open-world kart racer, making the new
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  modes breezy yet challenging, which matches well with its themes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  wouldn't feel nearly as amazing as it does to play without the careful consideration that was taken to its items. Even bananas and green shells were nearly cut from
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  during development to keep the gameplay flowing. Thanks to these decisions,
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  may remain one of the best racing games on the Switch 2 long into its lifespan.

 <p>
  Arrakis is a planet with dangerous terrain and threats that players will need to face while progressing further into
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dune Awakening
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Whether you strike a landing too hard while climbing or get hit by the enemy's firepower while raiding a camp, you're bound to lose health quite rapidly. Once HP depletes, players will have a limited window to self-revive; otherwise, they'll lose most of their resources. So, here's how you can heal your character and even increase your max HP to increase survivability.

  A Healkit is the first thing players will craft as they start
  <em>
   Dune Awakening
  </em>
  . It's one of the easiest healing items to craft in the game, as all it requires is 5x Plant Fiber. Plant Fibers can be found all over the regions of Arrakis, on and around landmasses. It restores
  <strong>
   a total of 50 HP
  </strong>
  , with 25 health being restored immediately, while the other 25 over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you progress further into the game and unlock more schematics, you'll be able to craft more powerful versions of the Healkits, starting with the Healkit MK2. This version requires double the Plant Fiber and Micro-Sandwich Fabric, which can be found inside moisture-sealed caves. These
  <strong>
   restore a total of 69 HP
  </strong>
  , with 34 HP being restored instantly and 35 HP over time.

 <p>
  While players can put on strong armor sets to increase their overall defense, there's only one way to increase the max health in
  <em>
   Dune Awakening
  </em>
  . If you've picked the Bene Gesserit mentor at the start of the game, you'll be able to
  <strong>
   invest skill points into Vitality
  </strong>
  . Each skill point invested increases the max health by 25 points.
 </p>
 <p>
  For players who chose another class in the character creator, they'll still be able to unlock the Bene Gesserit skill tree by finding its Trainer in
  <strong>
   the Eastern Shield Wall region
  </strong>
  . You'll need to do some quests to unlock the basic skill tree and find the advanced trainer to unlock the rest. Once players have maxed out the Vitality skill, they'll get an additional 75 points added to their max health.

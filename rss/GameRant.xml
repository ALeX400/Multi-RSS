   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3

  </strong>
  features a wide selection of feats to pick from, including a catalog of 41 feats adapted from
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition
  </em>
  . It's extremely important to make the right choices for a specific build or a character's progression to the next level.

 <p>
  There are only a few opportunities for players to learn new Feats in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , with a total of six for a character that reaches the level cap of 12, so making the right choice is a uniquely important decision. Fighters, a vintage class that has been in RPGs of all brands and types since the genre began, will learn additional feats at levels six and ten, providing extra opportunities to bolster their strength.

   The Fighter is one of the more forgiving classes when it comes to broken builds, thanks to its versatility when it comes to armor and weapon options. Re-speccing in BG3 only costs 100 gold each time, and a player with a decent Sleight of Hand skill can recover that from Withers easily. Some experimentation might be worth the cost for those who want to try multiclassing options, and the Fighter combines well with other class skills and party roles.

  Fighters will often find themselves on the front lines of battle, meaning they'll likely be taking just as many hits as they are dishing out. It's important to be able to stand up to the most brutal of punishment as a Fighter, and
  <strong>
   Tough
  </strong>
  is a great feat to help with this.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":918} -->

 <p>
  Tough grants two extra hit points for every level gained. This means that by level 12, a Fighter will gain an extra 24 hit points, which is more than decent. For some characters, this can represent a large percentage increase in available HP. It will no doubt allow a character to keep swinging in even the most tense of battles.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Martial Adept
  </strong>
  is a Feat that's ideal for any melee fighting build, so don't be afraid to use it with Rogues or Barbarians in addition to Fighters. There are 14 different Maneuvuers on this list, so even for those who already have chosen the Battlemaster subclass, this will make them even more effective.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1028} -->

 <p>
  The use of the Superiority Die is another bonus to this Feat. The Fighter gets to roll four, and it adds up to an impressive number. Before level 7, these dice are D8s, which is already generous. When the Fighter progresses to level 10, these become D10s.

  Fighters will often rely on two primary ability scores, Strength and Constitution. An ability score improvement is perhaps one of the more mundane Feats, but it is not to be underestimated. When creating a Fighter in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , a single core ability score can be as high as 17, but to achieve a Fighter's maximum potential, players will want to get their Strength or Constitution up to 20.

 <p>
  Ability Score Improvements allow a character to increase a single ability score by two, or two ability scores by one. This makes it a great option to bolster a Fighter's Strength or Constitution to give them a boost to their attack rolls, or their hit points.

  <strong>
   Charger
  </strong>
  is a great feat to expand a Fighter's pool of options in battle. It grants two additional attack types, Charger: Weapon Attack, and Charger: Shove. They both give a Fighter the ability to charge forward. Weapon Attack slams the Fighter's weapon into the first enemy in their path, and Shove pushes them off-balance, possibly Prone.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":940} -->

 <p>
  While this expands the options available to a Fighter during combat, it can be pretty situational and comes with a hefty resource cost of one action and one bonus action. The trade-off here is that it allows new possibilities to be opened up, and can potentially create a scenario for a spellcaster in the backline to drop a hefty fireball after an enemy is shoved within range of their attacks.

   Durable
  </strong>
  is a feat that lends itself well to those playing on higher difficulties, where long rests are generally more scarce. It increases the Fighter's Constitution score by one, inching it ever close to that coveted 20. It also allows a Fighter to regain all of their hit points on a short rest, which typically only restores 50% of total hit points.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":6,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":6,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1038} -->

 <p>
  As a Fighter is generally going to be on the front lines of battle, their hit points are an extremely valuable resource. While this may seem a little underwhelming on the surface, this feat allows Fighters to keep battling without the need for long rests, and will generally save on resources like healing spells and healing potions, which leave them available for squishier members of the adventuring party, like Wizards and Sorcerers.

 <p>
  Fighter builds that are based on ranged or melee damage might not benefit as much from this Feat, but it's excellent for defensive roles or for a Fighter that needs more AC. The Dexterity bonus can top up a character with a high ability score already, and for a Fighter that has a higher Strength, it gives them a better dodge and block chance.

 <p>
  Shield Master: Block is intended to protect the Fighter from magical attacks. When they make their Dexterity saving throw to dodge a spell, the Fighter can use a Reaction to use the shield to diminish the incoming damage. Even on a losing throw, they still only take half damage.

 <p>
  This also prevents weak taps, which can sometimes be the bane of martial characters, especially in a high-stakes fight with a powerful enemy. This feat will ensure that the Fighter is outputting more damage on average, which is usually their role in the adventuring party.

  <strong>
   Great Weapon Master
  </strong>
  is an excellent feat that has toggleable features, which can provide excellent versatility depending on what is needed in the heat of battle. After choosing this feat, a Fighter that lands a critical hit, or kills a target with a melee weapon attack, is then able to make an additional melee weapon attack as a bonus action that turns.
 </p>

 <p>
  When attacking with a heavy melee weapon that the Fighter is proficient with, there is an option that can be toggled on or off that deals an additional 10 damage, with the caveat that there is a -5 attack roll penalty. A Fighter can stack these and ensure they are dishing out up to 3 attacks per turn, and when combined with a feat like Savage Attacker or Sentinel, this provides a huge boost to their attack power.

  <strong>
   Mage Slayer
  </strong>
  is an exceptionally deadly feat that allows Fighters to take on spellcasters with ease. Spellcasters can be particularly formidable opponents, especially when utilizing area-of-effect attacks, or attacks that force a saving throw from the target.

 <p>
  This feat grants Advantage on all saving throws against a spell that is cast within melee range of the Fighter and allows for the Fighter to use their reaction to attack the caster. If this wasn't powerful enough, it also imposes a disadvantage on Concentration saving throws after a Fighter makes a melee attack against a spellcaster, ensuring their powerful spells come to an end.

 <p>
  The concept of Initiative works slightly differently in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  than it does in
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
  </em>
  Instead of rolling a d20 and adding a Dexterity modifier, a d4 is rolled instead and then combined with a Dexterity modifier. This means that Initiative orders are usually much closer, and any additional bonuses to Initiative rolls are exceedingly helpful.

 <p>
  Alert provides a whopping +5 bonus to Initiative, meaning that the Fighter will almost always take the top spot, or will be near enough to the top spot in the initiative order. It also prevents the Fighter from ever being surprised in combat, which can prevent devastating ambushes as the Fighter is always ready to jump into battle.

   Sentinel
  </strong>
  is an excellent feat that further allows for a Fighter to provide much-needed support to their squishy allies. This feat allows a Fighter to spend their reaction to make a weapon attack against an enemy who attacks an ally, provided that the enemy does not also have the Sentinel feat.

 <p>
  This Feat also grants the Fighter an advantage on opportunity attacks, and on a successful hit, prevents the creature from moving for the rest of their turn. That means any enemy attempting to retreat is sorely hindered and left vulnerable for the rest of the party.

 <p>
  In a game with "dungeon" in the title, this Feat is almost too obvious, but it is a good one even when playing an adventure that doesn't involve a conventional dungeon. The abilities that improve Perception and Resist Traps also work in castles, prisons, hideouts, and a variety of other locations.

 <p>
  The Perception side of this helps the Fighter detect hidden or obscured objects and secret doors and gives them Advantage on their saving throws. Resist Traps, on the other hand, doesn't help find traps. It means that the character has a better resistance to damage caused by traps.

 <p>
  Barbarians and Paladins can also get a lot from this Feat because they are classes that prioritize Strength. The main stat of the Fighter is also Strength, and this Feat relies on that ability, which is one of the reasons why Tavern Brawler is one of the best choices.

 <p>
  What makes Tavern Brawler a popular Feat in the game is the variety of opportunities available for improvised weapon attacks. Players can throw almost anything provided they have the required Strength, and options include crates, chests, bottles of water, or even other characters.

  This is a great feat in both
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3

  and
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  . Any Fighter wielding a glaive, halberd, quarterstaff, or spear is granted the ability to make an additional attack using the butt of their weapon. It only costs a bonus action, which provides a huge boon to martial characters and allows them to deliver the final killing blow on a weak enemy.

  <strong>
   Polearm Master

  also provides a cool twist on Opportunity Attacks, which typically are only triggered when a target moves out of melee attack range.

  players aren't happy with the AI in the game and some of the bizarre moments NPCs exhibit. Frustration with the game is rising, and gamers want to see
  <em>
   GTA 6

  dramatically improve upon
  <em>

  </em>
  and
  <em>

 <p>
  Getting AI to cooperate and behave properly in an open world game is seemingly never an easy task for developers. Open world games like
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  , and others are notorious for having NPCs act oddly, disappear off the map, shoot through walls, and so on. In addition to the usual necessity of having AI pose a challenge to the player without being completely overpowering, the sheer scope of some games seem to make matters worse.

  player martinbean shared their broken AI experience with fellow fans, and it's understandable why they're frustrated. A brief clip shows the player taking cover during a firefight. As they creep toward the edge of it to resume fighting, an NPC suddenly appears right in front of them and immediately draws his weapon and fires, killing the player instantly. Martinbean was given less than a second to react, making getting out of this particular scenario extremely difficult if not entirely impossible.

  GTA Players Complain About the Game's AI
 </h2>
 <p>
  Outside of responding with
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  memes and jokes, many fans have expressed frustration and anger with the AI in the game. Some speculated that this could have been a hacker messing with the player, but others reported having experienced similar encounters of their own in various missions. The frustration with the game is clearly high, with some players noting that if
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  doesn't have hugely improved AI, they won't be playing the game. It's an understandable stance to take, considering NPC behavior plays a huge role in
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  games whether online or offline.

  Having a problem like this appear is a major inconvenience, especially if the player is participating in a mission that gives them limited lives to work with. Losing is one thing, but this type of situation is simply unfair. To make matters worse, as the OP indicates in their post's title, enemy AI isn't the only problem in the game. Players have said for years that
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  's traffic behaves erratically, with cars and pedestrians randomly veering into the player's vehicle, causing accidents or worse. It's been an issue for so long that it's become something of a meme, but it's still annoying to encounter, especially during car chases or other intense moments.

  With
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  being so old at this point, it's somewhat understandable that the game may be having problems. However, even
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , which is signifcantly younger, has its own AI problems. With any luck, Rockstar Games has further refined the way bots work, as
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  has a lot to live up to in order to meet player expectations.

      Concord's development spanned 8 years, surprising the gaming industry due to this lengthy cycle because of Firewalk's young age.

     <li>
      Sony's investment in Firewalk and Concord is evident, with top-notch visuals and a strong marketing push for the game's release.
     </li>
     <li>
      Despite heavy marketing efforts, Concord's launch numbers have been underwhelming, with a peak player count of just 697 on PC.

 <p>
  As Firewalk's Lead Character Designer, Jon Weisnewski, confirmed in a recent Tweet,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Concord
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been in development for around eight years. This news comes as a pretty big surprise to many in the gaming industry, not just because developer Firewalk was founded just six years ago, but also because that's an incredibly long development cycle for a multiplayer video game, even one that now falls under PlayStation's first-party umbrella.

 <p>
  In April 2021, Sony announced that it was entering an exclusive publishing partnership with Firewalk Studios, and two years later, the studio was officially acquired by Sony. Though the exact details are a little hazy, it seems likely that Sony has invested a great deal in Firewalk and
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  over the last few years.
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  is now officially out, and while it might not be leading the charge for PlayStation's live-service department as intended, its first-party budget does give it one or two edges over its competition.

 <h3 id="concord-39-s-visuals-are-top-of-the-line">
  Concord's Visuals Are Top-Of-The-Line
 </h3>
 <p>
  Probably the clearest indication of
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's presumed higher budget, the hero shooter's visuals look spectacular across the board. Leaning heavily into its
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy
  </em>
  influences,
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  is filled with brief moments of vibrant color, with its hyperspace loading screens popping suddenly with a rainbow of light, and certain special abilities emitting a dazzling array of sparks and flashes. Many of
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's particle effects are also suitably vibrant, while still feeling grounded in the game's universe.

 <p>
  Though the designs themselves have been criticized for being too generic or derivative,
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's playable Freegunners all boast some extremely detailed character models and some impressive motion capture. The animations in general are pretty great, with even the Freegunners' reload animation injecting a subtle but neat layer of charm that distinguishes them from one another.

 <p>
  It may not have the same fidelity as a game like
  <em>
   Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2
  </em>
  , or the same heavily stylized pop as a game like
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's visuals are a key strength. And when compared to its more cartoony competition,
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's more grounded Sci-Fi art style does go a long way in making it stand out from the crowd.

  Concord's Marketing Is Keeping It in The Public Eye
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another clear indication of
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's status as a first-party PlayStation title is its rather extensive marketing campaign. Along with multiple pre-release trailers,
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  has been pushed to the front of social media platforms like TikTok, where ads for the game run frequently. With
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's Open Beta being a bit of a disappointment when it came to active players, this heavy marketing push both before and after
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's release makes a lot of sense.

 <p>
  But despite PlayStation's best efforts,
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's launch-day numbers aren't looking too hot. According to SteamDB,
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  has an all-time peak player count of just 697 players, and at the time of writing, it's been three days since the game had its full launch. Though
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's marketing has kept it in the conversation, it doesn't seem to have encouraged many players to jump aboard, at least on PC.

    <ul>
     <li>
      Art-house horror games focus on evoking emotions and exploring the uncanny rather than traditional scares through suspense-building.
     </li>
     <li>
      Games like The Space Between and No One Lives Under The Lighthouse deliver narrative-driven horror with unsettling atmospheres.

 <p>
  With the growing success of art-house horror in cinema, it’s only natural that enthusiasts would look to the gaming sphere for further examples and for developers to look to cinema for inspiration for their games. However, the definition of art-house is as nebulous as the emotions it evokes.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":300} -->
 <p>
  Unlike conventional horror games that rely on suspense-building and misdirection to frighten the player, art-house horror instead explores the uncanniness that lives in the liminal space between uncertainty and fear. It employs fear as a vehicle to drive the narrative rather than being a mere outcome. If traditional horror is the shock of a monster leaping from the shadows, then art-house is the unsettling sense of being watched, even when nothing is there.

  The opening scroll of

  There’s a clear—if somewhat heavy-handed—thematic and narrative throughline in play, as the game explores Matt’s complex relationships with others and lack thereof, filtered through an abstract, retro-aesthetic.

  This is evident during the game’s chase sequences, which employ a
  <strong>
   subjective camera
  </strong>
  from the chaser’s perspective, while the player remains in control of the protagonist, adding a disorienting—and horrifying—twist to the gameplay.

  During the late 19th century, polio was ravaging the Americas and Europe. There wasn’t, and still isn’t, any cure for the virus. The best outcome was palliative care and a painless passing; the second best would be spending life in an ‘

  Fans of the horror genre are more than familiar with the haunted house trope, but what
  <em>
   Anatomy
  </em>
  instead explores is what happens when the home itself becomes the haunting entity. The game delves into themes of loss—specifically, the loss of a home—and how people can so easily discard or abuse something they once cherished.

 <p>
  Often, moving house is treated with the same indifference as booking a holiday. In
  <em>
   Anatomy
  </em>
  , the house is anthropomorphized; it yearns, feels, and holds grudges and will seek revenge—turning an abode of safety into a prison that serves only to relieve the grief and fury of the warden.

  The game plays as if reading a Shakespearean tragedy, but each page is made of sandpaper, and the nerves in the reader’s fingers are fully exposed. And yet, beyond all of that, there lies arguably one of the best narratively driven games within the genre. There’s a reason why many gamers who power through and experience this tragedy on stage always look back on it fondly but can never recommend it.

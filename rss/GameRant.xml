  The tower defense aspect of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Two Crowns
   </strong>
  </em>
  is quite important to the story, though it remains a city building game at its core. Defending against waves of enemies coming to your kingdom isn't the only thing players need to do to win the game; they need to strike back and take back from Greed what is rightfully their land.

  Greed is the entity that sends out its troops to fight the player at night. If you want to win the game, you'll need to eradicate its presence from all islands on the map by destroying all of its portals, through which its troops come to attack your kingdom. However, players can't fight back until they reach a certain point.

 <p>
  In order to fight back against Greed, players need to
  <strong>
   gain access to stone
  </strong>
  , found on the second island. Stone is a resource which lets players upgrade their town center to tier 6 and progress into the Stone Age, which gives them access to squires. At town center tier 6, players can buy shields, which are taken up by villagers who become squires. You can buy four shields in total, two for each side of the map.

  The squires you hire take up command over a
  <strong>
   squad of archers
  </strong>
  and can be ordered to launch an offensive attack on portals. Giving squires extra gold means they'll be able to retain their shields longer, losing coins instead of the shield when attacked by greedlings.

  Once you have squires and a squad that they command, you can launch an attack on the portals surrounding your kingdom. To do so, go to the outermost wall of your settlement, where you will see a sign that you can interact with. Here,
  <strong>
   pay four coins to deploy a squad

  A squad consists of one squire with a shield and a handful of archers that follow behind him. These troops will attack the nearest portal. When the portal is attacked, it will launch a counterattack and spawn greedlings that will fight back. If your squire runs out of extra gold, it will lose its shield on being attacked, and the squad will dissolve. The archers will run back behind the wall, and the squire will become a regular villager.

  It is difficult for players in the early game to launch successful attacks against the Greed. There are a few things you should keep in mind before you start your attack in order to maximize your chance for success.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Expand Your Kingdom:
   </strong>
   To make sure that your squad reaches the portal as soon as possible, players should expand as much as they comfortably can. This means building the outer walls of your settlement as close to the portal as possible without triggering it. Doing so will ensure that your attacking party won't get caught out by the nightly wave, and they'll be able to retreat with minimal casualties if the squire falls in battle.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Optimal Timing:
   </strong>
   The best time to send out your army is right after the nightly wave. This gives you the most time before the next night's wave, avoiding any unnecessary casualties.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Squad Size:
   </strong>
   If you don't have enough archers, your squad will be underequipped to handle the threat of the Greed. Make sure you have enough archers for the squad you're about to send out. Otherwise, you won't be able to deal enough damage to the portal before your squire falls in battle.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Activate the Archer Statue:
   </strong>
   Make sure you activate the archer statue on the first island. This will give a boost to all your archers, no matter the island, increasing your damage output quite a lot.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Deployment Strategy:
   </strong>
   Send out both of your squads at once. If you have cleared one side of the kingdom, send out the third and fourth squads as well to minimize the amount of time you need to finish off the portal. The more firepower you have, the better.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Pay Raise:
   </strong>
   Make sure you give some gold coins to your squires. This way, they don't lose their shields when they die. Instead, they will lose a few coins. If you want to destroy the portal without any deaths on your side at all, go along with the attacking party and drop multiple coins where your squires are holding the line. This way, they can replenish the coins they lose and continue fighting longer. Whenever they lose coins, give them more to keep them alive longer. Don't worry, the greedlings won't steal the coins unless you drop them closer to the portal than to the squires.
  </li>
 </ul>

  After you destroy a portal, your squad will go back to base. In place of the portal, players can construct a teleporter, costing 8 coins. Once the construction is finished, the monarch can interact with it to place its twin anywhere on the map, which is where it will teleport the player when it is used.

  Once a twin is placed,

  . To teleport again, you just need to pay two coins again from either of its locations. This makes traveling between the two sides of the kingdom much more convenient.

  <strong>
   Strategy games
  </strong>
  are not for everyone, as they can be really fun to play, but also require tons of planning and a lot of patience, which is something not many players have. Over the last few decades, tons of different strategy titles have been released, helping shape the genre further and laying the foundations for developers to innovate or build on what already exists.

  While most strategy games have one way or another to help players progress through their stories and grow stronger, some have better upgrade mechanics than others. By allowing players to upgrade their units in different ways, the gaming experience becomes more complete and enjoyable. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best strategy games with power creep mechanics.

  The game has a very strong upgrade system, which allows players to make their units stronger for combat and keep evolving to face the ever-increasing challenges that they'll be dealing with throughout the campaign.
  <em>
   StarCraft 2
  </em>
  presents players with attack upgrades that increase the damage dealt by all their units, as well as armor upgrades, which make units more resilient to damage. Within a few hours, players will notice their armies are much more formidable and less susceptible to being eliminated early on.

  is yet another great strategy game with an amazing power creep system, as it allows players to evolve their units and civilizations throughout the story. The game's goal is to develop a primitive society and slowly turn it into an advanced one throughout the centuries. The more players advance their civilization, the more powerful it will be and the greater their chances of success.

  As players progress through the game, they will have the chance to implement technological developments into their civilizations, rendering units from earlier eras obsolete. This, in turn, results in obtaining much stronger, newer units that are better at fighting and surviving the many challenges players will encounter. Gold is typically the requirement for upgrades, and the more players work on their civilizations, the more expensive further upgrades will be. If players use their Gold wisely, before long, they'll have extremely powerful armies to take over the entire world.

   <strong>

  is, along with other titles, among the founders of what is arguably the best era of strategy games. Released in 1999, it featured a complete and complex gaming experience that got millions of players hooked from the start.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition

  sticks to this proud tradition by featuring the base game and DLC expansions of the HD version, while also offering players a free expansion called "The Last Khans", which includes four additional civilizations.

  While playing the game, players will have access to upgrades, which allow for the creation of better army units and stronger buildings that are more resilient. Upgrades are typically reflected in the improvement of the attributes of players' units, which, in turn, results in a more satisfying combat experience. Throughout the game, players will be able to notice their armies growing more resilient, and overall better at dealing with enemy forces.

  When asked about it, many Nintendo Switch owners agree that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fire Emblem: Three Houses
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the best strategy RPGs ever released on the console. This game focuses on the story of Byleth, a mercenary turned professor who is instructed to teach the students of a military academy in the middle of political turmoil. Not only is the game's story very interesting, but it also has a lot of options for players to upgrade their units and grow stronger, allowing for outstanding power creep mechanics.

  Not only can players strengthen their units through various methods to make challenges simpler, but it's also possible to recruit members from other houses with enough story progression. So, in a nutshell,
  <em>
   Fire Emblem: Three Houses
  </em>
  allows for an unmatched power increase through skills, upgrades, and an increment in numbers. Players should consider, however, that to recruit students from other houses, they'll need the right stats and enough experience, as otherwise, they won't be interested in joining their cause.

  Although
  <em>
   <strong>
    Europa Universalis 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  isn't the first game to use the concept of leading civilizations from one period of history to another while conquering other nations and seeking territory expansion, it does its job very well. Players will start in 1444, right in the middle of the transition from the Middle Ages, to the peak of the Renaissance, and end in 1821. This title not only features strategic gameplay in warfare, but also allows for diplomatic solutions in some situations.

  Moreover, players can upgrade many aspects of their empire, such as their Centers of Trade, which directly impacts their Trade power. The more Trade power players have, the more money they can make from their mercantile activities, and the more money they can spend on expanding their territories and improving their civilizations. While players might start out making pennies, with enough effort and the right investments, they'll be dominating other nations and swimming in pools of gold before long.

      <title>Roblox: Anime Defenders Codes (October 2024)</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/roblox-anime-defenders-codes/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There are plenty of great tower defense games on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but few that are quite as well fleshed out as
  <em>
   Anime Defenders
  </em>
  . The game has a unique and varied selection of units for players to choose from and plenty of challenging levels in which they can show off and hone their skills.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":281} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":200,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: featured video below first paragraph! -->
 <p>
  Before they can start pulling for the best units, though,
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  players will first need to get their hands on a healthy supply of Gems. They can do this simply by playing the game if they want to, but can speed up the process dramatically by redeeming
  <em>
   Anime Defenders
  </em>
  codes.

  <em>
   Update 7 is finally here, and with it comes three new Anime Defenders codes. After redeeming them, players should take a moment to bookmark this page and be sure to check back here often, as we're constantly on the lookout for new codes for Anime Defenders and will add any that we find to the list below.

  As you progress through the game, you'll need to upgrade your town center to recruit knights that can attack greed's portals. However, after a certain point, you won't be able to upgrade it any more without obtaining stone. Stone Technology is the next step to uniting the lands under one ruler.

  Many buildings don't let players upgrade them any further until they unlock stone technology. For example, walls and archer towers cannot be upgraded to tier three, and the town center doesn't go beyond Tier 4. To get these upgrades, players need to obtain stone, an important resource that can be found on the second island.

  To reach the second island, players need to find and repair a ship. There will be a ship wreck on the starting island, which will only take 10 coins. If you're on the first island, you don't need to spend any money on ship parts, the game will provide them alongside the ship's hull. Wait for the workers to finish construction and pay two more coins to get the ship into the water.

  Once in the water, workers will come and push the boat to shore, where players can pay ten more coins to leave on an aquatic adventure to discover more islands. After the cutscene finishes playing, click any of the arrow keys to bring up the map and select the second island as your destination. The ship will crash on the island, leaving you free to explore and build. If you want to go back to the first island or go to a new one, you just need to rebuild the ship and repeat the process.

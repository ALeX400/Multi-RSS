      Roadhog's rework in
      <em>
       Overwatch 2
      </em>
      has made him less frustrating to deal with and provided him with new tools like the Pig Pen ability for crowd control.
     </li>
     <li>
      Sombra, Pharah, Illari, and Zenyatta are effective counters to Roadhog, each with their own unique strengths and abilities.
     </li>
     <li>
      Ana is Roadhog's best counter due to her ability to prevent his healing and immobilize him with Sleep Dart, making him vulnerable to attacks.

 <p>
  November 2023 saw the massive Roadhog rework in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  and the powerful and often annoying tank was made easier to deal with. His ability, Pig Pen, gives him some crowd-control, so he can do more than just deal damage, and Take a Breather was reworked to be a resource rather than a “don’t die” button. This rework and subsequent patches brought in more complexity and a higher skill ceiling, resulting in Roadhog's counters in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  changing by a fair margin.

 <p>
  While the rework was a solid move, the new Roadhog shares many similarities with the old version. He can still seem unkillable without coordination and can punish squishy targets with his hook. However, some characters can
  <strong>
   easily counter Roadhog in
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and players just need to know who the right pick is to delete that pesky tank.

   <strong>
    Updated on August 21, 2024, by Amjad A. Asma:
   </strong>
   Amid the number of hero adjustments in each season, Roadhog in Overwatch 2 has retained the status of "annoying tank" with his well-rounded arsenal comprising self-sustenance and crowd control. Following the major changes to his kit in November 2023, he lost some of his old flares only to gain a high skill ceiling. This, in the right hands, can bring impressive results and wins across the board. When planned carefully, Roadhog’s Pig Pen and Chain Hook combo is an instant kill for squishy targets.

 <p>
  Regardless, some heroes have the tools to become dominating Roadhog counters in Overwatch 2. Players can rely on someone who can either go toe-to-toe against the tank or deal adequate damage while staying out of his range. Overall, teamplay is the key to taking down this enforcer from Overwatch 2's Junkertown map.

 <p>
  Before his rework, Sombra was a great Roadhog counter in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  . The Hack was the perfect tool to interrupt Take a Breather and deny all that healing. However, it is now a channeled ability, meaning that the tank can just reactivate it after the hack and significantly reduce the window of vulnerability.

 <p>
  Still, Sombra isn’t a bad Roadhog counter in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  . Her Hack can increase the damage she deals (by 25%), and Virus deals more than a quarter of his health. Players should pick the DPS if they are confident in their abilities and good at deciding when to engage. However, if they aren’t a dedicated Sombra main, easier Roadhog counters can be used in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Illari isn’t exactly a direct counter for Roadhog in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , but she can be an excellent support for teams going against the menacing tank. Her Solar Rifle can deal excellent damage from range with a decent headshot multiplier. Illari players should be able to poke opponents with charged shots and make the tank focus more on healing instead.

 <p>
  When hooked, Illari has better odds of escaping, even when compared to some of the best support heroes in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  . She can use the Outburst to leap away in the opposite direction, but playing outside Roadhog’s range wouldn’t bring up the situation in the first place. Lastly, her Captive Sun ability has always been a threat during teamfights, so comps running the ‘hog’ will have to rethink before any engagements.

 <p>
  Ranged characters are extremely effective against Roadhog in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , especially when they can play from a position where the Scrap Gun’s damage falls off. As a flying DPS, Pharah checks out the box, spending most of her time in the air and out of the tank's reach. In fact, she has excellent mobility with her Jet Dash, and when paired with the Jump Jets, it is a nightmare for Roadhog players when they cannot hook her down from flight.

 <p>
  Not to forget, Pharah can poke the tank's teammates, forcing them to mold their strategy accordingly. Her Concussive Blast is also a great tool to scatter the backline, effectively hindering their assistance. Overall, with her agility and further reach, Pharah is one of the
  <strong>
   best Roadhog counters in
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Ashe is less of a counter to Roadhog in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  and more of a hero who takes advantage of the tank's weaknesses. The big bad has no way to block his teammates besides literally standing in front of them. Roadhog's focus on short-range combat means that snipers are free to take shots at their supports and DPS.

 <p>
  On the off chance that players do get hooked, they can try to escape with the Coach Gun ability. Widowmaker has similar advantages but is beaten by Ashes' versatility. She can deal AoE damage with her dynamite, and B.O.B. can be a nuisance if placed right. So, find a good sniping spot and get comfortable; it's not like Roadhog can do anything about it.

 <p>
  If there’s any tank in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  that can go toe-to-toe against Roadhog, it is Mauga. This duel-wielding mercenary has a few moves up his sleeves, including the ability to obtain overhealth from his Berserker's passive. So, players can expect to see a drawn-out battle between the two, where the one with the highest sustainability should win. Although, this may change in the future as a Mauga rework in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  seems to be on the cards.

 <p>
  Mauga has better odds since he can turn Roadhog’s body into a giant crit spot using his Incendiary Chaingun and Volatile Chaingun combo. The latter will be forced to play defensively unless he wants to tank the deadly barrage. Mauga also has a range advantage for using guns and can escape the hook with his Overrun ability, making him a great hero to counter Roadhog in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Zenyatta’s Discord Orb is a handy counter against Roadhog in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  as it increases all damage done to its target by 25%. This effectively means that Zen's team only has to deal 560 damage to kill Roadhog (as opposed to the usual 700). However, the monk is a risky counter because, if he is hooked, doom is assured. Any Roadhog can easily deal with a pesky Zenyatta in about two shots.

 <p>
  The support does have an escape route via his snap kick to give him a little space, but without any movement abilities, it likely won’t be enough. Zenyatta has great lore in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  and is a fairly decent character, but some other supports can deal with Roadhog with less of a risk.

 <p>
  While other heroes in this list usually have very specific methods for countering Roadhog in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , Bastion's strategy is fairly straightforward. The tank is tough to kill because of his ability to heal; the simplest solution is to deal damage faster than he can replenish his health. Bastion's Configuration: Assault can deal over 2000 damage in a single use.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":10,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":10,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1039} -->

 <p>
  This is more than enough to take care of Roadhog or get him extremely close. Not only that, but Bastion has a great ultimate that can finish off the fleeing tank or take out his supports (pairing it with Mauga's ultimate makes it a devastating combo). Players should just make sure that Bastion doesn't get hooked. If he keeps his distance, there's little that a Roadhog can do besides switching heroes.

 <p>
  Zarya is an amazing pick to counter Roadhog in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , so long as players play smart. Even if the latter hooks the former in for a kill, he will suddenly get a shield absorbing all that damage. Zarya thrives when she can put her shields directly in harm's way, and Roadhog isn’t exactly subtle about what he’s about to do.

 <p>
  Zarya can get into trouble if she runs out of shields, but strategic use can easily create a situation where Roadhog hooking allies (or Zarya herself) actually becomes beneficial to the team. Once she has built up enough of a charge, she can punish the opponent tank and finish him off.

 <p>
  While Echo may be a difficult
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  hero to play at times, she can take Roadhog out with the right timing. Given that he doesn’t have any means of shielding against incoming damage, his health is in constant flux as the game progresses. Echo’s Focusing Beam deals 3.5 times more damage to targets below 50%, meaning that, in one use of the ability, she can deal a whopping 350 damage to a single target.

 <p>
  In addition, Echo can use her Sticky Bombs to get him below that 50% threshold and use her Flight ability to make her a difficult target to hit. Overall, she is a good Roadhog counter in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  because, if she uses her abilities correctly, she can take him out alone.

 <p>
  Ana is easily the
  <strong>
   best Roadhog counter in
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  because of how much the tank relies on his ability to heal, something the support is very good at preventing. Ana's Biotic Grenade inflicts anti-healing on enemies for three and a half seconds. During this time, Roadhog loses his primary survival tools, mostly leaving his supports powerless to help him. However, the rework does remedy this weakness a bit.

 <p>
  If Take a Breather is used, Roadhog still gets the damage reduction, but that's it. Ana's Sleep Dart is also perfect for interrupting his Ult or saving a teammate if they've been hooked. Picking Ana will always give a Roadhog trouble and provide plenty of opportunities for their team to deal with the tank. Moreover, her overall prowess makes her a great counter for Sombra in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  as well, in case fans are having trouble with the DPS character.

  Niantic has announced that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  's September 2024 Community Day will feature Ponyta and Galarian Ponyta.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players will have the opportunity to catch the popular Fire-type from Kanto and its regional variant from Hisui, with the luckiest trainers able to find both creatures in shiny form.

 <p>
  Niantic had recently teased September's Community Day Pokemon, indicating that players would have not just one but two monsters to capture. Interestingly, this isn't the first time the developer has announced this kind of Community Day. Previously, the March 2022 edition featured Sandshrew and its Alolan form, while 2023 had Slowpoke and Galarian Slowpoke in March and Wooper and its Paldean variant in November.

  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  revealed Ponyta and Galarian Ponyta as the September Community Day critters. The event will take place on September 14 from 2 pm to 5 pm local time, and during this period, the two Pokemon will appear more frequently in the wild. By evolving Ponyta or Galarian Ponyta during the event or up to five hours after it, trainers will get Rapidash or Galarian Rapidash that knows Charged Attack Wild Charge, an attack that deals 90 damage in trainer battles and 100 damage in gyms and raids. Like in other Community Days, a Special Research will be available for $1.00 USD and can be gifted to friends with Friendship level Great Friends or higher.

  While the Meta Quest 2 is starting to show its age, not all users have migrated to a newer verison of the wireless virtual reality headset. It also hasn't been abandoned by Meta. In fact, the Meta Quest 2 previously received a new feature that only it and the Meta Quest Pro got for a period of time. Fans using the older virtual reality headset will be glad to know that the parent company is still looking for ways to make the device even better for existing owners.

  Meta Quest 2 now has access to Multimodal, a form of control that implements the ability to freely utilize the controllers and hand controls at the same time. This feature was previously limited to the newer versions of the devices. While the Meta Quest 2 had a version of the mode, it required that users own the Touch Pro controllers, not the default Meta Quest 2 controllers. While the Meta Quest line of VR headsets has had hand controls for four years now, Multimodal is a step-up in convenience and capability.

 <h2 id="the-difference-between-multimodal-and-prior-controls">
  The Difference Between Multimodal and Prior Controls
 </h2>
 <p>
  When hand tracking launched for the Meta Quest, it required users to switch between using controllers or using their hands to interact with the device. There was a delay in doing so, and using one form of control would disengage the other. In other words, using one's hands would cause the tracking of the controllers to cease, and vice versa. Now, however, the Meta Quest 2 had the same feature as the newer headsets, allowing developers to let users seamlessly switch between the two. It also means that the headset can track the controllers and a user's hands at the same time, which could open up some interesting possibilities for tracking body movement.

 <p>
  While this feature is now available on Meta Quest 2, whether developers make use of it is another matter. Multimodal isn't supported by many developers, but this could be partially due to not wanting to alienate a large portion of the current Meta Quest user community. With the function now available across all currently-supported Meta headsets, it's possible that it could gain favor with developers and be put into use in the future. However, only time will tell.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  games are loved by a niche crowd who enjoy the repetitive nature of combat. They are compelled by the sheer variety of characters who excel at different weapons from swords and spears to more audacious things like yo-yos or fans. It’s a popular enough franchise with many spinoffs including some based on
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Those games aren’t well-known for their deep narratives and that’s fine. All some players need is a good combat system to get them heated up to play more. Here are some offerings that elevate the action gameplay beyond the simple hack and slash nature of
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  although again, there’s nothing wrong with them. If these examples have good stories too then that’s merely a bonus.

  <em>
   Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow

  was the culmination of the Metroidvania entries that came before it. Players inhabited Soma Cruz who once again tried to fight off the monsters of the night under Dracula’s curse. Defeated enemies could drop loot from weapons to armor for Soma to equip. Soma could also learn magic spells from monsters, giving him more abilities. Besides the leveling-up system, it gave players more ways to interact with the world.

  <em>

  took a decade to come out but when it did, it hit hard. The battle system in particular was a favorite among fans as it evolved systems that came before it namely things Square Enix tried with various
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  entries. Noctis could throw his blades at enemies and warp toward them. Besides melee attacks, Noctis could cast spells and his comrades aided in the fight as well. The coolest element of the combat system came with the Summons that were otherworldly and their attacks absolutely devastated foes.

  Not everyone in the press loved
  <em>
   Forspoken
  </em>
  for its story as told in the many reviews. However, the one universal thing the media and fans dug was the magic system. The heroine, Frey, could learn magic spells by defeating bosses and putting points into a skill tree to diversify her casts.

  Fire magic could burn the world while wind magic could uplift foes and cut them down. Even the smallest of spells made players look cool thanks to the particle effects system in the game.

  The
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  franchise began by giving Sora a basic magic system along with a pretty hefty Keyblade for hack and slash gameplay. The series evolved over time and the last mainline entry,
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  , took things to a new level. Sora’s Keyblade still did a good amount of damage along with his magic from Fire to Blizzard. There was more to it though as the Keyblade could transform into other weapons based on the player’s combos such as a gun or a hammer. Plus players could summon famous Disney attractions during certain sections like a teacup ride or a train. It made battles wildly intense with new things popping up frequently.

  <em>
   Mega Man Battle Network
  </em>
  was a mix of a few genres and it was the first true RPG in the
  <em>
   Mega Man
  </em>
  franchise. Players were a normal kid, Lan, who could jack in his NetNavi, MegaMan.Exe, into different terminals. Command would then switch over to MegaMan.Exe in online dungeons wherein battles were randomized. During the battle, players could move MegaMan.Exe on a tactical grid and use cards to give him attacks from a sword swipe to a cannon blast. The hodgepodge of genres proved to work well as the game was followed by many sequels and spinoffs.

  was the last thing famed manga artist Akira Toriyama worked on before his untimely death. It’s based on the manga of the same name and the story was expanded into a full 3D open-world adventure. Players took on the role of a demon, Beelzebub, who could attack enemies with melee attacks and specials.

  His abilities could be expanded with a skill tree and he got party members that could help too via AI. The biggest hook of the game though was collecting various tanks, vehicles, and mechs to fight against the forces of evil. It may get a bit repetitive, but it’s still a game worth checking out for Akira Toriyama’s legacy alone.

  , or any game in the franchise, is not going to be for everyone. This game can be likened to a
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  clone except that all of the female ninja warriors get stronger the fewer clothes they wear. Going into missions, players can choose from a wide selection of Kunoichi from ones that use swords to mallets. They begin in their standard clothes but over time they can transform into more powerful versions, typically with more loose-fitting clothes. It’s a game full of fan service that may embarrass the grandmas out there but it’s also quite good based on the sheer amount of variety in the character selection alone.

  was one of the few games that took advantage of the DS at the time. On the bottom screen, players control the main character, Neku. Players could equip him with pins that created his attack patterns from slashes to fireballs. All techniques could be performed with specific movements using the DS Stylus. On the top screen, players could use the face buttons and the D-Pad to control Neku’s various partners. It was like trying to rub the head and pat the stomach at the same time but it still made for a memorable combat system unlike anything on the DS. In the Switch remaster, the top screen was removed, making it easier but still memorable as far as JRPG battle systems go.

  After completing a chapter in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </strong>
  </em>
  , players will obtain one of the six relics of Wukong and obtain some of his power. Upon getting the relic, you'll have to choose between which bonus from the relic to set as active, giving a permanent buff.

  While it may not seem clear at first, these buffs can be changed between the various options for that relic. This is just one of the many ways players can change the build of their character, letting you try out any build you can think of easily without any in-game cost to respec.

  Once you have a relic equipped and the buff activated, it can be found anytime in your main menu under the relics section. To change which buff is active, head to the nearest Shrine and select Self-Advance, then Reignite The Spark to open the respec menu. Now that you have a relic, a
  <strong>
   new menu will be available along the top of the screen under, "Relics"
  </strong>

  lets players respec and try different builds for just about all aspects of their character. While
  <strong>
   spent resources in crafting can't be brought back

  , you can still undo Staff upgrades to follow a different path if you want. Everything that can be undone or respeced is below, with armor being left off as it can be equipped and unequipped anytime after being crafted:

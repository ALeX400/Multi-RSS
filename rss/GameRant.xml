      <title>Starfield's Potential PS5 Version Has One Golden Opportunity Ahead of It</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been in the rumor mill, as speculation suggests a PS5 version could be imminent. Rumors sparked when an eagle-eyed gamer noticed that a Creation featured on the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  Creation Club platform stated PS5 support. This evidence has since been removed, but it ignited discussion about whether a
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  PS5 port is coming or not.

 <p>
  At this point,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  coming to PS5 wouldn't be that big of a surprise. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has been quite vocal recently about his willingness to release first-party games to other consoles. Back in January, Spencer even stated that he couldn't confirm that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  would remain exclusive to Xbox. A
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  port no longer seems like a matter of if, but when, and Bethesda's space adventure could have a deep well of crossover content to pull from.

 <p>
  <em>

  </em>
  brings a hilariously violent world to life, as players are tasked with fighting to defend Super Earth from the threats of the galaxy. The armor in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has an iconic appearance that would be a perfect fit for extra
  <em>

  content. Whether it's the classic Helldiver armor, the Illuminate, or even a revamp of the REV-8 that turns it into
  <em>

  <em>

  crossover.
 </p>
 <h3 id="killzone">
  Killzone
 </h3>
 <p>
  This first-person shooter franchise remains one of the most beloved Sony exclusive series, with many hoping for a reboot. Such a revival remains to be seen, but a crossover with
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  could really generate some hype for PS5 players. The battle between the ISA and the Helghast would not only provide the game with some great cosmetics, but it could introduce the planet Helghan as a fresh location. Of course, this type of crossover wouldn't be as powerful as a full-blown
  <em>
   Killzone
  </em>
  revival, but it could definitely be a fun and nostalgic way to represent the franchise.
 </p>
 <h3 id="resistance">
  Resistance
 </h3>
 <p>
  This story of American and British troops coming together in an alternate version of the 1950s in order to destroy the alien threat of the Chimera is an action-packed piece of historical fiction. The extraterrestrial Chimera race remains a fantastic example of strong monster design. A
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  crossover that introduces the Chimera could shake up its enemy offerings. A
  <em>
   Resistance
  </em>
  revival has been requested for a long time, and a
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  port on PS5 may be one of the closest ways to make that happen.

     Microsoft-exclusive

  <em>
   Returnal

  is a Sony exclusive that has helped mark the PS5 era. This third-person roguelike from developer Housemarque is filled with a fascinating story and mind-blowing visuals. Weapons like the Pyroshell Caster and Spitmaw Blaster would serve as strong additions to

  arsenal, bumping combat up a notch. Also, now that Housemarque has a new game on the way called

     and

  Right now, it remains unclear if Microsoft is gearing up to bring
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  to the PS5, but based on Phil Spencer's past comments, it feels inevitable. As the year continues, it will be interesting to see if
  <em>
   Starfield

  finally gets to branch out to other consoles. Ever since its first DLC,
  <em>
   Shattered Space

  , was released last fall, Bethesda has been pretty quiet about its plans for the game. This is purely speculation, but this silence could potentially be the calm before a big announcement.

      <title>Assassin's Creed Shadows: Should You Forgive or Attack Hanzo? (The Meaning of the Blade)</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-ac-shadows-forgive-or-attack-hanzo-meaning-of-the-blade/</link>

 <p>
  As they near the end of the Meaning of the Blade main story mission,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  players will learn how Hanzo betrayed the Iggan people, which resulted in the death of Naoe's father and countless other people. They'll also find out about his complicated relationship with Naoe's parents and how it eventually drove him from his home.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Naoe is understandably angered by these revelations and considers attacking Hanzo for the irreparable damage that he's caused to her and her people, yet there's a part of her that wants to forgive his transgressions and work with him to find out the truth about her mother. As is often the case in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , it's left for the player to decide.

 <p>
  Unlike most of the other big choices in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , whether players decide to attack or forgive Hanzo actually makes a difference, at least in the short term. As one might expect,
  <strong>
   choosing to attack Hanzo will result in a fight
  </strong>
  , and a rather difficult one at that. However,
  <strong>
   there are no long-term consequences to either option
  </strong>
  , and Hanzo's fate remains the same either way. With this in mind, players should choose to attack Hanzo if they want to put their combat skills to the test or forgive him if they just want to move on with the story.

 <p>
  If players choose to forgive Hanzo, Naoe will deliver an emotional speech, after which, she and Hanzo agree to work together to find out the truth about Naoe's mother. The dialogue during their parting conversation is a little different when players choose to forgive Hanzo rather than attack him, but the manner in which the two Iggans part ways is very much the same.

 <p>
  If players choose to attack Hanzo, he'll tell Naoe that he has no intention of holding back. At this point, they'll be given another chance to forgive Hanzo. Choosing to do so plays out in much the same way as the above. However, if players instead choose to kill Hanzo, a brutal and fairly difficult boss fight will commence.

  There are two elements of the Hanzo fight that can be tricky: his smoke bombs and his triple kunai attack. The former will make it so that Naoe is no longer locked onto him while the latter can be difficult to dodge due to their trajectory. Players can attempt to block or parry them if they like, but it's better to just prevent Hanzo from throwing them in the first place.

  To do this, players should stay as close to Hanzo as possible and keep hitting him whenever he's not attacking with his blade. If they're relentless enough and use their abilities at the right time, players can prevent Hanzo from ever using his kunai. From here, it becomes a fairly simple case of dodging and parrying his attacks until he goes down.

  Once the fight is over, Naoe will have a chance to finish Hanzo off. However, she elects to forgive him, thus rendering her earlier decision somewhat redundant, much like the deadly showdown that the pair just squared off in. They'll agree to work together to find out the truth about Naoe's mother and Hanzo will limp off to fight another day.

  The Darkness Falls main story mission of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </strong>
  </em>
  sees players attending peace talks between Tsutsui Junkei and Akiyama Ayako, with Joken Hokkyo acting as a mediator of sorts. However, after it becomes clear that the talks are going nowhere, players will be left to root out the guilty part by themselves.

  After a short conversation with Kojiri,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  players will be asked to choose whether to accuse Joken Hokkyo, Tsutsui Junkei, or Akiyama Ayako. Most should already have a fairly good idea of who's been pulling the strings by this point, but for those still unsure, the following guide goes over the consequences of each potential decision.

  Like so many of the other big decisions in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   it doesn't matter whether players accuse Joken Hokkyo, Tsutsui Junkei, or Akiyama Ayako
  </strong>
  . Granted, accusing the wrong person will lead to them being annoyed momentarily, but it doesn't take long for the real villain of the piece to be uncovered and brought to justice.

  If players accuse Joken Hokkyo, he'll say that Yasuke has gone mad, which prompts the samurai to throw his knife directly at the monk's head. Without even thinking, the monk catches the blade between his hands, revealing his true identity as The Wise. He then orders his men to kill everybody, starting with Yasuke.

  Like any innocent person, Tsutsui Junkei is not too happy about being accused. However, Kojiri interrupts proceedings to tell Yasuke that he should throw his blade at Joken Hokkyo. Why exactly the samurai blindly agrees to this is anybody's guess, but it leads to the monk catching the blade and revealing his true identity.

  Choosing to accuse Akiyama Ayako plays out much the same as if players accuse Tsutsui Junkei. Akiyama Ayako protests, Kojiri tells Yasuke to throw his blade at Joken Hokkyo, and a mass brawl kicks off. After dealing with Joken Hokkyo's men, players will need to give chase and finish the monk once and for all.

  Sony has unveiled five games coming to
  <strong>
   PlayStation VR2
  </strong>
  over the next few months. As the holiday season approaches, gaming companies are ramping up their marketing efforts, and the makers of the PlayStation are no exception. Anyone who's considering getting a PS VR2 headset for themselves or a loved one now has five more reasons to do so.

  The PS VR2 has quickly become one of the most popular VR headsets on the market after debuting in 2023. Sony seems to want to capitalize on that success, with rumors suggesting the PS VR2 will get a Black Friday sale for the first time since its launch. While the full lineup for the remainder of 2024 has yet to be announced, Sony is highlighting some potentially tempting titles scheduled to hit the device in the coming months.

  In a November 18 post on the official PlayStation blog, Sony announced the indie puzzle game
  <em>
   Mare
  </em>
  is now available on PS VR2 in two modes: Classic and Enhanced. In Classic mode, players use the headset's eye-tracking functionality to solve puzzles. Enhanced brings the system's Sense controllers into the equation, though some users have reported issues with the PS VR2 controllers in the past. Being able to pick between control options could provide a work around such problems by letting players avoid the more complex tech aspects entirely.

  While

  <em>
   Trombone Champ: Unflattened
  </em>
  , which will be available on November 26. The original
  <em>
   Trombone Champ
  </em>
  blew up on Steam, and this latest version adds a slew of new collectibles and gameplay tweaks to modernize it for a next-gen VR experience. A few weeks later on December 18, PS VR2 will get
  <em>
   Masters of Light
  </em>
  , a rhythmic, magic-focused action title. The much-anticipated
  <em>
   Alien: Rogue Incursion
  </em>
  will follow on December 19, with a VR port for
  <em>
   Hitman World of Assassination
  </em>
  coming on March 27, 2025.

 <p>
  IO Interactive and Sony hope
  <em>
   Hitma n
  </em>
  will be one of the series' most engaging entries to date. That's a bold goal, considering how the game bundled three titles into one when
  <em>
   Hitman 3
  </em>
  was rebranded as
  <em>
   World of Assassination
  </em>
  back in 2023.
  <em>
   Alien: Rogue Incursion
  </em>
  will likewise take full advantage of VR's immersion to make the Xenomorphs more terrifying than ever.
  <em>
   Trombone Champ
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mare
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Masters of Light
  </em>
  may not be quite as intense, but no matter what kind of games VR enthusiasts enjoy, there's something to look forward to in the PS VR2's upcoming lineup.

      <title>Why Pokemon Fans Shouldn't Sleep on Beastieball</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/pokemon-fans-beastieball-monster-volleyball-indie-game/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Beastieball
   </em>
  </strong>
  is currently in early access, but it already features a number of colorful monsters to team up with. This growing cast of creatures has invited comparisons with
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , and there is certainly plenty of shared DNA. However, while
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  sees players doing battle with their newfound friends,
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  brings volleyball into the mix for a fresh new take on the monster-taming genre.

  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  seems to wear its
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  inspiration on its sleeve, and the titular Beasties have already begun to draw attention from the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fanbase and adjacent communities. After all, adorable and awe-inspiring designs are a big draw for any monster-tamer. However, the ways in which
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  sets itself apart are undoubtedly what should keep players on the hook.

  Beastieball is Making Strides with Early Access Updates
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  was released on Steam in early access on November 12, 2024, after previously being announced as a Kickstarter in 2023. The game does not yet have a full launch date, and will likely remain in early access for the foreseeable future. There are plenty of reasons to hop on the
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  train early, though.

 <p>
  First and foremost, it's important to recognize what being in early access means for
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  . Of course, the game is far from complete, but it's definitely not stale either.
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  's developers have released updates that are both frequent and extensive, with little sign of slowing down. Consistent balance patches are a great way to keep up with player feedback, although it's a little too early to tell if this trend will continue. Regardless, the progress made so far should instill faith in anyone keeping a close eye on the project.

  Beastieball Adapts Many Key Mechanics from Pokemon
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  has taken more than a few notes from
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  , with some mechanics seemingly being lifted wholesale. However, where Pokemon do battle, Beasties play sports, and this key difference ensures that the similarities are much more than skin deep. This dynamic should provide a lot of appeal for
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans, while still creating something that stands on its own.

 <p>
  One of the first things players will encounter is the concept of Metamorphosis, which is very clearly intended to be
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  's take on Evolution.
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  also features Railhouses and Reserves, which are analagous to Pokemon Centers and the PC Box respectively. Many of these mechanics are well adapted for
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans to pick up fast, with a few even being arguably improved.

 <h3 id="beastieball-boasts-unique-features-for-veterans-of-the-pokemon-series">
  Beastieball Boasts Unique Features for Veterans of the Pokemon Series
 </h3>
 <p>
  Of course, the fact that
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  is a sports game is by far the biggest thing that separates it from
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  . The focus on competitive volleyball informs every part of the game, even with small details such as naming conventions. One great example is that of Away-Teams, which are a one-stop-shop for any players looking for an online experience. Online battling has been a crucial mechanic ever since it was introduced to the series in
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  Generation 4, but
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  takes a different approach.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":735} -->
 <p>
  Away-Teams are essentially a network feature that allows players to earn passive EXP, not a direct way to do PvP battles. In simpler words, players create an Away-Team to go out into the world and compete against teams other players have made online. Although this is different from
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  's online battles, it should still be very familiar to
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans. Many games in the series have introduced similar network features, such as the Poke Pelago introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun and Moon
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  One of the best features
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  plays with is Relationships.
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  uses the Affection System to represent the bond between a trainer and their Pokemon, although it is admittedly a little bit obtuse. Relationships, meanwhile, actually form between Beasties who have played together. There are different kinds of Relationships that can develop, and each of them has a unique effect on Combos performed during a match. This not only makes Relationships more streamlined, but gives them a greater degree of depth altogether.

 <p>
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  carves out its own unique identity, while still feeling familiar in the best way possible. In fact, the monster designs and cutesy charm that give it ties to
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  are often what lets it make the boldest strides. Considering it is still in early access, the game will hopefully continue to grow and evolve from here. Until then,
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans can hop in early to get a kick out of everything
  <em>
   Beastieball
  </em>
  has to offer.

  The world of
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  is a captivating blend of breathtaking landscapes and intriguing characters, but the true allure of the game lies in its collection of (often fearsome) animal-like metallic machines, each with its unique features and abilities. In 2022, Lego released its Horizon Forbidden West: Tallneck Creator set, proving to fans of the game franchise that the potential for seeing their favorite machine in brick form was not something Lego would overlook.

 <p>
  Now, with the release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lego Horizon Adventures
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the cry for brick-built machines is louder than ever. Fans have seen and fought the machines they know and love; now they know more could be coming. But which machine deserves consideration from the famous plastic brick?

  One of the smaller machines that Aloy has to fight, a Watcher, resembling that of a theropod dinosaur, has become one of the most recognizable machines of the
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  franchise. Patrolling in groups, usually three, Watchers mainly protect terraforming machines as they work.

 <p>
  While the Lego Horizon: Forbidden West: Tallneck also features a Watcher, it would be fun to have a larger, more intricate model or more than one to play around with. There is also the upgraded Redeye Watcher variant that could be considered instead.

  One of GAIA's first designs was the Grazer, which is one of the more delicate-looking machines. Made to turn plant life into necessary resources, Grazers run in herds and are easily spooked when approached, although if players push them too hard, they will turn hostile.

  Lego has made woodland animals before. Foxes, rabbits, and birds feature in many of their builds and a stag is the focus of their
  <em>
   Harry Potter

  Expecto Patronum set. So, a majestic Lego Grazer would not be a massive stretch of the imagination with its metallic antler-like blades and long legs.

  A mega boss of the original game and one of the main machines used by the Eclipse when they attacked Meridian, a Deathbringer (also known as FAS-FSP5 Khopesh) was one of the Chariot line of machines made by Ted Faro and was partly responsible for the end of life on Earth.

  If Lego were to release a Deathbringer, a large-scale version would be the only way to do this machine justice. While the original machine looks much more military in design, the
  <em>

  version would also be a fun build.

  Known in the old world as the FAS-ACA3 Scarab, the Corruptor was another of the Faro peacekeeping machines made to protect the earth but, unfortunately, helped destroy it instead. A war machine able to traverse all types of terrain, it is a deadly foe for Aloy quite early on in
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn

 <p>
  Despite being a large machine, the Corruptor is very elegant and insect-like. A Lego build would be delicate but fierce-looking. The color in the
  <em>

  differs greatly from the all-black of the main game, but it would be good to see a balance should this machine get its own set.

  One of the transport machines, the Shell-Walker, is hermit-crab in appearance and scuttles along like a spider. It often travels in convoys with other machines and can raise a shield to protect itself. Upon destruction, it often loses its cargo container.

 <p>
  The Shell-Walker makes for an interesting potential build on its own due to the hexagonal cargo canister it carries on its back. While it is a simple, smooth design, it would be good to see a more intricate way of creating this effect instead of just using six basic plates. A detachable energy shield would be good for those wanting to create scenes with their Lego and seethrough pieces always add something extra to a model.

  On a purely nostalgic basis, seeing this machine in Lego form in
  <em>
   Lego Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  was a pleasant throwback to Aloy’s beginning and the very first difficult machine encountered by players. While only mentioned and not seen in
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  , players always remember their first big battle, and immortalizing it with its own large-scale model is a good way to honor Rost.

  A large, fierce combat machine with features akin to that of a T-Rex, the Thunderjaw is, as Aloy says, “huge and built to fight” and is one of the most famous machines from
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  . Along with a few characters, the Thunderjaw was also released as a Funko POP! Vinyl Figure when the first game was released.

 <p>
  A large Lego version of a Thunderjaw would be more than appreciated by fans of the main games. With the multiple components that go along with a Thunderjaw, it would make for a build with a lot of pieces. The pieces and size would be very in keeping with the Lego Tallneck and would be a great addition to appear alongside one.

  Handheld consoles like the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  are great for playing both simulation and strategy titles. One such great example that covers both of these genres is city-builder games that give players the freedom to create their own bustling city that expands across various lands.

  While some may argue that the Nintendo Switch isn't very powerful, it still has the capability to run some truly immersive city-builder games. Out of all the titles available, these are by far the
  <strong>
   best city builders on the Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  that gamers can dive into.

   <strong>
    Updated on November 18, 2024, by Megan Smith:
   </strong>
   Switch city-building games can be great for those looking for a management title where they can feel the leadership and control of building their own city, while also being great for relaxing, especially as some city-builder titles focus on the creativity of making a city that either sits upon the water or floats in the sky. These are some of the best city-builders for the Switch as many of these games may be available on other platforms, but being able to build a city while using the Switch in handheld or docked means players are able to manage their cities while cozy at home or even out on their travels. Players who are looking for the best city-builders that have an assortment of mechanics should look no further than these city-builder titles.

  When it comes to relaxing city builders,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Townscaper
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a great game that requires a player to put in little effort. Although it doesn't have much gameplay to it, that's exactly what makes this cozy title a brilliant city builder. There is no real goal to the game other than for the player to make the town or city of their dreams.

 <p>
  Players are free to create a whole town block by block as they sculpt out their own hamlets, canals, or even cathedrals. Players don't need to worry about these cities being realistic in any way, as they can happily make a town that soars above the rest on stilts.

  Out of all the available city builders, it's no surprise to see that one of the most loved simulation titles has also found a place for itself on the Nintendo Switch. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cities: Skylines

  , players simulate the work of a city planner as they plan out the perfect city structure while also figuring out how the roads would work in such a situation.

  As seen, not all city builders involve players building modern skyscrapers; there are also strategy city-builders like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Port Royale 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  that see players attempt to increase their power through the colonization of the Caribbean during the 17th century.

 <p>
  While players will be predominantly creating production lines to plan incredible trading deals between the multiple islands, players will also need to build up their coastal towns to make sure these trading routes get all the support they need. The small settlement a player may start with will eventually transform into a busy trading city that is sure to see the gamer's pockets grow.

  While many city-builders may have players creating medieval kingdoms or modern-day cities, there are many other themes for gamers to explore on the Nintendo Switch. This includes outer space.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Spacebase Startopia
   </strong>
  </em>
  is exactly what some city-building players are looking for, with its mix of not only the usual economical mechanics of creating a functioning star base but also real-time strategy skirmishes to break away from constantly upgrading the player's main base.

  The well-known city builder,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tropico 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , made its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2019. In this title, players are left to manage multiple islands as they build up both their forces and the main city to please those who live in the archipelagos.

  Naturally, over time, players will begin to expand their territories as they find and research ancient technologies that will help their Peeps.

  is a simulation title that may not entirely fit the city builder theme. However, players are tasked with building multiple skyscrapers – or high-rise buildings – that can survive the elements. While many of these may be office spaces, players will also be challenged to create residential skyscrapers that possess all the requirements for an individual to live within the city.

  Besides the open sandbox mode that leaves players to create the skyscrapers of their dreams with multiple difficulties to challenge themselves, there is also a campaign mode that will not only teach the player the ropes but also test their skills through multiple challenging scenarios.

  Here is a relaxing city-building strategy title for players to enjoy on the Nintendo Switch.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Islanders
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a short and simple game that leaves players to create their own cities across cliffs of small islands.

 <p>
  With a point system in place, players will choose from a variety of buildings that will benefit from being placed near certain features of the islands, such as a Lumber Pack being useful next to trees. Players who enjoy increasing their points will want to experiment with where they put their buildings in this cozy title.

  took the city builder genre in a new direction. The game combines the franchise's dungeon-crawler gameplay with taking charge of a mining town. Deep within the mines is ancient technology that could be used to help this financially sinking town.

  However, the player's kingdom isn't the only one that has taken to the air. Gamers will need to form alliances with fellow terrestrial kingdoms if they hope to see their own city blossom. Besides building in the sky, players will also need to research technology and complete quests to improve their time above the clouds.

  As seen through the selection of the best city builders on the Nintendo Switch, not all of them are realistic or medieval. Some of them can even take place in space, like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Terraformers
   </em>
  </strong>
  . In this city builder, players make their home on the red planet of Mars, where they must try to make a safe place for not only themselves but also the other colonists.

 <p>
  Players must explore the planets they are given in order to find new resources. There is no reason for players to remember these locations for new playthroughs, as every planet adventure is procedurally generated. This helps to make every playthrough feel different and provides gamers with new challenges to solve.

   <em>
    Minecraft

  </strong>
  isn't a city-building title, but it does provide the player with the tools to create their own city. Therefore, it's important to mention
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  as it technically has the potential to be one of the
  <strong>
   best city-building games on the Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  . Players who are looking for games that allow them to get creative with the sort of city they wish to make will find a lot to enjoy with

 <p>
  While mods aren't available to players on the Nintendo Switch, those who wish to expand upon their ideas can take

  a step further on other platforms to create the perfect city builder for themselves.

  While not entirely a city builder, there are city builder aspects to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sid Meier's Civilization 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Players are tasked with competing against the computer AI or a group of other players as they attempt to build the most successful empire.

 <p>
  Therefore, a player must build multiple cities with all the resources a resident of the city may need. While this may not be as detailed as other city builders, strategy is still required if a player hopes to keep their empire afloat while defending against others who may wish to either destroy or take over.

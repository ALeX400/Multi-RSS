      "One Piece" is a manga and anime powerhouse since 1997, with a vast worldwide appeal rivaled only by "Dragon Ball."
     </li>
     <li>
      Most games based on "One Piece" were not localized, but there are gems like "Unlimited World Red" and "One Piece GBA" to check out.
     </li>
     <li>
      "One Piece" also offers mobile game "Treasure Cruise" and Musou entry "Pirate Warriors 4," with the latest JRPG "Odyssey."

  <strong>
   <em>
    One Piece
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been a manga since 1997, and it is still going strong. Additionally, the anime series, which started in 1999, has skipped a thousand episodes and, again, is still going strong. Even if it took longer to cross over to Western countries than the other "big" battle shonen properties,
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  is arguably untouchable when it comes to worldwide appeal, with only
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  exceeding it.

 <p>
  Due to its delayed push, many games based on
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  were never localized in North America. Furthermore, the franchise has not always had the greatest track record when it comes to these sorts of adaptations, with most projects being very mediocre. Still, there are some gems that fans should check out. Let's take a look at the

  One of the more readily available
  <strong>
   <em>
    One Piece
   </em>
   games
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Unlimited World Red
  </em>
  is on the cusp of greatness, but mostly settles for being just pretty good. Telling an original story that is not far removed from the quality of the
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  movies, the campaign finds the Straw Hats helping out a unique town while also engaging with a powerful pirate from yesteryear. Also, the crew has to go up against some of their strongest past foes, although they are not quite themselves.

  <em>
   Unlimited World Red
  </em>
  knocks its presentation out of the park, looking great on most systems. While very linear, the stages are generally impressive and varied, with their backgrounds being consistently gorgeous; conversely, Transtown, the main hub, is quite open and allows for a fair amount of exploration. The combat feels like a mash of beat 'em up and Musou mechanics, albeit arguably slower than both. Although far from terrible, the battle system gets repetitive rather quickly, especially since encounters with fodder enemies tend to overstay their welcome. That said, the boss fights are consistently great and superior to the ones found in most of the
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors
  </em>
  games.

  Simply called
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  , this beat 'em up is a perfectly good option on Nintendo's handheld GBA system. Dimps is a reliable developer, and this somewhat forgotten project represents the developer's talent for crafting solid licensed games that capture the charm of the source material while providing accessible gameplay. Just to be clear,
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  does not excel in any one area, and its combat will probably not keep non-fans engaged for too long due to its low difficulty and style-over-substance approach.

 <p>
  However, the 2005 title is decent across the board. A vibrant color palette and little animation touches (like Luffy holding his straw hat when he runs) add personality to the otherwise simple visuals, and the game nails its character designs and Luffy's special attacks. The campaign is also reasonably robust for a GBA release.

  Gacha mobile games are a dime-a-dozen, especially ones based on anime licenses. Most major shonen series have at least a single adaptation that fits the bill, and they tend to be fine ways to waste a few minutes per day. That said,
  <em>
   One Piece Treasure Cruise
  </em>
  is arguably better than average, delivering a surprisingly fun turn-based combat system that can be reasonably challenging and requires frequent interaction by players due to its input-based bonuses. The story mode runs through the manga's main arcs and is updated fairly regularly, ensuring there is always new content on the horizon.

 <p>
  Still,
  <em>
   Treasure Cruise
  </em>
  's appeal is its HUGE roster of characters, with pretty much every
  <em>
   One Piece
  </em>
  figure having different tiers/forms that cover their changes throughout the story. Players will gradually build a six-member crew featuring some of the most powerful names in this universe; however, the process is slow. Like most gacha games,
  <em>
   Treasure Cruise
  </em>
  starts fairly forgiving but gradually slows down to a crawl, requiring players to grind for pretty much any progress.

  The latest installment in the Musou
  <em>
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors 4
  </em>
  is basically a love letter to the franchise, offering die-hard fans a massive roster of characters along with telling a unique version of Wano Arc, which was ongoing at the time of the game's development. While nothing too amazing, the story is at least a fun departure from the status quo, making this entry a better overall pick than, for example,
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors 3
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Ultimately, this game (and series) is not for everyone. The Musou formula tends to be very divisive, either granting players a cathartic power fantasy with accessible hack and slash combat or a repetitive slog with shallow gameplay. Still,
  <em>
   Pirate Warriors 4
  </em>
  is a fantastic example of this formula that is packed with content, even going beyond the massive roster of characters that are just waiting to be unlocked. For what it is trying to be, this title is great.

  The most recent
  <strong>
   <em>
    One Piece
   </em>
   game
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  is a turn-based JRPG that frames some of the manga's most prominent arcs through a new storyline. The Straw Hats wind up on a mystery island that strips them of most of their abilities, forcing the crew to revisit their most challenging memories to regain their skills. While largely retreading familiar ground,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  does change a few things about the sagas, so they should present a handful of surprises for long-time fans.

 <p>
  <em>
   One Piece Odyssey
  </em>
  is arguably the franchise's most ambitious game to date, and it comes the closest to capturing the source material's sense of adventure. The turn-based combat works fairly well since it emphasizes the crew's positioning on the battlefield, encouraging players to move them around to ensure they are targeting the right enemies for them. That said, outside of boss encounters, the campaign is a bit too easy for its own good, which winds up taking away from what is fundamentally a solid battle system.

 <p>
  On paper,
  <em>
   One Piece Odyssey
  </em>
  is the most accessible game in the franchise, but it is still ultimately difficult to recommend to JRPG fans who are not interested in the manga or anime. The story is not only long but moves at a fairly slow pace, which can cause boredom to set in after a while.

  While surviving, players will need to increase specific stats to make it easier. For example, the Stealth Stat will allow players to sneak around the map, avoiding any enemies that may be too difficult to take on. Here's what the Awareness Strength Stat is and how to increase it.

  Awareness Strength is basically the player character's strength. The in-game description reads, "How powerful you are. You can gain Awareness Strength EXP through combat or work and view the progress on the bottom of the HUD. A sufficient strong awareness can help you restore more Mask Nodes as well as learn more knowledge and technology."

 <p>
  Therefore, the higher a player's Awareness Strength is, the more they will be able to do. This will unlock new technology and knowledge, allowing players to craft and build more things. Considering crafting better armor and weapons is vital to the game, this is an important number to keep track of. Once their Awareness Strength is strong enough, players can control and recruit Tribesmen just by using their mask.

  Increasing Awareness Strength is actually a lot easier than it seems. The truth is, anything that players do can raise this number up. Whether they are collecting resources, harvesting plants, killing enemies, or just exploring the world around them, chances are that they will be able to increase this pretty quickly. The truth is, just playing the game will naturally level Strength Awareness up.

  While most things can increase this, there are a few things that players can do to grind levels for their Strength Awareness. These things are:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Kill higher-level enemies (Tribe Chiefs, Temple Guardians, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
   Craft the highest level items available whenever possible.
  </li>
  <li>
   Look for areas that have large amounts of resources (clay and copper are the best) and just collect everything available.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  The easiest way to earn Strength Awareness is by doing it passively. Once it gets high enough, players can have their Tribesmen create things without them present. The more items that are made, the more experience players will receive without having to do anything.

  ’s Salvation’s Edge raid saw only one team beat it, which cements it as the hardest raid in the game to date, even more so than the previous record holder, Last Wish. Raids, with their unique mechanics and obstacles, typically rank among the most challenging activities
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players can take on, so it’s fitting that the one meant to cap off the series' grand Light and Darkness saga would prove to be the greatest challenge yet.

 <p>
  Ten years of storylines that have unfolded between two games, several expansions, and dozens of seasons culminated with the release of
  <em>
   The Final Shape
  </em>
  and its raid, Salvation’s Edge. As with past raids in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , the race was on to see which team of players could overcome its dangers, strike a decisive blow against the Witness, and claim the coveted World’s First clear. The race may finally be over, and more teams are starting to beat the raid, but it’s safe to say that Salvation’s Edge has not gone down without a fight.

 <p>
  Now that the dust has settled, it’s become clear just how hard the raid is. According to Destiny Raid Report, only Team Parabellum, the team that took home the World’s First for Salvation’s Edge, was able to clear the endgame activity within the first 24 hours, doing so after almost 19 hours. By comparison, Last Wish, a raid notorious for its difficult mechanics and encounters, saw two teams beat it in the same timeframe, with the World’s First being claimed ten minutes faster than Salvation’s Edge.

 <p>
  Team Parabellum pulled off an impressive feat beating
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  ’s new hardest raid as fast as they did. This is made even more apparent by the fact it would take another six hours before another team was able to best the Witness, according to Destiny Raid Report. That being said, now that players have an idea of how to take on Salvation’s Edge, the number of clears has begun climbing rapidly, with 50 teams beating the raid as of this writing.

  While these raid teams celebrate their achievements, all

  players can take part in a new activity called Excision, which was added to the game following the end of the World’s First race. In a first for the series, up to 12 players can group up to confront the Witness one last time and bring the Light and Darkness saga to an epic close.

  It’s a new era for

  very noticeably leaves a few plot threads unresolved. No doubt Bungie will explore these in greater detail over the coming weeks and months, though it remains to be seen how its new approach to content releases – which ditches

  ’s previous season-based structure for “Episodes” that will be fewer but more substantial – will deliver them to players.

  Final bosses serve as the true test of a player's skill after they have spent hours in a game making sure that their playable character — or characters, in some instances — are as powerful as can be. Given the weight of these encounters, it can be rather underwhelming if these final bosses don't end up being all that challenging and can be taken out with relative ease.

 <p>
  Thankfully, some video games conceal their true final boss. In the majority of instances, these enemies can prove to be a pain to deal with, and this frustration can become especially exacerbated if the path to unlock these true final bosses is also pretty tiresome. Gamers hoping to take on such foes will be in for a rude awakening when they realize what must be done in order to do so.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Octopath Traveler
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a retro JRPG with beautiful visuals and simple yet fun combat that gamers can easily get into. However, the job systems hide a surprising amount of depth that players must exploit if they wish to take out the toughest bosses in the game. Some of the optional bosses in this title are harder than the final boss for each character's narrative, but what's really mind-blowing is that the toughest boss in the game by a country mile is a mandatory encounter that players must complete to unlock the true ending.

  Players must complete some side quests revolving around a mysterious woman who turns out to be the daughter of Galdera, Lyblac. She aims to unleash the god's wrath upon the world, and it's up to the heroes to ensure that this foe is stopped. However, this is only possible after players unlock the path to the fight against Galdera and go through a boss rush that needs to be repeated every single time players fail to defeat this god, which is about as irritating as it sounds.

  Square Enix should definitely be lauded for going out of their comfort zone and developing a beat 'em up game after making JRPGs their forte for the longest time. However, for all the risks they took, it's a shame that
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Bouncer
   </em>
  </strong>
  was simply too short and featured mind-numbing gameplay that didn't really ingratiate itself to the masses. Combat was frustrating to deal with, and the bosses could be downright nightmarish unless players were willing to exploit the game's systems.

  Despite the novelty of three playable characters with different levels, it was still a huge chore to go through the game with each character and beat Dauragon, a boss so ridiculously challenging that players may just give up following a single encounter. However, players who want to access the true ending of the game must beat this boss a total of three times (with the difficulty escalating in each encounter) before getting an opportunity to tackle the toughest variant of this boss. The effort required to defeat the strongest enemy in
  <em>
   The Bouncer
  </em>
  is truly intimidating.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy

  </strong>
  is the best version of this crossover fighting game that lets players control their favorite
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  characters and help them win against the many foes that stand in their way. The story mode could've been a dumpster fire, but some engaging writing coupled with enjoyable gameplay and high stakes ensures that this game didn't feel like elaborate fanfiction. Players who complete the main story will find themselves going toe-to-toe with Chaos himself, which is ridiculously challenging and can take quite a few tries before gamers eventually emerge victorious.

 <p>
  However, for the true final ending, players must play through the unlocked chapter titled Confessions of a Creator and fight against Feral Chaos, which is one of the hardest boss fights in gaming history. Players will get a taste of how powerful this foe is midway through the story before engaging in a proper fight with the strongest version of this foe at the end of this chapter. It is unbelievably hard and has probably led to several frustrated players smashing their PSPs for understandable reasons.

  It's a shame that players can't access
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Blade
   </em>
  </strong>
  anymore, with this title staking a claim as one of the best mobile games ever made. Featuring amazing graphics for a mobile game coupled with an addictive gameplay loop that made the most of the touchscreen, it's easy to see why the high-octane gameplay of this series was something that enamored many fans and pushed them to fight the God King over and over again until they finally succeeded.

  However, the game didn't end there. Instead, defeating the God King once lets players unlock the path to fight the three Deathless Kings, who are pretty challenging in their own right. Only by doing this can players unlock the dual-boss gauntlet against the Zero Mech and Archarin, uncovering some unique lore that tied into the plot of
  <em>
   Infinity Blade 2
  </em>
  and letting players unlock the game's true final ending.

 <p>
  The Moon Presence is the true final boss of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Bloodborne
   </em>
  </strong>
  , so players may not be all that enthused about the fact that this boss is actually one of the easier foes they'll encounter in the game. In fact, most people would argue that the path to unlock this boss fight is arguably harder than the battle itself. To get the true ending, players must consume three out of four possible One Third of Umbilical Cords that can be found in the game.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1025} -->

 <p>
  This is easier said than done, especially since only one of these items can be found via the main route. Everything else requires a fair bit of exploration and some forethought on how to make progress in the game's side stories, since failing to do so means that two of these umbilical cords will be unobtainable after a point. It's a nightmare to deal with, and one can only wonder how players were supposed to figure this out without a guide telling them exactly what to do.

  </em>
  introduced a new aftermarket part for the Kastov 762, exciting fans by reviving features reminiscent of a popular rifle from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
  </em>
  . The latest update for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  has brought numerous changes and additions, continuing to engage its player base with fresh content. The game has consistently evolved since its release, with each season bringing new weapons, modes, and maps.

 <p>
  Season 4 of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  brings a bunch of new content, including maps set in Tokyo and Paris, six new game modes, and a collaboration with the sci-fi franchise
  <em>
   Gundam
  </em>
  . The update also includes significant gameplay adjustments, such as changes to footstep audio to diversify perk usage and numerous weapon balance updates. Additionally, multiplayer and Zombies modes receive a slew of fixes and improvements. Fans can anticipate the release of in-season content around late June or early July, with the
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Direct event scheduled for June 9.

  The new JAK Requiem Kit for the Kastov 762 has been highly praised for its effectiveness, reminiscent of the AK12 from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
  </em>
  . A Reddit user shared a video demonstrating the part's capabilities, showing the player emptying a full magazine with almost zero recoil. The video and ensuing comments have highlighted the attachment's potential to make the Kastov 762 a formidable weapon, with users noting its insane value and ability to enhance mobility due to its accuracy. This addition basically brings back the AK12 from
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
  </em>
  , adding a nostalgic touch for long-time fans.

  In addition to
  <em>
   MW3
  </em>
  's JAK Requiem Kit for the Kastov 762, Season 4 also offers three new weapons via the Battle Pass, along with new modes and maps. The Kit can be obtained by completing five out of seven Week 2 challenges across various game modes, enhancing the weapon’s accuracy at the cost of some damage range and fire rate. This loadout has been praised for its utility, especially in close to mid-range engagements.

 <p>
  Activision has also been proactive in addressing other aspects of the game. Recently, it announced new measures to combat boosting in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  . Boosting has been a persistent issue, with players using unfair means to gain an advantage. Activision's response included banning 29,000
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  accounts involved in such activities and implementing the "Splat" feature to prevent cheaters from entering matches. This feature, part of the Ricochet Anti-Cheat software, cuts the parachutes of detected cheaters, causing them to plummet to their deaths.

  Popular streamer Dr Disrespect has also weighed in, criticizing the Ricochet anti-cheat system in
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  as ineffective against hackers. Despite Activision's efforts, he expressed frustration with the persistent cheating issues during a recent stream, highlighting the need for more effective measures. This criticism comes amid Activision's ongoing battle against cheating in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  , which has included significant lawsuits against cheat providers and major victories.

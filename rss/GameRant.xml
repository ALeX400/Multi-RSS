      <title>Best Open-Worlds In Sucker Punch Games, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-open-worlds-sucker-punch-games/</link>

 <p>
  Ever since the first
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  game back near the beginning of the PlayStation 3 generation, Sucker Punch has become known for visually stunning open worlds where players meaningfully interact with every element, crafting some truly amazing games. While rarely realistic, the stylized worlds of Sucker Punch games pay loving tribute to their pointed inspirations, making them unforgettable in the minds of many gamers.

  Whether they are set in the fantastical comic book worlds of
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  , or the historically inspired (and Kurosawa-infused) world of feudal Japan in
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  , Sucker Punch worlds have something for everyone, and there are no doubt even greater settings to come from this legendary studio.

 <p>
  While far from a bad open world,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infamous: Second Son
   </em>
  </strong>
  's depiction of real-world Seattle suffers only due to the higher quality of the rest of Sucker Punch's work. Most Sucker Punch worlds are highly stylized and don't conform 1-to-1 with reality, instead adapting more comic book-y or dramatic film settings. That isn't to say
  <em>
   Infamous: Second Son's
  </em>
  Seattle is hyperrealistic, but it's not quite as visually gripping as its peers.
 </p>

 <p>
  That being said, Seattle makes for a great accompaniment to the superhero antics of protagonist Delsin Rowe, who can fly around the skyscrapers and urban sprawl with a variety of innovative new powers. It's not the best open world Sucker Punch have ever made, but it certainly delivers a fun time, and it remains a stark reminder that the
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  franchise should definitely return sometime soon.

 <p>
  Sucker Punch's first adventure into the open-world space has become one of its most memorable and is widely considered one of the best in the franchise — and for good reason.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Infamous
   </strong>
  </em>
  as a superhero fantasy takes clear inspiration from superhero comic books, and Empire City is a clear send-up of cities like Metropolis or Gotham that are stand-ins for their own parallels in reality.

 <p>
  Empire City is a bit of a gray urban sprawl, which does hurt it in terms of visual splendor, but it is still a striking playpen, especially when things get really chaotic in the back half of the game. It's just a shame that it's so emblematic of the often drab, washed-out visual aesthetics that were so popular in the late 2000s.

 <p>
  While Tsushima was a fantastic open world for Sucker Punch to explore, the decision to include a brand-new island in its DLC paid off massively. While Iki Island doesn't innovate in any major ways on the source game's Tsushima, it is still stunningly beautiful, chock-full of Easter eggs and secrets, and offers a great setting for Jin's emotional journey throughout the

 <p>
  Returning players may find Iki Island's stark beauty a little too familiar from what they've already played, but with some particularly memorable sections — such as the rock-strewn beaches and the radiant pink cherry blossom fields — there's still more than enough here to rate Iki Island as one of Sucker Punch's best open worlds.

 <p>
  The setting of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Infamous 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  proves just how much Sucker Punch wanted to improve from the original game, transferring Cole (who underwent a somewhat controversial mid-development redesign) from the drab Empire City to the vibrant and very different streets of New Marais, a colorful comic book stand-in for New Orleans. The change in setting allows for a beautiful Southern Gothic setting to permeate every aspect of the game, leading to a brilliant and moody new atmosphere.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1075} -->

 <p>
  With a boost in the graphical department and a clear mandate to lean further into its comic book inspirations, New Marais is a clear step up in every regard. As a bonus, the Southern Gothic atmosphere also allowed the setting to be reused for the fantastic standalone expansion —
  <em>
   Infamous: Festival of Blood —
  </em>
  that brought more horror undertones to the surface with a vampire-based narrative that fit right in with the dark splendor of New Marais.

  Frankly, it's hard to imagine how Sucker Punch will ever surpass the visual splendor of Tsushima as a setting in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Ghost of Tsushima
   </strong>
  </em>
  . The real-world island, situated almost exactly in the center between Japan's southwestern coast and South Korea's eastern coast, is rendered in loving detail. However, Sucker Punch took a clear choice to not let realism get in the way of style, which paid massive dividends.

 <p>
  Sucker Punch's version of Tsushima is a sweeping island that is filled to the brim with gorgeous Akira Kurosawa-inspired vistas. Whether that be forests drenched in amber leaves or endless grain fields, it seems that nowhere on the island is immune from the visual splendor needed for a truly epic samurai duel to the death. It's no wonder

  's photo mode was extremely popular — the Kurosawa mode that ups the grain in the picture and turns the image into a high contrast black and white was an instant fan favorite.

  Link's original adventure through Hyrule released in Japan on the Famicom Disk System certainly looks a lot different than the series' more modern entries, but that doesn't make it any less of a blast to play. The top-down perspective and 8-bit graphics carry a certain charm, while the unrestricted exploration make it one of the earliest (if not the first) open-world games. It's also the origin of one of the franchise's most iconic lines: "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this."

  A direct sequel to the original outing,
  <em>
   Zelda II: The Adventure of Link
  </em>
  was a huge departure from the first entry in almost every way. This time around, the green-clad hero tackles side-scrolling levels more akin to a
  <em>
   C
  </em>
  <em>
   astlevania
  </em>
  game, complete with experience points and more strategic combat elements. There are also magic spells to collect, and interactions with NPCs were vastly expanded to help flesh out the story further.

  Releasing to critical acclaim in 1992 and still regarded as one of the best entries in the series,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
  </em>
  saw a return to the top-down perspective of the first title. It also leveraged the increased power and capabilities of the SNES to present Hyrule as a vibrant and colorful land bursting with a vibrant palette that would eventually become a mainstay of the franchise. In this adventure, Link must conquer various dungeons to obtain specific items necessary for progression. Players are also tasked with exploring two different realities, the Light World and the Dark World.

  One of the requirements for the Ghost victory title involves players taking a minimal amount of damage whether that's from the gun of an enemy or by falling from a great height. The best landing spots at Rebirth Island and Fortune's Keep are bound to prove useful when looking to stay out of trouble during the early stages of a match.

  For Urzikstan, smaller, unnamed points of interest are excellent locations to touch down. The likelihood of encountering opposition is low and some of the buildings contain several loot caches to earn cash and some powerful weaponry with ease.

  The majority of ground loot in
  <em>

  doesn't feature a suppressor making it very easy to alert nearby opposition. During big-map and Resurgence matches, a Loadout Drop will spawn at a random location giving players a chance to use their favorite builds without having to splash the cash.

  Ensure the loadout selected features a suppressor to maintain any element of stealth and to prevent nearby opponents from starting a firefight where the chances of walking out victorious are low.

  Before claiming a loadout, it's essential players create a build with the element of stealth in mind. The STG44 assault rifle and Static-HV submachine armed with a silencer are strong picks to remain hidden from opponents and airborne UAVs that patrol the skies.

 <p>
  Alongside a suppressed weapon, selecting Throwing Knives as the Lethal Equipment is the next step for maximum stealth. Use them to eliminate downed opponents in the blink of an eye or to crack their armor before finishing them off with a primary or secondary weapon.

 <p>
  Lastly, using Perks such as Cold-Blooded and Ghost is key to staying off the grid. Ghost conceals the map location to any UAVs while moving while Cold-Blooded allows players not to be detected by thermal optics or Recon Drones.

  Staying off-grid by hiding away in a small building is a surefire way for players to earn the Ghost victory title in
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  . After collecting a loadout from the Loadout Drop, posting up inside or on the rooftop of a building is great for overseeing the action without being hit by incoming gunfire.

 <p>
  The hiding tactic works well in busier areas of the map where there's a risk of taking damage around every corner. Find a building inside the circle and wait for it to close. Listen out for enemy footsteps or remain close to a Buy Station to catch anyone scrolling the menus off-guard.

  Earning the Ghost victory title in

      <title>7 Best Horror Games With Stylized Graphics</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-horror-games-stylized-graphics/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Developers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible when it comes to making games. The early days of video games wowed with just two simple paddles and one white ball bouncing between the two. Now, games are jam-packed with fun mechanics, and some are so graphically impressive, it is almost impossible to differentiate them from movies.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":356} -->

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: below first paragraph! -->
 <p>
  But not every developer is aiming for realism, instead choosing to innovate in totally unique ways. They have an aesthetic in mind for their game to perfectly complement their vision, favoring stylized graphics rather than realism. Even in the horror genre, which relies so heavily on player immersion, stylized graphics can be used to great effect in terrifying their players.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Stifled
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most unique horror games on the market due to its minimal graphic style and how it utilizes sound. Throughout the game, players are plunged into darkness, seeing nothing but a black screen. Making noises illuminates the surroundings in white lines, aiding them in navigation — though these lines eventually fade, and players will need to create more sound to bring back those guiding lines.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1039} -->

 <p>
  But, there is more to this title than trying to walk around in the dark, as players are rarely ever alone. Danger is shown in red, starkly contrasting the safety of the black and the white. These brazen red lines alert the player and set them on edge as they need to use noise to navigate — but noise attracts danger. This unique approach to graphics makes
  <em>
   Stifled
  </em>
  one of the most tense games players will ever experience, as there is true horror in things that can't be seen.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Detention
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a horror game that has tragically flown under the radar of many horror gamers, which is a shame, as it has a lot to offer for fans of the genre. Set in a grim time period in Taiwanese history known as The White Terror, Wei and Ray find themselves trapped in their school during a typhoon that has driven all the teachers and the other students home. Malevolent spirits stalk the nightmarish halls as Ray and Wei slowly unearth the school's haunted past.

 <p>
  Players guide Ray through a 2D point-and-click interface, but this POV does little to detract from how darkly beautiful the game actually is. Perspective is done masterfully, such as trees dropping the leaves right in front of the camera, and vivid colors such as deep reds and violets pop through during scenes of tension.

  Love it or hate it,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Bendy and the Ink Machine
   </em>
  </strong>
  became one of the most famous horror mascots of all time, cementing an audience with Twitch streamers and younger games. Its success comes down to the sheer creative scope of Bendy, which is nothing short of impressive. The sepia tones and inky accents lend the game an old cartoon feel, which is fitting, as this is what Bendy is all about.

 <p>
  It is a classic tale of style over substance, but the style here is sharp and distinct, and there is enough of a narrative to keep players immersed. Following the story of Henry, the ex co-founder and animator of Joey Drew Studios, he is invited back to the old studio — only to see his creations have come to life thanks to an invention known as the Ink Machine. Taking inspiration from
  <em>
   BioShock
   <strong>
    ,
   </strong>
  </em>
  the combat never quite elevates the experience, but the exploration and unique graphics are enough to keep players coming back for more.

  Realism has been done to death by most developers creating modern games, and some developers have taken it upon themselves to do the exact opposite, resulting in fan-made 'demakes' and pixelated horror games for modern hardware.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Faith: The Unholy Trilogy
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the latter, offering three games in one package that all follow a Priest and his war against cults and the demonic entities they worship.

 <p>
  The game favors a side-screen 2.5D POV, occasionally switching to up-close and personal views for truly terrifying scenes. Smooth animations juxtapose the rough retro graphics effectively, cementing them in the player's mind and serving as a harsh reminder that these graphics serve to make
  <em>
   Faith
  </em>
  scarier, rather than tone down the frights. The game just would not be the same if the graphics were different — they are what make the experience of
  <em>
   Faith
  </em>
  so special.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dredge
   </em>
  </strong>
  , of course. Dredge has a lot more meat in it's filling, as there is an intricate story of cosmic proportions that slowly unveils the further players progress, upgrading and repairing their ships in increasingly hostile (and unsettling) waters.

  Not all fish are normal in

  <em>
   <strong>
    Little Nightmares
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a game that is equally as charming as it is terrifying, introducing players to the tiny and adorable yellow raincoat-wearing Six and her exploration of the Maw, the giant ship inhabited by massive and terrifying humanoid creatures. The Chef, The Janitor, The Guests, and The Lady are all wholly unique creatures who have the shared interest of preventing Six's escape.

 <p>
  The sheer size of the Maw and the creatures compared to Six is often jaw-droppingly awe-inspiring, and this only helps to instill a keen sense of vulnerability — what can players hope to do in the face of such odds? Combine this with the fantastical art style that would not look out of place in a Tim Burton production, and gamers have something that is beautiful yet grotesque, as much a nightmare as an uneasy fairtale.

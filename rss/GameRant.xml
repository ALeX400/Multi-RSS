  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared the adorable Bulbasaur-themed gifts they've made for their wife for Valentine's Day. The
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  present is charming fans of the series, and is just one instance of how fans integrate Pokemon into everyday life.
 </p>
 <p>
  WIth over 1,000 Pokemon now in the franchise, chances are that every player or viewer of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  media has a favorite. However, as the first Pokemon in the original Pokedex and one of the original starters, Bulbasaur has a special place in the hearts of many fans. It seems this person's Valentine is one of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reddit user things_i_make shared the two Bulbasaur-themed Poke Balls they made for their wife for Valentine's Day. The two designs carry over traits that are readily recognizable as Bulbasaur's, like its bluish-green color, spots, cat-like pointy ears, and the bulb on its back. However, the fan has also included a second one that changes up the design to a cute pink variant, putting a rosebud on the Bulbasaur's back instead of the traditional bulb. It's a pair of gifts that would likely be received well by just about any Bulbasaur fan on Valentine's Day.

  Pokemon Fans Ask Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Numerous fans of Bulbasaur and
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  in general have shared how impressed they are with the creator, but there's also been a number of questions asked about how the two were made. Things_i_make explained that the designs were created by a third party, who offers them for sale, which can then be built using a 3D printer. For the pink Bulbasaur ball, things_i_make used a X1C printer with matte red and pink Bambu filament. The green one was printed with resin instead, and after some sanding, was airbrushed with the iconic green and blues Bulbasaur can be recognized by. Those who are curious about printing their own can potentially follow the same process.

  Customized Poke Balls have become popular as of late, with creative designs integrating iconic elements of a Pokemon directly into the Poke Ball. In the past, many fans have expressed interest in the idea of Poke Balls like these appearing in an actual game, or a Poke Ball changing to reflect which pocket monster is housed inside of it. While introducing a Poke Ball design for every single Pokemon in the franchise would likely be too time-consuming for Game Freak to actually implement, if fans keep at it, they may end up inventing and producing designs for them all on their own.

 <p>
  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has teased that Mr. Reca might become playable in Version 3.3.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  recently added the Remembrance as a playable Path, and several characters of this class are expected in future updates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players first encountered Mr. Reca in-game during
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 2.6 in Penacony. Although fans were excited about his arrival, Mr. Reca was introduced as an NPC, while Rappa made her debut as a playable character. Mr. Reca has not appeared in-game again, but he has been heavily rumored to become playable in later patches. HoYoverse has not drip-marketed Mr. Reca for
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's Version 3.1 banners, so fans may not be receiving news about his playability yet. However, a new leak suggests that it won't be long before the character joins the roster.
 </p>
 <p>
  A new leak from Galaxy_Leak and UncleGreekMilk indicated that Mr. Reca's kit is complete, and he would likely become playable sometime during Version 3.3. Earlier
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  leaks about Mr. Reca suggested that he would be a 4-Star Remembrance unit, which would make him the first 4-Star character of this class. During the Penacony storyline, it was revealed that Mr. Reca is a Memokeeper, like Black Swan, so he canonically follows the Aeon Fuli and the Remembrance. There is a chance that
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  decided to keep Mr. Reca as an NPC until more playable Remembrance units were introduced, but now it could be only a matter of time before his debut.

  Aside from Mr. Reca's potential release window, the leak also sheds light on
  <em>

  </em>
  's collaboration with Fate/Stay Night. Per the leak, one of the two crossover playable units will be a limited 4-Star in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  . Previous rumors teased that the popular characters Archer and Saber from the anime saga would be featured in HoYoverse's game. The collaboration is expected to launch during the third quarter of 2025. Finally, the leak revealed that another 4-Star character could debut in Version 3.7 and that they could serve as a support unit for the rumored Cyrene.

  recently shared promotional images of two new playable characters, Castorice and Anaxa, for Version 3.2. This means that only three Chrysos Heirs remain in line to join the playable roster.

  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, so if you've redeemed codes elsewhere before, you'll have no problem doing so here. However, if you face difficulties, or you are redeeming codes for the first time, here are detailed instructions on how to do it in
  <em>
   Mall Tycoon
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    Mall Tycoon
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Pay attention to the left side of the screen. There will be several buttons arranged in a column. Among them, find and interact with the second one, which says Profile.
  </li>
  <li>
   After doing so, you will open a menu with many buttons and options. Here, in the upper-left corner of the screen, you'll see a blue Codes button. Click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   That will open the redemption menu. Below it, there will be an input field and a green Enter button. Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above-mentioned active codes into the input field.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finally, click on the green Enter button to submit your reward request.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If everything is done correctly, a notification will appear with a list of rewards received.

  The code redemption system in
  <em>
   Sprunki Tower Defense
  </em>
  is pretty straightforward and simple as it is similar to the one used in other free
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, so you shouldn't have any problems with it. However, if you are a beginner or can't find where to redeem codes, follow the step-by-step instructions below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Firstly, launch
   <em>
    Sprunki Tower Defense
   </em>
   in
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   After that, pay attention to the right side of the screen, where you can see a button with a bird on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click on it, and you will see a menu with a code redemption field.
  </li>
  <li>
   Enter, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above codes and click Redeem.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If everything is done correctly, you will receive a notification that the code is redeemed. However, if this does not happen, and you cannot redeem one of the codes, it may be expired. Also, make sure that you entered the code correctly and that you didn't enter an extra space, as these are some of the most common mistakes.
 </p>

  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_16">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Keep in mind that this game may require you to re-enter the game after each code entry to see your rewards.

  <em>
   Shoot Wall Simulator
  </em>
  is one of the most popular games on
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  , not to mention one of the most intuitive. However, users still need to train a lot to progress in the game, which can sometimes mean a lot of grinding. Thankfully, it's possible for
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  players to accelerate this process by redeeming the
  <em>
   Shoot Wall Simulator
  </em>
  codes found below.

  The process of redeeming codes in this game is very simple and quite similar to most other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games with a code redemption system. If players still need help, they can refer to the step-by-step instructions below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   First, launch the
   <em>
    Shoot Wall Simulator
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   After that, find and tap or click on the Codes button located in the middle right.
  </li>
  <li>
   When the button is pressed, a menu will appear with the Enter Code field in which it is necessary to enter any of the above codes.
  </li>
  <li>
   To redeem the code, tap or click Submit.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  But keep in mind that each code can be redeemed only once.

  It is straightforward to play
  <em>
   Shoot Wall Simulator
  </em>
  . To make effective progress, players need to shoot and break walls and get Wins. These Wins act as a game currency and can be used to move to new locations. To get Wins faster, it is necessary to buy pets and train. To make this process much more accessible, players will find two buttons at the bottom of the screen: Auto Train and Auto Shoot. Players can press one of them and go into AFK.

  Rocksteady Studios' rumored
  <em>
   <strong>
    Batman
   </strong>
  </em>
  game may get a PlayStation 6 release, according to a recent job posting at the company. The
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  series is one of the most beloved superhero video game franchises to date, so hopes are high for the next entry, even if the recent spin-off
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  largely fell flat. Whenever it does come out, Rocksteady's next
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  game could have the advantage of running on next-gen hardware.
 </p>
 <p>
  A recent job posting led some to believe Rocksteady is working on another
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  title, as the description mentioned several mechanics and features central to the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  series. While the studio has yet to formally announce such a project, it's looking increasingly likely that it does have something similar in the works. Another open position fans have spotted pushes these rumors even further by hinting at the possibility of a PS6 release.
 </p>
 <p>
  Warner Bros. Discovery recently posted a job listing for a Senior Core Engine Programmer at Rocksteady Studios. According to the job description, the Programmer will be working on an unannounced AAA title, and while that doesn't explicitly say it's a
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  game, the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  universe is the most obvious candidate for such a game. More intriguingly, it also mentions "the next generation of consoles" as part of the title's target hardware. It won't be solely next-gen, though, as it also mentions the PS5 and Xbox Series X, the latter of which contradicts a previous rumor that Rocksteady's next
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  game would be a PlayStation exclusive.

  The PlayStation 6 and next Xbox consoles may take a while to come out, but it's likely the same story for this Rocksteady game. Hiring has just started, and it hasn't been long since the studio's last release, so its next project is likely in its very early stages. Some rumors suggest the PlayStation 6 could launch by the end of 2027, too, which would not be too long a wait. Even if it takes longer, though, the timeline still works out for this unannounced game, whether it's a
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  title or not, to get a PS6 release, considering how long AAA dev cycles can be.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rocksteady's next
  <em>
   Batman
  </em>
  game isn't the first title to be rumored to come to the PlayStation 6. A different job listing hinted that a
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  spin-off could skip the PS5 to go straight to the PS6. Without any word from Sony on the console, though, it's unclear if and when any of these games will truly be PS6 titles.

  After forming an alliance with Kyonyo in

However, convincing Mitsumune to join the fight will take some extra work as he requests Naoe to retrieve a statue for him that was stolen by bandits. So, the Stolen Faith quest will prove to be vital for Naoe in strengthening her allies before confronting Wada Koretake.

 <p>
  After talking to Mitsumune, he'll request Naoe to

  To retrieve the Shinran statue for Mitsumune in the Stolen Faith quest, players will need to
  <strong>
   head east, through the Senri Hills, to reach the Toneyama Post Town
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   AC Shadows

  . After arriving at the location marked on the map above, you'll find yourself at the entrance to this hostile town that's crowded with enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although players can go inside swinging their sword at every enemy they see, the best approach here is to stealth assassinate as many enemies as you can first. While
  <strong>
   sticking to the rooftops, go further into the town
  </strong>
  and use Naoe's Eagle Vision ability to scan the area for any blue/objective dot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will
  <strong>
   find the statue inside a small room toward the end of Toneyama Post Town
  </strong>
  . However, the room is guarded by several soldiers, including a large brute. After taking the enemies down, players will be able to pick up the Statue of Shinran.

      <title>How Assassin's Creed Shadows Establishes the Brotherhood's History in Japan</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-brotherhoods-history-japan/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  For years, the story of the Japanese Brotherhood of Assassins was very much a mystery. Even though players knew of its existence, there was never a mainline game that really delved into its lore. Luckily,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  has arrived to finally deliver on that tale. Not only does it finally bring the franchise to the long-awaited setting of Japan, but it also sheds light on exactly what went down for this chapter of the Brotherhood.
 </p>

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  From the second
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  starts, players are thrust into the shoes of future assassin, Naoe. They get to watch as the Brotherhood is vanquished, help rebuild it to its former glory, and discover the events that led up to both throughout their adventure. While not every detail has been revealed, the story that
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  tells is a fascinating one. And through post-launch content, the Brotherhood's journey through Japan will likely only get more expansive.

 <h3 id="the-japanese-brotherhood-is-devastated-by-the-time-of-ac-shadows">
  The Japanese Brotherhood is Devastated by the Time of AC Shadows
 </h3>
 <p>
  Before
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , Naoe's mother, Tsuyu, was tasked with establishing a brand-new Brotherhood in Japan alongside other assassins. They ended up succeeding, and the Japanese Brotherhood prospered across the continent, with one of their main goals being to protect the three Imperial Regalia. However, they were eventually hunted down by a mysterious group of samurai known as the Shinbakufu. These samurai ended up massacring the assassins, leaving only three alive and taking two of the Regalia. The survivors fled with the final piece, hoping to keep it from their enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  kicks off, the Brotherhood has dwindled even further, with only Naoe's father Nagato and Sandayu being surviving members of the original team. However, they too quickly meet their end at the hands of Oda Nobunga and his army. Nagato is struck down at the start of the game while protagonist Naoe is left for dead. As players push further into the game, they also discover that Yasuke killed Sandayu, leaving the entire Brotherhood decimated.
 </p>
 <h3 id="it-is-up-to-naoe-and-yasuke-to-rebuild-what-was-lost">
  It is Up to Naoe and Yasuke to Rebuild What Was Lost
 </h3>
 <p>
  In his dying breath, Nagato tells Naoe to follow the blade. So, once she recovers from her wounds, she makes it her mission to avenge his death. As she does so, she also begins to build her own version of the Assassin's Brotherhood. She spends much of her time constructing a Hideout for them to call home, and many of the allies she encounters end up joining her fight. As she continues to take out members of the Shinbakufu, even Yasuke ends up joining her team,
 </p>
 <p>
  Together, they work to rid the world of evil while also rebuilding much of what was lost. This is the primary focus of the rest of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadow
  </em>
  s' story, which makes for a pretty intriguing tale. While other
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games have also had players rebuild a destroyed Brotherhood, this type of story has not really been told for a little while now. Instead, players have either not really played as an Assassin or have worked within a pretty well-built Brotherhood, so this is an exciting change of pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since more content is coming to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , there are likely even more stories surrounding this Brotherhood waiting to be told. Players still do not really know what its early days looked like, and Ubisoft has barely scratched the surface of some of the surviving members' stories, so he future is very much unwritten. But for now, players will just have to wait and see where Naoe and Yasuke's journey takes them next.

 <p>
  Two of the PSP's most beloved rhythm games are making their way to the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  this year. These are none other than the first two
  <em>
   Patapon
  </em>
  games, and interestingly, this is the fourth PlayStation-owned IP to have officially been announced for a Switch release.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally released in 2007,
  <em>
   Patapon
  </em>
  was developed by Pyramid and the now-defunct PlayStation first-party team Japan Studio.
  <em>
   Patapon
  </em>
  quickly became a hit among PSP players thanks to its innovative gameplay mechanics, where players control an army of tiny, one-eyed warriors using drum beats. The success of the first
  <em>
   Patapon
  </em>
  game led to an award-winning sequel in 2008, and then a third entry in 2011.
  <em>
   Patapon
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Patapon 2
  </em>
  were ported to the PS4 by 2020, and the niche franchise remains a PlayStation cult classic to this day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans of the series have had an eventful year so far, as
  <em>
   Patapon 3
  </em>
  was added to the PlayStation Plus Premium classics catalog last month, making the entire trilogy playable on modern hardware. Now,
  <em>
   Patapon
  </em>
  is making its first-ever debut on the Switch, with the latest Nintendo Direct having announced
  <em>
   Patapon 1+2 Replay
  </em>
  . Despite it being a Sony-owned IP, PlayStation isn't handling the development of this
  <em>
   Patapon
  </em>
  collection; Bandai Namco Entertainment is in charge.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Patapon 1+2 Replay
   </em>
   hits Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC on July 17, 2025
  </strong>
  , and will feature the same beloved gameplay that made the series popular in the first place.

  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Additionally, Bandai Namco has implemented some new accessibility features in
  <em>
   Patapon 1+2 Replay
  </em>
  , such as difficulty settings (Easy, Normal, Hard), the ability to adjust button press timing, and keeping the drum icon displayed at all times. Pre-orders for
  <em>
   Patapon 1+2 Replay
  </em>
  are expected to go live soon, but details around pricing remain under wraps for now. The exclusion of
  <em>
   Patapon 3
  </em>
  from this remastered collection is a bit odd, but Sony may be gauging the response to the first two games from Switch users to decide whether to bring the threequel forward as well, possibly in a standalone capacity. Interestingly,
  <em>
   Patapon 1+2 Replay
  </em>
  wasn't the only legacy PlayStation IP to show up during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct.

  , a brand-new entry in the
  <em>

  franchise developed under the Bandai Namco umbrella, has also been confirmed to launch on Switch, PS5, and PC later this year. Moreover, the Japanese publisher released a remaster of the obscure PS Vita first-party title
  <em>
   Freedom Wars
  </em>
  in January 2025, and prior to this, PlayStation itself launched
  <em>
   LEGO Horizon Adventures
  </em>
  on Switch last November. It's clear that Sony is looking to introduce its IPs to the Nintendo audience, and it should be interesting to see how far the gaming giant is willing to go with this multiplatform venture.

  Some games challenge players to master their mechanics, while others hand over the tools to completely dismantle them. Whether through intentional design or overlooked exploits, certain titles become playgrounds for creative rule-breaking. From games where words reshape reality, to those where alchemy turns characters into near-immortal beings, these games are all the better for bending — or outright breaking — their own systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  In some cases, developers embrace these quirks. In others, players work tirelessly to uncover ways to push the game's rules far beyond what was ever intended. Here are some of the best games where pushing mechanics to the breaking point is just as fun as playing by the rules.

   <strong>
    Path of Exile
   </strong>
  </em>
  thrives on customization, but in the Standard League, legacy items turn balance on its head. These relics from past updates retain absurdly overpowered stats, letting players create builds that obliterate the game’s intended challenge. Items like the legacy Vinktar flask grant instant life leech, making characters almost unkillable. Gear items like Kaom’s Heart stack enormous health pools with high-damage bow skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some builds take this rule-breaking further, reaching ridiculous levels of energy shield regeneration or armor values in the billions, effectively making death a non-factor. While these mechanics offer a power trip for veteran players, they also highlight the game’s evolving balance issues. The existence of such broken builds in Standard League creates a fascinating paradox, allowing players to wield godlike strength while reminding them that the game was never designed to be this easy.

    Warframe
   </strong>
  </em>
  is all about bending the rules, giving players the freedom to craft builds that defy the game’s intended balance. Some Warframes boast abilities with infinite damage scaling, effortlessly cutting down high-level enemies. Xaku’s "Grasp of Lohk" steals enemy weapons and turns them against them, while "Gaze" shreds defenses, making even the toughest foes crumble. Then there’s speed. Gauss and Volt, when modded the right way, can reach movement speeds so extreme they rival the game’s own flight systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plus, players have cracked the code for invincibility. By stacking defensive mods like "Adaptation" and leveraging healing or damage-reduction abilities, certain builds turn Warframes into near-unstoppable forces. This level of customization has cemented the game's status as a fan-favorite. Creativity is rewarded with power, and breaking the game’s limits is almost encouraged.

  Meanwhile, impossible jumps, enemy spam, and brutal Kaizo-style gauntlets push the limits of what the platforming genre can handle. Some levels feel like puzzles, others like endurance tests.

  Few puzzle games redefine the genre quite like

   <em>
    Baba Is You
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This mind-bending indie hit lets players rewrite the game's rules by rearranging word tiles, altering interactions and redefining objects on the fly. One moment, Baba is the protagonist; the next, a simple phrase swap turns a rock or even a wall into a controllable character.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sheer freedom of this mechanic transforms each puzzle into a playground of logic-defying experimentation. Every new word added to the mix deepens the strategic possibilities, making even the simplest sentences game-changing. This dynamic, rule-breaking gameplay has earned
  <strong>

  is a playground for those who love manipulating the rules. Its intricate alchemy and magic systems practically invite players to break the game in hilarious and overpowered ways. For instance, by stacking Fortify Intelligence potions, intelligence can skyrocket into absurd numbers.

 <p>
  The spell-making system is equally susceptible, allowing for broken spells that cost zero magicka or effects that last indefinitely using the infamous "Soul Trap" glitch. With enough experimentation, players can jump across the entire map, become invincible, or obliterate enemies with reality-warping spells. Rather than feeling like flaws, these exploits have become a beloved part of

  The right build in

   <strong>
    Vampire Survivors
   </strong>
  </em>
  can tip the scales, transforming a desperate struggle into an unstoppable power trip. This roguelike shoot ‘em up exploded in popularity for its deceptively simple gameplay: players maneuver an auto-attacking character through relentless waves of enemies, collecting upgrades and evolving weapons. But the real magic lies in bending the game’s difficulty to absurd extremes.
 </p>
 <p>
  By stacking the right weapons, passive items, and arcanas, players can achieve near-invincibility, wiping out enemies before they even appear on the screen. Combinations like Soul Eater and Bloody Tear, enhanced with double healing, allow for relentless regeneration, making survival effortless. Some builds unleash such overwhelming firepower that the screen becomes a flashing storm of destruction. These overpowered setups let players break the game’s balance, turning a brutal survival experience into unstoppable carnage.

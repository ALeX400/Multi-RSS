      Metaphor: ReFantazio features a diverse voice cast with 11 actors, including party members and election candidates.

      The English voice cast has been confirmed, but the Japanese version faced setbacks, with one actor having to be recast.

  Atlus revealed the voice cast for the characters in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metaphor: ReFantazio
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Eleven voice actors have been introduced, covering both party members, traveling companions, and election candidates. Unlike
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  won't feature a silent protagonist, whose voice actor has also been revealed.

 <p>
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is being developed by Studio Zero, a subsidiary of Atlus dedicated to creating new IPs beyond
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  . The division is led by Katsura Hashino, the director and producer of several
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  titles and the director of
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . Because of that, comparisons between
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  have been constant, but Hashino assures that the upcoming RPG will have its own distinct identity and personality.

  Recently, Atlus unveiled the voice cast for
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  . The game's protagonist will be voiced by Caleb Yen (
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  ). The cast also includes Alejandra Reynoso (
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  TV series) as Gallica, Stewart Clarke (
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  ) as Strohl, Kristin Atherton (
  <em>
   Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden
  </em>
  ) as Hulkenberg, and Phillipe Spall (
  <em>
   Amnesia: The Bunker
  </em>
  ) as Heismay. These are the five party members confirmed so far in the game. Atlus has said there will be seven party members in total, which increases the potential for archetypes in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  .

  While the English voice cast has been confirmed, the Japanese version has faced some setbacks. In June this year, Atlus announced that it had recast voice actor Toru Furuya following abuse allegations. The character Furuya was set to voice in

  , Yamcha from
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  , and Amuro Ray from the

   <em>
    Updated August 20, 2024:
   </em>
  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset. The final week of
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Solstice event has arrived, giving players one final change to collect silver leaves and forge the alloy needed to craft this year's unique armor sets. It also represents the final week before Act 3 of Episode Echoes arrives in full, begining the final art of this first episode.

 <p>
  Today's reset also brings about a brand-new update, which Bungie teased a little bit last week. One of the biggest changes with the update is that Xur will now carry
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's exotic class items. While they'll be available starting on August 23, each week after that is subject to RNG, so they won't always be available each weekend. It's also worth noting that players will need to finish the Dual Destiny mission once in order for these randomized rolls to appear at Xur at all, otherwise they'll be replaced by an Exotic Cipher.

 <p>
  In the meantime, the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  weekly reset continues right along with its usual refreshed content, activities, and rewards for players to chase over the next week. For a complete look at all the new content available for the week of August 20, including Nightfalls, Crucible modes, and challenges, here is everything players need to know.

 <p>
  According to a new patent,
  <strong>
   Sony
  </strong>
  might be working on a new PlayStation 5
  <strong>
  </strong>
  controller that uses a touchscreen instead of buttons. Gaming is an ever-evolving landscape, and Sony has filed numerous patents for new peripherals or features that might be used in a future PlayStation console. Some of these are software-based, like a feature that could convert captured gameplay footage into replayable minigames or a system to let players take voice or video calls in-game.

 <p>
  Other Sony patents hint at new controllers or hardware features, like a DualSense with special earbud slots or a detachable touchscreen peripheral for gaming away from the TV. There have also been patents for spherical PlayStation controllers that could be used in VR games and gamepads that could change temperature to simulate in-game environments. While the existing PlayStation 5 DualSense already creates an immersive experience for gamers and the PlayStation Access controller includes a wealth of accessibility options, it seems that Sony is constantly looking for new ways to improve player input in games.

  Earlier this month, another Sony controller patent was published detailing a new touchscreen-based design. The face of this controller would be one giant touchscreen into which players could program as many buttons as they need. Said buttons can be any size the user wishes and can be placed in any arrangement the player might see fit, such as lowering the directional pad or moving the X button to the right. This would result in a truly customizable controller layout tailored to each user’s needs or preferences.

 <p>
  The controllers for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 already incorporate touchpads that allow for feel-based inputs, but they are nowhere near as advanced as the touchscreen described in this recent Sony patent. As mentioned before, Sony has previously toyed with the idea of a touchscreen peripheral for the PlayStation 5 DualSense, and the PlayStation Portal remote controller uses a touchpad for video display in the place of a standard monitor or TV.

 <p>
  While these options are used in tandem with the traditional PlayStation controller buttons, this new Sony patent would theoretically replace them with a fully customizable touchscreen display that would be programmed to fit an individual’s playstyle. Of course, as with all patents, there is no guarantee that Sony’s new touchscreen controller idea will ever be realized, but if it someday comes to fruition, it could give gamers a whole new means of input for their favorite PlayStation 5 titles.

 <p>
  Instead of limiting Mages to an elemental staff,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  will also allow alternative weapon choices for its spellcaster class, such as the dagger and orb. Much discussion has been made about the combat in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , as its approach represents a major departure from previous
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  titles. While strategy, skill progression, and party management exist, the gameplay itself is fast-paced, action-focused, and allows players to only control their own character.

 <p>
  The release date for
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  was revealed with a new trailer, and fans can expect to see plenty of new gameplay footage until the end of August 2024. Whereas its deep dive in June 2024 showcased the opening hours of the game, BioWare is eager to present high-level content for all three classes from August 19 to August 26.

    What Are Your Thoughts On Dragon Age: Veilguard's New Combat System?
   </h5>
   <p class="display-card-excerpt">
    I've been a fan of Dragon Age since Origins, and while I'm a little disappointed that it won't have the classic turn-based tactical combat, I'm not entirely opposed to the action-combat system shown in trailers. It reminds me of Mass Effect, in a way, and I can only hope that it's as satisfying as it looks.

 <p>
  Even within the same class in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , fans can expect to have plenty of different playstyles made available to them. Mike Gamble commented on a recent video of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  , stating that players would be able to wield a dagger and orb as a Mage, and thus not be beholden to the iconic staff. Given that the Spellblade, a Mage specialization associated with the Antivan Crows, will feature in
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  , it's quite possible that Mages will have an even wider arsenal of weapons to choose from.

 <p>
  Though not directly confirmed, it's assumed that the choice of origin for Rook in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  will dictate the specializations that are initially available for the player. The rest of the specializations will instead be learned by engaging with the major factions of Northern Thedas, such as the Lords of Fortune and the Shadow Dragons. A fair few of them will have exclusive weapons, such as the Reaper (tied to the Mourn Watch faction), which will use night blades instead of the more traditional Warrior options.

 <p>
  Much like previous titles, the companions in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  will have their own specializations, and will be tied to the faction to which they belong to. For example, Neve Gallus is an Ice Mage, a unique version of the Evoker specialization, which is exclusively obtained from the Shadow Dragons. While players won't be able to control them directly, the combat in
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  will encourage teamwork between the companions and Rook, as many of the abilities will support devastating combos.
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is set to launch on October 31, 2024, nearly a decade after its predecessor.

  With its 11th anniversary right around the corner,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </strong>
  </em>
  revealed what players can expect during the 2024 edition of the Rising event. Starting next week,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  players will have a new quest to undertake that will grant them a new minion and indoor housing item after completing it.

 <p>
  Held in late August each year, The Rising is a commemoration of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's relaunch as
  <em>
   A Realm Reborn
  </em>
  . Following the game's disastrous 1.0 release,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  producer and director Naoki Yoshida decided to build an entirely new game from scratch, which became
  <em>
   A Realm Reborn
  </em>
  in 2013. In the game's lore, the shutdown of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  version 1.0 was heralded by the Seventh Umbral Calamity, which saw Bahamut lay waste to Eorzea, only for the land to rise from the ashes like the mythical Phoenix. In the 2023 iteration of The Rising,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  players could earn a Rising Phoenix mount.

  One day after the ongoing Moonfire Faire concludes,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  will keep the party going with its upcoming anniversary. According to Square Enix, the annual Rising event will start on Tuesday, August 27, at 3:00 AM Eastern, and conclude on Wednesday, September 11, at 10:59 AM Eastern. Unlike past years, which saw the Rising held in the desert city of Ul'dah, this year's festivities will be in a different capital city. The seasonal quest "Rising to the Call" can be started by players with any level 15 class or Job by speaking to the Wandering Minstrel in the Upper Decks of Limsa Lominsa. The minstrel can be found in the Aftcastle in the center of the decks, seeking out adventurers willing to help lend a hand with The Rising celebrations.

 <p>
  The rewards that players can earn this year are the Rising Table Lamp, which is an indoor housing item, and the Brushed-up Krile minion. Although Krile has been depicted as a collectible minion in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  before, this exclusive Rising minion is the first to feature her as the Pictomancer Job that was introduced in
  <em>
   Dawntrail
  </em>
  . Past rewards from The Rising, including the 2023 Rising Phoenix reward, will likely go on sale on the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  Online Store once this year's Rising event kicks off.

  It remains to be seen how much the Rising Phoenix and other rewards will cost. But, between the annual Rising event, and in-person events at Gamescom and PAX West,

  players will have plenty to celebrate as summer winds down.

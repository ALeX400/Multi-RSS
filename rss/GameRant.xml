 <p>
  The prospect of a new
  <em>
   <strong>
    Battlefield
   </strong>
  </em>
  release is finally on the horizon, with DICE recently confirming that post-launch support for
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  will officially cease after the end of Season 7. While nothing is currently confirmed about the potential setting, modes, and core mechanics of the next entry to the franchise, it would make sense for DICE to capture the attention of fans by offering some brand-new experiences.

 <p>
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  has always had a level of scale and immersion that sets it apart from its major competitors like
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  , and this is something that the IP could easily lean into with its next release. The
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  community has been hard at work with mods and sub-communities dedicated to more realistic gameplay, and this perfectly tees up the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  release to include its own realism playlist, giving much-needed variety to the next steps of the franchise.

 <p>
  Regardless of the early controversies surrounding
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  , the title was quite ambitious in terms of the new experiences it offered fans of the franchise. To compensate for things like a lack of a single-player campaign,
  <em>
   2042
  </em>
  introduced new modes like Portal, which allowed players to mix and match assets from several
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  releases to create time-bending custom multiplayer experiences.

 <p>
  While Portal sadly did not live up to the expectations that surrounded the mode, it showed a desire for innovation on DICE's part that should be extended to the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  release. Portal gave much more depth and variety to the core experience of
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  , and a realism mode for the next release could have a similar impact.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  community has already voiced how conducive the games are to more realism-focused gameplay, with the high-profile Reality Mod for
  <em>
   Battlefield 3
  </em>
  showing a clear desire for this kind of approach. The Reality Mod turns
  <em>
   Battlefield 3
  </em>
  into more of a mil-sim, with a bare-bones HUD, faster time to kill, and an increased focus on teamwork and voice communication. The popularity of other mil-sims like
  <em>
   Hell Let Loose
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Six Days in Fallujah
  </em>
  shows that the market for these experiences is larger than ever before, and
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  could easily capitalize on this.

 <h3 id="battlefield-could-provide-the-best-of-both-worlds-with-a-realism-mode">
  Battlefield Could Provide the Best of Both Worlds with a Realism Mode

 <p>
  A realism mode should be offered alongside the traditional gameplay of the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  , being a perfect fit for players who want more strategic and immersive engagements.
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  would be leaning into one of its largest strengths in this way and could play against one of the largest current weaknesses of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  . In recent years,
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  has faced a lot of flak due to the increasingly zany nature of its multiplayer, losing its gritty roots in favor of more weird and wonderful operators, weapon skins, and finishing moves.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1111} -->

 <p>
  With a full realism mode, the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  would make a strong statement against the changing identity of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  , offering tense and immersive gameplay that is becoming increasingly rare in standard
  <em>
   CoD
  </em>
  multiplayer. Of course, the traditional
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  experience should still be available for fans, with smaller-scale maps providing the same fast-paced arcade gameplay that
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is known for.

 <p>
  In this way, the next
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  release could appeal to all walks of the FPS experience, allowing fans to experience the same maps and modes in wildly different contexts. With how ambitious parts of
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  were, it only seems right that the next franchise release takes things a step further with a focus on optional realism.

  There are few franchises that have earned their place on the shelves of gamers over the last three decades more than
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tomb Raider
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It may be overlooked somewhat because the first few games have aged poorly, but it was a flag-bearer for 3D gameplay, and has only improved over time. Lara Croft is one of the best female protagonists of all time, and will likely continue her legacy in the future.

  <em>

  Being a series that has a history dating back almost 30 years,
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  has had to adapt to survive. It may have started as a somewhat linear and restricted affair, but over the years it has experimented with open-world elements that are present in the Survivor Trilogy, as well as complete genre shifts as is apparent in
  <em>
   Lara Croft and The Temple of Osiris
  </em>
  . It hasn't been afraid to make mistakes in the pursuit of something new, which has put it in the best position to take yet more risks to help it feel fresh in the future.

 <p>
  Because of this, it can easily find and implement new ways to feel different from
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  , a series that has taken so much from
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  to begin with. That's not to say that Lara Croft's next outing has to be a racing game or anything else that's so contrasting to previous games, but something as simple as changing the tone or using less linear levels could be the difference it needs.
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  would be free to use all it has learned to take a big swing to hopefully cement itself as a AAA giant.

  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  is one of the most influential series of all time, being the blueprint for countless third-person action/adventure titles since it was released on the original PlayStation in 1996. Perhaps the franchise that has taken the most cues from it is
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  , which was lovingly referred to as 'Dude Raider' by some during the time leading up to the release of
  <em>
   Uncharted: Drake's Fortune
  </em>
  . The Naughty Dog IP would go on to forge its own legacy with later installments, however, cementing itself as one of the finest cinematic epics in PlayStation's rich history.

  Nathan Drake stole Lara Croft's crown alongside the hearts of players, and in doing so it put
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  in a strange spot. The 2013 reboot was a return to form and succeeded in spades due to its great characters, consistent tension, and memorable settings.
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  hit it big with its fourth game and the Chloe Frazer-centric
  <em>
   The Lost Legacy
  </em>
  , but now that Naughty Dog seems to be working on something new, the road seems to be clear for
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  to shape its own future. Comparisons between the two will likely be sparse without direct competition, which can only mean that the developer of Lara Croft's next adventure is free to explore new ideas.

  There's no telling what the next step for

  is, or even if there will be one. Rumors fueled by a cryptic PlayStation commercial have had fans on their toes about a possible reveal, but nothing has been confirmed, and so the franchise remains dormant. Should those rumors bear fruit,

  would be best served taking advantage of
  <em>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Haunted Bloodlines
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  new psychological survival horror inspired by Hideo Kojima's infamous
  <em>
   PT,
  </em>
  is coming to Steam. Despite serving as a mere snippet of what the since-canceled project
  <em>
   Silent Hills
  </em>
  promised to be,
  <em>
   PT
  </em>
  remains one of the greatest horror games ever made. After
  <em>
   PT
  </em>
  was removed from the PlayStation store, fans were left disgruntled and unfulfilled, but
  <em>
   PT
  </em>
  's legacy could continue with a copycat game mimicking the teaser's addictive and exhilarating mechanics.

 <p>
  Back in 2014, Hideo Kojima collaborated with legendary filmmaker Guillermo del Toro to create a photorealistic playable teaser for
  <em>
   Silent Hills
  </em>
  , an installment in the
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  franchise that was ultimately canceled after three years of development. It was set to star Norman Reedus as the protagonist, but Kojima, del Toro and Reedus reunited again for
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  instead. Konami's decision to cancel
  <em>
   PT
  </em>
  was met with criticism from journalists and fans, but the reasoning remains a mystery to this day. Now, a decade later, Iphigames is releasing a
  <em>
   PT
  </em>
  look-a-like to hopefully revive the simple yet effective gameplay style.

  Steam Next Fest is a celebration of upcoming games that offers a glimpse at all the latest titles coming to PC in 2024. The event begins June 10 at 10 AM PT and kicks off with Iphigames
  <em>
  </em>
  announcing a free-to-play demo of
  <em>
   Haunted Bloodlines
  </em>
  , a
  <em>
  </em>
  first-person psychological horror developed by newcomer Horrified Triangles. The plot follows a character who inherits a large mansion following the death of their father, but begins to experience supernatural disturbances that have them questioning their own sanity. Similar to the concept of
  <em>
   PT
  </em>
  and even comparable to the critically acclaimed
  <em>
   Outlast
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Haunted Bloodlines
  </em>
  offers no way to defend oneself as the only options are to run or hide.

  Earlier this year, Iphigames released
  <em>
   Skaramazuzu
  </em>
  , a hand-drawn, gothic adventure set in an atmospheric shadow puppet world with a visual design akin to the likes of
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Night in the Woods
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Skaramazuzu
  </em>
  has received positive reviews, despite only being available on Steam for a few months. Iphigames also developed
  <em>
   Abtos Covert
  </em>
  , another survival horror set in a remote military outpost that blends the creative visions of the immersive
  <em>
   Slender: The Eight Pages
  </em>
  and the terrifying
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy's
  </em>
  , utilizing environmental point-and-click interactions and a security camera setup.

 <p>
  <em>
   Haunted Bloodlines
  </em>
  has no confirmed release date, but the likelihood is that Horrified Triangles will have the full version available in either late 2024 or early 2025. Although it's still early days for the developer, a partnership with Iphigames could prove beneficial given the steady flow of positive reviews on the publisher's other titles. And if
  <strong>
   <em>
    Haunted Bloodlines
   </em>
  </strong>
  proves to be as popular as
  <em>
   PT's
  </em>
  spiritual successor
  <em>
   Supernormal

  , Horrified Triangles could be kick-starting a fruitful career.

  Even more guest characters could be coming to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Street Fighter 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  , according to a source formerly associated with Capcom.
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  dropped last summer, winning fighting game fans over with its hard-hitting action and new World Tour story mode. The game launched with 18 playable combatants, with more being introduced over the past year. The game's first DLC season included classic series mainstays like Akuma, more recent additions like Rashid and Ed, and a brand-new character named A.K.I.

 <p>
  During last weekend’s Summer Game Fest 2024 livestream, Capcom pulled back the curtain on what fans can expect in Season 2 with a pulse-pounding
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  Year 2 character reveal trailer. This trailer confirmed that Capoeira practitioner Elena is returning to the battlefield, infamous
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  villain M. Bison is rising from the grave with a more disheveled look than usual, and even
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  alumni Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui are crossing over into
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  . While Capcom’s World Warriors have clashed with gaming mascots in the
  <em>
   Capcom Vs.
  </em>
  series and other titles, these will be
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  ’s first true guest characters from another company.

  Terry and Mai might not be the last either, as someone has been sharing rumors of even more
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  guest characters in its third DLC season. The source of these claims is reportedly an ex-Capcom partner who shared the information as a response to
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  having
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  characters. They have since deleted their Twitter and Discord posts, but not before they were screenshot and shared by other Twitter users and discussed on r/GamingLeaksAndRumors.

  The person behind these
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  rumors has since apologized for their actions and admitted to sharing them out of disappointment over the recently announced
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  characters, so fans would be advised to take the information with a grain of salt until more concrete evidence surfaces. Still, the leaker cited
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  as a possible source of these rumored
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  guest characters - and the two fighting game franchises have crossed paths before in 2012’s
  <em>
   Street Fighter X Tekken
  </em>
  .

  Speaking of
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Tekken 7
  </em>
  had numerous guest DLC characters like
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  ’s Negan,
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  villain Geese Howard, and even
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  ’s dreaded Akuma. This trend of bringing guest characters into fighting games has also been used to great effect by NetherRealm, which recently added Homelander from
  <em>
   The Boys
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  ’s roster. Now it looks like Capcom is following this with Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui from
  <em>
   Fatal Fury
  </em>
  , and if this latest rumor is true then
  <strong>
   <em>
    Street Fighter 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  may see even more visitors in the coming years.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Yakuza
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most popular video game franchises of all time. As more and more players introduce themselves to this long-running series, they come to understand why fans go gaga over these titles. Every
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  game features compelling combat that is epic to see in action.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another major draw for every
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  game is an engrossing story that introduces new characters, strengthens relationships, and lets some of the most legendary characters in the series play pivotal roles. Not every narrative in the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series boasts the same level of quality, with some being notably better than others.

  It's easy to see the many inane plot twists of
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami 2
  </em>
  and label its story as a mess, but there's more to this ambitious narrative than meets the eye. Kiryu's relationship with Kaoru, coupled with the rivalry he develops with Ryuji Godo, makes for a compelling story that fans will love to see to completion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The emotional final boss makes it clear why players love the narrative of
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami 2
  </em>
  . It may have its faults, but the inclusion of arguably the most compelling antagonist in the series is enough to make its story more memorable than most other
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  games.

  Since
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  wanted to serve as a faithful remake of the first game, it's easy to see why some of its plot points may seem confusing. Toshihiro Nagoshi still had a ways to go before the narrative in the
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  games became better than ever before, but there's a lot that
  <em>
   Kiwami
  </em>
  does to make its story more emotional than ever before.
 </p>
 <p>
  People who enjoyed
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  will love how this game serves as an excellent narrative payoff for the relationships established in the prequel. The best part about
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  is the additional cutscenes that detail Nishiki's descent, painting him as a chilling villain once his tragedies are brought to light.

  While it may be odd to see a grown detective beat down high-school bullies,
  <em>
   Lost Judgment
  </em>
  is still a great game that tackles the damage bullies can cause. As long as players are willing to accept Yagami's involvement in these crimes, they'll have no problem getting invested in the story of
  <em>
   Lost Judgment
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The plot is engaging, with players investigating a murder tied to several instances of bullying in Seiryo High School. As long as players aren't too distracted by the open-world activities of
  <em>
   Lost Judgment
  </em>
  (which is easier said than done), they'll have no problems getting invested in this narrative.

  While Kiryu's arc technically ended with
  <em>

  , many players consider the sixth mainline entry to be the perfect sendoff for his character. Despite his best efforts to avoid his life of crime, Kiryu realizes that his presence will just endanger the very children he wants to protect.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, in an emotional narrative with strong themes of getting old and moving on, Kiryu makes a valiant sacrifice so that he isn't a liability to the people he cares about. The new Dragon Engine had some annoyances that prevented this title's gameplay from reaching great heights, but this is easily forgiven because of how great

 <p>
  A new report suggests that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Rivals
   </strong>
  </em>
  developer Netease Games is using a unique strategy for bot lobbies in its game, which involves using them only when a player loses consecutive games in a row. Bot lobbies are always looked down upon in competitive games, but it seems like
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' approach has gotten the community divided instead of outright angering a majority of fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has quickly climbed up the ranks and established itself in the looter shooter genre. Considering that the genre has been dominated by games like
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Paladins
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' success is quite commendable, to say the least. However, there are a few aspects fans aren't happy with, and bot lobbies are one of them - at least for some gamers.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a new post on the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  subreddit, user ciaranxy shares a detailed report they compiled about bot lobbies in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . Contrary to the common belief that bot lobbies only appear when players are new to the game, apparently, the report suggests that it also occurs if players end up losing consecutive matches in Quickplay mode. On top of that, allegedly, players get placed in a team with four human teammates and one bot, while their opponent team is filled with bots altogether. The user also notes some cues players should look at to identify bot accounts, as they reportedly have their level set to 1 and account privacy set to restricted.

  Marvel Rivals Fans Divided Over Bot Lobbies
 </h2>
 <p>
  This report has divided the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  community. On one hand, there are players who absolutely despise the idea of bot lobbies altogether, similar to other competitive games like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . However, there is a sizeable chunk of players who think that bot lobbies in Quickplay aren't that bad since they don't affect the competitive aspect of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , as the ranked mode lacks this feature. Not to mention, some feel that it is probably a good confidence booster for them to get a few kills and wins in bot lobbies after having a few rough games.

  As far for the players who are against it, they want an option to allow bots or not in the matchmaking settings. They think that it is unfair for players to encounter bot lobbies outside of the AI modes in the game. Some feel that the developers are doing it to artificially inflate the skill perception of players, which will end up keeping them engaged for longer.

  When you first join
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  , you will have low stats, few skills, and no money at all. To fix this, players have to complete missions, including one-time and daily ones. This will continue until you reach level 60. From this stage, you will have access to Boss battles, as well as Investigation raids. They offer much more valuable rewards, including large sums of money. Therefore, to farm cash fast in
  <em>

  , you should choose only the activities which require you to spend less time and offer the best rewards.

 <p>
  Missions are a great way to make a lot of money in a short time in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  . But of course, not all of them are suitable for this purpose. It is highly recommend that you avoid band-defeating quests. Curse users are quite strong opponents who are difficult to defeat quickly when there are several of them, even using AoE attacks. Instead, pay attention to capturing the point and eliminating lone curse users. Another good option is to destroy a group of Curses.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, players should go to Boss raids. Unlike investigations, they do not require several tasks and therefore take less time to complete. To further speed up the farming of money in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  , you can grind bosses together with other players. It is also worth noting that you should choose raids with the maximum level available to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last but not least, a good way to make money in
  <em>
   Jujutsu Infinite
  </em>
  is to sell items. Fortunately, this feature is available directly from your inventory, so you can sell unnecessary items or equipment at any time to earn extra cash. If you want to get a lot of money through selling, you can sell rare items, such as Demon Fingers. But this is not recommended, as they are better used in the Curse Market.

      Iansan may be a 5-Star Electro character in Genshin Impact Version 5.4.

 <p>
  A recent leak from the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Genshin Impact
   </strong>
  </em>
  community claims that Iansan could be a 5-Star character in Version 5.4. While Natlan has already introduced plenty of fan-favorite characters, Iansan has been known to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players since the Travail trailer in 2020. Her element was confirmed as Electro during the Ignition teaster for Natlan, but Iansan's rarity has been a great point of contention among fans and leakers alike, especially in the lead-up to Version 5.3.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current information that players have on Iansan in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is that she is set to launch during Version 5.4. The patch is expected to introduce a new zone to Natlan, and as such, Iansan is necessary to provide
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  players with exploration abilities that mimic the Tatankasaurus from the Collective of Plenty. Version 5.4 will also add Mizuki, a 5-Star Anemo character from Inazuma, to the playable cast. While all the signs pointed towards Iansan being the 4-Star character of Version 5.4, there may be a chance that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  changed direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Miruko, Iansan will be a 5-Star Electro character. In terms of credibility, Miruko is known as the leaker who shared Capitano's sword model, as well as also music tracks from Version 5.0. While Miruko has proven to possess early access to upcoming
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  content, this is arguably one of the boldest claims in the past few patch cycles. According to Miruko, the information is two months old, which would mean that the developers may have changed their mind on Iansan's rarity after the Archon Quest in Version 5.1.

 <p>
  However, this leak should be taken with a grain of salt for a couple of reasons. Iansan's symbol is used in the Pilgrim's Chronicle alongside Ororon and Kachina, two other 4-Star characters in Natlan. Had she been a 5-Star character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , her symbol would have been saved for the Tribal Chronicle instead. As a result, the logical assumption presented by the game is that Iansan is the 4-Star of the Collective of Plenty, while Varesa is the 5-Star of the tribe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the list of upcoming
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  characters places Iansan next to Varesa, who isn't expected to debut until Version 5.5. Given that Kachina was followed by Xilonen, and Ororon was followed by Citlali, there seems to be a pattern of releasing 4-Star characters of a Natlan tribe before the 5-Star. This is likely due to 5-Star characters having an upgraded version of their tribe's exploration ability. Thankfully, players won't have to wait long for
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  to confirm Iansan's rarity, as her drip marketing is expected to start soon. Version 5.4 is set to launch on February 12, 2025.

  Both
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro
   </em>
  </strong>
  last approximately as long as each other, with both taking about 7 hours to complete their main campaigns, and maybe an hour longer if players took a few detours along the way. But
  <em>
   Enter Electro
  </em>
  gets the nod as, if players wanted to beat both games 100%, the sequel takes an hour longer at 13 ½ hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Enter Electro
  </em>
  introduced ground levels to the PS1 series, albeit in limited grid-based sections. Spidey tries to stop Electro’s master plan to boost his powers via the Bio-Nexus device, all this while tackling the likes of Shocker, Hammerhead, and Sandman, with help from the X-Men. However, it got a cooler reception than its predecessor due to its more rote story.

  Speaking of sequels,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Spider-Man: Edge of Time
   </em>
  </strong>
  follows up on
  <em>
   Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions
  </em>
  , as the webhead rejoins forces with Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Man Noir, and Ultimate Spider-Man to keep space and time from falling apart (again). Each Spider-Man has his own spider-quirks too, from Spider-Man’s hyper-sense to Spider-Man 2099’s holo-clones.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, they’re the only two playable Spider-Men. The story focuses more on them as they try to secure the timeline against Anti-Venom and Dr. Octopus. Noir and Ultimate have their appearances limited to cutscenes. As such, it’s a much shorter experience than
  <em>
   Shattered Dimensions
  </em>
  , being just barely longer than
  <em>
   Enter Electro
  </em>
  .

  Movie tie-in games used to be the norm and were usually mediocre because of their limited development time, but Treyarch’s
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  movie games caught on quite well. Especially
  <strong>
   <em>
    Spider-Man 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as it took Spidey out of the PS1-style set levels and into an open-world setting. It basically created the formula the Insomniac games and others have since followed.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has similar beat ‘em up gameplay, but with a plot that follows the
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  movie, with the movie’s cast reprising their roles (for better or worse). The game also has plenty of side missions and activities that expand the Raimi-verse and stretch the game’s length. The story campaign is brief, but completionists will have up to 40 hours of fun cleaning up New York City of crime.

  Despite the Arabic numeral in
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  , it’s actually the third entry in Insomniac’s series. Among them is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales
   </em>
  </strong>
  , where players help the second Spider-Man fill in for the first and become a hero in his own right as he tackles Roxxon Corporation’s criminal conspiracy and the machinations of the Tinkerer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, fans might be forgiven for forgetting it, as it’s a rather brief game. Players can complete its main campaign in less than half the time of the other Insomniac Spider-games, and its extras don’t stretch it out much either. Still, it's probably better off as a short and sweet experience than one packed with filler. If only it was priced as such, as its $50 price tag was a lot to ask for on its release date.

   <em>

  </strong>
  continued where
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  left off in both story and gameplay. The movie’s actors came back to reprise their roles, with varying degrees of enthusiasm (Bruce Campbell even narrated the tutorial sections). The game also brought back the open world of Manhattan, side missions and activities, and beat ‘em up gameplay, with a new Rage mechanic for stronger attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  The length of play time is based on the PS3/360/PC version, which had better graphics and an extra playable character in the New Goblin. Yet while its story campaign was a little longer, it didn’t have as many extras as
  <em>
   Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  . Raimi-verse versions of Kraven the Hunter, the Lizard, and Scorpion, among others, turn up and equal up to only 10 or so extra hours of gameplay.

  With director Sam Raimi out of the picture after
  <em>
   Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  , Sony rebooted the Spider-Man movies with
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Amazing Spider-Man
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which turned out to be anything but. Its movie tie-in game took a different approach too, as Beenox (who ported Treyarch’s games to PC) told an original story where Spidey has to work with the Lizard to stop Alistair Smythe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gameplay-wise, it’s also an open-world game with side missions, but Spidey now fights similarly to Batman in the
  <em>
   Arkham
  </em>
  games, with its freeflow combat and counterattacks, albeit with a neat ‘Web Rush’ mode for zipping from enemy to enemy, point to point. It offered more bang for its buck, though it wasn’t much longer or better than the
  <em>
   Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  game.

  Just because a game gets a lukewarm reception, or is merely okay, doesn’t mean it can’t be influential. Without
  <strong>
   <em>
    Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the Spider-Verse likely wouldn’t have come to be. Dan Slott’s story for the game inspired his later
  <em>
   Spider-Verse
  </em>
  comics, which led to the
  <em>
   Spider-Verse
  </em>
  movies, and
  <em>
   Spider-Man: No Way Home
  </em>
  ’s own dimensional fiddling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of offering an open world, Spider-Mans Noir, Ultimate, 2099, and Classic go through levels tailored to their individual quirks (Spidey Noir is good at stealth, Ultimate has the symbiote suit, etc.) to restore balance to the spacetime continuum. All this is done at a decent length too, with a 10-hour main campaign, and a much longer 25-hour trek for completionists.

  As the longest non-Insomniac game, people might remember
  <strong>
   <em>
    Spider-Man: Web of Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  for the meme of Spidey walking morosely as his fellow heroes fight off an army of symbiotes. Or, if players chose to do so, they could make Spidey give in to the symbiote and take over New York City, with Black Cat by his side.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are happier endings, where Spidey saves the city and gets back with Mary Jane, but they’re rather ho-hum in comparison, as was the gameplay, which wasn’t exactly a step-up from the Treyarch games. Still, if players gave it a shot, they’d find its main campaign just as busy as
  <em>
   Shattered Dimensions
  </em>
  , and almost as long through its extras too.

 <p>
  Insomniac’s
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  games took all that worked about the older Spidey games, added a more cinematic polish, and told stories that really plucked the heartstrings once they hit their climax.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  continues that formula, as Peter Parker and Miles Morales deal with Kraven the Hunter as he starts hunting both them and their rogues gallery down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both Spider-Men have separate objectives and missions, along with individual power-ups, gadgets, and regular human partners as those stealth sections make a comeback. They alone might add to its 17-hour story campaign for some players, not to mention all the extras. Cleaning up Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens completely will take players 28 hours.

  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  was initially going to be followed up with some DLC like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel’s Spider-Man
   </em>
  </strong>
  . These plans were scrapped, likely because they’re going to be consolidated into their own
  <em>
   Venom: Lethal Protector
  </em>
  spin-off, but nobody knows for sure. This means the first game is now technically the longest
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  game out there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even without the DLC,
  <em>
   MSM1
  </em>
  would tie with
  <em>
   MSM2
  </em>
  in its campaign length, and outlast it in extras, offering 35 hours of gameplay for completionists. However, since its Remastered edition comes with everything
  <em>
   a la
  </em>
  its Game of the Year release, even players seeking to breeze through it will be kept busy for at least 18 hours. That’s more than enough arachnid-based fun for anyone.

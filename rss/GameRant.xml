  While Dress to Impress is free to play on
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  , you'll need to
  <strong>
   spend Robux to get a VIP Pass.

  Robux is the in-game currency of
  <em>
   Roblox

  , which is purchased with real money.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you’re playing
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  , click on the middle yellow icon located on the left side of your screen. This will open a menu displaying various in-game purchases, like
  <strong>
   Custom Makeup, VIP Pass,
  </strong>
  and the ability to
  <strong>
   Run Faster.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Click on the Purchase button under VIP, and you'll be presented with two options for
  <em>

  VIP:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>

   </strong>
   : Gives you Permanent VIP access for
   <strong>
    799 Robux
   </strong>
   .

  <li>
   <strong>

   : A 30-day VIP subscription for only
   <strong>
    299 Robux.
   </strong>
  </li>

 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-tip">
  <div class="emaki-custom tip" id="custom_block_10">
   <div class="custom_block-content tip">
    <p>

  The VIP Pass grants you entry into a special closet where you’ll find a whole range of high-quality clothing, shoes, bags, and accessories. The most famous items in the VIP dressing studio are the iconic jellyfish skirt, a stunning floor-length dress, an elegant late-Victorian gown, a beautiful selection of wings, and a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to these statement items, the VIP room offers a curated selection of necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, which expand your jewelry options. For those concerned about others copying their looks, VIP gives you private dressing rooms and salon seats, so you can hide your fit until the final reveal.

  The decision to purchase VIP status depends on your priorities within the game. If you're really passionate about fashion, crave exclusive items, and want to stand out from the crowd, VIP can be a worthwhile investment. While some items are undoubtedly unique and eye-catching, with a bit of creativity, you can often achieve similar looks with regular closet items. Ultimately, the choice is yours.

      Arrowhead Game Studios CCO Johan Pilestedt touched on the studio's involvement in the Helldivers 2 movie adaptation, saying “We are not Hollywood people, and we don’t know what it takes to make a movie...and therefore we don’t, and shouldn’t, have final say.”

 <p>
  Democracy is coming to the silver screen following the announcement of a new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  live-action movie from Sony, and Arrowhead Game Studios, the team behind the shooter, CCO Johan Pilestedt has clarified the team’s involvement. During CES 2025, Sony announced two other projects alongside the
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  movie, including a
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  movie adaptation, and a
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  animation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The co-op third-person shooter
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  launched in February 2024 and found immediate success thanks to its brutal combat against Terminids and Automatons, and its comical comradery. Looking to the future, with the shooter's success paving the way, Arrowhead is working on the next game to succeed
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . With updates continuing throughout 2025 on Super Earth, Pilestedt said the team was open to feedback from the community to help craft the next project during the early stages of development.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sony announced the
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  movie was a collaboration between Sony Productions and Sony Pictures, but head of PlayStation Productions Asad Qizilbash remained tight-lipped on any further details. Since the
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  community is rather protective of the source material, fans have been asking if Arrowhead would be involved in the development. Pilestedt finally responded on Twitter and admitted he had been dodging this question. The CCO confirmed the studio would be involved, but stated “We are not Hollywood people, and we don’t know what it takes to make a movie.” Pilestedt continued, “And therefore we don’t, and shouldn’t, have final say.”

  Helldivers 2 Dev Touches on Arrowhead's Involvement in Movie Adaptation
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  fans are adamant the movie has to strike the right tone, and to achieve this, the community is keen to see Arrowhead involved as much as possible, so the script and action remain loyal to the game. One Twitter user expressed concern that producers and writers would try to make the movie “their own,” and one idea players didn’t want to see was “gamer wakes up in Helldivers universe.” Most agreed Arrowhead should have the final say on the script, theme, and aesthetic of the movie, and another fan thought it was paramount the Helldivers never take their helmets off.

  While a
  <em>

  <em>
   2
  </em>
  movie sounds like an action-packed time on the silver screen, comparisons have been drawn to a pre-existing cult classic.
  <em>
   Starship Troopers
  </em>
  is a 1997 sci-fi action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and based on the 1959 novel by Robert A. Heinlein. The premise involves a militant branch of the Earth-based United Citizen Federation that is caught in an interstellar war with alien Arachnids, and gamers hope
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  can set itself apart from
  <em>
   Starship Troopers
  </em>
  , possibly by getting rid of the common alien insects.

  Restoring the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dreamlight Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  to its former glory is going to take a lot of work, and you’ll need plenty of energy to keep going. One great way to stay energized is by cooking meals, and there are tons of recipes you can make in the game. The rarer the ingredients, the more energy your meal will give you.

  Arcane Garlic Crab is a four-star entree introduced in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley: Storybook Vale
  </em>
  . Unlike some other recipes, all its ingredients are found within Storybook Vale, so you won’t need to travel back to
  <em>
   Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  . However, it can still be tricky to figure out what you need to make it. Here's a quick guide to help you gather the ingredients.

  Garlic is the easiest ingredient to find for this recipe. If you’ve been cooking in
  <em>
   Dreamlight Valley

 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Everafter
  </li>
  <li>
   Forest of Valor
  </li>
  <li>
   The Grove
  </li>
  <li>
   The Lagoon
  </li>
  <li>
   Frozen Realm.
  </li>
 </ul>

  For the Arcane Garlic Crab recipe,
  <em>
   DDV
  </em>
  players can use any spice ingredient of their choice. The game has plenty of spice options, so you should be able to find one easily in a nearby biome. Some spices that work perfectly for this dish include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Lightning Spice
  </li>
  <li>
   Ambrosia
  </li>
  <li>
   Ginger
  </li>
  <li>
   Paprika
  </li>
  <li>
   Oregano
  </li>
  <li>
   Mint
  </li>
  <li>
   Majestea.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="getting-sorcerer-hat-hermit-crab-in-ddv">

 <p>
  Next, you’ll need to catch the Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab. This seafood ingredient is a bit tricky to get because it’s a rare spawn.
  <em>
   DDV
  </em>
  fans should fish in golden bubbles, as that’s where this ingredient appears.

 <p>
  To get Salt Crystals, you will need to equip your fishing rod and cast your line in the water without any bubbles. Salt Crystals are pretty common here, as there aren’t many other materials you will reel in outside of bubbles. You will be able to gather plenty of them quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have all the ingredients, find a stove (one is available in your house). Interact with the stove and add the ingredients to cook Arcane Garlic Crab. After it’s made, you can either eat it to restore
  <strong>
   3,250 energy
  </strong>
  or sell it for
  <strong>
   1,335 Star Coins.
  </strong>

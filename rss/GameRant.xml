  Similar to steam cores in the original
  <em>
   Frostpunk
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Frostpunk 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  introduces
  <strong>
   Cores
  </strong>
  , a rare resource that you can’t mine or produce by yourself. Cores are one of the most important resources you’ll need to unlock advanced technologies and upgrade your city's infrastructure. Without Cores, your city's growth and survival would be severely limited.

  Unlike Coal, Oil, or food in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  , Cores are not a naturally occurring resource in New London. They are components of pre-Frost machinery and cannot be manufactured, only found. Read on to learn how you can get more Cores in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2

  To launch expeditions, you need to unlock

  The main use of Cores is to
  <strong>
   upgrade the Generator
  </strong>
  in the Central District and construct specialized buildings, like the
  <strong>
   Deep Melting Drill
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Pressurized Coal Liquefactor.

 <p>
  The Deep Melting Drills let your Extraction Districts access
  <strong>
   Deep Deposits
  </strong>
  that increase your resource yield, while the Pressurized Coal Liquefactor lets you convert Coal into Oil. These buildings are a must-have to ensure your city has enough resources to survive.

 <p>
  Besides this, Cores are also used in establishing
  <strong>
   Colonies
  </strong>
  . Since Cores are pretty scarce, it’s recommended to use them only when absolutely necessary. If you're desperate for Cores, you can dismantle buildings that originally used them, but this should only be done as a last resort. Destroying buildings takes up time and can negatively affect your city.

  A creative
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has brought a bit of classic cartoon villainy to the world of the Guardians by creating a new costume based on iconic
  <em>
   Masters of the Universe
  </em>
  bad guy Skeletor. Designed for use by a
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Hunter Guardian, the costume underlines the many creative possibilities afforded by the game's versatile armor customization systems.

 <p>
  Though the active
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  player count has shrunk to new lows in recent months, the game still maintains an enthusiastic core of players and supporters still playing and creating content for it. That's particularly true for fashion fiends that love creating new costumes in-game. This is due to the fact that many longtime
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players have access to huge ranges of armor appearances and color shaders for use with the game's transmog system. Every new season of content brings new possibilities for creating a new original aesthetic, or perhaps reference a beloved character.

  For DestinyFashion Reddit community member DownThrowToAnything, that beloved character is He-Man's arch-nemesis Skeletor. Perhaps one of the most iconic cartoon characters of the 1980s, Skeletor served as the villain of the original
  <em>
   He-Man and the Masters of the Universe
  </em>
  series, and became the subject of an impressive
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  Hunter costume decades later.

 <p>
  DownThrowToAnything's Hunter costume uses the very popular Epialos Following Hunter mask as its centerpiece. Released during
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Season of the Haunted back in 2022, the mask recalled the ghostly nightmare enemies that stalked players and characters alike throughout the seasonal story. Colored with the Continuum Alloy shader, the mask looks like a shinier version of Skeletor's bone-white visage. The rest of the costume is kept deliberately low-profile, owing to the fact that Skeletor's classic character design isn't given to wearing bulky clothes or armor.

  The simple Renegade Hood doubles as Skeletor's hood, while his full-body bright blue tights (or bare skin, depending on the depiction) are replicated by the form-fitting Outlander's Grip gloves, Pathfinder's Tunic chestpiece, and Soaring Sword legs. The bright blue-and-purple shading is provided by the cyberpunk-themed Indigo Matrix shader, with Tyrian Abyss on the hood and Sinking Feeling on the gloves to round out the ensemble. As a bonus, DownThrowToAnything added the skull-topped Bad Juju Exotic pulse rifle to evoke Skeletor's ram's head staff weapon.

  Fellow players praised the new Skeletor costume, responding with memes and references to Skeletor's insults. A few also compared DownThrowToAnything's work favorably with another

  Chapter 2, you’ll find a drunken boar that goes by the name of the

  While Fuban is an optional boss in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , you’ll still want to beat him to get your hands on his Vessel and Horn, both of which can help you on your journey. Here’s how you can defeat Fuban.

  First things first, don’t let Fuban's large size intimidate you. Despite being a secret boss in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , this fight isn’t as hard as the others in Chapter 2, but you’ll still need to stock up on healing items and possibly upgrade your Gourd.

 <p>
  Fuban will start the fight by disappearing underground. When Fuban emerges from the sand, he’ll leap high into the air and try to crush you with his flop attack. The key here is to time your
  <strong>
   dodge perfectly
  </strong>
  to avoid taking damage. After he lands, Fuban won’t move around too much, giving you a window to get some attacks in.

  <strong>
   Focus your attacks on his claws
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
  </strong>
  and you’ll slowly but surely drain some of his HP. Use the
  <strong>
   Thrust Stance
  </strong>
  to attack its claws with a long-range heavy attack. Although Fuban won't move around much during this phase, he’s going to shake his head violently. Be prepared to dodge any slams or attacks he might attempt.

 <p>
  Once you’ve drained about a third of Fuban’s health, he'll retreat underground and start swimming through the sand towards you. Keep your eyes fixed on him and track his movements. Fuban’s next attack will be from beneath the sand with his horn, so keep dodging to stay safe. Use the
  <strong>
   Pillar Stance
  </strong>
  to rise above the sand and avoid taking any damage.

  Fuban will eventually jump out from the sand again and launch a series of leap attacks, beginning the second phase of the fight. Thankfully, the
  <strong>
   Yellow Wind Sage
  </strong>
  will intervene by banging his drums and stun Fuban, giving you an opening to climb onto its back and retrieve the Vessel.

  At first glance, it may seem that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Anime Simulator
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a pretty simple training simulator. However, the game has many RPG features and abilities that can be obtained in various ways. This also applies to your Companions since in addition to stat bonuses, they can have Traits. Therefore, in this guide, we will tell you how to get and use Reroll Tokens in
  <em>
   Anime Simulator
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":370} -->

 <p>
  As we said, these Tokens are necessary to get new Traits in this
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  experience. Therefore, these items are extremely valuable. Fortunately, there are quite a few ways that you can earn them.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Anime Simulator
  </em>
  , players need to farm many different currencies to progress effectively. However, Reroll Tokens are the rarest of them all, as they do not drop from bosses or regular enemies. Instead, you need to use one of two methods to get Reroll Tokens in
  <em>
   Anime Simulator
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":714} -->
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Redeem Codes

 <p>
  The first method is the easiest but has limitations. Although the developers regularly add quite a few codes to
  <em>
   Anime Simulator
  </em>
  , they are all one-time use and also expire after a while. Therefore, you will not be able to get more than a few Tokens this way.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1001} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  At the same time, Quests are the best source of Reroll Tokens in
  <em>
   Anime Simulator
  </em>
  . Be it Daily or Weekly Quests, most of them will reward you with several Tokens, in addition to Coins and Gems. Also, players should not forget about Side Quests. To start them, you need to find the appropriate NPCs, such as The World, aka Dio.

  However, we recommend that players use both of these methods at the same time. This way, you can earn the maximum possible number of Tokens in a short time.

  After you have earned your first Reroll Tokens, you will probably want to use them as soon as possible. To do this, players should
  <strong>
   go to the hospital building,
  </strong>
  which is not far from the starting building. Near it, you will find the Trait Manager NPC.

  After that, you need to interact with him to roll a Trait for your current Companion. Each attempt costs one Reroll Token, so with enough of these items, you can get any Trait you want. It is worth noting, though, that this feature is only available if you have achieved Reaper rank or higher.

Players who want to experience the Midtown map immediately can select a Quick Play mode specifically designed to showcase the new content.

 <p>
  The Lift to the Top
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  event is a perfect chance for players who want to join races in the Snow Racers minigame. There are over 2,200 Flags up for grabs, which you will need to participate in the minigame.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lift to the Top is the first event to offer the Lucky Rocket booster in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , and it’s a total game-changer for the Snow Racers event. Here’s how it works: when you use the Lucky Rocket, your next dice roll will guarantee numbers between 4 and 6 on each of the three dice. That means you’ll roll a total of 12 to 18, which helps you earn more points and move your car further along the track.
 </p>
 <p>
  When one teammate activates the Lucky Rocket, everyone on the team gets the boosted roll on their next turn, so your teammates will thank you for participating in Lift to the Top
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  . We have a detailed guide on the Lucky Rocket booster that players can check out for more details.

  Your objective in the Lift to the Top event is to land your board token on the
  <strong>
   Chance, Utility, and Tax Tiles
  </strong>
  . Here's what each square offers:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Chance: Two Points
  </li>
  <li>
   Tax Tile: Three Points
  </li>
  <li>
   Utility: Two Points.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As usual, you can activate a higher multiplier to score more points with every landing. For example, a 10x multiplier will grant you 10 points for the Chance tile.

      <title>Haunted Chocolatier's Customization Options Could Skyrocket if It Follows One Animal Crossing Trend</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/haunted-chocolatier-animal-crossing-village-customization-buildings/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  When it comes to cozy gaming,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  is the holy grail, and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Haunted Chocolatier
   </strong>
  </em>
  is looking to continue this tradition of excellence. Being developer Eric Barone's second game, audiences can expect
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  to take some greater risks than its predecessor, sticking to many of its core mechanics while iterating upon them in unique ways.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  The greatest changes will likely stem from
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  's radically different premise. It's all in the game's name, really:
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  will task players with creating and selling chocolate instead of farming, and the supernatural will play a decidedly central role in the game, whereas it is more of a background element in
  <em>
   Stardew
  </em>
  . Both of these departures provide fertile soil for new personalization and progression features. For instance, since players are running a customer-facing business in
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  , there are opportunities for strategic customization, setting up the storefront with both aesthetics and function in mind. But there is one other personalization system that, while unprecedented in Barone's one-game portfolio, could nevertheless be a natural progression from the player's locus of control in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  .

  Giving Players More Control Over Haunted Chocolatier's Game World
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  series, the player-character is more than just another resident: they are essentially the main urban planner for their community. This informal position of power manifests in a number of different ways, with the series' latest entry,
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  , making the player more influential than ever. They can build, upgrade, and move just about every in-game building (the exceptions being the airport and Resident Services)—with the approval of Tom Nook, of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  This feature creates a broader sense of freedom for the player, and
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  could learn from it. Since players will presumably have less space to work with compared to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , where they had an entire estate instead of just a single factory under their control, allowing for some greater customization of the town's layout or appearance could be beneficial. In fact, one could make the argument that the ability to move, alter, or otherwise customize multiple buildings would be a sensible extension of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's Community Center and Joja Mart quest chain. That is to say, players would be given the same level of control over the whole town, not just one or two buildings.
 </p>
 <h3 id="animal-crossing-esque-customization-in-haunted-chocolatier-would-be-a-tough-line-to-toe">
  Animal-Crossing-Esque Customization In Haunted Chocolatier Would Be a Tough Line to Toe
 </h3>
 <p>
  Though they both fall under the ever-widening umbrella of "cozy game," and Barone has explicitly named the
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  series as one of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's influences, it would be a mistake to think that
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  are overtly similar to Nintendo's long-running franchise. In fact,
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  may have more differences than commonalities between them, as the latter is ostensibly aimed at slightly older audiences, and will probably lack many of the core gameplay staples of
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  , like the real-time in-game clock.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of that is to say that
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  copying-and-pasting
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  's village-wide customization features would be both unlikely and potentially damaging to the overall experience.
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  is a triumphant achievement, but it isn't aiming for the same targets as
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  , especially when it comes to immersion, RPG elements, and NPC relationships. In other words, it would be weird for
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  to give players carte blanche to rearrange their towns however they see fit, as this would basically break the illusion of the game being set in a town with real people living independent lives. But perhaps
  <em>
   Haunted Chocolatier
  </em>
  could simply borrow the spirit of
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  's customization, letting the player move only a few buildings and make smaller changes to other common spaces, all couched within the game's narrative, keeping things from getting jarring or overly silly.

   <em>
    Human Within
   </em>
  </strong>
  straddles the line between virtual reality games and interactive fiction, smoothly shifting from one format to another in a unique way that has yet to be seen on the platform. Its traditional virtual reality moments contain most of the game's interactivity, while the 360-degree live-action scenes host some thought-provoking decision-making.

  In an interview with Game Rant, creative director Avi Winkler spoke strongly about the importance of meaningful decisions in
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  and interactive media as a whole. He also revealed how the logistical challenges of live-action filming unexpectedly benefited player choices. Winkler then described how players will weigh these decisions in
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  .

  Owing to its interactive fiction side,
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  runs a bit shorter than popular VR games that seek to engage players over long stretches. Instead,
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  presents more as a feature-length film with a strong narrative focus from beginning to end. Due to this comparatively short length, Winkler explains that the team had to be selective about the decisions players face:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   While Human Within is a long-form interactive experience in the VR sense, it's not a 15-to-20-hour experience. It's about an hour to an hour and a half per playthrough. The time can vary depending on how long it takes you to solve puzzles, which scenes you watch, and what ending you get.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of the duration of Human Within, we have to be very selective regarding the choice opportunities in the story and the fact that it's live-action. That all impacts the shooting schedule and production process. Filming a branching narrative in live action is a huge endeavor, so we are very selective about the opportunities. As a result, your choices significantly influence which ending you ultimately get.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Practicality was another factor the team had to consider when developing
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  . Including too many branching decisions and too many game endings would make an already ambitious project impossible to manage. Filming schedules, script writing, and other production elements would be bogged down by excessive content. On the flip side, managing this limitation proved to be beneficial to Signal Space Lab: Winkler notes that being selective by necessity ensured that
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  was packed with drastically influential decisions. It's a quality-over-quantity approach that kills two birds with one stone.

 <p>
  When it comes to those decisions, Game Rant asked if
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  would separate choices into directions like 'good' or 'evil' or as
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  's dialogue system describes it, 'paragon' and 'renegade.' In response, Winkler describes Human Within's decisions as divided between selfish and compassionate options. To revisit the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  comparison, the approach resembles
  <em>
   Mass Effect: Andromeda
  </em>
  's dialogue. The choices are based more on emotion and the player's outlook rather than being a strictly binary morality system.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Not good versus evil, it's not quite like that. Everyone in the world is unique and makes choices in their life based on a variety of circumstances. The choices in Human Within are based on selfish versus compassionate options.
  </p>
  <p>
   While these choices impact the events that follow their underlying themes, they also reflect the choices that are made behind the advancements of technology. “Is technology always created for the betterment of humanity, or are there sometimes ulterior motives behind their development?”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  How player decisions influence
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  's unfolding story is also worth mentioning. Its 360-degree live-action scenes take place in the past, letting the player determine their backstory and establish a history to address in the 'present time' sequences. Instead of choices being limited to immediate situations, players face decisions that fundamentally reshape their future. Thanks to an intriguing narrative theme that enables a unique combination of interactive elements,
  <em>
   Human Within
  </em>
  is a promising VR game worth looking into.

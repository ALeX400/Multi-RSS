  One
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  fan created mockups of custom Special Edition Pro controllers based on some popular gaming franchises, including
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  . First launched in 2017, the Nintendo Switch is one of Nintendo's most successful consoles ever released. The hybrid system has entered its seventh year of being on the market, and has had an impressive lineup of games. While the Nintendo Switch has a pair of detachable controllers on its side, the Joy-Cons, Nintendo has also sold a series of wired and wireless controllers for fans who prefer a more traditional controller. One of the best variants of these controllers is the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.

 <p>
  The Switch Pro Wireless controller is one of the best options to use on the Switch. It includes a comfortable form, responsive buttons and sticks, and built-in HD rumble and motion controls, which most third-party controller options don't have. While the controller has a default black color scheme, Nintendo has released special edition variants of the controller, which are based on popular properties like
  <em>
   Xenoblade Chronicles
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  , and even
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  . Fans love creating their own mockups of custom hardware, with one fan showing off what they think would look best on a controller for the Switch.

 <p>
  Posted on the r/NintendoSwitch subreddit by user Iamar333, they showed off Special Edition Switch Pro Controller concepts. The games they used to be represented on these custom Nintendo Switch Controllers were
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fire Emblem: Three Houses
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  . The
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  controller appropriately has the game's logo located where the buttons are, along with an orange and white scheme. The
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  Controller has an orange color scheme and is based on Samus Aran's helmet and visor.

  The

 <p>
  Fans praised the mockups, noting they do look similar to how Nintendo would design a Pro Controller, based on past ones that were released. Some fans pointed Iamar333 to CaptnAlex Designs, an Orlando-based gaming hardware distributor that specializes in custom controllers or accessories, who sells hardware based on popular games like
  <em>
   Persona 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Metroid.
  </em>
  The site even teamed up with
  <em>
   Cult of the Lamb
  </em>
  to produce a limited set of themed Joy-Cons. Fans also hoped that the Switch successor would continue with the Switch Pro Controller line for the console.

  Epic Games, the developer and publisher of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  , has shared an update regarding the upcoming return of the game's mobile version to Apple iOS. The company's free-to-play title remains extremely popular, and
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  continues to regularly collaborate with major brands and IPs.

 <p>
  In 2020, Apple removed
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  from the iOS App Store after Epic Games added its own payment system to the title, a move that violated the platform's guidelines. Since then, iPhone and iPad users have been unable to update and install
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  on their devices. Those on iOS were only able to play the game by using workarounds that involved the streaming services Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia Geforce Now, and Amazon Luna. However, Epic Games said in January that
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  was set to return to iOS devices in the European Union (EU), and the company has just announced that this could happen very soon.

  Epic Games plans to launch
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and its own storefront, the Epic Games Store, on iOS in the EU within the next couple of months, the company recently claimed in a Twitter statement. It was revealed in March that the Epic Games Store would come to iOS and Android devices in 2024, but no exact release date was provided at the time.

  Apple previously terminated an Epic Games developer account that the latter company had intended to use to bring
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and its storefront to iOS devices in the EU. Epic Games argued that the termination violated the coalition's Digital Markets Act (DMA), and Apple later reinstated the account following an inquiry by the European Commission. Under the DMA, platform holders like Apple must permit third-party app stores to exist in their operating systems, and Epic Games credits the law with allowing
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's return to iOS in the EU.

 <p>
  According to Epic Games' latest statement, both
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and its storefront have been submitted to Apple for their required notarization processes. Epic Games hopes to bring its other titles to more mobile app stores, and it wants to talk with stores that offer great terms to all developers. Apple charges a 30% fee for paid apps and in-app purchases on iOS, while the Epic Games Store, which is currently only available on PCs and Macs, takes a 12% revenue cut. The Epic Games Store has yet to turn a profit, Epic Games admitted in November.

 <p>
  Fortunately for Epic Games,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  alone is generating a lot of money for the company. The free-to-play experience was the highest-grossing game in the first quarter of 2024, research and analytics firm Newzoo found.

  A fan of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </em>
  </strong>
  went above and beyond with her fandom by turning themselves into the titular princess of Hyrule with a carefully detailed Zelda cosplay that brings the character to life in the real world. The cosplayer used a variety of accessories to bring
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  to the real world with their outfit, which shows off a seemingly high attention to detail.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  is one of the biggest and most iconic franchises in gaming, with its most recent mainline title,
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom,
  </em>
  pleasing fans with its open-world design and ability to create various vehicles and constructs. The game is one of only a few direct sequels in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise, taking place after the events of
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild,
  </em>
  which seemingly serves as the basis for this cosplayer's outfit.

  Users in the comments showed up to praise the cosplayer and her detailed outfit, with some even claiming that she should portray the character in an official film adaptation of the long-running Nintendo franchise. Another praised the staging and composition of the photos, as the forest environment, waterfalls, and serene scenery seemingly emulate the tranquil nature environments from
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  and other games in the series.

  The cosplayer has done a variety of other shoots as different characters from multiple franchises as well, such as Aerith from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7,
  </em>
  Clorinde from
  <em>
   Genshin Impact,
  </em>
  and Melina from
  <em>
   Elden Ring,
  </em>
  among others. Their cosplays consist almost entirely of video game characters, mostly from RPG titles, and all of them seemed to impress fans, who often comment on their photos with mass praise and adoration.

 <p>
  Currently, the fan has not revealed what their next cosplay may be, but since their entire account is dedicated to the hobby, it seems likely that more will come in the near future. With Zelda taking center stage in
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom,
  </em>
  however, it may be another opportunity for a follow-up photo shoot using that game's design for the character.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
   </em>
  </strong>
  , despite receiving near-unanimous praise from critics ahead of its release, has found itself embroiled in an impassioned debate regarding the merits of its difficulty. The expansion is certainly a step up in challenge compared to the base game, with major bosses like Messmer the Impaler causing trouble for players even after FromSoftware's latest calibration patch, which significantly improves power scaling in The Land of Shadow.

 <p>
  The specific complaints about Shadow of the Erdtree's difficulty are myriad, but among the most commonly raised points is the matter of player progression and ability: many Tarnished are heading into The Land of Shadow with late-game builds, often well over level 200, and still getting annihilated by several enemy NPCs. In response to this, defenders of the expansion have cited FromSoftware's own statements, which touch on a desire to make Shadow of the Erdtree
  <em>
  </em>
  a significant challenge, even for veteran players. This is why the DLC map has its own progression system via Shadow Blessings. Setting aside the value of this new progression system, there's one problem with this revamped difficulty curve that is worth addressing.

  The Land of Shadow's Difficulty Makes Sense at Many Points

 <p>
  Among Shadow of the Erdtree's most controversial elements is its boss design, as many players feel that certain boss fights, especially the ultimate one, are hard in an unfair way. This isn't a ridiculous argument, but one may be able to view this elevated difficulty from a narrative standpoint: Demigods, renowned knights, and mythical, ancient creatures all ought to be difficult foes to topple. It's fair that these boss fights should be overwhelmingly challenging, as the player is tasked with taking down the world's most powerful forces.

     Certain overworld enemies, like Shadow of the Erdtree's Furnace Golems , also pose a reasonable challenge, based on their place in

  Shadow of the Erdtree's Difficulty May Be Too Universal
 </h3>
 <p>
  Lore issues start to arise when viewing Shadow of the Erdtree's difficulty as a whole. It's not just the uber-powerful bosses that can take down players in one or two hits: bears, overgrown bats, and everyday foot soldiers that roam the overworld can also brutalize the player-character with relative ease.

 <p>
  By this point in the game, players will have, at the very least, taken down Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood, and many will have already beaten the game at least once. These players have essentially slain the gods of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's world, so regular animals and warriors, vicious as they may be, should pose no threat from a lore perspective.

 <p>
  Granted, this is a tricky problem to remedy. With the expansion having such a massive map, it must be populated with some sort of fodder enemies, and making them all pushovers wouldn't make for a very interesting open world, mechanically speaking.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":925} -->

 <p>
  At the same time, some sort of narrative justification for the player's massive decrease in relative power could have gone a long way toward immersion and plausibility. Something like
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   The Old Hunters
  </em>
  DLC does this well, as it pits the player against blood-drunk Hunters and hulking beasts that juxtapose the fodder enemies of the base game.

 <p>
  Of course,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  poses a significantly bigger balancing issue due to its build variety, not to mention its swollen scope in comparison to
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  's—not every minor enemy in The Land of Shadow can be a narratively justified, earth-shaking threat. At the same time, it can be hard to take the expansion's early hours seriously, as players may be fresh off the heels of Elden Beast's defeat, only to be swiftly cut down by a lone bear or archer.

  Warmaster Bernahl is a character you can meet early on in the base game. He will sell you Ashes of War. These are weapon techniques that can be used by consuming focus points. You can swap out these techniques and apply them to different weapons. Bernahl will move several times throughout the game. Here are all the places you can locate him in
  <em>
   Elden Ring.

  The first place you can encounter Bernahl is at the

   Warmaster's Shack
  </strong>
  in Limgrave. You may go there if you're following the graces on the way to Stormveil Castle. The shack is at the center of the Stormhill area. Head east from the Stormhill Shack where Roderika the Spirit Tuner is located. Speak to Bernahl and he will offer his wares to you.

  Bernahl will move if you pledge your allegiance to Volcano Manor by finding it or getting an invitation from Raya in Liurnia. He'll be in the
  <strong>
   dining room
  </strong>
  down the hall from the main grace. His name will now be Recusant Bernahl. He'll give you a letter concerning the manor questline and continue to sell you Ashes of War. Return to him after you complete Volcano Manor requests for rewards.

  Once you've defeated Rykard, he'll leave the manor. However, his
  <strong>
   sword
  </strong>
  will remain propped up on a chair in the dining room. You can still speak and spend runes to learn new skills. At this point, he will no longer be in the world through normal means.

  Bernahl can then be summoned as an ally during the difficult

  </strong>
  boss fight in Crumbling Farum Azula. Go up the staircase from the Dragon Temple Transept grace to find his summon sign before the Godskin Duo fog door.

  Recusant Bernahl will invade while you're on the walkway to the chest. He has a large AOE attack that can be interrupted, so be patient and wait for openings. He will drop the Blasphemous Claw, Devourer's Scepter, and the Beast Champion armor set. You can still use Bernahl's sword as a merchant after defeating him.

      <title>The Elder Scrolls 6 Can Follow Avowed's Example to Shake Up Its Formula</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Elder Scrolls 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  can change up its formula by incorporating an idea based on what
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  is doing with its player characters. With
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  being the venerable RPG series that it is, it's a little unusual to picture it following another game's lead. However,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  has an idea that could prove useful for
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  to follow up on in its own way. The two games are bound to have a whole world of differences in many areas. Even with that in mind,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  could learn from
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Considering that
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  has already been compared to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , it would be little surprise if it was eventually likened to
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  as well. While there is still very little that is known about
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  , it's very likely that it will be fairly similar to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  in more than a few ways. On the other hand,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's gameplay is largely public knowledge by now. Naturally, its first-person fantasy gameplay featuring spells and swords drew comparisons to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , with a few twists. Once
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  comes out, players will find out how similar it truly is to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  .

 <h3 id="avowed-39-s-skill-system-is-essentially-a-multiclass-system">
  Avowed's Skill System Is Essentially a Multiclass System
 </h3>
 <p>
  One interesting mechanic worth watching is
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  's new skill system. It has a set of skills separated into various classes, each focuses on a specific kind of gameplay. For example, Fighter skills are focused on making characters better at melee combat, Wizard skills improve spellcasting ability, and so on. It's not a true class system, since players are free to mix-and-match skills as they please. However, it still gives clear archetypes that players can follow.
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  players can go all in on one class, or diversify their character's skills to give themselves more options. This approach should offer plenty of viable character builds.

  The Elder Scrolls 6 Can Experiment With Starting Classes

 <p>
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  could offer its own take on the idea. When creating a character in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  , giving players the option to choose their class at the start could give them a few immediate bonuses. For example, Mages could get a larger starting mana pool, while thieves get a stealth bonus and a slight speed increase. However, after leveling up a couple of times, the game could open up to grant players access to skills based in other classes or disciplines. The result would be a character with a strong base, but the ability to have a flexible skillset.

 <p>
  This design would also be a good way to branch off from past
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  character creation systems. While choosing a race in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  was the only way to augment the Dragonborn's skills before their first level-up, other features like
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  's birthsigns have offered unique bonuses as well. Even
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  itself had several skill trees to grab perks from. However, if
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  features classes with innate abilities combined with skill trees, it could have the best of both worlds. The combination could result in players having good reason to make a lot of different characters to experiment with.

 <p>
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  has some good ideas, and
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  can have its own version of some of those concepts. The eventual release of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  is going to be an event no matter what. Not only will it finally continue the series after
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  became a cultural phenomenon, but it will also show the series' next evolution. Of course, its protagonist will be a big part of that. There's a chance that
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  could be something of an inspiration for
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  in that sense.

   <em>
    Love and Deepspace
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an Otome game that blends RPG battles into its mechanics. Players will come across several love interests to spend time with, and they can bring their significant other to fight against enemies in the set universe. The power of the players' companions is dictated by the character's card, which can be obtained through the gacha system. On top of enhancing players' battle experience, these acquired cards also serve to unlock special moments with the in-game characters.

   With the release of the Love and Deepspace Version 2.0 Opposing Visions, Infold released some new

   to celebrate the occasion alongside its Hunters. One of the redemption codes offers players a 10 Empyrean Wish, that they can use to wish on the Xspace Echo banner. Moreover, the new version will include new stories, new features, new events, new free outfits, and the addition of one of the most anticipated new love interests, Sylus.

  fan has recently taken to social media to praise Bethesda for improving the RPG's stealth gameplay, substantiating that observation with some new footage from the game. The brief clip helps illustrate how

 <p>
  One of the major
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  complaints that the game's fandom voiced at launch was that sneaking around was extremely difficult. Those grievances were largely aimed at enemies' ability to spot the player from extreme distances, sometimes even "seeing" them through walls or other types of cover. Bethesda has so far made several attempts to address those complaints.

  Fan Illustrates How Starfield Stealth Is Much More Forgiving Nowadays

 <p>
  While it remains to be seen whether the company is done refining the game's sneaking mechanics, its efforts on this front have already yielded some palpable results. This was recently noted by Reddit user TurnipTate, who shared a clip illustrating some of the observable improvements in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's stealth mechanics. The video begins with their character running down a corridor before crouching down at an intersection, with their footsteps making a guard around the corner grow suspicious, but not outright hostile. This turn of events would virtually never happen in the early versions of the game, which featured enemies with near-superhuman senses.

  A later portion of TurnipTate's clip also illustrates how
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's sneak attacks are now much more consistent, predictably triggering so long as the player remains undiscovered. According to them, the current version of the game's stealth system now only has one big issue that's yet to be resolved, which concerns companion interactions with enemies. Namely, should a companion enter combat, the player will sometimes be unable to perform sneak attacks, even if they themselves haven't been discovered.

  Bethesda's Been Improving Starfield Stealth Since Late 2023
 </h3>
 <p>
  Some of the newly exemplified stealth improvements have been in the game for a while now, dating back to the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  update 1.8.86, which rolled out in late November 2023. That release saw Bethesda adjust the game's sneaking mechanics in order to make them "a bit more forgiving," according to the developer's official changelog.

 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Several more improvements have been released since then, with the most recent of the lot arriving as part of the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  update 1.10.31, which launched in mid-March 2024. That patch fixed an annoying bug that would occasionally cause Minibots to mess with the in-game Stealth Meter. Players who still find sneaking around to be too hard also have the option to utilize some of the game's many stealth mods. One such particularly popular community creation is the Stealth Overhaul mod. Developed by Nexus Mods user IxionXVII, this add-on has been downloaded nearly 215,000 times since its September 2023 release.

      <title>Zenless Zone Zero: W-Engine (Weapon) Tier List</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/zenless-zone-zero-zzz-best-wengine-weapon-tier-list-ranked/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The following tier list ranks the best W-Engines in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  based on their Types: Attack, Anomaly, Stun, Defense, and Support. Before diving into the list, there are a couple of important points to consider. Firstly, W-Engines’ effects only work on Agents with the same Type (Specialty) and Attribute, making a general tier list impractical. Therefore, this tier list has been divided into five categories to better rank each Type’s best options. Secondly, this list excludes battle pass W-Engines and weapons with niche buffs (e.g., those that enhance one specific Attribute), because the goal is to identify all-around practical weapons for players.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    S-Tier
   </strong>
   : The Brimstone is one of the best W-Engines for all Attack Specialty Agents because it benefits from the equipper’s Basic Attack, Dash Attack, and Dodge Counter to buff DMG. Cannon Rotor, meanwhile, offers an easy-to-trigger 12% ATK buff on top of a 200% extra DMG after CRIT hits.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    A-Tier
   </strong>
   : Steel Cushion is a safe option because it provides up to 50% DMG for any attack from behind. It also provides up to 40% Physical DMG for the user. Starlight Engine is another reliable choice because it feeds off Dodge Counter or Quick Assist, two frequent combat moves, to buff ATK.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    B-Tier
   </strong>
   : The Street Superstar is the ideal stopgap. It gives the Agent a Charge stack every time a team member lands a Chain Attack.

  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    A-Tier
   </strong>
   : Hellfire Gears comes with a passive and active effect that are both practical. Off-field, it accelerates Energy Regen. On-field, it can enhance the user’s Impact effect by up to 20% (for each EX Special Attack that they land).
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    S-Tier
   </strong>
   : Fusion Compiler is a top-tier W-Engine in that it comes with a base ATK boost that benefits all Anomaly Agents. It also feeds off Special Attack or EX Special Attack to accelerate Anomaly Proficiency, a critical stat for the Anomaly Specialty. Electro-Lip Gloss is another good choice thanks to its ATK and DMG buff against Attribute Anomaly-infected enemies.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    A-Tier
   </strong>
   : Rainforest Gourmet and Roaring Ride are the runner-up best W-Engines, as they both come with ATK buffs. Roaring Ride can also enhance Anomaly Proficiency and Buildup Ratio, which are essential in combat.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    B-Tier
   </strong>
   : Weeping Gemini is perfect for early-game Anomaly compositions, as it provides a reliable source for Anomaly Proficiency.

      <title>What The Involvement of Resident Evil 7's Director Could Mean For RE9</title>

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise has seen its fair share of talented developers come and go over the years. Naturally, some of the most fondly remembered
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  devs are those credited with directing some of the most beloved entries in franchise history, with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  director Shinji Mikami, and
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  director Hideki Kamiya both being legendary names in the gaming industry all these years later.

  There have been a total of eight mainline
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  releases since 1996, and over 20 spinoffs or remakes, and the vast majority of these projects have each been helmed by someone new. But in a rare turn of events, it's just been confirmed that
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  's director, Koshi Nakanishi, is returning to direct the next mainline installment of the franchise. Nakanishi actually has a few
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  titles under his belt, and they might give fans some clues about what they can expect from
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  .

  Koshi Nakanishi's Past Work on the Resident Evil Franchise
 </h3>
 <p>
  When it comes to
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  directors, few have been quite as prolific as Koshi Nakanishi. While most
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  directors helm one or two projects, Koshi Nakanishi has already directed a total of three
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games, with his fourth now officially confirmed to be in development. The first
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  game Koshi Nakanishi worked on was 2009's
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  , where he's credited as being one of the game's designers.

 <p>
  Just two years later, Koshi Nakanishi would be given the reins to his very own
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  title, this time being the 3DS-exclusive
  <em>
   Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   Resident Evil: The Mercenaries
  </em>
  <em>
   3D
  </em>
  wasn't a fully-fledged
  <em>
   RE
  </em>
  game, it was a pretty impressive 3DS game and a solid debut at the helm for Nakanishi. But just two years later, Nakanishi would get to flex his directing muscles, leading the charge on
  <em>
   Resident Evil: Revelations
  </em>
  , a critically acclaimed and often overshadowed entry that hearkened back to the series' roots during a time when the franchise was creeping further away from that with each new entry.

 <p>
  After proving himself with
  <em>
   Mercenaries 3D
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Revelations
  </em>
  , Koshi Nakanishi was given the reins to the next mainline entry in the franchise. After the dismal reception of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  , there was a lot of pressure on Nakanishi to get the franchise back on course, and
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  did just that, bringing the series back to its survival horror roots while still offering fans something new with its first-person perspective and terrifying new threat.

  How Resident Evil 9 Could Be Influenced by Koshi Nakanishi's Past Work
 </h3>
 <p>
  With three great
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  projects already under his belt, Koshi Nakanishi is more than qualified to helm the next mainline
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  entry. In his recent announcement, Nakanishi stated that he struggled to find a direction for the series after
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  , but he's now found it, and according to him, it "feels substantial." Though fans shouldn't read too much into this one quote, it does suggest that the series could be heading in a bold new direction, though some of Nakanishi's staples are likely to carry over regardless.

  One of the most common praises of both
  <em>
   Resident Evil: Revelations
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  was the games' excellent use of claustrophobic spaces, capturing the oppressive atmosphere of the original games and emphasizing the survival part of "survival horror." According to some recent rumors,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  could be going open-world, which would be antithetical to Nakashini's previous game structures, though fans can probably still expect
  <em>
   RE9
  </em>
  to embrace the series' roots just as Nakanishi's past games have.

  The Shorekeeper is a mysterious entity of energy in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Wuthering Waves
   </strong>
  </em>
  . She's not exactly human and only exists to assist the Black Shores in a time of crisis.

  The Guardian of the Black Shores exists because of the Rover, which is why her combat ability includes a special bonus exclusively for the main character. However, that doesn't mean that she isn't good for other Resonators. In fact, the Shorekeeper is an amazing healer and buffer, especially if players assign the correct

  <strong>
   Fallacy of No Return
  </strong>
  is an Echo released with the Shorekeeper in version 1.3. Upon activation, the Echo deals damage based on the user's HP, granting the user 10% Energy Regen and buffing the team's ATK by 10% for 20s. This equipment is perfect to increase Shorekeeper's supportive value, and if players ever need more damage from her, they can also hold the Echo Skill to deal a continuous Spectro DMG.

 <p>
  Another support-related Echo,
  <strong>
   Bell-Borne Geochelone
  </strong>
  , is also great for the Shorekeeper. Although it doesn't deal damage like Fallacy of No Return, it's still great for the protection and 10% DMG Bonus for the team.

 <p>
  Shorekeeper's Echo Set can be either
  <strong>
   Rejuvenating Glow
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Moonlit Clouds
  </strong>
  , although players will likely opt for Rejuvenating Glow and equip Moonlit Clouds on another Resonator. Rejuvenating Glow is great for enhancing Shorekeeper's healing and buffing the team's ATK by 15%. Meanwhile, Moonlit Clouds is great for increasing Shorekeeper's Energy Regen and the next Resonator's ATK by 22.5%.

  Since the Shorekeeper in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  scales her kit with HP, players would want either
  <strong>
   HP
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Healing Bonus
  </strong>
  on her 4-slot. However, she can also use
  <strong>
   Crit DMG
  </strong>
  to maximize her
  <strong>
   Discernment
  </strong>
  damage, which is always guaranteed to Crit. Next, place as much Energy Regen as possible on 3-slot until you get 250%. If you have more than 250% Energy Regen, then Shorekeeper can also use Spectro DMG. As for her 1-slot, focus on HP, as ATK isn't as useful for her.

 <p>
  The best weapons for the Shorekeeper in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  are those that include Energy Regen and HP stat. Equipment that boosts Energy or Concerto Energy is also great. For this, her signature weapon,
  <strong>
   Stellar Symphony
  </strong>
  , is the best option for Shorekeeper's weapon in
  <em>
   WuWa
  </em>
  .

  Afterward, players can opt for 4-star
  <strong>
   Comet Flare
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Variation
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   Rectifier#25
  </strong>
  . The 5-star
  <strong>
   Cosmic Ripples
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Rime-Draped Sprouts
  </strong>
  aren't fully suitable for the Shorekeeper, but are still viable if available. Finally, for new players, using
  <strong>
   Rectifier of Voyager
  </strong>
  is the best early-game option.

  Shorekeeper's skill level-up priority in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  depends on what players want from her. To maximize Shorekeeper's healing, you must upgrade her
  <strong>
   Resonance Liberation
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Resonance Skill
  </strong>
  , with occasional healing from
  <strong>
   Intro Skill
  </strong>
  . Shorekeeper's Discernment DMG also scales with Intro Skill, making it a good Forte to upgrade. If players don't really care about the healing, then they can level up everything except her Resonance Liberation.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty Zombies
   </strong>
  </em>
  is sometimes not a forgiving experience, and with almost 2 decades of the mode across Treyarch’s
  <em>
   Call of Duty

  titles, those who have jumped into it even once or more will be aware of a few mistakes that they have made that might have just cost them a game over.

  There are many mistakes that players new and old could make in
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  that serve as a nostalgic reminder of how far gamers have come, and hopefully, new players can avoid these mistakes to ensure that their highest round doesn’t end on the single digits.

  There’s nothing worse than trying to get some chores done in a game of Zombies by purchasing Perks, hitting the Mystery Box, or even completing easter egg steps, all while there’s a round of hectic zombies going on. To negate this, players can often slow a zombie down by turning them into a crawler with a grenade, but sometimes, things do not go as planned.

 <p>
  Whether players overcook the grenade or deal too much damage, the zombie can instantly die, or perhaps they accidentally had Widow’s Wine thus resulting in a hit from the zombie causing it to explode. Whatever the case, even the best players out there falter sometimes when trying to create a zombie to stop the round progressing.

  Acquiring a wonder weapon is an extremely satisfying task, whether that’s as a buildable or as a gift from the Mystery Box. Yet, one wonder weapon that will never leave the player’s side is the Ray Gun, a staple of the series that has been with fans since day one. However, despite the coolness and the power of the Ray Gun, there’s a catch.

 <p>
  The Ray Gun has explosive splash damage, meaning if players fire it too close to themselves then they too would take damage. Getting cornered by zombies and relying on the Ray Gun to kill them all is a bad idea, as the splash damage will kill the player without PhD Flopper, leading to a classic “
  <em>
   please revive me, bro, I have a Ray Gun
  </em>
  ” in co-op.

  Obtaining points to further enhance the capabilities of the player is everyone’s goal in
  <em>
   COD Zombies
  </em>
  , and as players round up the points and hope to spend them on delicious Perks and upgrades, they might be disappointed to know that they must first waste them all on doors and obstacles. Yet, there’s something even worse than that.

  Occasionally, there can be an important door in a map that if opened, will completely destroy the training spots of many. Whether it’s the door closest to the power switch in Kino Der Toten, or the sofa on the stairs in Nacht der Untoten, opening the wrong door is fatal for many and irreversible.

 <p>
  For the most part, players should know how to correctly stab zombies. They should know that zombies will hit them if they get too close, so it’s best to pull back on the left stick while clicking in R3 to stab them, which will instead go for a connecting slash rather than a deep plunge into their chest. This will both save players and prevent an unwanted power-up.

 <p>
  If players continue to lunge forward into zombies with each stab, it’s inevitable that a Nuke power-up will spawn and they will be unable to avoid it, thus ruining an early-round set-up due to the fact that they have exploded every zombie in the map for a measly 400 points that will stop progression for precious perks.

 <p>
  The Pack-a-Punch machine is essential to late-game rounds in
  <em>
   COD Zombies
  </em>
  due to its high damage output. Upgrading a weapon should be everyone’s priority, but Pack-a-Punch can often be found in rather tight spots that make using them in the middle of a chaotic round quite the problem, and often, players will trap themselves against the Pack-a-Punch machine, or worse.
 </p>

 <p>
  Sometimes, players who Pack-a-Punch their weapon might end up losing it due to the fact that they were unable to grab it before it’s sucked back into the machine. This loss of 5,000 points is enough to make any Zombies veteran cry, especially if it was a wonder weapon.

 <p>
  The modern era of
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  doesn’t count for this issue, but this is an utter classic that everyone should be aware of and has happened to them multiple times over the years. When a Max Ammo power-up spawns in, everyone can rejoice knowing their weapons are safe from being all out of juice, but the classic Max Ammo wouldn’t refill the magazine, only the reserves.

 <p>
  This meant that those who claimed the Max Ammo before players had reloaded would see them lose a valuable magazine, thus more bullets than they would want. Alternatively, picking up a Max Ammo while a teammate needs reviving will see them lose out on the Max Ammo, meaning they might just go down again.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    EA Sports FC
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise has developed into one of the greatest and most realistic sports games over the years. To add more authenticity to the game, the developers update and add new talents, celebrations, and movement mechanics every season. This year is no exception.

  There are a lot of attacking and defensive mechanics that players need to learn and master to be the best in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  . One such crucial movement mechanic every player must know to perform the ideal dribble and forward runs during an attack is the Control Sprint, which was newly added to the game last year. Here's everything you need to know about using it.

 <p>
  Players can move fast and quickly with Controlled Sprint, just as in the Normal Sprint, but they
  <strong>
   have far greater control over the ball
  </strong>
  . If done flawlessly, the controlled sprint can significantly impact dribbles, even though the speed and acceleration may not be as great as the other available option.

 <p>
  With this technique, players can move around and dribble with the ball near their feet while guarding it with their bodies. Improved agility from this mechanic can facilitate a smoother transition into forward or wide runs and make it easier to go past opponents.

 <p>
  Press and
  <strong>
   hold RB

  on an Xbox controller or
  <strong>
   R1
  </strong>
  on a PlayStation controller to perform the Controlled Sprint, and use your
  <strong>
   Left Stick to control the ball
  </strong>
  . Although your player may not always shield the ball during a controlled sprint, the likelihood of losing the ball is significantly reduced compared to the ordinary sprint in
  <em>

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   attackers
  </strong>
  <strong>
   ,
  </strong>
  who are primarily responsible for dribbling, are the players who stand to gain the most from Controlled Sprint. Along with sprinting, proper dribbling technique is crucial; a controlled sprint facilitates the task considerably. The faster and more agile the player, the more control they will have over the ball and their movement. Furthermore, in
  <em>
   FC 25
  </em>
  , players who possess the
  <strong>
   Speed Dribbler
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Fast Break
  </strong>
  PlayStyle can do phenomenal things with the ball in their possession by controlled sprinting.

 <p>
  The control your players will have over the ball while running is the primary difference between a Controlled Sprint and a Normal Sprint. You may have noticed that when a player uses the standard sprint, the ball seems to go farther away as it continues to move quickly forward. In a typical sprint, every step is a hard step, and the ball gets harder to manage. The likelihood of the defenders taking the ball also increases as you go through the sprint due to the less control provided by the normal sprint animation.

 <p>
  The Controlled Sprint feature fixes this issue, making it much simpler to change directions when sprinting with the ball. The ball will travel a shorter distance as you sprint, and if you simultaneously
  <strong>
   press LB/L1
  </strong>
  and move about holding the
  <strong>
   RB/R1 button
  </strong>
  , your player will be able to guard the ball better. A controlled run is far more effective when
  <strong>
   defenders are around you in confined spaces
  </strong>
  . When you dribble, this mechanic can let you get past multiple defenders simultaneously in combination with your player's agility.

 <p>
  That being said, this does not lessen the value of the standard sprint. If there's a gap in front of you or during a counterattack, your only option for sprinting should be a regular sprint. In these circumstances, sprinting at a controlled rate makes little sense, since it allows the opposition more time to catch up to you and make a tackle to capture the ball.

 <p>
  Having the ability to
  <strong>
   combine a controlled sprint with a regular sprint
  </strong>
  can be highly effective. It's recommended to dribble around defenders using a controlled sprint, then resume regular sprinting as soon as you see a space between them. To improve your understanding of which sprint to employ in any given scenario, keep your eyes open for gaps and repeatedly practice the combination.

  <strong>
   Horror games
  </strong>
  are able to elicit fear in a multitude of ways. Some horror games bring out a more "physical" kind of fear; adrenaline rushes, jump scares, that kind of thing. Other games are about a slower, more quiet sense of dread that gradually builds up. And then some are just really hard.
 </p>

 <p>
  No matter how frightening a horror game is, however, the player can usually take some comfort in the fact that whatever entities are running them down can't escape beyond the screen. It's easy for players to convince themselves that it's just a game, and nothing more. For gamers who don't think this goes far enough, however, there are some games that go the extra mile,
  <strong>
   breaking the fourth wall to confront the player directly.

   <strong>
    Inscryption
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a phenomenal card game that manages to be experimental while maintaining so many engaging, addictive gameplay loops. From the get-go, this game's uneasy, dreary atmosphere manages to make players feel unsettled, and that feeling never subsides throughout the game. This is an incredible deck builder that allows for a lot of experimentation and customization, and when players finally feel like they've gotten a handle on the game, it changes in a way that makes them rethink everything they thought they knew.

 <p>
  This game is immediately tongue-and-cheek with its meta references, such as the only opponent in the opening stretches of the game being the same old guy wearing a bunch of different masks, but as the story continues, proper fourth wall breaks become an integral part of the plot, as the developer himself starts sharing his unnerving experience making the game.

  This is an iconic title that doesn't let its simplistic graphics stop it from being utterly nerve-wracking. Quite the opposite. "White Face" has become a bit of an icon since this game's debut as a well-recognized and utterly frightening entity, establishing that same kind of cult veneration that something like Slenderman or any of the
  <em>
   FNAF
  </em>
  animatronics have achieved. With a minimalist story and minimalist graphics to follow suit, the ways that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Imscared
   </em>
  </strong>
  uses techniques to trick the player into thinking their computer is being manipulated is incredibly novel.

  Before he was challenging and frightening players with
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  , Daniel Mullins had put work into a different horror title based around a meta narrative and the breaking of the fourth wall.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pony Island
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a game within a game, a broken and janky arcade title that must be hacked in order to find the true game within, which is some sort of vessel for souls that the Devil has taken over; and he is trying to use to capture the player's soul next.

  This game acknowledges that it is, in fact, a game, and much of the player's efforts to win will involve "hacking" the software and changing the code to bypass the broken bits of the game that simply aren't navigable otherwise.

  </strong>
  made a phenomenal impact upon its release by being an incredibly subversive visual novel and, as much as one can in the age of the internet, keeping the secret of its true horrific nature pretty well under wraps for the first few months that players had their hands on it. There's an incredibly insidious nature to the fourth wall breaking here, where the somewhat generic main character slowly bleeds away over time and the 'love interests' come to see the player themselves as the focal point of their world.

 <p>
  This is a terrifying visual novel that doesn't shy away from issues of mental health, and the game only gets more frightening as the characters struggle to reconcile with their true nature as virtual entities.

  While some horror games will attempt to lure players in with cutesy art styles and graphics,

  , while remaining subversive and fourth-wall breaking, takes on no such pretense. This is a game that, in simplest terms, does not want to be played, and will do everything in its power to keep its secrets hidden away. A puzzle horror game,

  doesn't give the player too many tools to work with, but this makes experimentation and finding the right path very rewarding given the limited options available.

  The sound design is what really pulls this title together, from the unnerving sounds the game makes as it glitches and encounters "fatal errors" to the general droning ambiance, this game just

  alive. That makes it appear all the more hostile towards the player, as it uses settings and command screens to be as unpleasant as possible.

  In
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </strong>
  </em>
  there's plenty of hidden content and a lot of Secondary Quests to complete. However, players, especially those who want to follow the main quest line, do not always pay attention to everything they can do in the game. In some cases, this leads to missing opportunities such as Legendary Loot, Secret Cutscenes, and Lore which will never be found.

 <p>
  The following examples are side quests players should not skip
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  if they want to have all that precious loot and unlock a lot of secret content, including one of the special endings in the game.

 <p>
  Players will unlock this sub-quest as a follow-up after Taash's personal quest "In The Lair Of The Dragon King," and it will send Rook and their party to a meeting with the Spirit of Adventure. The spirit will tell the tale of a certain eager pirate who tried to loot a chest mid-combat and met his demise. Not before preparing a hoard of gold for whoever could find his lair.

 <p>
  So, it's basically that: a Treasure hunt, and fighting against undead pirates through the Rivaini Coasts. The best part? It's an easy quest that ends up with one of the best items in the game: Glorious Ultimatum. Equipping it turns the healing pots into Ultimate Pots, and using the Ultimate now heals players to maximum health. Players shouldn't miss this chance to get this Unique Item.

 <p>
  This quest starts way earlier during the first encounter with Taash. Rook and his party will be sent on a wild chase through the old Grey Warden ruins on the Rivain Coast, and when going through the fortress, they might stumble across several Lore Objects that trigger this quest. It will send players to investigate various signs left by the First Qunari Grey Warden: Grey.

 <p>
  After a while, the quest will come to a halt, but it will be re-triggered later when players unlock the Sharksmouth Mount area, after the "In The Lair Of The Dragon King" Companion Quest. Track down the remaining lore pieces, and this will also trigger another quest called The Warden Vault. Following up Warden Grey's Final Repose will reward players with exp, invaluable lore pieces, and Mementos that are needed to level up Caretaker's Workshop.

  The Warden Vault tasks the players with solving yet another Statue Puzzle, which consists of investigating a series of clues about ancient Grey Wardens from the Second Blight. The Vault Itself lies hidden in plain sight in one of the towers inside Sharksmouth Mount ruins.

 <p>
  The puzzle itself is easy to solve, but the solution is detailed in the images above. The important thing is the Reward at the end of the road, which is several treasure chests, Memento Items, Lore Items, and a Unique Weapon, which can be a Greatsword, a Stave, or a Bow. Players may even receive Meredith's Legacy (from
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2

  ) and the Arcane Stave, which causes Necrotic damage and has an overpowered Self-Heal perk.

  This Quest will be automatically available from the moment players unlock the Dock Town area as an explorable zone, and if they go to the Market, they will notice a quest marker nearby.

 <p>
  A Spirit of Compassion will appear before Rook and beg the team to investigate a series of murders occurring all across Dock Town. Simply follow the marker, search for the clues, and discover what's going on with the murder cases. Having Neve with the team helps a lot. After helping Compassion, this Spirit will leave with a warning. Something wicked is feeding on Dock Town's suffering. That means there's still a long way to go before completing a series of quests that will periodically appear in this area.

If players choose to help Dock Town instead of Treviso, they will be able to complete this quest. In case they don't, they will be blocked from the follow-up quest "A Hidden Hoard" quest, and the quest chain will break there.

  After investigating a series of disappearances in Dock Town, Rook will be able to clear a Darkspawn nest right beneath the Shadow Dragon base, which will lead to open a new area: The Catacombs. After defeating the Blighted monsters and destroying some Cysts, players will be able to explore further in and detect some mysterious traces of demonic influence.

  Shortly after completing the "Cornered In The Catacombs" quest, Rook notices a strange billboard while browsing through the Dock Town Market that speaks about a Treasure Hunt. Following the clues, the players will soon discover it was all a trap, and some mercenaries will ambush them in the Catacomb area.

  Killing them will unlock the Vault containing a "smelly" Hidden Hoard, some Mementos, a Random Treasure, and most importantly, a Lore Object that finally triggers the "Desperate In Dock Town" quest. The demonic influence in Dock Town has been a problem ever since the war with the Gods started, and now Rook finally has a lead to its origins. This quest needs to be completed to unlock the next step in the Dock Town series.

  Following up on "A Hidden Hoard," players will be able to reach the final section of the Dock Town Catacombs, which will lead to the final confrontation with the Desperation Demon, the one who has been moving the threads behind the curtains, and has been feeding on the suffering of the people.

This will lead to a mysterious voice beckoning from the depths of the Vault, the place where the Venatori were trying to access. And then, the "Pinnacle Of Its Kind" quest will pop up, and now players have an important task ahead.

  The "Pinnacle Of Its Kind" quest consists of getting rid of three demons that hold the seal for the Vault's door, one located in Dock Town, another in Hossberg Wetlands, and the final one hidden in Arlathan Forest. Once they break this three-part seal, they will be able to access the Vault and face The Formless One, which is also required for the Bringing The Sky Down Achievement/Trophy.

 <p>
  This quest is important because it also grants a lot of Faction strength with both the Mourn Watch and the Lords of Fortune, and the players will also miss the chance for some Unique Weapons (depending on their class) and lots of Treasure chests, Mementos, and other loot.

  If players follow all the Devrim's companion quests until the end, they will also notice a series of follow-up quests with Antoine and Evka, the only Grey Wardens who were willing to help Rook from the start. Returning the kindness and helping them deal with the corruption spreading through Hossber Wetlands will not only unlock new areas to explore but also grant access to Chests that were locked behind Blight Corruption.

 <p>
  The series of quests will start with "Something Wicked" and will end with "Something’s Coming," where Rook will have to defeat a huge mutated Blight Cyst who seems to have gained sentience. Blasting away the ugly amalgam of corruption will give Rook the chance to help Antoine and Evka retire and live happily ever after away from the fight against Darkspawn. But, there is more. If the players choose the "Gyiphons Return to the Wardens" option at the end of Devrim's quest chain, Antoine will become the new Gryphon master of the order, and players will be able to witness one of the funniest scenes in the entire game.

  The Crossroads is a place that players need to explore fully if they want to understand Solas and also unlock the best possible ending. But to do so, they will need to open up a series of Corrupted Doors protected by Champion Essences, which are obtained throughout the adventure by destroying Blight Cysts and defeating the Darkspawn Champions.

  There are several doors to open, but the most important ones are those that lead to the Pillars of Corruption.

Following up after Defeating the Three Pillars, players will be able to face the Revenant Dragon, which is also required for the Bringing The Sky Down Achievement/Trophy, and also earning some juicy rewards.

      <title>The Case For and Against Rerun Banners in Wuthering Waves</title>

  Since its debut in May,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  has continued to leave a mark on the open-world gacha genre. Not only has
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  generated impressive revenue, but it also won the Best Audio/Visual Accomplishment Award at the Mobile Game Awards, along with an honorable mention for Game of the Year. With Version 2 on the horizon, excitement remains high for the game's narrative and characters.

  Despite its success,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  is facing some criticism, with players divided on whether rerun banners benefit the game’s long-term health. Kuro Games initially launched the ARPG with 18 playable Resonators, and the roster has only grown since then. As of version 1.3, the lineup has expanded to 24 characters, with two new characters set to debut in update 1.4 alongside two rerun characters, fueling the ongoing debate.

  The first rerun banner in
  <em>
   Wuthering Wave
  </em>
  s version 1.3 featured Jiyan as the spotlighted 5-star Resonator, along with the 4-star character Youhu. Previously, Jiyan debuted in the Prevail the Lasting Night event, which ran from May 23 to June 13. Afterward, it was announced that Yinlin and Xiangli Yao would return in version 1.4 as part of phase two. While the reappearance of 4-star characters in banners is typical, the recurrence of 5-star Resonators is now becoming more common.

  Some players have voiced concerns about the time between
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  updates, arguing that the wait for a new 5-star character is too long, especially if the second phase is reserved for mostly rerun banners. They claim this reduces the "FOMO" feeling, as it seems players won't have to wait long for a rerun of a character they liked. Additionally, there is a case to be made that frequent reruns could limit the introduction of fresh content and result in a more stagnant experience for the player base.

 <p>
  Given that each
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  patch typically lasts around 37 to 46 days, it can feel like a long wait without someone to get excited about. While the developers could shift focus towards creating more replayable content, companion stories, and fresh events in the meantime, it's understandable that players who either already have a rerun character or chose not to pull for them previously might not want to see them return. Overall, this can lead to frustration for players seeking new and unique content, though the wait between versions may ultimately benefit the quality of the work produced by Kuro Games.

 <p>
  Conversely, some players see rerun banners as a way for newcomers to obtain Resonators they may have missed, while also giving others another chance to pull a character they couldn’t get before. This is often due to limited Convene materials. For free-to-play players, gathering the necessary Astrite or Tides can take a considerable amount of time, and knowing which temporary banners are coming in advance allows players to plan and save their materials for the characters they want. While it doesn’t guarantee a Resonator,

 <p>
  Kuro Games' open-world title has been praised for being friendly to free-to-play players, even over the long term. As a result, continuing to introduce rerun banners would likely satisfy this portion of the community, as "FOMO" is often used in games to encourage spending, something that isn't always feasible for everyone. Furthermore, others have compared
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and other HoYoverse titles, arguing that in the early stages, these games featured an overabundance of characters who rarely get time in the spotlight due to their mass production. With new 4-star characters continuing to be released alongside a 5-star rerun banner, supporters of rerun banners argue that there is enough to keep players satisfied while waiting for
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  ' next major update.

      <title>PS3 Has Secret Controller Trick That Fans Are Just Now Discovering</title>

      It was recently discovered that the particles in the XMB interface react to physical movements with the PS3's controller in real-time.

  A PlayStation fan recently discovered that physically moving the
  <strong>
   PS3
  </strong>
  controller can affect the console's home menu in a fun way. The PS3 is nearly 20 years old at this point, yet it somehow continues to be a source of cool Easter eggs for the devout PlayStation enthusiasts who still use the console in 2024.

 <p>
  Although the PS5's slick and minimalist user interface is well-regarded by a lot of PlayStation fans, many argue that its roots lie in the PS3's iconic XMB menu. An abbreviation of Xross (pronounced "Cross") Media Bar, the XMB name may be a bit of an odd choice on Sony's part, but its sheer usability is something PS3 fans swear by to this day. All the functions of the console, and their related sub-functions, are neatly laid out in columns that span horizontally across the PS3's interface, making for a simple and effortless user experience.

  Despite many PS3 users loving its operating system, Sony unfortunately abandoned the XMB during the PS Vita's development, and the PS4 and PS5 followed suit. While the XMB is relegated solely to the PS3, the 18-year-old interface has a lot of hidden design flourishes that fans continue to discover, even up until a week ago. A recent tweet from PlayStation aficionado realradec shows the user waving the PS3's DualShock 3 controller in front of their TV, and the particles in the XMB's background moving in the direction of the controller.

  Directionally controllable particles may not be a particularly helpful UI feature, but they do show how much attention to detail Sony packed into the XMB. Moreover, it's a nifty showcase of the PS3's Sixaxis gyro controls interacting in real-time with the PS3's UI. Considering the PS5's DualSense controller is compatible with the PS3 and supports gyro controls as well, it should be interesting to see if it could also control the XMB particles similarly.

  It's a shame that the PS3's XMB interface may not ever return, and one can only hope that Sony uses it as a key source of inspiration while designing operating systems for future PlayStation consoles. Interestingly, the XMB still outclasses the PS5's operating system in one big way: support for custom themes. Despite receiving a plethora of firmware updates since launch, the PS5 still lacks support for custom system-level themes. At this point in the PS5's lifecycle, it's unclear if Sony even plans to release themes for the console, but until it does, the PS3's XMB remains superior in this one very specific regard.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </strong>
  </em>
  closes many story threads that were set up as early as
  <em>
   Dragon Age Origins
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is the conclusion of Solas' story, and is likely the last time he makes an appearance in the series. While
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  concluded without any cliffhangers for many players, some players who found all three Mysterious Circles scattered across Northern Thedas were given a secret post-credits ending.

 <p>
  The secret post-credits ending documents key moments from each
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game, including Loghain's betrayal at Ostagar, Bartrand and the red lyrium idol in Kirkwall, and the Breach in the Veil from
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  . The character speaking notes that, with the elven gods out of the picture, their opportunity to become more active in Thedas has arrived. With the Executor's history stretching back to Arlathan, it's likely that Solas' legacy as the Dread Wolf will continue to be alluded to in future
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  stories, with very real consequences for the group and those involved in stopping them.

  The mysterious voice in the
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  post-credits scene is an Executor, and the post-credits cutscene essentially documents the Executors' manipulation of events during the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  . The Executors were introduced in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  , with the war table mission Investigate the Strange Chalk Markings, where the same marking in chalk appeared at every Inquisition outpost. If investigated, agents familiar with the markings speak of "those across the sea." The Executors claim to merely be observers but, in the
  <em>
   Tevinter Nights
  </em>
  story "Dread Wolf Take You," an Executor is present at the tea house meeting, where Solas warns Charter of their danger.

  While the codex writer discounts the Forgotten Ones, it does note that the Mysterious Circles are at least as old as Elvhenan. The Executor in the post-credits scene also alludes to the Dread Wolf and the elven gods as deterrents to getting directly involved in events in Thedas. While Solas may not be directly involved in any future
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  games, his role as the Dread Wolf and actions in Thedas will likely be alluded to moving forward if the Executors become the next major conflict in
  <em>

  .

  Bethesda games are known for their popularity with modders, and
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  isn't any different. In the 13 years since its release, Bethesda's modding community has created an innumerable amount of mods for
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . Their contents have brought the likes of graphic overhauls, new weapon types, a Thomas the Tank Engine-themed reskin of dragons, and more to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . These have all helped to renew interest in the game over a decade after many players' first playthroughs. For anyone looking for a new narrative experience from
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , modders have that covered too. Most recently, the team at High Tale Creations released a new DLC-sized mod that pits the Dovahkiin against an entire island of supernatural foes.

  Exploring the Blighted Marsh
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Coven of Crones
  </em>
  adds an entirely new map region to
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  called the Blighted Marsh. Hidden within the Sea of Ghosts, the Blighted Marsh was once an island inhabited by druids until it was taken over and corrupted by Anise's hags. The dark, twisted island is inhabited by many monsters and features multiple dungeons where a brave enough adventurer can find weapons and spells exclusive to this mod. High Tale Creations uses sound design, weather effects, and custom lighting to make the Blighted Marsh an immersive environment comparable to those in official Bethesda expansions. While the Blighted Marsh is smaller than the map featured in the recent
  <em>
   Fallout: London
  </em>
  mod, it is roughly the same size as Solstheim from
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Dragonborn
  </em>
  expansion.

  How to Play Coven of Crones
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Coven of Crones
  </em>
  is currently on PC and is one of the many
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  mods available on Xbox. There is no word on whether Bethesda and High Tale Creations plan to bring the mod to PlayStation in the future. The latest version of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  is required to download Coven of Crones, and High Tale Creations recommends starting a new game to avoid potential complications with existing files.

  can be accessed through Bethesda's Creation Club, which allows players to directly download approved mods in games like
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  . Unlike certain mods,
  <em>
   Coven of Crones
  </em>
  does come with a price tag. Players wanting to explore the Blighted Marsh will need to spend 500 Creation Club credits, which costs $4.99. While many fans are upset with Bethesda's continuing monetization of mods within its games,
  <em>
   Coven of Crones
  </em>
  ' verified status in the Creaton Club means that High Tale Creations will receive royalties from purchases of this mod.

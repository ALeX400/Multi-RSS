  <em>
   <strong>
    Splatoon 3'
   </strong>
  </em>
  s repeat chocolate Splatfest has come to an end and crowned its winner, with White Chocolate declared the winning team once more. However, it's not the only trend that the
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  Splatfest win has continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  is still running events like Splatfests, and will hold the Eggstra Work mode of Salmon Run in the future, but the game's major content updates have come to a close. As a result,
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  has been revisiting past Splatfests, either from the current game or its predecessors. The Chocolate Splatfest was originally held in 2023, and this year's version made no changes to the teams or who led them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  's Chocolate Splatfest has declared White Chocolate the winner, not only repeating the results of the 2023 Chocolate Splatfest, but also continuing the trend of Big Man wins. The game made significant overhauls to the Splatfest tallying system with the
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  7.0 update. Previously, only the team that earned first place in categories like Votes or Tricolor Battles would earn points, but now the second-place team also earns some points. This change and the efforts of players meant that rather than a full sweep of all categories, White Chocolate only won four of the five possible categories, with Shiver's Dark Chocolate team bringing home the Pro Battles category, and Frye's Milk Chocolate team managing to get second place in popularity.

 <h2 id="big-man-continues-winning-streak">
  Big Man Continues Winning Streak
 </h2>
 <p>
  Part of the reason for the
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  adjustments was due to an excessive number of sweeps from certain teams. For example, prior to the 7.0
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  update, from April to September 2023, Shiver enjoyed a five win streak. However, Big Man is now on a three win streak, and has won the most standard Splatfests overall. Some players are frustrated to see that the team is not only continuing to win, but that the current incarnation of the Chocolate Splatfest played out the same way as before.

 <p>
  Many have argued that
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  having three Splatfest teams instead of the two that its predecessors implemented has led to some unfair matches. Looking at the results, it's easy to see why, as Big Man has enjoyed 10 wins and Shiver has 9, but Frye's team has brought home the win just three times since the game's launch back in 2022. Many players hope to see something change to make a more even playing field for the teams in
  <em>
   Splatoon 4
  </em>
  , though at this point, there's no way of predicting what direction the developers will take the series in.

  There are a lot of great action RPGs from Japanese developers out there for fans to enjoy.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is a recent hit, part of the Soulslike genre from the very makers that helped create the genre, FromSoftware. Then there's
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  which is getting a second chance at life thanks to its PC port.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of these examples are great, but it brings to mind that there haven't been as many
  <strong>
   top-down JRPGs
  </strong>
  recently. Most are from the golden era of the 90s and maybe the early 2000s. With that in mind, let's look back and rank some of the
  <strong>
   standout top-down action JRPG
  </strong>
  hits that fans may or may not remember.

  is probably a game most have not heard of. It was released in Japan exclusively on the PS1, but thankfully, there’s not much dialogue to prevent importers from checking it out. Players assume the role of a magical witch girl who embarks on a top-down adventure with a heavy emphasis on combat over puzzles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Monsters aren’t the average lot, as they include, for example, talking watermelons to smash. Players will gain EXP through monster bashing and there’s an equipment system too. It’s not a revolutionary action RPG, but it still holds up thanks to the visuals and easy gameplay setup.

  is a lost hidden gem from Squaresoft’s publishing contributions to the SNES. The character sprites are large and more detailed than most action RPGs of the time. It’s also rather linear, but that just means it’s a quicker game to get through nowadays.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players begin as a young adventurer with a sword and shield who is aided in most dungeons by companions ranging from other warriors to mages. It has the feel of a more Japanese-centric
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  campaign mixed with
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  . While it was never released officially in the West, there is an English fan patch out there for those interested in checking out this forgotten SNES game.

  There have been a million and one
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  games and quite a few have been RPGs.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a top-down action game for the GBA set during the Cell Saga arc. Players would control multiple characters as the game progressed linearly through the story. Trunks and Gohan are two examples, but there were some side exploration opportunities too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players could fly around the world map, similar to how airships work in older
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games. The combat wasn’t as intense as a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  fighting game, but
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku 2
  </em>
  managed to create some lasting memories for players who enjoyed it back in 2003.

  was ahead of its time on the NES. Players may have looked at the back of the box and scoffed at it for being just another
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  clone at the time, but those who played it know there was much more to it. Players could roam around an open world and go into dungeons to solve light puzzles, mostly framed around the elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players would gain elemental blades that could perform tasks like fire melting ice or ice creating a bridge over water. It’s nothing new for modern games, but again, this was the NES generation. Made by SNK, the game was ported to the Game Boy Color, but there was never a sequel.

  </strong>
  is a forgotten
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  clone that was exclusive to the PS1. The titular Alundra is gifted with the ability to dive into dreams, which is both a gameplay and story mechanic. Players will get an assortment of weapons, from swords to flails, along with sub-weapons like bombs as they explore. They will also solve puzzles, which is a particular emphasis in the dungeons.
 </p>
 <p>
  What Alundra has above a hero like Link from
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  is the ability to jump.
  <em>
   Alundra
  </em>
  was a bit underappreciated back in the day because it wasn’t pushing graphical limits, which made it look like a SNES game. Decades later, RPG fans can better appreciate it and its unique ideas.

   <strong>
    Lunar Knights
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the fourth and final entry in the
  <em>
   Boktai
  </em>
  series, which began on the GBA. This entry eliminated the need for the cartridge solar panel, although players could still use an old cartridge on their DS to absorb the sun if they wanted. Gimmicks aside, players assumed the role of two vampire hunters: Aaron and Lucian.
 </p>
 <p>
  They shared an item pool, but leveled up separately, and could be swapped out mid-battle. Aaron used guns, from pistols to flamethrowers, while Lucian was melee-focused and had weapons like a sword and a scythe. Even though this Konami series never made a huge splash,
  <em>
   Lunar Knights
  </em>
  is easily the best RPG in the franchise, and hopefully, one day more people can enjoy it without the need for emulation.

  is one of the best RPGs on the SNES, action or otherwise, but it sadly only went to European regions when leaving Japan. That at least meant players could enjoy it in English without having to resort to fan patches or emulation. It was an Enix-published game set in a dark world where players could traverse dungeons and level up through the expected means.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the most unique things about it was the cylindrical world map that made it look like players were exploring the ring worlds from Halo. Those who have never played it before should rectify that error, as 2025 is the 30th anniversary of the original Japanese release.

  <em>
   Secret of Mana
  </em>
  is probably the most well-known entry in the
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  series. It was released for the SNES and gathered critical acclaim. There was a sequel,
  <em>
   Seiken Densetsu 3
  </em>
  , which was and improvement but was never released outside of Japan. That is, until the
  <em>
   Collection of Mana
  </em>
  was released for the Switch in 2019 in North America.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Seiken Densetsu 3
  </em>
  was retitled
  <em>
   Trials of Mana,
  </em>
  and it gave players multiple characters to follow right from the start. This player choice added to the replay value that
  <em>
   Secret of Mana
  </em>
  lacked. Both games are great top-down action RPGs, but if players had to choose one, it should be
  <em>
   Trials of Mana
  </em>
  . The character choice, combat improvements, music, and pixel-perfect art easily make it a must-play.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise is one of the most commercially lucrative video game series of all time. Almost two decades since its first release, each game has taken place in different settings throughout history, with the overarching narrative of the war between the Assassins and the Templars. The games have a focus on action, exploration, and adventure, with a switch of focus to an action RPG series in 2017's
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Origins
  </em>
  , set in Egypt and exploring the Origins of the Assassin's order.
 </p>
 <p>
  The franchise shows no signs of slowing down, with
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  releasing in 2025, set in feudal Japan with a dual protagonist system. The game has garnered hype but has been hampered by delays, being pushed back from its initial release date in 2024. With many more moments in history for the franchise to explore, what are seven big moments in history the
  <em>
   Assassin's
  </em>
  <em>
   Creed

  franchise hasn't explored yet?

  Two
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games have been set in England so far, with
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Syndicate
  </em>
  being set in London in 1868, and
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Valhalla
  </em>
  taking place in the British Isles in 873CE. This leaves scope to explore another huge point in English history, the War of the Roses.
 </p>
 <p>
  This series of civil wars took place between the houses of York and Lancaster over the course of three decades, both vying for control of the English throne. Over the course of the war, fans could see plots that involve political intrigue, and epic battles and eventually lead into the reign of Henry VIII, who has been described as a Templar affiliate in past entries in the series. This makes the War of the Roses a potentially great setting for an
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game.

  The
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  franchise had visited India previously with
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India
  </em>
  during the Anglo-Sikh Wars, around the same time a rebellion was taking place against the British East India Company. With India in the 19th century having multiple wars and rebellions against British rule, this would be a perfect setting for a full-length
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the Assassin's Order already being present in the time period, a game revolving around the uprising of the Indian people against British rule could provide a great setting for the next entry in the franchise. An
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game set in the 19th century would also provide excellent options for parkour as well as narrative, making it one of the biggest moments in history not yet fully explored.

  The Spanish Inquisition became the setting for the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  movie, released in 2016, and still has plenty of potential for a mainline
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game. The Spanish Inquisition was set up by the Catholic Church to punish heresy against their religion which led to countless deaths across Spain, Portugal, and other Spanish colonies.
 </p>
 <p>
  As this has already been explored in the movie but never in the mainline games, there are huge open areas to be explored, with a dark story to explore. This makes the Spanish Inquisition a great setting for the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  franchise to explore.

  The

  franchise briefly visited China during the Imperial era in

  . However, a game set during the Anglo-Chinese wars in the 19th century could provide an incredible backdrop for an entry into the franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Anglo-Chinese wars began as a trade dispute that escalated into an all-out naval war, with narcotics being smuggled into China in an attempt to derail the economy. A story set in this tumultuous period of history offers a place for the Assassins to fight for good against the Templar order looking to take control. This makes the Anglo-Chinese War an interesting moment in history not yet explored in the

  One area of history that has been untouched by the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  franchise is the Aztec Empire. The Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire took place from 1519 to 1521, resulting in the fall of the Aztec Empire.
 </p>
 <p>
  This area of history is ripe for exploration, with the potential of having the protagonist of the game either fighting for the Aztec Empire or against them as a Spanish Conquistador or an indigenous ally of the Spanish. This would allow for an exploration of South America that has yet to feature in an
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game. This makes the Spanish Conquest of the Aztecs the biggest moment yet to be explored by the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed

  It could be said that
  <strong>
   open-world games
  </strong>
  encapsulate gaming's best attributes and push them to their logical extremes — they offer fully fleshed-out alternate realities for the player to explore as they wish, generally affording them unprecedented levels of agency and freedom in determining their path through it. An open-world game has the potential to, almost literally, become a second life for the player to disappear into.

  So it should come as no surprise that some of the gaming industry's most prolific titles manifest as open-world games. As luck would have it, a generous number of titles are at players' fingertips if they happen to have an active Xbox Game Pass subscription. But which world should someone dive into next? What are the
  <strong>
   best open-world games on Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated on February 9, 2025 by Mark Sammut:
   </strong>
   The end of January 2025 saw the release of a pretty great action-adventure game that has relatively big regions, even if it is not quite an open-world. That project has been added to the open-area section. Furthermore, Atlas Fallen has been added as a recommendation.

     A game's quality is not the only deciding factor in its ranking. For instance, if a major open-world game has just been added to Game Pass, it will be listed at the top initially.

  For a while,
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  seemed destined to never come out, and the fact that it is readily available nowadays on Game Pass serves as a testament to GSC's dedication and perseverance. Putting aside any question of quality for the moment,
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  's existence should be celebrated. Thankfully, the open-world game is also pretty darn great, as long as subscribers know what they are getting into. The franchise has earned a reputation for delivering challenging titles that emphasize survival and vulnerability. The 2024 entry is probably the most accessible yet, and it is still very difficult and capable of overwhelming newcomers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set within The Zone,
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  drops players into a cutthroat hellscape defined by desperation, greed, and relentless survival. There are mutants, magic artifacts, and plenty of weapons, even if ammo can be scarce. The world is massive, far surpassing anything else in the series, and frequently stunning, a consequence of utilizing Unreal Engine 5. Survival games are not that rare, but
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  is a unique breed that is rich in atmosphere and world-building. The gameplay complements the tone well through things like a radiation system and item management. Even if someone has never played a
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
  </em>
  game before, they should give the latest release a try. That said, they should prepare themselves for the occasional bug.

  No game encourages freedom and exploration the way that
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  does. As soon as players spawn into the world, there are no boundaries restricting what they do next. Building a mansion in the forest, mining to the depths of the world, or crafting the most intricate roller coaster are all options on the table.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though there are no quests sprinkled throughout the world of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , the ability to do anything so chosen is the game’s main appeal.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  is the ultimate sandbox project, and players are only limited by their imagination. Mojang's masterpiece has been an inescapable part of the gaming industry for so long that a recommendation is unnecessary by this point. Anyone remotely familiar with gaming is aware of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , and they almost certainly know if the project is for them or not. In terms of
  <strong>
   open-world Game Pass games
  </strong>
  , almost no other project comes close to matching
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's importance.

   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim

  has long been a definitive staple of the open-world catalog, and it’s likely to remain that way until the next chapter of the mainline
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  saga manifests. Even today, players still wander the snowy tundra, lush forests, and decrepit dungeons of
  <em>
   Skyrim

  in droves, which is no mean feat considering the base game was released in 2011.
 </p>
 <p>
  If for some reason someone is yet to embark on the epic tale of the Dragonborn, now’s as good a time as any. And if they already have, then they can pick from an extensive selection of mods that are available for Xbox consoles and fabricate a new twist on a familiar adventure.

  Coming out of nowhere and instantly establishing itself as one of
  <strong>
   Game Pass's best open-world games
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is almost unbelievably good, especially considering it is still in Game Preview. Pocket Pair aimed for the stars by delivering a project that, on paper, appears to spread itself too thin to offer any real depth in one field; however, somehow, the 2024 game comes together to create a surprisingly cohesive experience. Now, this is still an early access release that is a work in progress, so anyone who jumps in should expect to encounter a few bugs and issues along the way.
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  runs pretty well for this type of release, but it is still a ways off from completion, so expectations should be kept realistic. That said, the current version has more than content to justify a recommendation on its own, all with the knowledge that the future should come with a stream of new updates.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  ? Well, that question is somewhat difficult to answer. Before its debut, it was described as "
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  with guns," a reductive statement that holds some truth but hardly paints a full picture. Set in a fairly impressive open-world,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  is – first and foremost – a survival exploration game. Players will need to set up a base, manage their food, and craft items to increase productivity and protect themselves from the elements. That is all well and good, but the novelty comes from the introduction of Pals. Players can catch a wide assortment of monsters who fit different types. Along with helping out in battles, Pals are also crucial for exploration and base-building. They even need to be taken care of since they also get hungry.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  casts a wide net that allows it to cater to various audiences. People yearning to catch them all will find an engaging monster-collection game with well-designed creatures with genuine purpose. Survival fans will find a fairly accessible experience that offers depth and challenge through its combat and team management. Meanwhile, players who wish to explore a fresh-feeling realm will find a lot to love in
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  's open-world. While not the biggest or the most beautiful setting in the genre, Palpagos Islands is a fun sandbox to explore.

  Blizzard's latest games seem to reliably attract controversy. While garnering a positive reception at launch,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's reputation turned sour incredibly quickly, with the goodwill not even surviving until the launch of the first season. Nowadays, the action RPG feels like a bit of an afterthought that is struggling to attract attention beyond its core playerbase, which can be quite volatile. Consequently,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's Xbox Game Pass debut was not as exciting of an event as it arguably should have been, despite the game being comfortably one of the biggest names added to the service in 2024.
 </p>
 <p>
  With all the negativity, one would be forgiven for forgetting that
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is still a decent isometric hack and slash game. Sure, the endgame could be significantly better, and some of the post-launch updates did more harm than good. However, the campaign is generally solid, offering nearly 30 hours of entertainment. Obviously,
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  has never been about the main story, but that does not mean players cannot treat the 2023 entry as a single-player experience with a definitive ending.
 </p>
 <p>
  Prior to its release,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  marketed its open-world heavily since it was a first for the series. Sanctuary is large, diverse enough, and filled with replayable content thanks to the procedurally generated dungeons. It is not amazing, but there are not all that many open-world hack and slash projects.

  Not every person who owns an Xbox Series X/S will gravitate toward
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator
  </em>
  , but there are undoubtedly people who specifically purchased the console to play this flight sim. After spending a year as a PC exclusive, Asobo Studio's project finally made its way to Microsoft's latest hardware, and even a couple of years after its launch, the 2021 release is still among the console's most impressive technical showcases. As its title suggests, the game seeks to accurately recreate the experience of piloting a plane, at least to the point that gaming allows. While somewhat realistic,
  <em>
   Flight Simulator
  </em>
  is relatively accessible by the subgenre's standards, so newcomers who have never sat down in a virtual cockpit can rely on a detailed tutorial to teach them the basics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generally,
  <em>
   Flight Simulator
  </em>
  's gameplay is structured around flight plans, which are linear by design. However, players are given free rein in how they approach routes since they can plan their own flights through the World Map mode. Essentially, Earth is
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator
  </em>
  's open-world, and while players might not be able to land and go for a stroll, they can witness the planet's majesty from the skies.

  Debuting in 2011,
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  's staying power is beyond proven by this point. Re-Logic's action-adventure title pushes exploration to the forefront, presenting players with all the freedom in the world to traverse its impressive procedurally generated sandbox map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blending combat, survival, and crafting elements,
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  is rich and diverse, and the game comes with an incredibly passionate fanbase. Besides the standard version of the campaign,
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  comes with plenty of other modes that alter its difficulty, leading to wildly different adventures.

  After a lengthy spell in early access,
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  has finally made its full debut. A "normal" backyard becomes a dangerous sandbox filled with terrifying creatures after players are shrunk down so that a blade of grass towers over them. Finding themselves in a sticky situation as they try to make their way back home, the protagonists must survive this strange land as they adapt to its ecosystem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  is an imaginative open-world game that takes inspiration from its contemporaries while still carving out a unique voice that sets it apart from the crowd. Obsidian is responsible for some of the most fully realized worlds in gaming, and
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  is another feather in the developer's cap.

  Rare's
  <em>

  had a somewhat rough launch, but the game has improved by leaps and bounds since its debut. Although not devoid of enjoyment for solo players, this title should be experienced alongside a group of mates since so much of
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  depends on the crew making its own fun.
 </p>
 <p>
  As
  <strong>
   pirates in a vast and gorgeous open-world
  </strong>
  , adventure is constantly at their beck and call as crews seek to complete trade missions, find buried treasure, and survive against a Kraken or a ghost ship. Rare regularly releases updates for
  <em>

  that introduce new ways to interact with the sandbox and other players who exist within it.

  Xbox Game Pass sure loves some
  <em>
   Yakuza.
  </em>
  Subscribers can play through the entire main saga, starting with
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  and ending with
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  . That amounts to eight lengthy campaigns that feature consistently fantastic storytelling, lovable or unforgettable characters, enjoyable minigames, and small but dense open-worlds. Technically,
  <em>
   Kiwami
  </em>
  counts as the first title since it is a remake of the original PS2 game, but newcomers should just start with
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  . Not only is it a prequel that takes place prior to every other entry, but it is also arguably the franchise's peak, which is saying something.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set within two Japanese cities, both of which are lively and overflowing with personality,
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  follows Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima's early days in the Tojo Clan. Both protagonists are wildly different from each other, and their stories start fairly isolated but eventually come together. Along with the central narrative, which is nothing short of brilliant, the game is filled with side stories that range from hilarious to heartbreaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  , players should press forward with
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  , which tells the next chapter in Kiryu's story. Admittedly, this entry is not among the franchise's strongest efforts, but it is still pretty good.
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami 2
  </em>
  is far better too. Conversely, players can jump into
  <em>
   Yakuza: Like a Dragon
  </em>
  , which marked a new era in the series. While not completely disconnected from the past, this title features a new protagonist, battle system, and setting.
 </p>

    <p>
     <em>
      Like a Dragon: Ishin
     </em>
     is another Xbox Game Pass option worth considering. The spin-off throws familiar faces into Japan's Edo period, providing a historical lesson with a
     <em>
      Yakuza
     </em>
     twist.

  Originally a PlayStation console exclusive,
  <em>
   Tchia
  </em>
  eventually made its way to the Xbox ecosystem and subscription service, making it a great and fairly novel addition to Game Pass' open-world lineup. While incorporating various ingredients standard for the genre, Awaceb's project has two things that set it apart from the crowd: a beautiful tropical environment based on New Caledonia and an inspired central mechanic that opens up a world of interactive possibility. The former is a visual treat for the eyes that is overflowing with gorgeous locals and vistas. Tropical settings are hardly "new" territory for open-world games, but
  <em>
   Tchia
  </em>
  's influences help give it a unique edge.
 </p>
 <p>
  More importantly, the gameplay revolves heavily around soul jumping, a concept that allows Tchia, the endearing protagonist, to take over the bodies of wildlife and inanimate entities.
  <em>
   Tchia
  </em>
  has an impressive list of animals that are viable for soul jumps, ranging from land-locked beasts like cows to underwater creatures such as mackerel and airborne alternatives like doves. Along with just being fun to mess around with, these creatures combine to create a flexible and rewarding movement system. This mechanic also extends to combat, which generally involves taking over fire-based options. While fairly simplistic, the combat is quite enjoyable and offers a nice change of pace, especially since it is only a part of the puzzle and not the main focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if it might not be an all-time
  <strong>
   excellent open-world game
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Tchia
  </em>
  is charming and creative. The game blends impressive visuals with a decent story, an awesome setting, and great core mechanics.

  Rocksteady's
  <em>
   Batman Arkham

  trilogy set the benchmark for superhero games, and many would argue it is still the standard-bearer. As
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   City
  </em>
  are, unfortunately, not on Game Pass, newcomers might want to search beyond Mircosoft's subscription service to start with the first game (and
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Origins
  </em>
  is also quite good). However,
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  is available on the platform and, unsurprisingly, fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bringing to life Gotham City instead of just its prison,
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  has an atmospheric open-world that is still impressive all these years later. Rocksteady did a stunning job of capturing the spirit of the DC Comics through its storytelling, environmental design, and combat. While
  <em>
   Arkham Knight
  </em>
  's batmobile sections are divisive, the vehicle itself controls well, even if it might overstay its welcome.

  While barely qualifying as an open-world,
  <em>
   South Park: The Fractured but Whole
  </em>
  warrants a mention. Ubisoft's sequel to
  <em>
   The Stick of Truth
  </em>
  tends to be more divisive, particularly in its humor and storytelling; however, it is still a pretty good turn-based RPG that does a fantastic job of recreating the animated show's aesthetic, tone, and setting. Dropped into a superhero civil war, the New Kid will find themselves donning an alter ego, battling farts, and listening to tragic backstories narrated by Cartman.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the map takes a while to open completely,
  <em>
   The Fractured but Whole
  </em>
  does let players roam freely in due time, and they can mostly go where they want once the main story is finished. Even if it might not have the same magic as the first game due to being mostly a repeat, South Park is still a blast to explore, assuming someone is a die-hard fan of the source material. The world's size is pretty conservative as well, so it is not overwhelming to travel across.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   South Park: The Fractured but Whole
  </em>
  is not an all-time great open-world game, and it might not hold much value to non-fans. Still, there is a lot to enjoy here, including a solid combat system, great visuals, and the occasional funny gag.

  OK, these two games are special cases since they are technically not fully open-world, although they drop players into decently sized areas that should be completed in order. That said, both
  <em>
   Expeditions
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   SnowRunner
  </em>
  are divided into maps/regions that can be mostly explored freely, and the former includes a free-roam mode that is unlocked once a certain number of expeditions are complete. So, despite their structures, both titles are capable of scratching that open-world itch, as long as somebody is also craving slow-paced games about overcoming environmental obstacles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Saber Interactive's franchise is an acquired taste. Although they have plenty of differences,
  <em>
   SnowRunner
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Expeditions
  </em>
  ' routine is largely the same. Players will be slowly guiding massive vehicles across bumpy and challenging terrain, trying to plot a safe and stable course that preserves their cargo (
  <em>
   SnowRunner
  </em>
  ) or facilitates exploration (
  <em>
   Expeditions
  </em>
  ). They will gradually unlock new trucks that are better suited for certain trips, and they have to manage things like fuel to ensure they have enough for a full trip. Both games are pretty difficult and time-consuming, and they can be frustrating at times. However, if their routines strike a chord with somebody, they can also be life-consuming.

  Including its early access period,
  <em>
   Starbound
  </em>
  has been around for more than a decade, and its popularity has persisted throughout all that time. Up until 2024, the game could only be played on PC; however, nowadays, an Xbox One is available, which can be played on the Series X/S as well.

  A proper 2D sandbox that prioritizes player freedom,
  <em>
   Starbound
  </em>
  uses procedural generation to create a universe that seems to have endless potential. While there is a story to follow that is worth checking out in at least a single playthrough, the game's brilliance lies in the possibilities it presents to players. Putting aside the plot, the concept is pretty simple: Explore, gather, and craft. After their planet is invaded and taken over, players must find another world to call home, and they are free to expand their base as they see fit. The latter involves visiting other planets, which come with an impressive variety of ecosystems. Combat is a relatively big part of exploration too, similar to something like
  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point,
  <em>
   Starbound
  </em>
  is a well-established name in the indie scene, but the game's long-term PC exclusivity means it could still be a fresh experience for console-only players.

  An argument could be made that
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  is a non-linear RPG rather than a traditional open-world, but the first game shares enough with the latter to warrant a mention. And, the sequel is even more open and free-flowing than its predecessor, making it even more worthy of an unabashed recommendation. Acquire's JRPG is a throwback to the good old '90s, offering gorgeous 2D-HD visuals, turn-based combat, and an epic fantasy setting that makes good use of an overworld. Similar to
  <em>
   Live a Live
  </em>
  , this franchise focuses on telling individual stories for each of its playable characters, and they are fairly disconnected from each other. Players are encouraged to explore the map freely and decide which order they want to tackle the questlines, although some are power-gated.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  does a better job than its predecessor of linking the characters through a main quest and their general banter. Unlike the first game, the heroes come across like a party in the sequel, rather than just people who happen to be fighting enemies together. As fun as this project is,
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  is mainly for people fond of old-school JRPGs rather than die-hard open-world fans.

  Xbox Game Pass has three
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  games:
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  . Each title is an ambitious open-world game packed to the brim with content, both mandatory and optional. There is not all that much separating the games in terms of quality, and someone's preference might come down to whether they prefer
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  ' Ancient Egypt,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  's Ancient Greece, or
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  's Viking setting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although it can be quite polarizing compared to
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  fine-tunes some of its predecessor's mechanics, particularly the combat system. Visually, the game arguably represents the franchise's peak, especially since its setting allows for a wider berth of diverse locations than
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  . Out of all three titles,
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  is the most immersive, and it even tells a pretty good story by the franchise's standards. All three titles are extremely long, but
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  does not threaten to overstay its welcome to the same extent as
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  is the first chronological entry, newcomers to the series should start with that title; however, the franchise's releases can be enjoyed as standalone adventures, so
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  is still an option.

  When it was first released back in 2016,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  was lambasted for its lack of gameplay and unpolished design. Many fans were upset that the release seemed to lack many of the initial promises that were made by the developer, Hello Games. Thankfully, even though it was critically panned during its initial release, designers stuck with the title and continued to improve it as much as possible in the following years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nowadays,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  is leaps and bounds better than what it once was. Players are finally getting the space epic they'd hoped for, and feelings toward
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  are incredibly positive in recent years. Players that are looking for a fun, in-depth, and downright addictive open-world should hop into this now fantastic adventure.

  As the first Spotlight Cache release of the Brave New World season in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel SNAP
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Joaquin Torres Falcon introduces a unique Ongoing ability that duplicates the effects of one-Cost On Reveal cards. This has drawn comparisons to Wong, with some calling him the bounce archetype’s equivalent. But does he truly live up to that reputation?
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  This guide presents a deck that doesn’t fully commit to his bounce synergy. Instead, it blends an On Reveal strategy with bounce as a secondary element rather than the deck’s core focus. Here’s how to build the best deck for
  <em>
   Marvel SNAP
  </em>
  ’s Joaquin Torres Falcon.

  Joaquin Torres Deck Synergies
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Use Kate Bishop to generate one-Cost cards.
  </li>
  <li>
   Play Kate’s summons, along with Hawkeye, Nico Minoru, or Rocket Raccoon, in Joaquin Torres’s lane to double their effects.
  </li>
  <li>
   Have Beast collect your one-Cost cards and turn them into free plays—then replay them into Joaquin Torres’s location.
  </li>
  <li>
   If Beast isn’t an option, use Black Swan instead. Activate her ability before playing your one-Cost cards to remove their Cost.
  </li>
  <li>
   Let Caiera protect your one-Cost cards.
  </li>
  <li>
   Drop Marvel Boy for passive buffs.
  </li>
  <li>
   Play Hit-Monkey in the final rounds when you have multiple zero-Cost cards for a major power boost.
  </li>
  <li>
   Rely on Gorr and Cull Obsidian as your primary win conditions.
  </li>
 </ul>

  How to Play Joaquin Torres Effectively
 </h2>
 <p>
  Here are some key tips to maximize Joaquin Torres’s potential:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Don’t rush him out.
   </strong>
   Think of Falcon 2 as an Onslaught for your one-Cost cards. If you want to surprise your opponent, consider saving him for turn five or six instead of playing him on curve.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Protect your scaling cards.
   </strong>
   Joaquin Torres decks tend to flood the board with vulnerable units, so include tech cards to safeguard them. Armor and Caiera are excellent choices.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Look beyond the bounce archetype.
   </strong>
   While most players lean into bounce decks, you can explore his Ongoing synergies instead. For example, try him in a Thanos deck to take advantage of the numerous On Reveal one-Cost cards he summons.
  </li>
 </ol>

  Enchantress is the most direct counter to Joaquin Torres, shutting down his ability and disrupting the opponent’s strategy. Rogue is another solid option, as she can steal his effect—especially since Joaquin Torres is often the only Ongoing card in his deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other effective counters include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Cosmo
   </strong>
   blocks On Reveal effects in Joaquin Torres’s lane, limiting his impact.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Killmonger
   </strong>
   wipes out his one-Cost allies, crippling his synergy.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Mobius
   </strong>
   is an indirect counter, but he disrupts Cost-reduction strategies, which are crucial for Joaquin Torres's decks.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Joaquin Torres’s biggest drawback is his limited synergies in the current meta. There aren’t many one-Cost On Reveal cards that truly maximize his ability, making it harder to build around him effectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  That said, if you enjoy low-Cost decks—especially those that build up on one-Cost plays—he’s worth investing in. Joaquin Torres can help you generate surprisingly high power using just your early drops, often catching opponents off guard.

      <title>Animal Crossing's LEGO Crossover Should Inspire Another Pitch Perfect Collaboration</title>

  The success and popularity of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Animal Crossing
   </strong>
  </em>
  have allowed it to form an interesting collaboration with LEGO. With the toy company basing sets on iconic characters and structures from Nintendo's franchise,
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  has broadened its merch opportunities. Since the
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  LEGOs are proving to be a hit, perhaps the gaming franchise should consider collaborating with another popular toy company. Out of the many candidates, there is one that could see the same amount or even more success as the LEGO collaboration, while also opening up in-game-related opportunities.

  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  and toy sets make for a combination that sells and is highly appreciated by fans, which tells Nintendo that it should consider collaborating with another company known for manufacturing collectibles/playthings. If there is one that comes to mind, it's Funko. The American company is highly regarded for its Funko Pops, figurines that resemble iconic characters from popular franchises such as Marvel, Sanrio, Dreamworks, and so on. To this day, Funko and
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  have yet to work together, despite how well they complement each other and the benefits they can bring to one another. But if it were to happen, the output from the two working together could become a huge success.

  If there's one
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  collaboration that could be an even bigger hit than the one involving LEGO, it has to be with Funko. Aside from being able to generate cute figurines of popular characters from the franchise, here are a few other reasons why working with the company is beneficial:

   It helps lesser-known

  <li>
   The art style of the
   <em>

   characters complements the design of the Funko Pops, making it easy to develop figurines that are both cute and marketable to the public

   The number of villager types from
   <em>
    Animal Crossing: New Horizons

  Nintendo should consider working with Funko, as it shows that both companies stand to gain a lot from an
  <em>

  collaboration. Should that happen, it could even lead to another area of opportunity, further promoting both the game franchise and the figure-making company.

  How the Funko Collaboration Could Lead to In-Game Content for Animal Crossing
 </h3>
 <p>
  If there's one thing about the next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  that seems likely, it's having more in-game items to obtain. Were Nintendo to push through collaborating with Funko, instead of only creating real-life figurines of the franchise's characters, perhaps those figurines could make their way into the game. Funko Pops are made to be collected and adored, and the gameplay of
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  involves acquiring items and decorating one's space with them however one pleases. This means that turning those figurines into in-game collectibles would actually be a sensible and beneficial thing to do, as it allows for a lot of content for the next mainline entry and a way for the franchise to promote Funko. Pushing through such an opportunity also helps solidify the cooperation between the companies, potentially ensuring even more collaborations in the future.

  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  shouldn't pass up on the golden opportunity of collaborating with Funko, as there are too many benefits from doing so. Whether it's in the form of in-game or real-life content, there are a lot of ways for both brands to expand their reach by working together, ensuring that there are new fans for Nintendo's franchise and the figurines of the American company.

  It’s not surprising that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  would feature a Zombies mode brimming with easter eggs and secrets just waiting for fans to pick apart as the undead would to a fresh body. Part of the charm with
  <em>
   COD Zombies
  </em>
  will always be the secrets, and
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  continues that trend by bringing forth a secret vault that has a unique combination to allow players vast rewards from within.

  The bank vault is located on West Main Street inside Liberty Falls' Savings &amp; Loans bank. In order to open the bank vault in Liberty Falls, players must find three sticky notes that will all have 2 numbers on them. There are
  <strong>
   3 codes to find
  </strong>
  , and each of them must be set into the bank vault in a specific order, so here’s exactly how to find every vault code:

  Now that players have memorized all 6 total numbers, it’s time to head back to the bank, where in the back room with the vault they will be able to interact with the door to input the numbers with the up and down arrows on their keyboard or D-Pad. In solo, zombies will avoid players completely while they are entering the code, so don’t worry about getting swarmed when on this screen.

  Once the code has been entered, select X/A/F (PS5/Xbox/PC) for the vault door to unlock. To actually get inside the vault, players will need to interact with the slightly ajar door, where they will be teleported into a square room filled with safe deposit boxes. Inside, players are completely safe from zombies and will have about a minute to utilize the vault before being kicked out, where there will be a short cooldown before they can re-enter.

 <p>
  Inside the vault itself, players can gather some unique rewards by opening the safe boxes inside with any Loot Keys that they acquire. For those wondering how to get Loot Keys, they can be obtained by defeating Abominations and Manglers or by completing S.A.M.’s challenges, so try to watch for floor loot among the zombie carnage that unfolds.

  Inside the safe boxes, players might get lucky and obtain new weapons, ammunition, Essence, Scorestreaks, or even Perk-a-Colas.

  Argonaut Games has confirmed the platforms for the remaster of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Croc: Legend of Gobbos
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The remastered version of the popular PlayStation 1 game will be skipping one major platform, however, which may be bad news for some
  <em>
   Croc: Legend of the Gobbos
  </em>
  fans.

 <p>
  <em>
   Croc: Legend of the Gobbos
  </em>
  was originally released for PS1 in 1997, later receiving ports for Sega Saturn and PC. In the game, a cute baby crocodile called Croc ventured to save his Gobbo friends from Baron Dante, a villain who kidnapped all of them. The platformer was a big hit, spawning a sequel and a Game Boy Color spin-off. In 2023, it was revealed that a
  <em>
   Croc
  </em>
  would be making a comeback with a remaster, and now Argonaut Games has confirmed the platforms where it’ll be available.

 <p>
  The remastered version of
  <em>
   Croc
  </em>
  will be available for consoles on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The title will also be released for PC, but only on GOG, skipping Steam. This seems like a pretty big omission, considering that Steam is by far the largest PC gaming platform, and the
  <em>
   Croc: Legend of the Gobbos
  </em>
  remaster would be losing a chunk of its audience by not being available there. At the moment, the game does not have an official release date and is only slated to be coming out “soon.”

  In any case, the release of this remaster is good news for fans of old-school PlayStation 1 platformers. Together with other popular franchises such as

  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Gex
  </em>
  , and
  <em>

  <em>
   Croc

  was one of the most noteworthy 3D platformers of Sony’s first console, and it’s going to be available with improved graphics soon. In the game’s trailer, it’s possible to see these new graphics in action as Croc explores platforming areas and faces bosses, and the enhanced visuals look very smooth. The remaster will also have modern analog controls with an enhanced camera, and new visual effects.

  While it’s impossible to say how much of a hit the upcoming

  sold over 10 million units, for example. The same can be said about the
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy

  <em>
   Croc: Legend of the Gobbos
  </em>
  ’ remaster will be a high-quality recreation of the game, have amazing fans, and achieve similar success.

  The recent
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  data leak has unearthed plenty of unused assets and details, including a cut Mega Evolution for Generation 1’s infamous Jynx. In August 2024, The Pokemon Company and longtime
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  developer Game Freak fell victim to a series of massive data breaches that have exposed many unproduced games, scrapped lore, and a multitude of unused Pokemon designs spanning several decades. It is being called the biggest
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  -related leak ever, and new things are still being discovered several months later.

 <p>
  Some of the ultimately unused Pokemon revealed in this massive “Teraleak” include an alternate Water starter that fans have named "Warabbit," which would have replaced Mudkip as one of the starter Pokemon options in
  <em>
   Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire
  </em>
  . There were also beta versions of Shroomish and Breloom, a pair of Grass types that were also introduced in
  <em>
   Ruby and Sapphire
  </em>
  . These and many other scrapped Pokemon names and designs have inspired fans to draw their own versions of what they might have looked like if they made it into an official
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game.

 <p>
  Yet another cut Pokemon has been revealed from the already world-shattering “Teraleak,” this time as an unused Mega Evolution for a creature that was introduced in the original
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  . Concept art for a “Mega Jynx” was recently shared on Twitter by CentroLeaks_alt (as reported by Kotaku), detailing an alternate form that would have debuted in
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  . Mega Jynx retains the humanoid design of its standard form, with longer blonde hair and a shimmering blue and white dress. According to notes shared by CentroLeaks_alt, Mega Jynx would have kept the original’s Ice/Psychic typing.

 <p>
  Jynx is one of the most infamous Pokemon in the
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  lineup, thanks to its controversial original design. Said design was accused of resembling negative stereotypes of Black people, a controversy that led to a holiday-themed
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  episode never airing in the US. Game Freak addressed the issue by changing Jynx’s black skin to purple starting in
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  , the same entry that introduced its earlier form of Smoochum.

 <p>
  Some
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans had already designed a hypothetical Mega Evolution for Jynx, unaware that it almost received an official one when the mechanic was introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  . Mega Evolutions are set to return in next year’s
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , so perhaps Jynx may get a powerful new form similar to the one revealed in the recent
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak in the near future.

  Controversy is brewing within the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  community following the game's 4.1 update, with some players calling on developers to retire an exclusive in-game item. The item, a helmet given out to those who complete
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's co-op PvE Operations mode in Lethal difficulty, was brutally hard to get, but the game's latest update has taken a considerable bite out of this difficulty, prompting some to feel cheated out of their original accomplishment.

  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  has effectively dominated much of the conversion within the video game community following its release in September, transporting fans back into the grim world of the
  <em>
   Warhammer 40k
  </em>
  universe. Underneath its violent and flashy combat,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  tells a story steeped in the rich lore of
  <em>
   Warhammer 40K
  </em>
  . Alongside its campaign mode,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  also features a multiplayer PvP mode as well as a co-op PvE mode, with the latter finding itself at the center of debate online.

  Controversy has been stirring since
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's 4.0 update, which saw significant changes to the game's Operations mode. Included in the update was a new Survivor's Helm, which is tied directly to
  <em>
   Space Marine 2'
  </em>
  s new Lethal difficulty setting. However, following complaints,
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's new difficulty has been scaled back, and with it, the requirements needed to unlock the Survivor's Helm. This backtracking has caused players who acquired the Survivor's Helm under the original requirements to feel a little cheated, resulting in gatekeeping posts popping up on the game's official Reddit page.

  The post above garnered over a thousand upvotes and over 500 comments. Some players shared their frustrations with
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's new helmet, calling on Saber Interactive to retire the reward altogether now that it has become more accessible. Others pushed back against this idea, asking, "who cares" if some players get the helmet easier than others. Most users urge others to still feel proud of acquiring the new Survivor's Helm, regardless of difficulty. The general sentiment from the community appears to be positive and that it doesn't really matter how players unlock the helmet, as there is no way to know if they did it before or after the update.

  This controversy can all be traced back to last week's
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  update, which introduced players to a challenging new Lethal difficulty setting. This new difficulty significantly upped the time and amount of skill required to complete
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  's Operations mode but included special new rewards as a way for players to relish in their accomplishments. Update 4.1 was a direct response to the difficulty of this update, removing the controversial Tight Formation system requirement, which forced players to stick together during matches.

  has already seen extensive amounts of post-launch support, with a content roadmap laying out everything players can expect over the coming months.

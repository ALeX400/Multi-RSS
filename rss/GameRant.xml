      <title>After the Canceled Avatar: The Last Airbender Fighting Game, One Project Shoulders an Even Heavier Weight</title>

  In February of this year, Maximum Entertainment revealed that it was working on a fighting game set in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Avatar: The Last Airbender
   </strong>
  </em>
  universe. The game, which was initially planned to launch in early access next year, has been officially canceled, dashing the hopes of both
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  and fighting game fans.

  It's a bit bizarre that there has yet to be a big-budget, well-received video game adaptation of
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender
  </em>
  . Aside from the fact that it's one of the most beloved TV shows of all time,
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  would be a great fit for a video game, especially since its lore dictates a cyclical, large-scale narrative. In other words, any adaptation of the source material would be given a lot of breathing room to tell its own original story, not hogtied to the plot elements of either
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Legend of Korra
  </em>
  . Then there's the bending-related lore itself, which obviously has a lot of exciting potential for gameplay systems, in a variety of different genres. All of this is to say that it's a crying shame that no ambitious
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  game exists in the world of modern gaming, and that needs to change soon.

 <p>
  A fighting game based on the world of

  </em>
  is rich with promise. Franchises like
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Demon Slayer
  </em>
  have demonstrated what's possible when TV or comic series with broad casts of characters come together in a fighting game, and
  <em>

  could have joined them in this space. Characters from both
  <em>

  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Legend of Korra
  </em>
  could have been fully realized in the interactive medium, with intriguing and fleshed-out mechanics designed around their canon abilities and personalities.

 <p>
  But there's no use lamenting the past; Maximum Entertainment's fighting game may have been great, but it's back on the shelf, for the time being. More crucial is that controlling parties, such as Paramount (who owns the
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  rights), not get bearish about future projects based on this IP. Indeed, previous
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  games have been oddly restrained, with projects like 2023's
  <em>
   Avatar: The Last Airbender - Quest for Balance
  </em>
  being remarkably low-budget and unambitious. Saber Interactive has referred to its
  <em>
   Avatar
  </em>
  game as "the biggest video game in franchise history," and with that much confidence, it needs to deliver.

 <p>
  Saber's
  <em>
   ATLA
  </em>
  game has been described as a AAA RPG—a prospect that should no doubt be exciting for fans of the franchise. But AAA RPGs aren't exactly easy to make, not only because of their inherent narrative and mechanical complexity, but because of the expectations heaved upon them by gaming audiences. For better or worse, gamers are going to want
  <em>

  's first big, modern video game to be firing on all cylinders, with industry-leading gameplay, writing, production value, and so on.

 <p>
  These expectations and standards existed before news of the
  <em>
   ATLA

  fighting game being canceled, but they may be exacerbated now. At least with another
  <em>

  game on the market, even if it's in a completely different and more niche genre, Saber's title wouldn't have to be saddled with the weight of solely representing the IP in gaming. Now, it is.

  This situation is strangely reminiscent of the leadup to
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  's launch. For years, audiences had been asking for an ambitious and polished game set within the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  universe—it just seemed like a no-brainer. Thus, there was a lot riding on
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  to bring the franchise into the rapidly-developing medium of gaming. And if the sales of that game are anything to go off, then it certainly met its goals. Hopefully, the same will be able to be said about this
  <em>

  </em>
  RPG.

 <p>
  Death is a common yet primal fear shared by almost every human being. People ultimately fear the end and everything that comes with it, so naturally, horror games have taken to playing on this fear throughout the genre's existence. While almost every horror game (and most games for that matter) typically features death in some fashion, it’s never more than the slight inconvenience of pressing restart and losing a little bit of progress.

 <p>
  The truly great horror games will find new ways to prey on a player’s fear of death. This could be through a well-crafted and scary story or by some clever implementation of mechanics.

  Like any good Lovecraftian game,
  <em>

  has a bestiary of tough, creepy enemies, from werewolves to spiders to unexplainable abominations that like to eat or curse unfortunate hunters.

  If this wasn't enough, players will also have to contend with the core mechanic of a Souls-like game; losing all your blood echoes (serving as both experience points and currency) upon death. Naturally, these are retrievable as long as the player collects them before their next death, however, the enemy that killed the player may have picked them up. This can create a tense situation where the player may have to confront the very enemy that killed them to get their precious blood echoes back.

  While not overtly horror,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Death Stranding
   </em>
  </strong>
  has many staples of the genre, such as wondering about a creepy, barren landscape and dealing with supernatural enemies in the form of BTs, souls of the deceased who are stranded and will try and kill protagonist Sam. The player must use Sam’s Bridge Baby to detect the BTs to sneak past them, lest they be dragged into a dark inky abyss, losing their precious cargo and creating a voidout, a large explosion that persists in the world after the player dies this way.

  Sam is a repatriate, meaning he can come back from death, forcing players to live with the results of their mistakes instead of reloading a checkpoint. While the story is the expected amount of craziness expected from Hideo Kojima, it also has quiet moments where the story makes the player reflect on death, not just in the context of loved ones but the context of the entire human race as a 6th extinction event threatens to wipe out humanity.

  While its sequel has a lot of similar elements, the original

    Darkest Dungeon

  </em>
  is a lot more brutal with death. Much like a campaign in
  <em>

  To make any progress in

  In terms of facing death, there’s not much closer to it than fighting literal ghosts.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fatal Frame
   </strong>
  </em>
  has the player traversing through a Japanese mansion, encountering supernatural scares and solving puzzles, all while dealing with vengeful spirits who can only be fought by taking their picture with the Camera Obscura, requiring the players to get up close to the ghosts. Much like how other survival horror games have their own ammo types,
  <em>
   Fatal Frame
  </em>
  uses different types of camera film that function similarly.

  Mortis -- the Latin word for death. This is the world that appears when John Thomas Ward, the protagonist of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Faith: The Unholy Trinity
   </em>
  </strong>
  , dies. It’s a constant reminder for players about how vulnerable their protagonist is, especially because it only takes one hit to kill the player.

 <p>
  As a result, they will have to be on their A-game, playing through each boss perfectly by learning all the attack patterns. There’s even an achievement for beating the game’s marathon mode (all 3 chapters back to back in one sitting) without dying once. This is all wrapped in a compelling story about the loss of faith and regret about not saving someone from a fate worse than death.

  From the creators of the Amnesia franchise,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Soma
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a sci-fi horror game set in an underwater facility in the far future. The game explores death interestingly and philosophically, focusing on transhumanism, consciousness, and whether preserving life by any means necessary is truly worth doing.

  These aspects of

 <p>
  There aren't many games as unrelentingly punishing as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fear &amp; Hunger 2: Termina
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a unique cross between the survival horror and JRPG genres (with a hint of a roguelike). Not only is the combat brutally difficult, requiring careful strategy to beat enemies much stronger than the player, but every single encounter is potentially deadly, and some enemies have insta-kill attacks that require the player to correctly call a coin toss to defend against them.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Even saving is a luxury and comes with its own risk of being attacked, and it advances time, ticking down the clock on the player's precious three-day time limit. This limited saving means that a player can lose a lot of progress upon death, however, it’s this friction that makes
  <em>
   Fear &amp; Hunger 2
  </em>
  so compelling. Death is also a big factor in the story, where fourteen people are mysteriously thrust into a battle royale where only one can leave alive.

  Whether it’s the remake or the original, one of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill 2
   </em>
   ’
  </strong>
  s most prevalent themes is death, specifically the death of a loved one and the regret of not doing all you could for them. The game sees the protagonist, James Sunderland, journey to the titular town after receiving a letter from his wife Mary, something that should be impossible as she died three years prior.

 <p>
  What follows is a dive into the psychology of James, as the town reflects his inner guilt through its environments and iconic monsters such as Pyramid Head. Players will peel back the layers of intrigue in the town, such as the mystery of why Maria looks a lot like Mary and why Laura can seemingly go about the town unharmed.
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  is not so much about the traditional fear of death expected from the genre but more about the emotional fear of losing someone and leaving so much unsaid and undone.

  The game's currently well-optimized, except for the Texture Pool Size setting, which heavily impacts FPS (not sure if that's intended). The game will get further optimized with post-launch performance patches, so you can expect to raise a few settings after that happens.

      <title>Marvel's Wolverine Needs to Come Out Swinging with Its Gameplay Reveal</title>

 <p>
  Except for the information unveiled as part of last year's devastating Insomniac Games leak, very little is known about the highly anticipated
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel's Wolverine
   </em>
  </strong>
  . It's hard to determine the extent of the leak's damage to the project and Insomniac's broader marketing plans, but it very well could have pushed back an official gameplay reveal, and such a delay may now be ratcheting up expectations from gaming audiences.

 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  is something of an interesting prospect. On the one hand, no one should be surprised by AAA studios pushing forward with superhero adaptations, as these IP have built-in fanbases and brand recognition that simply can't be matched by brand-new fictional worlds. At the same time, though,
  <em>
   Wolverine
  </em>
  is coming from Insomniac Games, and is set in the same universe as its
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  franchise. Regardless of how one feels about the
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  games, it can't be denied that
  <em>
   Wolverine
  </em>
  presents a markedly different narrative tone and gameplay premise, so it will be intriguing to see how Insomniac handles this pivot. This facet of
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  , alongside others, is why it needs to wow audiences upon its official unveiling.

     One of the biggest question marks surrounding
     <em>
      Marvel's Wolverine

     is how Insomniac will handle its mature tone, as the studio's previous games have been notably PG.

  There Has Been a Drought of Information Since Marvel's Wolverine Was First Announced
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  was officially revealed during a 2021 PlayStation showcase via a brief cinematic that seems to show the aftermath of a battle between Wolverine and a group of thugs, ending with him gearing up for another bout. There is no gameplay featured, nor is any story information unveiled, but the reveal was nevertheless effective as a means of establishing the darker, more violent tone of the upcoming game. Moreover, it served to confirm the game's existence.

 <p>
  But that was almost four years ago, and there's been nary a peep from Insomniac nor Sony since. Speculation has run rampant about the game, especially in the wake of the very early gameplay footage revealed during the 2023 leaks, but there's been little real substance to analyze or get excited about. While it may not have been as egregious as something like the
  <em>
   Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  logo reveal, which felt like generating hype for the sake of hype with little to back it up, the 2021
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  teaser needs some follow-through, especially as it gets further in the rearview.

  What the Next Marvel's Wolverine Reveal Ought To Include
 </h3>
 <p>
  With nearly four years passing since the game's reveal, the next
  <em>
   Wolverine
  </em>
  trailer needs to be substantive. Some cinematics would be fine, and even welcome, as they could shed light on the game's narrative, but gameplay should be the main focus.
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  is expected to be more visceral, brutal, and violent than
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  , with a greater focus on combat than traversal, so a good glimpse into what its gameplay will entail will be essential for setting expectations, and perhaps even easing certain concerns from those unconfident in Insomniac's ability to pivot from the
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  games.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  It's not exactly fair, but many gamers have been judging
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  based on the in-development gameplay footage uncovered during last year's leaks. Naturally, this footage is incredibly rudimentary, painting an unpolished picture of the game, but this is to be expected given its stage of development. The footage wasn't meant to be seen by the public, after all. Nevertheless, this rougher-looking
  <em>
   Wolverine
  </em>
  is what has defined the game's legacy thus far, so a stunning, slick, and well-presented trailer could wash away these previous negative connotations, regardless of how reasonable they may or may not be.

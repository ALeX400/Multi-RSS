  <strong>
   <em>
    Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be the debut game from River End Games, a developer boasting a mere seventeen team members. Not one to be held back by its resources or conservative talent pool, River End Games is shooting high with
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  's gameplay and visuals, looking to create a deep, cinematic, and engaging game that doesn't pull any punches.

  's creative director, Anders Hejdenberg, recently walked Game Rant through a few early sections of the game, highlighting its puzzle-like stealth and mystery-thriller narrative premise while granting new insights into its development process, as well as sharing what players can expect once it's actually in their hands. Presentation, character dynamics, and variety-driven game design were all introduced as important themes of
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  , and the footage Hejdenberg showed suggests that these ideas will flourish in the final product.

 <p>
  The first thing that stands out about
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  is its incredible cutscene direction. Of course, the game looks great, leveraging Unreal's MetaHumans tools for impeccable character models and animation, but getting a nice, extended look at certain in-game cinematics revealed a few other important directional pillars. Hejdenberg kicked off the presentation by showing a scene between Hannah, the game's protagonist, and a pair of city guards searching for her brother, and it's through this scene that many strengths become immediately apparent.
 </p>
 <p>
  High-quality character models can only go so far toward making a game's cutscenes work, and River End Games seems to have a strong grasp on this notion, as this scene between Hannah and the guards demonstrates
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  's strong voice acting, cinematography, and direction, highlighting its attention to detail. The speaking guard is shot at a low angle, effectively conveying his intimidating stature, both physically and socially, and Hannah's street-smart, slightly petulant attitude does a lot to establish her as a bright character who thinks on her feet. When she resists the guard's faux-polite demands, and he rests his hand casually on his baton, her eyes fall on it and her facial expression changes ever-so-slightly: an example of
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  's nuanced visual storytelling.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same can be said about another scene wherein Hanna enlists the help of Alva, a character with whom she has a complicated history. Special praise should be paid to the writing here, as lines from Alva like "Oh, it's always about you Hanna," efficiently and deftly communicate these characters' shared past without feeling ham-fisted or revealing too much. Once again, scene direction shines in this exchange, with the conversation flowing in an engaging, clear, and effective manner, the emotion and gravity of the situation conveyed with nuance and maturity. It's clear that River End Games' developers are students of cinema.

  Eriksholm's Storytelling Extends Beyond the Pre-Rendered Cutscenes
 </h3>
 <p>
  Hejdenberg told Game Rant that
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  has about "25 to 30 minutes" of pre-rendered cutscenes, like the ones referenced above, but the rest of the game is doing some heavy narrative lifting as well. The character of the game's titular city is typified through environment design and NPC interactions: a guard may harass non-combat NPCs for a cigarette, showing the force's manipulation of power, or the industrialized, impoverished status of a neighborhood may be expressed through its unmaintained buildings. It's not an approach that's necessarily groundbreaking, but once again,
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  shines through attention to detail.

     Little to no visual fidelity seems to be lost outside

     's pre-rendered cutscenes: the explorable in-game areas are well-realized and attractive, with true-to-life lighting and plausible level design that lend them a significant allure.

  Eriksholm Rewards Real-Time Stealth and Forethought in Equal Measure
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  is an isometric game, offering players a birds-eye view of any given playable scene. This appears to have a major impact on how stealth gameplay is presented, and how the player can engage with each setpiece. Although
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  's gameplay hinges on many of the same principles as other stealth games, with factors like visibility and sound being used for one's advantage or detriment, the top-down perspective grants each encounter a puzzle-like quality because of how players can view the battlefield. The locations of enemies, environmental hazards, vantage points, and the like, are not obfuscated by a third-or first-person perspective. They're all visible, and it's up to the player to decide if, when, and how to engage with them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each stealth encounter thus assumes this puzzle-box identity, blending genres together in a manner that promises to be both satisfying and constantly changing. One such satisfying variable that Hejdenberg touched on is the character-swapping system. All three playable characters, Hanna, Alva, and Sebastian, have unique abilities that impact how a player can engage with enemy NPCs:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Hanna can shoot sleeping darts.
  </li>
  <li>
   Alva can scale certain walls.
  </li>
  <li>
   Sebastian can swim.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  An example of this tandem gameplay was demonstrated toward the end of the preview during a scene where Hanna and Alva work together to take out an enemy NPC. Alva was able to use her movement abilities to climb to a high vantage point, allowing her to throw a rock at a noisy grate, luring an enemy into Hanna's line of sight, and thereby allowing Hanna to shoot him with a dart. This is a promising example of
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  's synergy between puzzle and stealth mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, it looks like there's a lot to love about
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  . It's punching far above its weight graphically, which has garnered a lot of attention so far, but River End Games is clearly looking to implement strong gameplay as well, making it more than just a visually stunning experience. If its gameplay and presentation mingle as effectively in the final product as they did during the preview, then
  <em>
   Eriksholm
  </em>
  will be a title worth checking out.

  Bad Blood is one of the quests related to Pavlena and her mother Bozhena in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2

  </strong>
  , the two people who helped Hans and Henry earlier in the game to survive and get their wounds healed. However, this quest won't be available right after exiting from their hut.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Players need to make a bit more progress in the main campaign. After Hans and Henry are denied from entering the
  <strong>
   Von Bergow castle
  </strong>
  , they will find themselves in a small town near the castle, and it's from there that players can come back to Bozhena's hut again, talk to her, and acquire the Bad Blood quest.

  After talking with Bozhena, she will inform you about Pavlena and how she's gone missing for a few days. This will give the player some leads on Troskowitz. Now, head back to the city and find a man named
  <strong>
   Woodcutter Dushka
  </strong>
  . He can be found in front of the street behind the tailor shop, in front of a woodcutting yard. Talk to him and tell him about Pavlena's missing.

  with a man named Roman. Ask him about Roman's whereabouts and then use Speech to persuade him to give you some coins. Now, head to Roman's home. The door is closed and requires a lockpick, but there is no need to waste the lockpick. Head to the
  <strong>
   wall on the right side of the stairs
  </strong>
  and there is a ladder. Make sure no one is around, then climb up the ladder and head toward the lunch table and examine it.

  Around the corpse, you will hear a man yelling, looking for a pig. Follow the sound, speak with the man, and ask him whether he's seen anything suspicious. He will tell something about a man named Straw, living in
  <strong>
   Jakesh's barn
  </strong>
  . Dot his location on the map and go speak with him. With a low level of speech, none of the persuasion methods will work, but it doesn't matter, as beating up the guy with a few sword attacks will force him to let his guard off and confess.

  Once this part is over, you will be tasked with finding Pavlena. As marked on the map, she will be
  <strong>
   inside a hideout between the rocks
  </strong>
  with a small ladder leading to it, but keep in mind that as soon as Henry climbs up the ladder, a dog will attack from behind. So, make sure you have enough HP before moving to the rocks.

 <p>
  Stand where you are and
  <strong>
   negotiate with Ota
  </strong>
  . Tell him that your name is Henry and that Bozhena has sent you after Pavlena. There is no need to answer him about his dog or brother, as it's difficult to persuade him through those methods at a low level. Instead, ask him why he is doing this, and then talk about how god can forgive him if he leaves Pavlena.

  Now, this part is quite important. Here, Straw's brother will ask how he can be remedied, and then you need to choose the second option,
  <strong>
   telling him that you will put in a good word to Von Bergow
  </strong>
  . This will persuade Ota, and he will release Pavlena.

  Take Pavlena to her house and talk with Bozhena. In this part,
  <strong>
   Bozhena will ask the player to kill Jakesh
  </strong>
  . If the player denies the request, the quest will end and Henry will gain a reputation loss with Bozhena. But, if the player accepts, they will need to return to the city and kill Jakesh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Earlier in the morning, Jakesh goes to the far side of his land and prays next to the grave of his wife and son. That is a quiet place to kill Jakesh.
  <strong>
   Talking to Jakesh before killing him
  </strong>
  will provide multiple options.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you just decide to kill the guy, your reputation with the city will go down, but Henry will not be under arrest as long as he kills Jakesh quietly and hides the corpse somewhere outside the city. In return, this will provide a big boost to Henry's reputation with Bozhena and Pavlena, up to the point that Henry will have a new dialogue option with Pavlena after reporting the death of Jakesh to Bozhena and her daughter. The new dialogue with Pavlena will grant Henry
  <strong>
   a necklace that was a memento of Roman to Pavlena
  </strong>

 <p>
  On the other hand, if Henry decides to spare Jakesh, the old man will compensate Bozhena with 100 coins. Jakesh will also allow the old woman to return to the city again. When meeting with Bozhena and reporting the result, Henry can avoid talking about the compensation and keep it for himself, but if he decides to be honest, Bozhena will offer half of the compensation to Henry himself, which is 50 coins.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter if Henry keeps the compensation or gives it entirely to Bozhena,
  <strong>
   sparing Jakesh will not increase his reputation with Pavlena far enough to unlock the new dialogue with the girl

  <em>
   With the recent announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2 coming in 2025, fans of the Mario Kart franchise have a brand-new installment in the franchise to look forward to! There's little known about the new game, including even its title, but what most fans are excited about are which levels from previous games will be returning. From the chaotic frenzy of Waluigi Pinball to the blue skies of Sunshine Airport, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe fans have a lot of studying to do if they wanna hit the ground running in the new Mario Kart knowing all the best shortcuts in some of the best levels (assuming they all come back!).

  This level originated in
  <em>
   Mario Kart DS
  </em>
  , preceding the franchise's addition of underwater racing in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 7
  </em>
  for the 3DS. With the track returning to
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  , Cheep Cheep Beach has a new section that players can breeze through by taking a trip underwater, following a path of gold coins in shallow water behind an arrow sign pointing left early in the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  While this shallow water does contain dark sand at the bottom that could slow players down, this can be remedied by clever timing with a Mushroom, so make sure you're not trying to take advantage of this shortcut without one locked and loaded. This hidden path will get you ahead of racers who take the normal path without ever noticing where you went.

  Piranha Plant Slide returns to
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
  </em>
  from the 3DS, featuring a wide variety of obstacles as racers breeze through a sewer system. However, it's easy to end up falling behind if you get attacked by giant Piranha Plant hazards, with one in a key spot right before you exit the sewers. That being said, it'll require some perfect timing on the players' part.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the gated floor of the track, water bubbles will rise up to indicate a current, lifting players a la a gust of wind in other levels. If you notice a water current at any point nearing the Piranha Plant, feel free to race straight into it, as it'll give you an aerial boost that can not only avoid enemy hazards, but also set you up perfectly for the cannon at the end of the tunnel.

  Toad Harbor is an original stage in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  , and for the most part, seems like a pretty easy course to race through. However, nearing the finish line, follow the train tracks to find an alleyway, which is free from hazards and (for the most part) other players, letting you breeze past opponents. This shortcut can allow for a pretty exciting end to any
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  race!
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, imagine you're trailing behind an enemy racer in 2nd place, but with knowledge of this shortcut, you swerve to the right and ride along the tracks. With the addition of a well-timed Mushroom, you can surpass the racer ahead of you to 1st place without them even seeing you passing them! Plus, the alleyway will drop you out just ahead of the course, giving you the head start for the next lap.

  Athens Dash, based on historical locations in the real-world country of Greece, originally debuted in the mobile title
  <em>
   Mario Kart Tour
  </em>
  . With all the incredible sights, including the Parthenon, statues of Greek deities, and amphitheaters, it can be tough for racers to spot this secret passageway, blocked by a pair of Piranha Plant wooden cutouts.
 </p>
 <p>
  By taking this hidden route, racers will be granted a speed pad they can use to get ahead of other players. However, given how the Athens Dash route changes, this shortcut can only be accessed on the second and third laps of each race. These wooden Piranha Plant cutouts can also be found on courses like Daisy Circuit and Boo Lake.

  Very few courses in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
  </em>
  reference the
  <em>
   Yoshi's Island
  </em>
  franchise, but the Booster Course Pass changed this with the Yoshi's Island stage. Aesthetically, it resembles the graphics of the SNES title
  <em>
   Yoshi's Island
  </em>
  , featuring enemies and characters like Poochy, Goonies, and Nep-Enuts. However, the shortcut on this track is not immediately obvious!
 </p>
 <p>
  One Winged Cloud, which can be found floating in the sky throughout the course like in
  <em>
   Yoshi's Island
  </em>
  , will reveal a red staircase letting players ride for a while above the regular route. This will help players get a little further ahead and avoid obstacles, or possibly give them a safe space to use a Mushroom and speed ahead.

  Sunshine Airport was originally a part of the Star Cup in the base game of
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  . Throughout its DLC releases and re-imagining on Nintendo Switch, frequent
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  fans have probably raced through Sunshine Airport hundreds of times. However, even they might not know of one particular shortcut towards the end of each lap.
 </p>
 <p>
  As racers pass through the indoors of Sunshine Airport, nearing the finish line, they'll notice a luggage carousel with wooden crates moving on a conveyor belt. Players can actually drive through this section for a quicker line to the finish, but even more so, the wooden crates can be driven through, granting a Mushroom to help players make that final push to first place.

  First appearing on the GameCube version of
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  , this track is shaped like everyone’s favorite dinosaur creature, Yoshi. Players with a keen eye will be able to spot this shortcut immediately after the start/finish line. Though the track veers off to the left, there’s a large waterfall visible through a gap in the stone with a grassy slope in front of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  This shortcut can be absurdly difficult to master without bonus items, so even experienced players will need to give it a few practices to get it right. When aiming for the waterfall, the best course of action is to drift, hop twice, then perform a stunt boost to get across. Of course, for those who aren’t interested in perfecting this multi-step technique, a mushroom boost works just as well.

  As a new track making its debut in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  , Shy Guy Falls is a fun track with two steep waterfall sections dominating the loop. However, this track holds several small shortcut opportunities – two of which flow into each other nicely. When launching off the ramp into the canyon, players will need to perform a stunt boost to access an upper path nestled inside a cave.
 </p>
 <p>
  As players perform another trick when launching off the ramp on this upper path, they should see a grassy path to the right. Performing a right drift and a hop at the last moment will allow players to drive along this grassy path without slowing down. This path also ends in another ramp, giving players an opportunity for an additional stunt boost as well.

  This track is one that was introduced to the series in
  <em>
   Mario Kart DS
  </em>
  and features as part of the lightning cup in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  . It can be a tricky track, but there are two key shortcuts that will help players save some time. The first can be found in the large clockface center of the track, where the path diverges around a circular hole in the center. If the hand is in the right position, players can use it to bypass the gap and drive straight ahead so long as they stunt boost off the center.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second is much trickier but uses the same logic of driving along the clock hands that appear just before the start/finish line. Players will need to drift toward the hand and perform a quick left hop as they leave the road. Once they land on the hand, players should hop to the right to stay on track and then perform a stunt boost as they return to the main path.

 <p>
  Also new to the
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  series is the Ice Ice Outpost track which features as DLC in
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  but is included in the deluxe version. To hit this shortcut, players will need to keep an eye out when they enter the icy cavern after the two diverging yellow and green tracks meet back up. To the right of the cave, there is a path formed by large ice blocks with two visible ramps. Veer onto this path and perform stunt boosts for added momentum.
 </p>
 <p>
  When players land, they may be tempted to immediately correct themselves to the right to follow the track. However, another shortcut can be used if they hold the same direction. Coming out of the previous jump, players can drop off the track to land on an icy path with two more ramps. Using a drift boost and stunt boosts will increase the speed at which players launch out of this shortcut and back onto the main track.

  Another track that debuts with
  <em>
   Mario Kart 8
  </em>
  is Bone-Dry Dunes which features a large cave resembling Dry Bowser. This cave is where another key shortcut can be found in the form of a higher wooden path, which will also reward players with a bonus item block. Accessing this path can be difficult, but there are two main ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first is to utilize the sand spout that appears and bounce off it to access the wooden track. However, it can also be accessed from the air if players position their glide just right. When launching off the glide ramp, letting go of the joystick will give players much more height than normal. Using this extra height, players should then turn towards the path once they come near the two teeth of the Dry Bowser cave.

  This Christmassy course appears in the third wave of DLC Booster Course Pass tracks and has a shortcut that allows players to cut through the top part of the mountain. It does require a mushroom boost to pull it off, however, the payoff is worth it. When driving up the mountain players will see large wrapped presents buried in the surrounding snow.
 </p>
 <p>
  When passing the final set of presents, players can use their mushroom boost to drive around the left of the gift, hugging it tightly. Following this corner around, there will be a small cliff that players can jump off, giving them extra airtime as they sail downwards. This shortcut lands players a decent way down the slope but will mean sacrificing a few item boxes.

  Released as part of the fourth wave of DLC Booster Course Pass tracks, Bangkok Rush takes players through the busy capital city of Thailand. Though the course features a handful of small shortcut opportunities, the best one appears toward the end of the loop. When players exit the market section of the track, there is a set of stairs leading upwards on the left.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking the stairs up will give players access to the subway tracks and a great but somewhat narrow drift opportunity. There are several sections where players can drop back down to the track but waiting until the one with the red arrow will grant players three extra coins and take them much closer to the start/finish line.

 <p>
  Given how much
  <em>
   <strong>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  leans into realism and historical authenticity, it's perfectly understandable why its combat might be seen by some as falling short of remarkable and innovative. After all, in that approach to historical authenticity,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  can't feature spell-slinging, double-jumping heroics that give its protagonist, Henry, an edge over his enemies. Nevertheless, at the very least,
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  has done everything in its power to make its combat far more accessible and exciting than its predecessor's, even to the point of ensuring that no two duels in the game feel the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a considerable challenge, attempting to make every battle in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  feel unique, but the sequel manages to do just that — at least, as much as it can without compromising the realism that defines it. It ultimately accomplishes this with its design philosophy that not all enemies in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  are created equal, thereby requiring players to adjust their strategy depending on the scenario they find themselves in. Furthermore, the addition of several new weapons in the sequel adds a decent amount of variety to combat, as players can now choose between a more diverse array of playstyles than they could in the first game.

  Players Must Adapt Their Approach to Combat Depending on the Scenario
 </h3>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , NPCs respond and react to the player almost like real people would. While this is a major goal of the game's intent on immersing players in a living world, it simultaneously ensures that every interaction with an NPC feels different, especially during combat. If players apply the same approach to every NPC they fight in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , they will surely find the gameplay to be far more difficult than it should, as the game's NPCs are free of static design and instead primarily rely on the player's actions to decide what they are going to do next.

    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  This can be most clearly seen when players shift the direction of their weapon in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , as doing so will frequently cause the enemy to respond in turn. This was, of course, how the first
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance
  </em>
  was designed to behave as well, but that concept has been dialed up in the sequel to produce NPCs that are far more reactive and dynamic than they were in the first game. As a result, every duel in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  feels unique, as players are encouraged to adapt their approach to combat depending on the scenario and the enemy or enemies they are fighting.

  Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's New Weapons Help Add Variety to Combat
 </h3>
 <p>
  While swords are still considered one of the more realistic and immersive weapons in
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  , the sequel has also added several new weapon types that are meant to not only increase the accessibility of the game's combat, but also the diversity of playstyles. For example, early firearms have been incorporated into
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's combat, and while they are almost impossible to use, they can be quite effective when they land a hit. The addition of crossbows and halberds also adds new variety to
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  's combat, ensuring that players can approach battles in a variety of different ways.

  The former creative director of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  has responded to recent statements made by EA's boss implying that the game would have been more successful as a live-service title. While initially slated to include live service and multiplayer elements,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  pivoted to a single-player experience during its lengthy development period.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans of the franchise were thrilled when
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  launched in October 2024, but the game failed to reach EA's sales expectations, shipping only 1.5 million copies. While early player reviews were largely positive, things took a turn for the worse not long after the RPG's launch, with
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  review-bombed for its reportedly "woke" agenda and lackluster writing. 2014's
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  won numerous Game of the Year awards, leading many to promptly criticize BioWare and EA for the newest game's numerous shortcomings when players expected so much more. Now, a former director on the project is responding to some seemingly tone-deaf comments recently made by publisher EA.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recently, EA boss Andrew Wilson implied that
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  as a live-service title would have performed better. This garnered immediate pushback online, and former
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  creative director Mike Laidlaw, who worked on the series since its start, has now responded in a new post on Bluesky (as reported by Eurogamer). "Look, I'm not a fancy CEO guy, but if someone said to me 'the key to this successful single-player IP's success is to make it purely a multiplayer game. No, not a spin-off: fundamentally change the DNA of what people loved about the core game' to me, I'd probably, like, quit that job or something," he wrote. Notably, Laidlaw remained at BioWare until the decision to make
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  a live-service title was announced, after which time he decided to leave the company.

  David Gaider, the lead writer for the first three
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  titles, also offered his thoughts regarding the recent comments on social media. "Let's say you don't actually know much about games. You're in a big office with a bunch of other execs who also don't know much about games. What are they all saying? 'Live games do big numbers!' 'Action games are hot!' My advice to EA (not that they care): you have an IP that a lot of people love. Deeply," he wrote. "At its height, it sold well enough to make you happy, right? Look at what it did best at the point where it sold the most." Gaider then mentioned the wild success of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  as a single-player title before reminding EA that the fans would still be waiting down the line. The former lead writer left BioWare in 2016.

  In late January 2025, it was announced that some developers of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  had been laid off following the game's lackluster performance. The game's director, Corinne Busche, has also left the company, leading many to wonder what the future of the franchise will look like. Of greater concern to many in the community is now
  <em>
   Mass Effect 5
  </em>
  , which is currently in pre-production and was not impacted by the recent restructuring at the company. Given EA's misguided belief that
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  would have thrived as a live-service game,
  <em>
   Mass Effect 5
  </em>
  may now feature these controversial elements, despite past entries being almost exclusively single-player experiences.

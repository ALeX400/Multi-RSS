  <em>
   <strong>
    Marvel Rivals

  has no shortage of great qualities, from its vibrant comic-inspired art direction, to its clean menu UI and general presentation, to its great performances from actors who have become synonymous with the roles. But that would all be for nothing if
  <em>

  ' gameplay wasn't fun.

  Thankfully,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is a really engaging hero shooter that strikes a really great balance of being accessible enough to welcome newcomers to the genre, while still offering enough complexity in its mechanics to reward veterans of the genre.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  also strikes a pretty good balance with its roster, in several key ways. But developer NetEase can't rest on its laurels.

  Marvel Rivals' Roster Is Home to a Variety of Heroes
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' biggest strengths is the variety of its roster.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has shipped with an impressive total of 33 characters, each one coming with a very distinct moveset. While the roster is home to household names like Hulk, Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Black Panther, it also has its fair share of lesser-known heroes. Interestingly, it's several of these lesser-known heroes who have become the breakout stars of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , with Iron Fist becoming a notorious back-line menace, and Jeff the Land Shark being an adorable little team-eating fiend.

  Marvel Rivals' Roster Strikes a Solid Balance Between Roles
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another solid balance that
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' roster strikes is between its roles. While the number of heroes in each of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' classes are far from equal, it still feels as though there's a solid balance overall while playing. With
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' 6v6 team structure, at least half of the team is expected to choose to be a Duelist (Damage), and there are 18 different heroes to choose from, giving players a ton of playstyle variety and giving teams a plethora of different strategies they can work with.

 <p>
  Though there are far fewer Vanguards (Tanks) and Strategist (Supports) in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , there's still plenty of variation for players to experiment with. The complexity of some of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' Vanguards and Strategists also requires a bit more skill to master, meaning that it can often be more rewarding to play as a tank or support despite the fewer heroes available to players.

  Marvel Rivals' Roster Could Lose Its Balance Quite Easily
 </h3>
 <p>
  But while
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' roster is striking a solid balance right now, that could be thrown out of whack pretty easily if developer NetEase isn't careful. There are currently 18 Duelists in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , and just 8 Vanguards, and 7 Strategists. That's obviously a sizable gap, and though it's solid for a launch-day roster (
  <em>
   Overwatch 1
  </em>
  had just four Support heroes at launch), it won't be long before fans start to demand more heroes to fill that void.

 <p>
  Though it's surely tempting to put more Duelists in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  as their abilities only need to focus on dishing out damage, NetEase needs to make sure it adds new Vanguard and Strategist heroes first. Maintaining this careful balance is pivotal to the success of a hero shooter.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
   </em>
  </strong>
  has recently unveiled the official patch notes for its Patch 1.08. The new
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  update is already available for PS5, addresses several issues that the title previously had, and adds a new feature to the open-world game.

 <p>
  Developed by Guerrilla Games and Nixxes Software,
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  was released earlier this year for PS5 and PC. The game is a remaster of the popular 2017 title with enhanced graphics, and it takes advantage of some PS5 features such as haptic feedback.
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  received positive reviews from critics, and it currently holds an average score of 85 on OpenCritic.

 <p>
  Now, Guerrilla Games and Nixxes Software revealed Patch 1.08 for
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  , which adds a transmog functionality to the game, allowing gamers to pick how Aloy’s armor will look despite the actual armor they’re wearing. To access this function, gamers should open their Inventory, go to Outfits, and select Apply Look on the desired costume. The rest of the patch mostly focused on fixing several bugs, such as flickering backgrounds during cutscenes, issues when using Auto Pickup for items, or mount acceleration not working as intended. Other fixes include improvements to the game’s audio, fixing various minor visual issues, and gameplay elements such as motion aiming not working properly while riding a mount.

 <p>
  The new patch comes on the heels of Update 1.07 for
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  , which was released for PS5 late in November. This previous update introduced elements such as Auto Pickup to the Pickups setting and a Color Blind Mode, and addressed some other bugs and minor issues.

 <p>
  Despite the positive reviews and continued support from the developers,
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  is not selling very well on the PS5. According to a recent report from TrueTrophies, the game had a small impact on PS5 players when compared to
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered
  </em>
  , having 92% fewer players than the other Sony remaster.

 <p>
  Despite some issues attracting an audience,
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered
  </em>
  remains one of the best PlayStation exclusives. The original 2017 game was already a pretty engrossing open-world adventure, and the remaster makes the experience more in line with the recent
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  , making the title an excellent pick for fans who have not played it yet. Gamers who are looking for more, however, should keep an eye out for the next game in the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  franchise, which could be released in 2025, according to some rumors.

  With
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tales of the Shire
   </em>
  </strong>
  confirmed to take place between
  <em>
   The Hobbit
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , there's massive potential for this cozy little farm life sim to subtly foreshadow the War of the Ring and therefore one of Bywater's most historic events: the Battle of Bywater. In
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , the Battle of Bywater is the last battle fought in the War of the Ring, in the year 3019, making it not just an important event for Bywater but for all of Middle-earth. With
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  doing everything it can to be as true to its source material as possible, there is little reason why it wouldn't find some way to reference the iconic war and the final battle that ended it.

  There's no indication of a specific year that
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  is set in, but since there are only 77 years between
  <em>
   The Hobbit
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , there is plenty of opportunity for
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  to at least hint at an impending war coming. While talk of a war as oppressive as the War of the Ring and the Battle of Bywater that followed it might seem out of place in a farm life sim like
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  , it might actually be the perfect way for the game to offset its bright, joyous tones every once in a while and expand its worldbuilding in the process.

  In
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , once the One Ring is destroyed and Sauron is defeated, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin return home to the Shire, expecting to find everything is still the way they left it. Instead, they discover that Saruman's henchmen have taken over the Shire and industrialized it for the fallen wizard's purposes. The Hobbits then organize a resistance and overwhelm the ruffians in a coordinated ambush near the village of Bywater, freeing the Shire and its inhabitants from Saruman's control.

  As Saruman is ultimately the driving force of the threat against Bywater, perhaps
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  could hint at the wizard's growing influence and the potential for a hostile takeover of the Shire. Saruman's industrialization of the Shire likely would have been in its earliest stages just before the start of the War of the Ring, so it's possible (depending on how close it is set to the war) for
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  to somehow weave Saruman's plot into its narrative. Perhaps Hobbits around Bywater might gossip about trouble in Bree, mysterious movements along the Greenway, or strange activity around Isengard.

 <p>
  As players are exploring Bywater and its outskirts in
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  , perhaps they might come across peculiar tools or unfamiliar items, hinting at Saruman's industrial ambitions. It might make sense for certain parts of the Shire to begin showing signs of decay as well, if not just as a symbolic way of foreshadowing the war to come. Furthermore, since it seems Gandalf will make an appearance in
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  , according to what is shown in its various trailers, the wizard could even drop hints about potential dangers throughout the wider Middle-earth and caution the villagers of Bywater to stay safe.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Star Wars Outlaws
   </strong>
  </em>
  has released title update 1.5.0, which fixes bugs related to NPCs, the Sabaac mini-game, quests, performance, and more.
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  is one of the more divisive games of 2024, with some praising it for its open world design and scoundrel fantasy, while others felt alienated by its stealth-focused gameplay. Despite all this,
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  earned an impressive three nominations at the 2024 Game Awards for Humberly Gonzalez's performance as Key Vess, Best Action/Adventure Game, and Innovation in Accessiblity.

 <p>
  One of the biggest points of contention when
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  first launched was its large focus on stealth gameplay. Many players were turned off by the game's forced stealth areas with automatic fail states when caught by guards or going loud. In the previous update, 1.4.0, developer Massive Entertainment removed
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  ' forced stealth, allowing for players to be able to tackle these areas with blaster in hand. Of course, stealth has remained a viable option for players who prefer to remain quiet, they just won't get an automatic failure screen when caught.

 <p>
  Now, Massive Entertainment has gone ahead and rolled out
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  ' latest title update, 1.5.0, which addresses large swaths of the game. Headlining the update are some fixes to NPCs, such as issues with them entering and exiting cover, getting trapped in an Imperial base on Toshara, and basic clipping issues with their clothing. Performance is a top focus of update 1.5.0 as well, as Massive has addressed a frame drop issue related to RTDXI and improved frame generation for players who use DLSS.

  ' popular Poker-like card game Sabaac has also received a healthy dose of fixes in the new update as well. An issue making tables unplayable after leaving with certain Shift Tokens active has been resolved, as well as the suspicion mechanic not working properly when players cheat with Kay Vess' companion Nix during a game. The update addresses main and side quest bugs across all the game's explorable planets, as well as a large number of issues having to do with

  In February 2024, Konami announced the
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection
  </em>
  as part of the planned festivities to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  franchise. All games in the upcoming compilation title were initially released between 1998 and 2004 for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, or Game Boy Advance, with one title hitting shelves before the physical card game was even released in Japan. Over the past year, more and more titles have been confirmed for the collection, with the complete list now being confirmed by Konami ahead of the game's February 2025 launch.

  While certain games in the collection, such as
  <em>
   Reshef of Destruction
  </em>
  , aren't recalled too fondly by fans of the franchise,
  <em>
   The Eternal Duelist Soul
  </em>
  remains a wildly popular
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  game to this day, referred to by many as one of the best titles in the series. Five of the listed games have never been ported outside of Japan, including the aforementioned
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists
  </em>
  , which was released in December 2000 in three versions: Yugi Deck, Kaiba Deck, and Jonouchi Deck. While many fans are eager to play these Japan-exclusive titles for the first time, others are hoping to see Konami release a PlayStation collection in the future, as titles like
  <em>
   Forbidden Memories
  </em>
  for the PlayStation and
  <em>
   The Duelists of the Roses
  </em>
  for the PlayStation 2 remain beloved to this day.

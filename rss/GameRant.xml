  As with most fantasy games, magic plays a large role in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  , be it during exploration or in combat. To be expected for a game that adapts the magic system within
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  boasts a wide selection of arcane schools and damage types. Of all the damage types,
  <strong>
   lightning
  </strong>
  may be one of the most visually striking and visceral, leaving a player's enemies obliterated and smoldering.

  Ranging from cantrips to level six, lightning spells are predominantly suited to the sorcerer or wizard class. However, most classes can get their hands on lightning magic if players know how, the only exceptions being Barbarian and Monk. While most lightning spells are fun and effective to use, some will give players more of an edge in combat than others.

  <em>
   Fans of Dungeons and Dragons will find that
  </em>
  <em>
   not all spells from the popular tabletop game have been ported over
  </em>
  <em>
   to Baldur's Gate 3 in their entirety. This is, of course, understandable, as the burden of creating a fully interactive multi-layered world that responds to everything the player can think of doing was already a daunting task in and of itself. Larian Studios can be forgiven for not incorporating every single spell in existence into their game because the work that would go into accomplishing such a task would be an insane ask on top of an already grueling process. That said, the spells that BG3 does add are all implemented beautifully, and fans of Lightning Spells in D&amp;D have plenty of good options to choose from.

   Chromatic Orb
  </span>
  is a jack-of-all-trades spell, allowing players to pick their damage type from multiple options. Lightning is one of these options. The versatility makes this spell handy for facing enemies with damage resistances, as players can specifically choose damage types that the enemy isn't resistant to. However, there are some drawbacks to Chromatic Orb.

 <p>
  First of all, as a level one spell, its damage output can be quite low. Secondly, it is a ranged attack spell but has a small area of effect around the targeted creature or object, electrocuting enemies standing in it for subsequent rounds. While this can be helpful, it often limits the number of enemies the player can target, as any allies caught in the area of effect will also be electrocuted. Chromatic Orb is an evocation spell available to Sorcerers and Wizards. Players can also choose Chromatic Orb as an Eldritch Knight Fighter subclass, Arcane Trickster Rogue subclass, or as a Bard's magical secret.

  Elemental Weapon is a spell exclusive to Paladins, and the only one that allows these divine warriors to wield the power of lightning. While it isn't the flashiest lightning spell out there, it doesn't need to be. It is tailored to the class that uses it.

 <p>
  Paladins are primarily a martial class, using their limited selection of spells to support this. Elemental Weapon is a great example. As with Chromatic Orb, this level three Transmutation spell allows players to choose from a variety of elemental damage types, including lightning. The paladin's weapon then gains a +1 to attack rolls and deals an additional d4 damage of the chosen type.

 <p>
  Unique to the Ranger class, Lightning Arrow is a Transmutation spell that adds lightning damage to a ranger's ranged weapon attacks, with smaller bolts of lightning damaging nearby creatures within a rather large area of effect. While it is useful and unique, it does fall into a similar category to Chromatic Orb. It can be hard to find opportunities to use Lightning Arrow without damaging allies in the fray.

 <p>
  Rangers are primarily a ranged weapon class, and shouldn't rely on their spellcasting. Since Lightning Arrow is a level three spell, the highest level that a Ranger can get, it does quite a large amount of damage and is worth using when an opportunity arises, but it isn't the go-to lightning spell. It simply allows rangers the chance to harness the power of lightning!

   Shocking Grasp
  </span>
  is not to be underestimated. It may not do as much damage as the beloved Fire Bolt cantrip (1d8 as opposed to 1d10), but it has a nifty trick up its sleeve. Successfully hitting a target with Shocking Grasp will prevent it from taking reactions, meaning players can dart in, deal damage, and make their retreat without provoking an opportunity attack.

 <p>
  It is a melee spell attack, and it is often highly likely to strike true since attacks against opponents wearing metal armor have advantage. Being a melee spell attack is its primary drawback, as it does require the caster to be quite close to their target. Shocking Grasp available to Wizards, Sorcerers, Arcane Trickster Rogues, and Eldritch Knight Fighters.

   Witch Bolt
  </span>
  is a ranged spell attack that connects the caster to their target with a beam of lightning for a maximum of ten turns. Once connected, the caster can administer the damage each turn without expending a spell slot and without needing to make another attack roll.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  While it can feel like a waste of a spell slot if the attack misses or if concentration is lost early, Witch Bolt does a surprising amount of damage even on its initial beam, let alone when the caster applies that damage each round. Even better, it's only a level-one spell. Witch Bolt is available to Wizards, Sorcerers, and Warlocks. It is also available to a few subclasses: Eldritch Knight fighters, and Arcane Trickster rogues.

   Glyph of Warding
  </span>
  is a level 3 Abjuration spell that creates a large Glyph trap on any surface and primes it with one of seven possible effects. It either deals Fire, Lightning, Thunder, Cold, or Acid damage when triggered, puts targets to sleep, or creates a pushback effect. Casting Glyph of Warding does not require Concentration, even though it is a persistent effect. The only limitation to this spell is that only one Glyph can be active at one time; casting a second Glyph will make the first one disappear.
 </p>

 <p>
  Unlike the Dungeons and Dragons ruleset, Glyph of Warding in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  is an instant-cast spell that can trigger an explosion on the same turn that it is cast. There is no need to bait enemies into stepping onto a trapped platform, making the spell much more usable. Additionally, since Glyph of Warding can be customized to deal any type of elemental damage, including Lightning, it can be tailored to exploit the opponent's weaknesses on the fly. To boil it down, Glyph of Warding is a better version of Fireball that deals nearly as much damage but can be adapted to fit the situation better. It's one of the most powerful spells available to Bards, Clerics, and Wizards at level 5 and should be prioritized as one of the best spells in the mid to late game.

   Call Lightning
  </span>
  is like Witch Bolt if it was an area-of-effect spell and could never miss its mark. It allows casters to call a lightning strike within an area of effect, potentially damaging multiple enemies. It can often be easier to maneuver this spell around allies as well, since it targets a certain area as opposed to a specific target.

 <p>
  A Dexterity save is required by anyone caught in its area, and targets still take half the damage on a success. Following the initial strike, casters can then maintain concentration to conjure the storm again, choosing a new location if they like, without expending a spell slot. Call Lightning is available to Druids, Sorcerers, Tempest Clerics, Pact of the Tome Warlocks, and Bards using their magical secrets.

 <p>
  Lightning Bolt is perhaps the simplest lightning spell in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , yet it's still one of the most impressive. It is a bolt of lightning that is fired in a thirty-meter line extending from the caster. Anyone caught in the beam must make a dexterity save to avoid the full brunt of the spell, taking half the damage on a success.

 <p>
  The beam is somehow wide enough that players can get many enemies caught in it, while slim enough that it's not too hard to fire in between allies. It is a high-damage spell available to Sorcerers and Wizards, as well as Bards with magical secrets. It is a great addition to any spellcaster's repertoire.

  It may not come as a surprise that there is a large level difference between the number one spot and the other lightning spells. Chain Lightning is three levels higher than the previous highest lightning spell, and the maximum level that spellcasters can reach in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  . Casters make a ranged attack against a target, and the target must make a dexterity saving throw, taking half damage on a success.

 <p>
  The 'chain' part of the spell consists of a maximum of three bolts of lightning that can leap off the target, damaging up to three enemies within an eighteen-meter radius. It has everything the perfect lightning spell should be: high damage, lots of range, area of effect, half damage even on a successful save, and striking visuals. Available to Sorcerers and Wizards, it is certain to leave their foes sparking and smoldering.

  An imaginative
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has created crossover artwork that shows Juno from the shooter game together with the Xenomorph from the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  movies. While Juno is one of the playable heroes available in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , the Xenomorph is the primary antagonist in the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  franchise.

 <p>
  Last month,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  received a new major update when Season 12 rolled out. It introduced a bunch of new additions and a new support hero called Juno into the FPS title. In a short time, Juno appears to have quickly grown in popularity among
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  players, with a few of them reimagining her in their own unique ways. One recent example involves fan art that pits the new hero against one of the more notable villains in science fiction.

 <p>
  On Reddit, user Fragrant-Secret-6839 shared their
  <em>
   Overwatch 2 Alien
  </em>
  crossover artwork, bringing together Juno and the Xenomorph in an intriguing manner. The art depicts a scared Juno taking cover, with her Mediblaster equipped, as a fearsome Xenomorph walks close to her. Moreover, the image shows the creature extending its inner jaw, ready to pounce, in an iconic action that
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  fans have seen many times over the years.

  Through their art, the player unites

  's Martian hero Juno with a fellow extraterrestrial being, the Xenomorph from the

  films, in a curious new scenario. This particular portrayal of these characters together highlights the tense nature of a hypothetical encounter between the two. Several other
  <em>

  Interestingly, this isn't the first time Juno has been featured in an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  fan creation crossover. In fact, she has emerged as a popular subject for players to stretch their creativity. Earlier, another player reimagined Juno in the look of

 <p>
  As the old saying goes, history tends to repeat itself, and that's especially true in the world of video games. When
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  set the industry on fire in 1993, it created a desperate need for other developers to have their own hyper-violent shooters. This gave birth to the
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  Clone, a term that has carried over into contemporary times. Just eight years later, Bungie would change the shooter world once more with the landmark release of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Halo: Combat Evolved
   </strong>
  </em>
  in 2001.

 <p>
  In the years following,
  <em>
   Halo's
  </em>
  dominating performance prompted the competition to create the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Halo
   </em>
   Killer
  </strong>
  . Much the same as
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  Clones, the
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  Killers were about replicating the massive success that Master Chief's debut title had. Some of them were shameless rip-offs, while others carved out their own unique identity and even created franchises of their own. Whatever the outcome of any particular
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  Killer, it was all the evidence needed that the iconic FPS franchise was one of the industry's most remarkable properties.

  Through several delays and a publisher change,
  <strong>
   <em>
    TimeShift
   </em>
  </strong>
  came to resemble
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  in a number of ways. After its troubled development process, Saber Interactive overhauled
  <em>
   TimeShift
  </em>
  , putting a stoic protagonist behind a gold-plated helmet and setting him loose in a sci-fi world full of fierce enemies and bosses.

 <p>
  <em>
   TimeShift
  </em>
  feels outstanding to play, as the shooting still features some excellent feedback and weight. It also features some fun time-based powers to use, with slow-down and stop being crucial to making it through the game's tougher encounters. As far as sci-fi military shooters go,
  <em>
   TimeShift
  </em>
  is a solid adventure and still one of the more memorable
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  Killers of its generation.
  <em>
   TimeShift
  </em>
  is readily available on Steam, and is worth diving back into.

 <p>
  After exploring armed conflicts from previous decades for the first three
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty
   </strong>
  </em>
  games, developer Infinity Ward wanted to do something different. Seeing the massive success of
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  at the beginning of the century, the team decided to fast-forward to the present day, vaguely chronicling the wars in Iraq and Syria.

 <p>
  This shift away from World War 2 to contemporary warfare put it in direct competition with Master Chief's modern sensibilities, and it contended directly with
  <em>
   Halo 3
  </em>
  in 2007.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
   </em>
  </strong>
  was able to substantially outsell
  <em>
   Halo 3
  </em>
  and launched one of the industry's most dominant modern franchises.

  Realizing they had their own sci-fi military franchise that could compete with
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  , Games Workshop licensed the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warhammer 40,000
   </em>
  </strong>
  IP to Relic Entertainment, who produced a shooter for the PS2 and PC called
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fire Warrior
   </em>
  </strong>
  in 2003. The expansive world of
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  has been a perfect fit for video games ever since the first
  <em>
   40k
  </em>
  game in 1995, and it seamlessly fit into the FPS genre with
  <em>
   Fire Warrior
  </em>
  , where it challenged
  <em>
   Halo's
  </em>
  dominance as a sci-fi military shooter.

  <em>
   Fire Warrior
  </em>
  is still an excellent shooter, one that comes from an era where console shooters were still a bit rough around the edges. Movement feels slick and responsive, while the feedback and sound design of the guns is top-tier. It was a worthy challenger to Master Chief's throne, even if it remains largely forgotten today, even in
  <em>
   Warhammer
  </em>
  circles.

 <p>
  In its continued quest to compete with
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  , Sony tapped the massively-talented developer Insomniac to develop a first-person shooter. Insomniac separated their game from
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  by setting it in World War 2, featuring an alien invasion that pits the player against the fearsome Chimera. The end result was
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resistance: Fall of Man
   </strong>
  </em>
  , which launched on the PS3 in 2006. It was easily the PS3's best title at launch, with an impressive campaign and some truly wonderful world building.

  <em>
   Resistance
  </em>
  spawned a truly fascinating franchise, one that saw multiple sequels and spin-offs over the years. Much like the franchise it was competing with,
  <em>
   Resistance
  </em>
  focused on tight, responsive gunplay set in a bold, far-reaching sci-fi universe, while the Chimera remain one of the best antagonistic forces the industry has seen. These days,
  <em>
   Resistance
  </em>
  has been pushed aside for other Sony IPs and Insomniac is busy with
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  , but it was certainly one of
  <em>
   Halo's
  </em>
  most well-respected competitors.

  Branded as "The Next
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  " by the Official Xbox Magazine,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Brute Force
   </strong>
  </em>
  was designed to emulate the success of Microsoft's shooter franchise by utilizing similar themes and world design, but within the framework of a third-person squad-based action game. Utilizing the Xbox hardware in some impressive ways, developer Digital Anvil created a fun, addictive third-person action game that featured some great level design and excellent gunplay.

 <p>
  <em>
   Brute Force
  </em>
  features four playable squad mates, with each of them offering unique contributions to the team, focusing either on full-frontal assaults or stealth. The AI is still rather impressive, as the computer-controlled characters respond in a timely and appropriate manner. The setting of
  <em>
   Bruce Force
  </em>
  is also a delight, featuring unique sci-fi worlds and characters, as well as some standout alien races.

  Although the Wii was noted for its remarkable success with casual players, there was still a desire to create a game that would appeal to a more hardcore audience. Seeking to do just that, High Voltage Software started development on a Wii-exclusive known as
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Conduit
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which would launch just three months before
  <em>
   Halo 3: ODST
  </em>
  in 2009.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   The Conduit
  </em>
  , players take control of a special agent named Michal Ford as he tries to stop an alien invasion. Using the Wiimote to aim weapons feels snappy and responsive, with some wonderful feedback from the guns and a whole host of alien creatures to dispatch. It is easily one of the Wii's greatest shooters, and it was a great alternative to
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  for anyone who only owned Nintendo hardware. It was later ported to Android, and a sequel was launched in 2011, but a modern port of
  <em>
   The Conduit
  </em>
  remains elusive.

  <em>
   Endless Legend

  is the sequel of
  <em>
   Dungeon of The Endless.

Each of the factions emerges from the Dungeon and starts repopulating the planet, trying to establish an empire and thrive despite knowing the world is doomed.

  The descendants of the survivors have forgotten their true origins and have devolved into a medieval-like civilization, forming their own cultures and survival tactics. The
  <em>
   Endless Space

  universe has deep worldbuilding and this game continues this tradition with an impressive story of survival and conquest. It's magnificent and challenging at the same time.

  The Han dynasty stagnated, and a child Emperor was placed as a puppet on the throne. Three kingdoms seceded from the grasp of the empire and sought to swallow the others in one of the biggest wars the Chinese civilization had ever had. Legends are born, alliances are made, and blood is spilled.

  This game tells the story of a raging war in the eastern continent, with an accurate setting and a thrilling plot. Narrated with expertise, this story beautifully fits the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  franchise, with massive battles and bloodthirsty warlords with incredible tactical skills. Billions of arrows cross the skies, cavalry charges make the earth rumble, and Guandaos are swung around, creating rivers of blood all around. It's a magnificent game set in a historical period that is both gruesome and interesting.

  The exiled son of a British noble family is living in the New World, lying low and minding his own fishing business, when he is suddenly pressed by a missive from his sister, Hannah, warning him about events happening back in England. Horrified by the notice of his father being accused of treason, the noble and his best friend Aarhant start an enterprise to save up money and travel back to the Old World.

  Against the backdrop of the Industrial Revolution, the pair establish a plan, then grow a business. They plan to take back the lost family's legacy from the clutches of an evil uncle, a money-thirsty tycoon who would stop at nothing to erase the siblings' legacy and tarnish their reputation as children of a traitor, paving the way for the success of his hostile takeover.
  <em>

  An exiled tribe heeds the call of their dying Bear God. A daemon prince forges a bloody path to become the supreme commander of the forces of Chaos. The wood elves seek to unite the tribes to face a common threat. The incredibly deep and bloody dark fantasy lore of the
  <em>

  franchise is taken to a whole new level by Creative Assembly, proving that they're the kings of grand strategy games.

  If players own the two previous
  <em>

  games, they can also enjoy the previous games' campaigns, so there are plenty of great stories to explore with the coolest and most refined mechanics in a 4x game. The enormous Old World campaign with a persistent scenario can give way to endless playthroughs that will submerge the players into a brutal and dangerous conflict spanning the ages.

  The history of the Great Roman Empire unfolds in front of the eyes of the players, from the
  <em>
   Total War
  </em>
  perspective, the Punic wars are retold like never before. Under the shadow of the Great General Hannibal Barca, events like the Cross of the Alps and the rise of a Republic are the perfect setting for players to enjoy a massive grand strategy game.

  Players have access to the full power of the Roman Empire at their disposal, but if they wish, they can also engage in multiple sub-campaigns. There are modes with several factions to pick from, including the Arveni, Carthage, the Egyptian Empire, the Iceni, the Macedonian Empire, the Pontus, the Parthians, and the Suebi.
  <em>
   Total War: Rome 2
  </em>
  covers a thrilling historical period, with many legendary battles and commanders, and it is definitely one of the most addictive grand strategy games with an enthralling story.

  <strong>
   Roguelikes
  </strong>
  are one of the most versatile genres to date. Anything from arcade-style beat-em-ups to discomforting horror sensations can wind up using the randomness and difficulty of roguelikes to challenge and compel players for hours.

 <p>
  Whether it's through the procedural generation of dungeons or the challenging survival mechanics, open-world-styled games are an especially good fit for difficult and RPG-heavy roguelikes who want to leave the world in players' own devices - for better or worse.

  This grim, early-access roguelike already boasts hundreds of enemies and a classless character-building system that synthesizes over 200 abilities.
  <em>
   Stoneshard
  </em>
  is inspired by many old-school roguelike tropes, such as limited saves and the quintessential perma-death that many roguelikes offer.

 <p>
  A main quest, centered around the quintessential "Stoneshards" is one of the game's various features consigned to the tapestry of dreams and promises known as the development roadmap. Currently, small-scale quests and the drive to explore more of this artfully rendered world are all that push the player forward, providing an open-world experience that will only grow stronger as development continues.

 <p>
  Moreso than other genres, roguelikes fall along a fairly neat spectrum regarding how "rogue-like" they are. On one end there are the cute and cozy roguelites, and on the other end, players have the ASCII-touting grandmother of the genre,
  <em>
   Rogue
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Caves of Qud
  </em>
  , with its blinding difficulty and unique, minimalist tileset, occupies a distinct niche towards the latter side of this spectrum.

 <p>
  The surreal, sci-fi-fantasy blend of
  <em>
   Qud
  </em>
  hosts psychic vampires, sentient inanimate objects, and a dangerously vital world unkind and uncaring as far as humanity's fate is concerned. This is not a game for the casual player, as gate-keepery as that sounds. For players who can adjust to the minimal graphics and incredible depth on display, however,
  <em>
   Caves of Qud
  </em>
  provides an intensely rewarding, intensely open-ended experience.

  Tome4 is not an experience for the faint-hearted, as one of the longer roguelikes, and an alternative to one-life-perma-death that is still punishing. It's a high-stakes story set in a high fantasy world, saving the continent amid mage-druid feuds and encroaching darkness.

  The entire world of
  <em>
   Doors of Trithius
  </em>
  is randomly generated upon the start of a new file. The factions warring with each other, the landmasses, and the geography, are all procedurally generated to ensure no two playthroughs are ever the same. Like many roguelikes on this list, difficulty is a driving force of this game, encouraging players to craft and experiment to overcome the overwhelming odds against them.

 <p>
  This game is an exemplar of the roguelike-open world genre, fusing the intricate character customization players expect from roguelikes with the strong emphasis on exploration and discovery that is the cornerstone of most modern open-world titles. Players hungry for replayability would be amiss to not grab this title.

 <p>
  Few open-world games offer the level of experimentation and broadness that
  <em>
   Battle Brothers
  </em>
  offers. The world is entirely open to players from the beginning, from the farthest northern reaches to the blazing southern deserts. There's no main quest, no call to adventure, no higher purpose than the almighty gold coin. Players control a group of enterprising mercenaries, going from village to village, taking jobs, and recruiting warm bodies.

 <p>
  Besides serving as the inspiration for other in-depth mercenary simulators like Wartales,
  <em>
   Battle Brothers
  </em>
  exemplifies open-world, sandbox design in a roguelike format. Every individual mercenary is suspected of permadeath (or permanent injury, if they're lucky), and if the whole party goes down, it's game over.
  <em>
   Battle Brothers
  </em>
  insist upon rebuilding and persevering from near-losses, building up a mercenary company after a job gone wrong amid a sprawling, procedurally generated world.

	The Marvel universe is filled with iconic characters, many of whom have only grown more popular with age thanks to new comic runs, movies, TV shows, and video game adaptations. The X-Men alone are packed to the brim with household names, and Magneto is the perfect example of a character who's only grown more popular over time, so much so that he's about to make his
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Fortnite
	 </strong>
	</em>
	debut.

 <p>
	First introduced all the way back in 1963's
	<em>
	 The X-Men #1
	</em>
	, Magneto has been an adversary of the beloved superhero team since its conception. But while many Marvel villains of the time were rather simple evil archetypes, Magneto was made with the express purpose of challenging readers' beliefs, presenting a more complex adversary whose motivations are often very understandable. This complexity has been something that's set Magneto apart from the rest of the Marvel rogues gallery for decades now, and recently he's been getting the flowers he rightly deserves. Magneto is on a hot streak right now, one that's carried him all the way to
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	.

	Magneto's On a Hot Streak
 </h3>
 <p>
	Back in March, Disney began to air
	<em>
	 X-Men '97
	</em>
	, a long-awaited sequel to the classic
	<em>
	 X-Men: The Animated Series
	</em>
	that originally premiered back in 1992. A 10-episode season,
	<em>
	 X-Men '97
	</em>
	is now regarded by many to be one of the best adaptations of the superhero team ever made, featuring some incredibly complex and mature arcs, along with some of the best depictions of these iconic characters. Magneto is one such character. Voiced by Matthew Waterson,
	<em>
	 X-Men '97
	</em>
	's Magneto is charming, intimidating, and most importantly, understandable, leading to a very compelling performance and portrayal.

	While
	<em>
	 X-Men '97
	</em>
	was airing, the 6v6 hero shooter
	<em>
	 Marvel Rivals
	</em>
	was also undergoing its Alpha testing phase, where a select few got to play an early version of the multiplayer game. Playing very similarly to
	<em>
	 Overwatch
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Marvel Rivals
	</em>
	gives players an array of heroes and villains to choose from, each equipped with their own unique abilities and attacks. Donning the role of a Vanguard (Tank),
	<em>
	 Marvel Rivals
	</em>
	' Magneto is a true force to be reckoned with in the arena, capable of launching metallic meteors and blocking oncoming projectiles with a literal iron curtain.
	<em>
	 Marvel Rivals
	</em>
	' Magneto also boasts a powerful visual design, wearing bulky metallic armor that immediately conveys just how strong his abilities are.

 <p>
	Rounding out the character's hot streak, Magneto is also set to come to
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	very soon. A prominent part of this season's marketing, Magneto will appear in
	<em>
	 Fortnite
	</em>
	Chapter 5 Season 3 as the Battle Pass' secret skin. This means that players won't be able to unlock the Magneto skin until July, but when they do, it'll also come with a LEGO variant of the post-apocalypse-inspired skin.

 <p>
	But Magneto's current hot streak might not be over just yet. Though it hasn't been confirmed yet, it's possible Magneto will play some sort of role in Insomniac's upcoming
	<em>
	 Marvel's Wolverine
	</em>
	, whether it's as a prominent part of the game's story, or simply as a character who's referenced in some Easter eggs. Magneto's potential role in
	<em>
	 Wolverine
	</em>
	could then pave the way for another appearance in the rumored Insomniac X-Men game, where he'd likely play a much larger role. Regardless of whether he appears in Insomniac's Marvel universe or not, Magneto's future as an X-Men icon seems brighter than ever.

	Netflix has released an official trailer confirming 14 more games coming to its gaming service in the next few months. Familiar titles including
	<em>
	 Don't Starve Together
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 The Case of the Golden Idol
	</em>
	, and
	<em>
	 Rotwood
	</em>
	are among the lineup, along with several new entries in the
	<em>
	 Netflix Stories
	</em>
	series, featuring games based on popular Netflix original series like
	<em>
	 Selling Sunset
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Emily in Paris
	</em>
	, and
	<em>
	 Perfect Match
	</em>
	. Many of the games have been given release dates, though others have been marked as "coming soon" or given a broader summer release window. Netflix has already added several big-name titles to its gaming library, such as
	<em>
	 Hades
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
	</em>
	, and
	<em>
	 Dead Cells
	</em>
	, among others. As AAA game companies like Microsoft and Sony work to balance physical releases with video game subscription services, Netflix looks to be expanding its existing online offerings by entering the gaming fray.

	Fans can look forward to a number of surprising additions to Netflix Games this summer, with dating sims, point-and-click mystery, action-adventure, survival, and card games among the array of upcoming additions. Perhaps most surprising are the unreleased games, such as
	<em>
	 Tales of the Shire
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Lab Rats
	</em>
	, that are already slated to be launched on Netflix Games, indicating that they may be available to Netflix subscribers at a similar time to their release on other platforms. Whether Netflix Games will prove to be a competitor against the massive library of Xbox Game Pass or the growing popularity of PS Plus remains to be seen, but competition among big companies is likely to benefit consumers in the long run.

	Being able to enjoy a number of fun games on a mobile device without having to purchase additional hardware, such as a console or PC, makes gaming more accessible. In spite of some audiences remaining skeptical about the value of gaming subscription services, it is promising to see an entertainment powerhouse such as
	<strong>
	 Netflix
	</strong>
	branching out to offer new opportunities to gaming fans.

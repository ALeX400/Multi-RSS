  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Last of Us Part 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player notices an impressive detail while playing through the game's museum chapter that seemingly foreshadows one of the sequel's most shocking and heartbreaking scenes. Since Naughty Dog's hit debut title in 2013,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  franchise has gone from strength to strength.
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2
  </em>
  has not only been applauded for how it handled the game's complex characters and highly emotional scenes, but also its breathtaking visuals and acute attention to every detail.

  To showcase one of these amazing details from the game, Reddit user blixxe_ noticed that the moose and wolves structure, exhibited in the museum from the Birthday Gift chapter, looks like it foreshadows a major and devastating event involving Joel Miller. The exhibit highlights a huge moose being taken down by a pack of hungry wolves, seemingly symbolizing the shocking occurrence still waiting to happen in Joel's encounter with
  <em>
   The Last of Us 2
  </em>
  's W.L.F in The Chalet of chapter one.

  Some of the comments in the thread have pointed out that not only is this an incredible hidden detail in

  that many players may miss during their first playthrough, but it's also an accurate depiction of the mighty and strong Joel as the moose, right before being surrounded by his enemies. One commentor said that even the leg of the moose that is being bitten by the wolf is the same leg Joel sustains an injury to.

  Steam Deck players are expressing their frustrations with Rockstar Games after a new
  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto Online
   </strong>
  </em>
  update makes the game completely unplayable on Valve's popular handheld device. The latest update to both
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  implemented a new anti-cheat system known as BattlEye, but the software is not compatible with devices running on Linux.

 <p>
  On September 17, Rockstar Games shocked fans when it released a highly-requested update for
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  . The surprise update, which came eleven years after the live-service title's release, added a new anti-cheat system called BattlEye. This is something that fans have been begging Rockstar to add for years, with the PC version of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  being rampant with hackers and cheaters. Unfortunately, the update hasn't gone down too well with Steam Deck users.

  Over on Reddit, users are slamming Rockstar for its lack of Linux support with the latest
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  update. Despite regularly being one of the most-played Steam Deck games,
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  is no longer compatible with Steam Deck, and fans aren't happy. While the title wasn't officially verified beforehand, it was marked as "playable" and ran perfectly fine on the platform. Now, however, due to BattlEye's lack of compatibility with Linux, fans will only be able to play
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  and not
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  While the official FAQ surrounding the new Grand Theft Auto Online update states that BattlEye is not supported on Steam Deck, some users are claiming that Rockstar is "lying" and are simply refusing to enable the system on Linux devices. Others were baffled as to why Rockstar is directing players to Valve when it's "literally Rockstar's fault the game doesn't work anymore." While fans are rightly disappointed by the lack of support, players will still be able to experience
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  's single-player campaign on Steam Deck.

 <p>
  As a result of Steam Deck users no longer being able to play
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  , the game's concurrent players have plummeted by 50% on Steam, according to Twitter user GTAOnlineNews. While it's likely that a large portion of these players were once on either Steam Deck or Linux devices, it's also possible that many of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  's modders and hackers are no longer playing due to the implementation of BattlEye.

  This isn't the first time that fans have been left frustrated by Rockstar, as a recent
  <em>

  update also removed popular content from the game. Fans of Hasta La Vista, an adversary mode that pitted two teams against each other in trucks and bicycles, were left disappointed after the developer removed the mode after just one week.

  Some weapons in

  </strong>
  can feel a tad iffy compared to others, and some players out there might question just why that is. Considering

  usually has two different types of weapons, with the more classic being a hitscan, and the more common being projectile-based. These weapon types can cause some confusion to players unfamiliar with these terms, so it’s best to explain each of them below.

 <p>
  For those asking what hitscan is in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  , they can find the answer here. Hitscan weapons have non-physical bullets that are fired from the weapon. This means that the bullets fired have no travel time or gravity to pull on, so aiming at a target and pulling the trigger will see that target take damage instantly if a weapon is aiming at them. In essence, a hitscan weapon requires players to point and shoot at their enemy to see damage dealt.

 <p>
  Hitscans were incredibly popular across shooter games because all players needed to do was aim and shoot with no calculations on whether or not players had to aim up to compensate for gravity. Hitscan weapons were common in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  up until Chapter 5, in which most, if not all weapons were replaced by bullet drop from projectile-based weapons. Players can still find hitscan weapons in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Reload, which has a more classic approach to gameplay.

 <p>
  The valid reasons that people preferred hitscan weapons came from the fact that bullet drop requires calculation, realism, and often unreliable exaggeration, whereas hitscan was a simplicity of point at a target and shoot them.

 <p>
  Projectile weapons fire a physical bullet that has gravity physics attached to it, meaning that the bullet fired has to be compensated for speed and travel distance before the bullet drops from the pull of gravity. Projectile weapons were in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  with Snipers and DMRs, but they have since been overhauled so that every weapon in Battle Royale is a projectile-based weapon.

 <p>
  This means that a bullet drop weapon shoots out projectiles that shoot actual bullets that have to travel to opponents, providing time to dodge or even miss despite aiming at them since players will need to adjust their aim based on distance. Projectile weapons dominate
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Battle Royale as a more modern and realistic way to play.

  Building bases is a core part of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  experience. Players will usually start with small houses, but as they progress through the game, they'll need to expand their homes to support the myriad of crafting stations and implements they need to become stronger.

 <p>
  Given how
  <em>
   Once Human's
  </em>
  servers reset at the start of every new scenario, players will want to save blueprints of their bases in order to save time. Thankfully, this process is very easy to do, and assuming you have all the resources you need, placing a fully-built endgame mansion will be as easy as clicking a few buttons.

  Players can save a blueprint of their currently-built house by

   entering Build mode and opening the build menu with the Right Mouse Button

  Everything within the white borders of your territory will be saved in the blueprint, including whatever's been added by people that you gave building permissions to in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . If you plan on expanding your base in the future, you can overwrite any saved blueprint or create a new one. We suggest doing the latter for the sake of seasonal resets. That way, you won't have to keep redesigning and rebuilding a low-tier base once you start over in a new scenario.

  Speaking of building permissions, as long as you've given someone permission to build on your territory, they'll also be able to
  <strong>
   save the base blueprint for themselves
  </strong>
  by following the same steps mentioned above. This means that members of a Hive or Warband in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  can all have the same base designs without having to manually copy each other's work, provided one member gives everyone permission to copy their house.

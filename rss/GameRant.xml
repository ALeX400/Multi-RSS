      Starfield System Designer Bruce Nesmith expects that Bethesda's latest game will get a sequel.
     </li>
     <li>
      Nesmith believes Starfield 2 will be a great game that will build on its predecessor's foundation.
     </li>
     <li>
      Bethesda is currently working on TES 6 and has already confirmed Fallout 5 will be its next project afterward. Starfield 2 hence isn't likely to arrive before the late 2030s at the earliest.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is likely to happen further down the road, according to former Bethesda developer Bruce Nesmith. What's more, the industry veteran has high hopes for the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  sequel.

 <p>
  Nesmith is a game designer who had two stints at Bethesda spanning more than 20 years combined. He worked on all the mainline
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  games since
  <em>
   Daggerfall
  </em>
  , as well as
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , among other projects. While he left Bethesda in 2021 to become a fantasy novel author, he still contributed to
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  as a system designer.

 <p>
  Nesmith reflected on Bethesda's latest game in a recent interview with VideoGamer, stating that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  is bound to serve as an excellent template for a future RPG. Elaborating on this train of thought, the former developer explained that first entries in any series tend to be rough around the edges while still showing "flashes of brilliance," thus serving as an important building block for any given franchise to really start hitting its stride later on. That's what he believes will be the case with
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  . "I'm looking forward to
  <em>
   Starfield 2
  </em>
  ," Nesmith said, adding that he expects it to be "one hell of a game."

  Starfield Took Longer To Develop Because It Was Made From Scratch
 </h2>
 <p>
  Further illustrating the subject of iterative development, the industry veteran noted how having
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  was a "tremendous advantage" while developing
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  , which, in turn, also benefited
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  . Had Bethesda instead been forced to start from scratch each and every time it was building another 3D fantasy RPG,
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  would have conceivably taken "two or three years" longer, Nesmith explained. Coincidentally,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  spent over seven years in development, significantly longer than Bethesda's other titles.

 <p>
  And while Nesmith acknowledged that fans had some complaints about
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , he anticipates that the game's eventual sequel will address a lot of these grievances. "It takes, sadly, sometimes a second or third version of the game in order to really enrich everything," he opined.

 <h3 id="starfield-2-likely-isn-39-t-happening-anytime-soon">
  Starfield 2 Likely Isn't Happening Anytime Soon
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although Nesmith thus appears to be fairly convinced that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  will get a sequel, the chances of that happening anytime soon are basically non-existent, at least if the idea is for that game to be handled internally. Namely,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  is currently in early development, and Bethesda is also presently working on post-launch
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  content, in addition to continuing to support
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  . Once
  <em>
   TES 6
  </em>
  is done circa 2029, the developer intends to start working on
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  , as previously confirmed by Bethesda Executive Producer Todd Howard. Assuming AAA development cycles don't get any longer in the meantime,
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  may hit the market circa 2034. Therefore, even if Bethesda were to tackle
  <em>
   Starfield 2
  </em>
  immediately afterward, that game would be unlikely to arrive until the late 2030s at the earliest.

      <title>As More Time Passes, One Hogwarts Legacy Feature Only Feels Stranger</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </em>
  </strong>
  has taken the established world of the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  franchise and expanded it. The game’s canon may take place a hundred years prior to the birth of the boy who lived, but it manages to create an engaging story despite the exclusion of the franchise’s titular character. Despite its strengths,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  isn’t without oddities.

  As a magical world, it makes complete sense for fantastical elements to occur in-game. After all, flying around on brooms in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  and seeing ghosts aren’t features found in the real world. Thinking too hard about magic in any franchise can leave a person’s head spinning, and
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is no exception.

 <p>
  But one inclusion, in particular, feels distinctly bizarre, and it isn’t an aspect of
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy

  ’s story or game mechanics. Rather, eyebrows are raised at an unassuming button featured in the game’s main menu.

 <p>
  The lack of DLC for
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  has been frustrating for fans of the game. Many have begged for new additions to gameplay, with features like Quidditch at the top of wish lists. This frustration is likely spurned by teasing from the game itself, for in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  ’s main menu is a button for “Additional Content”.

  Currently, the only DLC available for
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is the Dark Arts Pack. The pack’s measly inclusions are a Thestral Mount, a Dark Arts Cosmetic Set, and the Dark Arts Battle Arena. Many fans have noted that the gameplay included in the pack constitutes about twenty minutes in total. Retailing at $19.99, this small pack hardly counts as a true expansion to the game.

 <p>
  Additionally, players could initially only receive the Dark Arts Pack by pre-ordering
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  on PlayStation or by purchasing the game’s Deluxe Edition. For players who purchased
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  through these avenues, the Dark Arts Pack has not acted as additional content, but rather as part of the game with no distinct novelty.

  The “Additional Content” button is also featured in the main menu, regardless if a player owns the Dark Arts Pack. Players that don’t own the pack receive a pop-up advertising the pack and can view details about the minute amount of DLC. This makes the “Additional Content” button feel like false advertising and cements it as one of the oddest features in
  <em>

  .

 <p>
  Rumors of DLC and a Definitive Edition for
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  have been circulating and enticing fans. Not only would the DLC option in the game’s main menu serve a larger purpose if these rumors were true, but fans would finally be able to explore
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  ’s world further.

 <p>
  News of the alleged DLC and Definitive Edition are sourced from a leak by Insider Gaming. In the leak, Insider Gaming alleges that this new DLC will add ten to fifteen hours of additional gameplay content including “a new story quest, side quests, activities, and outfits.” No release date was given alongside this information, but the DLC and Definitive Edition will supposedly release sometime in 2025 and feature a price tag between $20 to $30.

 <p>
  Considering the vast amount of content reportedly included in the
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  DLC, one can assume that the “Additional Content” button will take players to a buy screen for the DLC or an advertisement, similar to the one for the Dark Arts Pack, upon release. This will not only give the button more functionality but promote the DLC further to fans who may not have known about its release.

 <p>
  Of course, time will only tell if Insider Gaming’s report of the new
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  DLC and Definitive Edition is accurate. Until an official announcement from Avalanche Software or Warner Bros., fans who have yet to purchase the game’s Dark Arts Pack can find out more about it by clicking the random “Additional Content” button on

  Honour Mode in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  elevates the gaming experience to a challenging level, ideal for those seeking a more intense adventure. With mechanics that increase difficulty, players face more powerful enemies along with strategic challenges that require careful planning at every step. This additional difficulty offers a more engaging and rewarding experience.

  One of the most notable features of Honour Mode is the possibility of permanently losing saves in case of a game over. This limitation imposes a constant risk and makes each decision more significant, increasing tension during battles and exploration. The real threat of failure makes progress even more rewarding for courageous adventurers.

 <p>
  For old-school players who enjoy the constant sense of danger that many classic isometric RPGs provided during exploration, Honour Mode in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  manages to revive that feeling. Thanks to the new mechanics added at this difficulty level, anything can be fatal.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Thus, players need to think carefully about every new step taken by the characters, from combats to dialogues, since a wrong decision can put all progress made in the run at risk. Moreover, danger lurks in various ways, making the entire journey more tense and matching the game's tone at certain moments.

 <p>
  One of the great highlights of Honour Mode in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  is the possibility of being creative, prompting players to think even more outside the box when planning their next steps. In combat, for example, they can use items that were not relevant at lower difficulties but are fundamental in the hardest mode.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":229} -->
 <p>
  Tactics to avoid combat, especially when the group has already spent most resources like spell slots and potions, also open space for creativity, making players interact with
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  differently. Thus, Honour Mode encourages creative thinking, leading players to constantly seek new tactics.

 <p>
  Based on
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e
  </em>
  rules,
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  offers extensive character customization, especially in classes and the possibility of combining them to create different builds. Therefore, Honour Mode is the perfect setting to put their power to the test.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":133} -->
 <p>
  Unlike the normal difficulty, where extensive character optimization isn't necessary, here players are motivated to find better synergy between classes and abilities, creating various unconventional builds. Combinations that seem strange at first, like mixing Barbarian with Warlock, can prove effective and result in powerful combos.

  In lower difficulties, there is no shortage of resources to revive fallen characters after tough battles, such as resurrection scrolls and the option to talk to Withers during camp. However, although these resources exist in Honour Mode, the consequences are worse.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":973} -->

 <p>
  For example, if the entire party dies at any moment in the game's highest difficulty, it means game over, confronting players with the option to start over or lower the difficulty. Thus, Honour Mode values greater realism, where players need to cherish a character's life and choose their challenges wisely.

  One of
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3'
  </em>
  s strong points is its narrative, and attempting a run in Honour Mode is an opportunity to revisit iconic characters created by Larian and experience new choices. Meet again these characters and exploring their complex motivations makes the experience even more engaging, deepening the emotional impact of each moment.

  The game features many epic boss battles that, even on normal difficulties, offer an intense challenge. However, these encounters reach a new level in Honour Mode, becoming a true test of strategy.

 <p>
  Many bosses gain access to Legendary Actions, abilities that activate under specific conditions and can completely change the flow of combat. This forces players to be more cautious during these moments, as, for example, the Owlbear mother can summon the father, making the fight even more difficult.

  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  is a vast game, and no matter how much players explore the map, some areas might remain untouched due to its sheer size. Honuor Mode, however, encourages thorough exploration of every region. Every resource gained along the journey is of extreme importance.

 <p>
  Before major confrontations, it is necessary for players to obtain as much experience as possible to access new abilities or attacks that will make a significant difference during fights. Additionally, complete exploration can reveal secrets or characters not seen in other difficulties.

  Given the nature of Honour Mode, which allows only a single save slot and forces a restart or difficulty reduction upon total party defeat, mastering game mechanics is essential. This includes not only devising optimal strategies but also analyzing and understanding mistakes to avoid them in future runs.

  Sometimes, characters will face options they would prefer to avoid but that lead to easier combats at that point in the game. Consequently, every event holds more weight, leading players to reflect more carefully before taking the next step.

  Mastering
  <strong>
   <em>
    TCG Card Shop Simulator
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes some time. Early on, it is all too easy to make simple mistakes like overstocking items or hiring slow-moving staff members. Thankfully, one thing that is relatively easy during the early stages of the game is selecting which units to purchase. This is because the player is limited as to what units are available. That said, as they progress and begin unlocking new units, the player will need to start making decisions as to which units they want to have displaying their stock.

  The small metal rack is great on a number of levels. While it holds slightly less than the single-sided shelf, it is $100.00 cheaper to buy. Also, these units look pretty nice when placed at the end of an aisle.
  <strong>
   They hold up to 32 items on each shelf and have a total of 5 shelves
  </strong>
  . They work well when placed against the wall, and they also work well when placed back to back with another small metal rack.

 <p>
  These units are very cost-effective, making them great early-game investments. Also, since they aren't as wide as single-sided shelves, small metal racks don't require as much space as their larger counterparts.

  This is the first unit that players will have in their store.
  <strong>
   It has a total of 6 shelves, can be placed flush against a wall, and each shelf can hold up to 32 packs of cards.
  </strong>
  While these units can be placed back to back, it is much more beneficial to use double-sided shelves or wide units when creating central aisles.

 <p>
  Typically, players will have quite a few of these units that run along the walls of their store. At the time of writing, there aren't any decorative wall items in the game, so players instead dedicate all their wall space to units like the single-sided shelf. But overall, these units are a great way to make money.

  <strong>
   Card tables are hugely profitable units that players should definitely invest in.
  </strong>
  A bit part of the game involves the player opening packs of cards. Should they pack anything particularly valuable, they may want to consider selling it to a customer, especially if the valuable card is a duplicate. While card tables can be fairly time-consuming units to manage, since employees can't stock them, they are more than worth the effort due to how much money they can generate.

  Double-sided shelves have considerably more storage space than single-sided ones. Not only can both sides be used to display stock, but
  <strong>
   it has a total of 4 usable shelves as opposed to the 3 shelves that the single-sided units have.
  </strong>
  These are great for creating early to mid-game aisles. Due to how scent machines work, double-sided shelving units are great for herding smelly customers, so they are guaranteed to get 'des-stinked' as they enter the player's store. Similar to the single-sided shelf, double-sided units can hold up to 32 packs of cards on each shelf, which is a decent amount.

  As the player gets further into the game, they'll begin to expand their store. Each expansion brings in more customers. It will quickly get to the point where ordering stock day by day just won't be enough to keep the shelves full.
  <strong>
   Big warehouse shelves are great for keeping a stockpile of items
  </strong>
  that employees can use to constantly keep shelves topped up.

 <p>
  A lot of players opt to use shop B as a storage room. This is a good idea as it keeps the store and the storage room separate. Also, if the player organizes a few big warehouse shelves, then they can use these units to work out which items they need to purchase. Without these units, players will need to go shelf by shelf to work out what they need to buy.

  These units won't bring in any money, but they sure look cool. Since they aren't very tall,
  <strong>
   they are great for building barriers that guide customers to certain areas
  </strong>
  while also offering the player great visibility across their store.

 <p>
  Showing off rare and valuable cards is something that most card collectors get some satisfaction from. Keeping valuable cards hidden away in a binder isn't as exciting as showing them off for all to see. These are great for creating customer que systems as customers will form a line around them instead of creating a snake-like line by the register.

  This unit won't make players money in the conventional sense, but it will make employees more efficient. When the game was first released, the only available trash bin was fixed in place outside the store. While that trash bin is still there, players can now purchase bins that can be moved. If the player puts down one of these next to their storage area, then employees won't need to go outside every time they need to throw away an empty box.
  <strong>
   This helps to make employees more efficient,
  </strong>
  thus making the player more money, since there is less chance of the shelves running bare.

  Dealing with stinky customers is something that the player will need to do on a daily basis.
  <strong>
   Stinky customers actively put off other customers,
  </strong>
  which may end up with some customers walking out of the store without making a purchase and possibly even leaving a bad review. Auto Scent units 'de-stink' smelly customers, creating a better shopping experience for everyone. This isn't the only scent unit that players can buy, but it is the most cost-efficient one.

  The small unit holds two cans of cleaner while this unit holds four. While the large unit holds up to eight cans of cleaner, it is considerably more expensive than the G500. If the player invests in two of the G500 units and places them by the door, very few stinky customers will be able to make their way in and stink up the store.

  The wide shelf is by far the best unit in the game.
  <strong>
   It can hold much more stock than all other units in the game.
  </strong>
  For example, by default, players can only place a maximum of two Mafia Works board games on a shelf. The wide shelf can hold six boxes. This is great because of how customer purchasing works. When a customer decides to purchase something from a shelf, they'll select a random number between one and however many items are on said shelf. If there are more items on the shelf, then the customer has a higher chance of spending more money.

  The spiritual, imaginative worlds of games such as
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  , the Oddworld series, and titles such as
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  often provide some of the most creative and experimental experiences in the industry. When it comes to indie games, experimentation is in abundance, and this often leads to other-worldly experiences that immerse players in strange, at times spiritual settings.

  Games such as
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  feature immersive spaces for players to explore, with other-worldly aspects such as time travel, alien creatures, and fictional planets. On the other hand, games such as
  <em>
   Kentucky Route Zero
  </em>
  harness magical realism to submerge players in a surreal world.

  <em>
   <em>
    Rain World

  is a wholly immersive 2D survival game that tasks players with exploring a vast, harsh, and truly unforgiving world. The game puts players in the role of the fictional “slugcat,” hunted by a variety of vicious predators and just as prone to the danger of the titular rain.

  This brutal tale of survival is told across hauntingly beautiful landscapes rife with rundown, industrial architecture and a variety of overgrown regions. By depriving the player of information,
  <em>
   Rain World
  </em>
  keeps its setting mysterious, and the vague and somewhat subtle nature of its narrative only adds to its other-worldly atmosphere. It's the visuals and the imaginative designs of
  <em>
   Rain World's
  </em>
  inhabitants, however, that really sell its distinctive world.

  <em>
   HROT
  </em>
  takes place in the relatively grounded setting of 1980s Czechoslovakia after an unspecified disaster, but as a game it's layered with a dark sense of whimsy and layers of surrealism that provide an otherworldly atmosphere to its brown, rainy environments. For fans of 90s shooters such as
  <em>
   Quake
  </em>
  and downtrodden, quiet atmospheres,
  <em>
   HROT
  </em>
  is a veritable gold mine.

  <em>
   HROT's
  </em>
  gameplay is a relatively simple loop that will be immediately familiar to any fan of old-school first-person shooters; blast through enemies while collecting keys to open doors and progress through the level, gathering health and ammo pickups along the way in order to stay alive. While
  <em>
   HROT's
  </em>
  gunplay is far from perfect, the other-worldly atmosphere, facilitated by a surrealist world and highlighted by the game's dark humor, propels players through the angular architecture of its drizzly missions.

  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  may be an RPG, but the city of Revachol is its heart and soul. Interacting with its diverse ensemble of characters and exploring the possibilities of its painterly world are where the game's strengths lie, and while some of its themes may be more grounded,
  <em>
   Disco Elysium's
  </em>
  heightened reality provides the perfect playground for an RPG.

  From the alien nature of the player's homeworld, to the broad variety of environments across the game's solar system, to the never-ending
  <em>
   Groundhog Day
  </em>
  loop that it traps its players in,
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  is a truly otherworldly experience that's almost spiritual in essence. The heartwarming characters, unknown dangers of the solar system, and wholly comforting music result in a game that feels, at times, like a warm blanket.

 <p>
  <em>
   Outer Wilds'
  </em>
  lack of hand-holding and refusal to give the player much if any direction results in gameplay that's refreshingly freeing, championing player agency by allowing them to explore at their own pace. This also assists in facilitating a sense of wonder, as the world is presented to the player as a space of opportunity, a space in which each discovery is truly the player's own.

  Rusted caverns, expansive desert, ruined cities, strange nomads, magical cats, the science-fantasy world of
  <em>
   Caves Of Qud
  </em>
  is a tremendous place to be; players could spend hours exploring its many nooks and crannies, traversing its vast expanses, meeting its quirky characters, immersing themselves in its culture. From banana groves to the rotted, rusted dungeon of Golgotha, the evocative locations are just one piece of
  <em>
   Caves Of Qud's
  </em>
  otherworldly atmosphere.

  The strange, almost alien soundtrack provides a fitting backdrop, intensifying the tone and more than making up for the game's minimalist visuals by sparking the imagination. The writing is also otherworldly in nature, highlighting the weird and wonderful intricacies of the world and its characters through nuance and a subtle sense of humor.

  is short. Incredibly short. However, players shouldn't let that deter them from experiencing this one-of-a-kind title, as its surreal, otherworldly tone and thick, foggy atmosphere is unnerving in the best of ways. Swinging to-and-fro from tranquil to disconcerting with violent whiplash,
  <em>
   Paratopic

  is a wild, experimental ride with little gameplay but plenty of interesting ideas and visuals.

  This low-budget indie title is essentially a walking simulator, though it encourages multiple playthroughs with its subtle storytelling, which ensures players are likely to miss details the first time around. Fans of grungy, low-poly visuals, experimental stories, and gameplay-light experiences should certainly consider at least one playthrough, especially considering the affordable price.

  Most fans of video games will naturally expect gameplay to be present in the titles they purchase, and while
  <em>
   Kentucky Route Zero
  </em>
  does technically meet this requirement, it's clear that the developers created
  <em>
   Kentucky Route Zero
  </em>
  with more atmosphere, narrative, and pure feeling in mind than anything else. Fans of experimental narratives, quiet, contemplative atmospheres, slow-paced gameplay, and the vague and unhinged style of David Lynch's work are sure to enjoy this mellow title.

  <em>
   Kentucky Route Zero
  </em>
  is a bittersweet, surrealist dreamscape that's at times grounded and full of heart, other times utterly strange and deeply bizarre. The game's narrative twists and turns, sometimes bordering on insanity, provide moments of emotional warmth while remaining unafraid to unsettle the audience. The slow, even plodding plot leaves so much room for the story and its characters to breathe that, if players allow themselves to sink into its otherworldly setting, it's all too easy to get lost.

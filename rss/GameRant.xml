  The world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Clair Obscur
   </em>
   <em>
    : Expedition 33
   </em>
  </strong>
  opens up considerably once players reach the third and final act. Here, fans will finally have access to the full map, and can therefore go at their own pace when pursuing the final act's relatively straightforward main goal. Furthermore, players are free to keep playing after the credits roll, meaning that it's never too late to experience any of the game's robust side content.
 </p>
 <p>
  That said, there are quite a few side goals that are well worth taking on before proceeding to the final battle. Some of these will help bolster players for the final battle, while others are important for story reasons. Here are
  <strong>
   eight objectives players should be sure to give themselves before facing the final boss of
   <em>
    Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

  Players can actually gain access to Frozen Hearts relatively early in Act 2. A friendly Grandis will even offer the party a quest to venture there and retrieve a valuable resource. Players who take the Grandis up on that offer, however, will find themselves severely outmatched. Frozen Hearts is a deadly endgame area, and it's full of dangerous elemental foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans who return to Frozen Hearts in Act 3 will be richly rewarded. The region is full of powerful and valuable Pictos and deadly weapons, as well as some of the best outfits in the game. Helping this Grandis with their creation by taking on the towering boss of Frozen Hearts is a very valuable way for players to spend their time in Act 3.

  Endless Night Sanctuary is an easy location to miss, even once players have access to the full suite of traversal abilities in Act 3. This small, dark area is hidden away in a remote corner of the map, and even if players go straight there from the beginning of Act 3, they might not be prepared to handle it. This region is crawling with extremely powerful versions of the Sakapatate foes that players faced all the way back in Act 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once the Expedition is beefy enough to take it on, however, Endless Night Sanctuary is well worth a visit. There are some extremely valuable pickups to acquire here, and the location also offers a shocking look at the dark past of the Gestral people. Everything in
  <em>
   Clair Obscur
  </em>
  holds hidden depths, and these funny paintbrush people are no different.

  This bizarrely-shaped creature can be found wandering the waves as early as Act 2, and players can take it on as soon as they see it. Odds are they'll have to wait a while if they want to have any hope of defeating the creature, however. This potent field boss has an array of powerful laser attacks to complement its already formidable fists, and it can easily cut down an underleveled party in just one or two turns.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once players have had some time in Act 3 to upgrade their gear and get some new powerful Pictos, however, they can take Sprong on and win. This is well worth doing before taking on the final boss, as Sprong holds one of the most potent Pictos in the game. The

  The Canvas is a humble little airborne locale that players can reach as soon as Act 3 begins. There are no enemies to contend with and no particularly powerful items to be found there, but it's still worth a visit. The location contains a striking portrait of the Dessendre family, who are at the center of the drama and tragedy surrounding
  <em>
   Clair Obscur
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Once players recover this portrait, they can bring it to the Manor in order to unlock the painting room at the back. This room contains some valuable goods, but it also serves as a deeply symbolic act when compared to the events of the game. Players who are invested in the lives and stories of the characters should make time to complete this gesture before they finish the game.

  Fans who are interested in learning more about the mysterious White Nevrons who've appeared throughout the game should make time to visit the Fountain once they make it to Act 3. The NPC there has a lot to reveal about the nature of these creatures and the origin of Nevrons in general. Depending on how the player has interacted with these creatures throughout the game, the NPC might even have a considerable reward for them.

  Players who've done right by the White Nevrons they've encountered can get a tremendous bounty of

  The enigmatic Manor is a constant presence throughout
  <em>
   Clair Obscur
  </em>
  . Players can find mysterious doors to this strange locale scattered throughout the world, cropping up everywhere from the Gestral village to the heart of a dangerous, Nevron-infested dungeon. Each door will take the Expedition into a different room in the sprawling estate, permitting players access to different treasures and additional information regarding the Manor's strange owners.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the time Act 3 rolls around, players will have considerably more context for what the Manor is and what significance it holds for the protagonists. With the entirety of the map now accessible, players should make it a point to find every hidden door and unlock every room in the Manor. Opening all the doors will give the player a variety of valuable resources and insight into the family at the heart of the drama.

  Throughout the first two acts of
  <em>
   Clair Obscur
  </em>
  , players have had a hard cap of 9,999 damage on all of their attacks. Particularly powerful multi-hit attacks can technically circumvent this by dealing 9,999 damage multiple times, but the limit remains. This limit is removed at the end of Act 2, when players automatically unlock the

  Pictos. Characters equipped with this power-up have no roof on the amount of damage they can deal, theoretically sending it into the millions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between the sheer, undeniable power of this Pictos and the extreme power of many of the enemies and bosses in Act 3, unlocking it for everyone in the group should be a top priority for all players. Luckily, like with every other Pictos, the character holding it just needs to win four battles with it to unlock the Lumina for everyone else. At a cost of only 5 points, there's no excuse not to give Painted Power to everyone in the party.

  One of the first things players should do upon starting Act 3 is talk to all the party members at camp. If fans have been on track with Verso's relationship levels throughout Act 2, they should be ready to start maxing out some of those bonds. This is vital, not only to get closure on the characters' story arcs, but to unlock powerful new moves and resources to make use of in combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the characters in the group will require fans to go on side quests throughout the world in order to max them out. Given the steep difficulty spike players are likely to encounter in Act 3, completing these side quests is an excellent way to get some much-needed XP and prepare for the steeper challenges ahead. Pursuing these relationships will also unlock powerful new Gradient attacks for each party member to use if they want to turn the tides in a difficult battle.

  These new pets include the Wasp, Tarantula Hawk, Moth, Butterfly, and Disco Bee. Some offer abilities similar to the Queen Bee (perfect if you haven’t unlocked her yet), while others can trigger special mutations. This guide will cover how to get the Bizzy Bear pets and what each one does in

 <p>
  To get the Bizzy Bear pets in
  <em>
   Grow a Garden
  </em>
  , you’ll need to open Anti Bee Eggs. These eggs can be crafted by the Bizzy Bear NPC, which is found on the right side of the Bee Swarm event platform. Just bring him jars of honey and weighted pollinated fruits (as listed on the barrels nearby), and he’ll craft the eggs for you as you progress through his event questline.
 </p>
 <p>
  Completing the full Bizzy Bear Crafter quest once will reward you with
  <strong>
   four Anti Bee Eggs
  </strong>
  . You can retake the quest to earn more. If you’d rather skip it, you can also buy Anti Bee Eggs directly from the
  <strong>
   Game Shop
  </strong>
  : one for 149 Robux, three for 429 Robux, or ten for 1,269 Robux. Each egg is chance-based, meaning you’ll get one random pet per roll, with some bugs having a higher drop rate than others.

  Once planted, the Anti Bee Egg from the Bizzy Bear takes around
  <strong>
   four hours and 10 minutes
  </strong>
  to hatch. You can shorten the timer by using pets like the Chicken, Rooster, or Kiwi.

  The pets introduced in the 1.09.0 update are incredibly useful. Wasp and Tarantula Hawk share the same traits as the Queen Bee, while Moth helps pets grow faster, just like Brown Mouse and Owl. On top of that, Butterfly and Disco Bee can apply Rainbow and Disco mutations. Here’s a quick overview of what each pet can do:

It only targets crops with five or more mutations, removes all of them, and turns the crop into a Rainbow variant, which means you might lose some valuable combos. However, if you favorite those plants, the Butterfly will skip them and choose another one instead.

      <title>Minecraft Could Go Sky-High After Its Caves &amp; Cliffs, Vibrant Visuals Updates</title>

 <p>
  As Mojang continues improving the realism of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Minecraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  through updates, experimental snapshots, and content drops, various changes ranging from cloud designs to world generation could inspire new features that could help the game reach new heights. While it has since been revealed that Vibrant Visuals will now be included in Mojang's larger Chase the Skies drop alongside the likes of Happy Ghasts and player locator bars, there could be some hidden potential in a few of its smaller changes to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . More specifically, a recent update to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's clouds and ambient fog could be a step closer to Mojang overhauling the game's mountaineering mechanics.
 </p>

 <p>
  Though there aren't any features that are directly attributed to mountain-climbing in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , there are an increasing number of in-game mechanics that seem to indicate its potential nevertheless. For instance, both halves of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's Caves &amp; Cliffs update appeared to lay significant groundwork for future mountaineering features, such as changes in world generation, powder snow, and mountain biomes. With even newer updates introducing more changes like reworking clouds to exploring biome temperatures, Mojang could seize the opportunity to finally bring these scattered features together and experiment with
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's underutilized mountainous environments.

  Whether Mojang intended to or not, there has been a growing trend in previous and upcoming
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  updates where a few features have gradually fleshed out the game's mountaineering potential. While such changes could date back further to older updates, it arguably started with the overhaul of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's world generation during Caves &amp; Cliffs' second part, leading to even taller mountains and even deeper caves. However, though later updates like The Wild would capitalize on the Overworld's newfound depth with new underground biomes and structures, there didn't seem to be any similar exploration of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's equally new heights.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note" data-nosnippet="">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_6">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     These same updates seemed to at least continue making small additions and changes geared towards mountain-climbing in
     <em>
      Minecraft
     </em>
     , such as the mechanics behind powdered snow and leather boots, or new temperature-based mob variants.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  The latest Vibrant Visuals and Chase the Skies drops appear to do the same by changing
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's cloud designs, overhauling one of the game's most basic and unassuming mechanics to improve their realism. Therefore, should Mojang continue refining
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's existing gameplay by embracing and enhancing overlooked features, its next step could be to officially introduce mountaineering to the game.
 </p>
 <h3 id="minecraft-39-s-world-generation-and-cloud-changes-are-perfect-together">
  Minecraft's World Generation and Cloud Changes Are Perfect Together
 </h3>
 <p>
  Between
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's older update to world generation and its latest change to clouds, as well as the various changes and features listed below, there is a strong case to be made for in-game mountaineering:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   World height increases to y=320.
  </li>
  <li>
   Potential temperature mechanics influenced by mob variants and freezing in powered snow.
  </li>
  <li>
   New uses for leather armor linked to powered snow.
  </li>
  <li>
   Cloud changes that emphasize in-game altitude.
  </li>
  <li>
   Easier access to flying with mountable Happy Ghasts and Elytra.
  </li>
  <li>
   Potential altitude-based rework of air and breathing mechanics.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As the newest features in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's Chase the Skies greatly expand the player's ability to fly, it seems that Mojang is actively incentivizing players to explore the game's skies, enabled further by the combination of its new world generation and clouds. Therefore, in light of these changes, it might finally be time for Mojang to consider mountaineering mechanics in order to maintain the balance between
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's gameplay and progression.
 </p>
 <h3 id="minecraft-could-embrace-mountaineering-in-future-updates">
  Minecraft Could Embrace Mountaineering in Future Updates
 </h3>
 <p>
  For instance, with flight more readily accessible thanks to Happy Ghast mounts, Mojang could ensure the feature isn't exploited by adding gradual breathing and freezing damage at higher altitudes, requiring players to wear leather armor or Respiration-enhanced helmets. But to better balance the risks and requirements of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's potential mountain-climbing, players could be aided and rewarded when mountaineering with new features and mechanics like the examples below.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Anchors that combine with leashes to prevent players or mobs from falling.
  </li>
  <li>
   Waypoints that appear on maps or the player locator bar.
  </li>
  <li>
   Enchantments that increase speed on snow or ice, prevent sliding on ice, or prevent freezing.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mountain-based structures with loot, like forts, camps, or temples.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While adding new limits and challenges to a player's ability to traverse the Overworld could receive some pushback, it could be an inevitable step in Mojang's push for realism that balances its recent updates and taps into
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  's mountaineering potential.

     Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. You can survive the night or build a work of art – the choice is all yours. But if the thought of exploring a vast new world all on your own feels overwhelming, then fear not!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Minecraft has no set goal and can be played however you’d like! This is why it’s sometimes called a “sandbox game” – there are lots of things for you to do, and lots of ways that you can play. If you like being creative, then you can use the blocks to build things from your imagination. If you’re feeling brave, you can explore the world and face daring challenges. Blocks can be broken, crafted, placed to reshape the landscape, or used to build fantastical creations.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Creatures can be battled or befriended, depending on how you play. The world of Minecraft allows for epic adventures, quiet meditations, and everything in between. You can even share your creations with other players, or play in community worlds!

      <title>Nintendo Switch 2 is Getting a YouTube App ‘Soon’</title>

    <ul>
     <li>
      YouTube app support is coming soon to Nintendo Switch 2, according to a report.
     </li>
     <li>
      Switch 2 reportedly sold over 3 million units globally in 24 hours.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch 2
  </strong>
  will soon get YouTube app support, according to a response from the video-sharing giant on social media. Although the YouTube app for the original Switch is not supported on the new Switch 2 console, the company stated that it is working with Nintendo to ensure the service is available on the new hardware soon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The news came just days after the Switch 2's long-awaited release. Headlined by launch titles like
  <em>
   Mario Kart World
  </em>
  and enhancements to original Switch games like
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , the Switch 2's hardware is a marked improvement over its predecessor. Within the first 24 hours, reports claimed that the Switch 2 sold over 3 million units globally, which would break the record for the fastest-selling video game console in history if the numbers are correct. Although the Switch 2 stock remains in a state of flux, Nintendo is working with retailers like Walmart and GameStop to ensure consoles and accessories will be available.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the original Switch and the Switch 2 have some key differences on the hardware side, the new console currently does not support the YouTube app. As reported by GameSpot, the TeamYouTube Twitter feed responded to a post from a user named Amir1_0, who requested that Google's video app be on the Switch 2. Google replied that both YouTube and Nintendo are working to make the popular video-sharing app available on the Switch 2 soon, though the tech giant did not give a precise date for when that would happen. However, it remains unclear why the original Switch version of the YouTube app is not supported on the Switch 2, despite the new console offering backward compatibility with the majority of Switch software. In the meantime, users who still have their original Switch system can still use it to access YouTube and other games that are unsupported by the Switch 2, including
  <em>
   Ring Fit Adventure
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Nintendo Labo
  </em>
  play kits.

  Nintendo and Google Are Working to Get YouTube on the Switch 2
 </h2>
 <p>
  The eventual addition of the Switch 2 to YouTube's list of supported devices came at a strange time for the video service. Starting June 30, YouTube Premium Lite subscribers will see additional ads appear on Shorts alongside music content, though most videos will remain ad-free as part of the $7.99 monthly subscription. Along with YouTube's ongoing crackdown on ad-blocking browser extensions, users have expressed their displeasure over the pending changes.

 <p>
  While the Switch 2's launch lineup might not be as strong as other consoles, the additional hardware improvements compared to the previous Nintendo system could make it worth considering. It remains to be seen when YouTube will be up and running on the Switch 2.

      <title>Deadpool VR Beats the MCU to the Punch on One Villain</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/marvels-deadpool-vr-mephisto-villain-missing-mcu/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  While the announcement of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Deadpool VR
   </strong>
  </em>
  at this year's Summer Games Fest marks the character's first solo game in over a decade, its inclusion of a highly sought-after villain may have also one-upped the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the process. With the superhero genre of gaming still going strong despite the potential fatigue of its movie counterparts, Marvel has succeeded in diversifying its games with the likes of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Marvel's Midnight Suns
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Marvel's
  </em>
  <em>
   Guardians of the Galaxy.
  </em>
  Now, in addition to other projects, like
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra and
  </em>
  <em>
   Marvel's Wolverine
  </em>
  , the Meta Quest-exclusive
  <em>
   Marvel's Deadpool VR
  </em>
  is set to continue this trend.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->

 <p>
  Despite arguably being as popular as Marvel's own Spider-Man, Deadpool has only featured as the sole lead protagonist once before, with High Moon Studios'
  <em>
   Deadpool
  </em>
  in 2013. Yet while
  <em>
   Deadpool VR
  </em>
  might have broken the mold and given the titular character a second chance to lead, the upcoming VR game has simultaneously broken a long-running trend within the MCU. After years of fan theories, unofficial rumors, and even a few close calls,
  <em>
   Deadpool VR
  </em>
  joins an ever-growing list of games that beat the MCU to the punch by featuring the iconic Marvel supervillain, Mephisto.

 <p>
  Though their roles have typically been small, superficial, or secondary, both Deadpool and Mephisto have appeared in a significant number of games over the years, such as those listed below.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Marvel: Future Fight
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Marvel Contest of Champions
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Marvel's Midnight Suns
   </em>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As a result, except for High Moon Studios'
  <em>
   Deadpool
  </em>
  , the two characters appear to have ultimately been sidelined in favor of Marvel's more marketable gaming IPs, like Insomniac Games'
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  series or Crystal Dynamics'
  <em>
   Marvel's Avengers
  </em>
  . However, while the MCU has since welcomed Deadpool due to his big-screen success and fan demand, the same can't be said for Mephisto.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the fan-driven lucky break Deadpool got when test footage leaked online, the same demand hasn't helped Mephisto make his MCU debut despite ongoing rumors of the character's involvement in
  <em>
   Agatha All Along
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  or the next
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  film. Even as recently as
  <em>
   Deadpool &amp; Wolverine
  </em>
  , the character's third movie and his first officially within the MCU, director Shawn Levy claimed that Mephisto had been considered as the film's main antagonist before Cassandra Nova. But while Deadpool's and Mephisto's positions might be uncertain within the MCU,
  <em>
   Deadpool VR
  </em>
  doesn't seem to hold back with these characters.
 </p>
 <h3 id="exploring-how-mephisto-might-fit-into-deadpool-vr">
  Exploring How Mephisto Might Fit Into Deadpool VR
 </h3>
 <p>
  As one of Marvel's most notable and powerful villains, Mephisto could be likened to the MCU's Avengers-level threats, such as Ultron, Thanos, or Doctor Doom. Therefore, given that the trailer provided only a small insight into the upcoming game, it seems likely that Mephisto will play a key role in
  <em>
   Deadpool VR
  </em>
  as one of its main antagonists. However, with the likes of Hydra, the Hand, and Omega Red also confirmed to be in
  <em>
   Deadpool VR
  </em>
  , there is a risk that Mephisto's role will be scaled back alongside these other villains, regardless of how notorious, powerful, or popular he is as a character.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the added context that VR is still a niche for gaming and Deadpool's comics focus on dark humor and breaking the fourth wall, it does seem more likely that
  <em>
   Deadpool VR
  </em>
  might take a lighter approach to characters like Mephisto. Moreover, as the only available comparison, Camouflaj's
  <em>
   Iron Man VR
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  included a range of prominent Marvel villains in smaller roles, such as Ghost, Living Laser, and AIM. Provided it can learn the lessons from the original
  <em>
   Deadpool
  </em>
  game,
  <em>
   Iron Man VR
  </em>
  , and even the MCU itself,
  <em>
   Deadpool VR
  </em>
  has the opportunity to give Mephisto a chance to shine as its antagonist.

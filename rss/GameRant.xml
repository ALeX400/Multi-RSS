      <title>Why Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal Are Mostly Absent From Game Freak Leaks</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/pokemon-gold-silver-crystal-gen-2-teraleak-leaks-absent-why/</link>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  recently suffered one of the largest leaks in gaming history, in an event now known as the Teraleak. This leak was sourced from Game Freak directly, and included more than a Terabyte of the company's data, leading to it being named as such. This massive leak included never-before-seen information about nearly every game in the series. With that in mind, it's only natural to seek out information about even the earliest
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games.

  Unfortunately for fans of these classic games, there's hardly an equal distribution of information within the Teraleak. Thanks to this distinction, one can only assume that the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series has become much more extensively documented over time.
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal
  </em>
  are not exceptions to this phenomenon, as the Teraleak hasn't yet produced the major revelations that fans may expect or hope for. However, the reason for Generation 2's exclusion comes with an even more pressing implication.

  Pokemon's Massive Leak Hasn't Been Equal to Every Generation
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Teraleak has been largely distributed by a user known online as Centro Leaks. Those interested in sifting through the Teraleak directly can currently access Centro Leaks' pinned Tweet for an archive of the information they have posted so far. Unfortunately, doing so will begin to reveal some bad news for fans of Generation 2.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":177} -->
 <p>
  The Teraleak Archive posted by Centro Leaks places a heavy emphasis on the subjects that might interest fans most. For example, there is a significant section dedicated to unreleased Pokemon, as well as some beta designs of the Pokemon that escaped the cutting room floor. As fans of
  <em>
   Gold, Silver, and Crystal
  </em>
  will likely notice, the games in question are simply not included in this section. Instead, the section dedicated to cut content begins with Generation 3 and proceeds onward to every game since.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The primary Teraleak archive simply does not prominently include any information about Generation 2's cut content. There have been plenty of other revelations, such as the character biographies included in
  <em>
   Pokemon Black and White
  </em>
  leaks, but Generation 2 seems relatively sparse in that regard as well. This may be understandably disappointing for fans of the games who may have been hoping for any kind of juicy secret. Thankfully, there is a good reason that the Teraleak doesn't seem to do much for fans of
  <em>
   Gold and Silver
  </em>
  .

  The History of Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal Leaks Explained

 <p>
  Generation 2's general absence from the Teraleak can be chalked up to one reason that is equal parts ironic and painfully obvious.
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal
  </em>
  have already been leaked in the past, and to a similarly great extent as those now seen in the Teraleak. In fact, it's unlikely that the Teraleak could have revealed any information about the Johto Region that isn't already known.

 <p>
  Those interested can still view
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  's leaked source code, which was first unearthed in April 2020, and revealed plenty of assets from the development stage.
  <em>
   Gold and Silver
  </em>
  leaks revealed a great deal of rebalancing done to some Pokemon's stats, as well as a number of unused maps. It's not hard to imagine why content like this was eventually cut, considering the final game was already stuffed to the brim with content.

 <p>
  On the topic of unreleased Pokemon, other leaks have unearthed this much as well. Norowara is a Gen 2 stand-out among famous unreleased Pokemon. The cursed doll isn't alone, either, as some early builds of the game have been known to contain obscure designs that were scrapped late into development.

 <p>
  Considering there is very little new information about
  <em>
   Gold and Silver
  </em>
  in a breach as large as the Teraleak carries a pretty significant implication. As far as
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  are concerned, it is safe to say that fans of the game may not be able to look forward to any more major reveals in the future. On the flip side of this,
  <em>

  fans can still enjoy combing through the mass of information that already exists about Generation 2, and the countless other

  leaks circulating thanks to the Teraleak.

 <p>
  One of the most integral parts of Treyarch’s
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  titles isn’t just their exciting multiplayer or their espionage thriller campaigns, but their famed Zombies mode that has been with the franchise since
  <em>
   Call of Duty: World at War
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  is iconic, and every new Treyarch title has players cautious and excited about what the team is cooking up next.

 <p>
  With the release of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , there are now a variety of Treyarch Zombies modes, each with their own unique draws in terms of maps, stories, gameplay, and more. While not every
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  mode can reach the top spot, there are redeeming qualities about every
  <em>
   Black Ops Zombies
  </em>
  mode worthy of discussion.

 <p>
  The conclusion of
  <em>
   Black Ops 4
  </em>
  was a low point for the Zombies community, but there was optimism surrounding the rebirth of the mode that they have loved for over a decade. With
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  , the support for Zombies first saw a remake of Nacht der Toten with Die Maschine. The gameplay loop itself was fine, but perhaps far too casual and easy for anyone outside of desiring a casual game to enjoy.

  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  felt, in some places, like Warzone with zombies. Weapons were powerful, and zombies were weak, and there wasn’t much of a sense of survival. The maps were big and spacious, which made their environments and atmosphere somewhat absent. Also absent from
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  was an immersive story without a dedicated crew, which led to the maps missing a core element.
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War Zombies
  </em>
  isn’t a bad mode in the slightest, but it’s definitely far too casual to be held as the king.

  The newest iteration of Zombies comes from
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , a mode that launches with two maps: Terimus and Liberty Falls. There’s a lot to like about
  <em>
   Black Ops 6 Zombies
  </em>
  , and there’s an optimistic future ahead if new maps take onboard fan feedback.
  <em>
   Black Ops 6 Zombies
  </em>
  has a satisfying and casual gameplay loop thanks to its refined mechanics and use of next-gen hardware to overwhelm players with countless zombies at once, which also creates a more challenging experience.

 <p>
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  also has a varied way to play with its loadout system, as well as reasons to keep coming back thanks to the ability to create new Augments for Perks, Ammo Mods, and Field Upgrades. Even the main quest is a lot of fun with one of the best boss fights yet.
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies is on the right track, and while it does feel like a more evolved
  <em>
   Black Ops Cold War
  </em>
  in terms of gameplay, there’s high potential for versatility in design to be one of the best in its life cycle.

  After
  <em>
   Black Ops 3
  </em>
  , it seemed that
  <em>
   Black Ops 4
  </em>
  could do no wrong. The team at Treyarch had learned what fans liked, and what they didn’t, which is why expectations were so high for
  <em>
   Black Ops 4
  </em>
  ’s Zombies mode. However, fans inability to move on from the beloved Aether storyline left the new Chaos storyline in a sour place, where stellar maps and interesting mythologies were later sidelined for an underwhelming conclusion to the Aether storyline.

  Not only was the story of
  <em>
   Black Ops 4 Zombies
  </em>
  a sour note, but the life cycle of
  <em>
   Black Ops 4
  </em>
  struggled, and most maps ended up being expansive and disappointing remakes of classics.
  <em>
   Black Ops 4
  </em>
  tried to be different with the abandonment of crutch Perk-a-Colas and the introduction of new ones, but so much change and a lack of support for its life cycle made
  <em>
   Black Ops 4
  </em>
  fun like
  <em>
   Black Ops 3
  </em>
  , but missing essential elements to make it as memorable.

  Following the original
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  was always going to be a hard task, and
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  didn’t have the best go at it to start. Trying to link the stories of blowing up the Earth to a new group outside of Ultimis,
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  already had a tough battle when Victis took the reigns from the core four, but that’s not where the problems lay.
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  tried to innovate far beyond what was known of Zombies at the time, and that seemed unwelcome to some.

  The first map, TranZit, was expansive but lacking due to hardware limitations, leading to frustrating experiences, and its sequel, Die Rise, had too much verticality to make it fun. Yet,
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  ended on a high note with a trio of incredible maps with Buried, Mob of the Dead, and Origins, and the atmosphere, map layouts, and stories woven within
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  are something that remains nostalgic and fun to this day.

  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  is special for many reasons, and one of them is how it was really the first title where
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  was able to find its identity. Most maps before
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  were created with re-used assets from campaigns and multiplayer maps, but the release of Call of the Dead changed all of that by allowing for distinct visual styles and concepts that would further grow the series as it’s known today.

 <p>
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  also had a stellar collection of maps to choose from, with fan favorites like Kino Der Toten still remembered so fondly. Even the finale of
  <em>
   Black Ops Zombies
  </em>
  , Moon, was stellar in its innovation. There’s so much that works about
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  to make it a nostalgic classic that remains the blueprint for what makes
  <em>

  so great.

  It might annoy some players to know just how popular
  <em>
   Black Ops 3 Zombies
  </em>
  is within the community. It’s still the undisputed best thanks to its fast-paced fluid gameplay and its selection of great maps with an incredible high-contrast aesthetic. While
  <em>
   Black Ops 3 Zombies
  </em>
  retires the more horror-focused scenes for the fantastical sci-fi, it’s a welcomed change thanks to its focus on story and characters. Everyone who knows
  <em>
   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  knows of the Primis crew and their fight to save the Multiverse from the Dark Aether.

  On top of having a memorable story and easter egg quests that involved iconic boss fights,
  <em>
   Black Ops 3
  </em>
  had an incredibly varied selection of maps. Whether it was the simple and beloved classics with Zombies Chronicles, or the more complex maps of the Season Pass that allowed for incredible side quests to keep players busy through the rounds,
  <em>
   Black Ops 3
  </em>
  excelled at the gameplay loop with accessible training spots, slide mechanics, and immersive characters.

  Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Campaign Ending Explained
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the final set of missions in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's campaign, players take control of William "Case" Calderon once again, the faceless member of Woods' rogue black ops team. As Case, players must fend off an onslaught of Pantheon soldiers who have found the black ops team's safe house in Bulgaria. The battle culminates in Pantheon's leader, Jane Harrow, attempting to flee on a helicopter.

 <p>
  Case boards the helicopter right as it lifts off, and a frantic melee occurs in the air between Case and the soldiers inside. With the soldiers dispatched, Case turns his attention to Harrow, and the two duke it out. During their fight, the helicopter's pilot is killed, and they begin their rapid descent into the water below.

 <p>
  Earlier in the campaign, it's revealed that Case was the first test subject for a CIA-developed bioweapon called "The Cradle." This bioweapon increases the user's strength and agility, but also greatly increases their aggression. In the helicopter, Case allows themselves to be consumed by the Cradle, using their aggression to strangle Harrow while the helicopter continues to take on water.

  Set two weeks later,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6

  's final cutscene shows Woods and the rest of his rogue black ops gang meeting with their former CIA boss, Daniel Livingstone. Livingstone reinstates Woods' team, claiming that they need soldiers like them more than ever before, with them now dealing with an enemy that doesn't have a clear goal.

  Livingstone mentions that he's sending Woods and the rest of the team back to Avalon, the opulent city of organized crime located on the Mediterranean coast. He believes that Woods will be able to find more information about Pantheon there. It's been heavily rumored that an Avalon map could be coming to
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  in the near future, which would now tie in neatly with
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's ending.

  Livingstone's final words to Woods and Marshall are that the Pantheon's mole is still likely hiding somewhere in the CIA. As he says that, the camera cuts to Livingstone's CIA office, where his private computer is being accessed by a mysterious male figure. Many fans believe this figure to be Jackson Caine, one of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Crimson One Operator skins.

  Annapurna Interactive and A44 Games' 2018 Soulslike RPG
  <em>
   <strong>
    Ashen
   </strong>
  </em>
  is available on Xbox Game Pass as of October 29, 2024. The title was previously on Game Pass not long after its release but left the service in late 2019. Gamers can now get back into the action in more ways than ever, with
  <em>
   Ashen
  </em>
  coming to Xbox, PC, and Xbox Cloud Gaming.

 <p>
  Microsoft announced the second wave of Game Pass titles for the month on October 15. The update included several big entries, including
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  , but fans of indie games may be glad to see another, more easily missed title in the mix. After a long departure from Game Pass, A44's cell-shaded action RPG is back and more accessible than ever before.

  <em>
   Ashen
  </em>
  originally launched on Xbox One and PC in December 2018 before coming to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 a year later. That additional console release also saw it leave Xbox Game Pass, forcing fans to buy a copy for themselves if they wanted to keep playing it. Now that it's back on the service, its supported console base is considerably larger. In addition to being playable on newer hardware like the Xbox Series X/S, it's available on Xbox Cloud Gaming, which wasn't around when
  <em>
   Ashen
  </em>
  first released.

 <p>
  Despite receiving a somewhat mixed critical reception, some fans say
  <em>
   Ashen
  </em>
  is one of the best Soulslikes available today. The title may not be as large as others in the genre, but it boasts a unique art style and both online and local co-op. The story and events also change depending on where players are at any given moment, ensuring that no two users will have the exact same gameplay experience.

  Xbox Game Pass Brings a Slew of Noteworthy Titles in October
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Ashen
  </em>
  isn't the only game worth noting in the latest update. Fan-favorite
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  is now available on Game Pass, too, as is the hit fighting game
  <em>
   Sifu. Call of Duty
  </em>
  fans also have reason to celebrate, as the latest
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  title got a day-one Game Pass release.
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  also dropped on Xbox's online service the same day. Other games of note include
  <em>
   South Park: The Fractured But Whole
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   MLB The Show 24
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Of course, each month also brings some less exciting news. Five titles are leaving Game Pass on October 31, including
  <em>
   Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mineko's Night Market.

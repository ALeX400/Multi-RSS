  Aside from gameplay, one of the most interesting aspects of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the numerous
  <strong>
   hero cosmetics and skins
  </strong>
  that portray different esthetics, themes, or concepts across the different heroes and villains of the game. New cosmetics are introduced with every new event, season, and special in-game celebration, meaning there are constantly new options when it comes to collecting and showing them off in your matches.

      <title>8 Best PS5 Zombie Games, Ranked</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-ps5-zombie-games/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Zombies are probably the greatest video game villains ever made. Nothing lends itself more to exciting gameplay than an undead shambling horde just waiting to be exploded into a cacophony of blood and guts, and the PS5 is as good a home as any to do it.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Whether it's 4-player co-op mayhem or some of the best storytelling ever put to pixels, zombies are a great backdrop for the very best gaming has to offer. For this list, we're only considering games that have a native release on PS5, and we're taking a pretty generous definition of the word "zombie" as being anything that could reasonably be described as a zombie.

  No one will deny that the release of
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  was something of a disappointment to many, but that was likely because of the immense expectations coming off the legendary
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead 2
  </em>
  which Turtle Rock also had a big hand in making. Still, Turtle Rock delivered a modern interpretation of the 4-player co-op zombie shooter that satiated decades-old cravings for the time being.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a raft of patches and updates, the game's actually in a pretty good place these days. With a couple of friends,
  <em>
   Back 4 Blood
  </em>
  delivers where few other games do with a headfirst dive into zombie-based mayhem that would make for a great way to spend a couple of weekends.

  The original
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  was the crossover Capcom success that no one really expected. Taking place in a mall overrun with zombies, clearly inspired by the Romero movies,
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  sees photographic journalist Frank West rack up a body count in the thousands as he races to try and survive the oncoming apocalypse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  is renowned for its ongoing time system that constantly ticks down, putting pressure on the player as they navigate through an increasingly whacky world with absurdly violent weapons. This remastered version has got a very distinct slapstick charm unlike anything else in the video game world, making it one of the best Dead Rising games released.

  The original
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  was built on a premise so simple but good that it pioneered an entire franchise. What if there was an open-world zombie game based around parkour? By combining the parkour of
  <em>
   Mirror's Edge
  </em>
  with the intense zombie action of films like
  <em>
   28 Days Later
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  was a breath of fresh air in the increasingly saturated world of zombie video games.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  takes everything that worked about the original and turns it up to 11. With ziplines, parachutes, an in-depth combat system, RPG mechanics, faction mechanics, and a truly beautiful world, the formula Techland pioneered in 2014 reached its platonic point of perfection here.

  There's no denying that of the many games that struggle through development,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  had a particularly tough time, bouncing between studios and entering a period so dismal that most thought it wouldn't release at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, it did arrive, plunging players into a post-apocalyptic version of Los Angeles overrun by the nasty biters. Players must navigate through a whacky heightened world, defined by its absurd weapons, zany characters, and deadly apex zombies.

  Being a
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  fan in the modern day is a special kind of delight, considering the dismal pits the franchise sunk to in the early 2010s. These days, every new entry promises genuine invention on the zombie survival formula with
  <em>
   Resident Evil: Village
  </em>
  including not only zombies, but robots, vampires, werewolves, big babies, fish monsters, and everything else but the kitchen sink.
 </p>
 <p>
  It truly is excessive, camp, and Gothic beyond belief, but it's absolute catnip for horror fans. Everything about the game is designed to make horror fans squeal with delight, and though its exaggerated campness may have isolated some players, it's hard to think of any recent zombie games that go quite as far as Capcom,
  <em>
  </em>
  making modern
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games some of the best entries in the entire franchise.

  It's hard not to feel bad for the
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  franchise, a series of games that showed so much potential but snuffed out too early as it struggled to find its tonal feet. Luckily, in 2023, Motive got the opportunity to remake the original completely and showed just how much potential remains unplundered.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  , players take up the role of Isaac Clarke, an engineer who joins an expedition to the Ishimura, a massive spaceship, to try and find his girlfriend alongside his hefty bag full of deadly engineering tools. Things go sideways (to say the least), and zombies roam the halls, ready to disembowel Isaac from stem to stern at a moment's notice. The Necromorphs, a riff on the zombie, is a great innovation that is genuinely frightening, making it one of the best zombie horror games currently on PS5.

  Ever since its release,
  <em>
   The Last of Us: Part Two
  </em>
  has been a lightning rod for controversy, somewhat understandably considering the bold design and narrative decisions it makes. Regardless, on its own merit, it's a bold, wonderful, and artistic game that dares to put players in uncomfortable places that video games normally don't.
 </p>
 <p>
  The infected, the fungal-based zombies of this particular apocalypse, are a big reason why it works. The clickers have become iconic as horror villains, and the new prowlers scare zombies in ways they haven't been for some time. Naughty Dog's bold sequel won't be forgotten any time soon, and it's hard to find examples of better zombie games on the PS5.

  Of course, only one game could top this list. Widely considered not just be one of the greatest zombie games of all time, but one of the greatest games of all time, the original
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  is about as stone-cold a classic as the video game canon has got, and the recent remake does not disappoint, changing what doesn't work, modernizing what did, and rendering it through the ever-stunning RE engine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though the Ganados are
  <em>
   technically
  </em>
  not zombies, their behavior certainly puts them in that camp, and it would be difficult to think of a more zombie-coded horror set piece than the opening village survival scene that has gone down in gaming history.
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  delivers on action, scares, iconic boss battles, and pure heart, making it the definitive choice as the best zombie game currently playable on the PS5.

  </em>
  that you can catch. Some only spawn during special events, while others are found in hard-to-reach pools. Even if the rarity of the fish is low, that does not mean that it will be easy to catch.

  Most fish in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  live in specific pools, and some of them are quite far from the main islands. In the case of Fangborn Gar, to catch it, you need to visit a location deep underwater called Vertigo.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is impossible to get there using diving gear or a boat. Instead, players need to find a special portal or, more precisely, the
  <strong>
   Strange Whirlpool
  </strong>
  . It can easily be distinguished from other whirlpools by the beam of light shining from its center.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need to jump into its center to teleport to Vertigo. Then, you can jump down to the pool where the Fangborn Gar is found in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Even though the Fangborn Gar is an Unusual fish, catching it can be more difficult than catching Legendary ones. This fish prefers
  <strong>
   Fish Heads as bait
  </strong>
  . Also, its chance of spawning is slightly higher in
  <strong>
   Foggy weather
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The Fish Head is one of the best baits in the game, and if your fishing rod has a high enough Luck stat, it will be extremely difficult for you to catch a Fangborn Gar. To fix this, you should
  <strong>
   use Garbage bait
  </strong>
  . In addition, we recommend that you
  <strong>
   equip your worst fishing rod
  </strong>
  . This will help you catch Unusual fish in the Vertigo location much faster.

 <p>
  As befits an Unusual catch, Fangborn Gar has a fairly low cost. As such, this fish should not be caught in order for players to make money.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need the Fangborn Gar in
  <em>
   Fisch
  </em>
  to complete the Vertigo bestiary. Doing so will reward you with bonus XP and money, and it will also allow you to open the gates leading to the Depths. That is, of course, if you have The Depths Key.

  If there's one positive thing about the
  <em>

  </em>
  review plagiarism controversy, it's that more eyes were drawn toward what is easily one of the best 2D roguelike action games players can get their hands on. By emulating elements of the Metroidvania and Soulslike genres,
  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  becomes a captivating experience that more fans of tough indie games should check out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Progression is infinitely rewarding in
  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  as players finally make it past a challenging boss that had stopped them in their tracks over and over again. Just like
  <em>

  </em>
  , exploration is an integral facet of
  <em>
   Dead Cells.
  </em>
  The procedural generation ensures that no run feels quite the same as players find more buffs to help them deal with larger-than-life threats.

  If
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  can be reductively described as a 2D
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  with bugs, then
  <em>
   Nine Sols
  </em>
  is a 2D
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  with anthropomorphic characters. Combat relies on deflections to build up a special meter that can be used to attach talismans on enemies and deal severe damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like a simple combat loop, only for
  <em>
   Nine Sols
  </em>
  to open up as battles become breakneck affairs where a single mistake can lead to the player's demise. Just like
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Nine Sols
  </em>
  also released an update later on that added a boss rush mode to the game, letting players make the most of this tantalizing combat system.

  Before
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , there was a PS3 exclusive that not many people got their hands on. This is why the
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  remake interested many fans who grew to love FromSoftware after checking out their later popular offerings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given that
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  shares quite a bit of design philosophy with soulslikes, it's easy to see why
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  would be perfect for fans of this title. Just like Hallownest, this game also takes place in the wasting land of Boletaria that is full of unknown horrors and maddened foes.

  Players who want to get their hands on an ingenious metroidvania will find

  From community puzzles to solutions that require players to print things out, it's easy to see why
  <em>
   Animal Well

  Another indie game that burst onto the scene and wowed fans was
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  , a game that combined its roguelike mechanics with story progression deftly. Many players welcome a failed run since it lets them interact with several characters in the House of Hades to further their stories before trying to escape the Underworld once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game's challenging boss fights and excellent voice performances make it clear why
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  is such a gem of an indie game. It may be a brighter and more cheerful game compared to
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  , but players who love challenging combat will develop a soft spot for both titles.

  There aren't many games where players can control a monster and terrorize humans, which is why
  <em>
   Carrion
  </em>
  is so special. Players must stalk their foes and pick them off one by one, trapping humans in a horror movie where they wildly shoot at a wriggling mass of flesh that's out for their blood.
 </p>
 <p>
  These hit-and-run tactics must be mastered if players don't want to be shot up and killed in no time. For the power fantasy that this game provides at times,
  <em>
   Carrion
  </em>
  is deceptively hard, putting a huge emphasis on evasion in most encounters, much like
  <em>
   Hollow Knight.
  </em>
  Players also spend much of their time searching for a myriad of upgrades that transform and evolve gameplay scenarios throughout the game's ~5-hour runtime.

  The most popular FromSoftware game ever made, numerous players were introduced to FromSoftware's tantalizing action combat and lore-building when
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  came out in 2022. The open-world approach provides similar exploration to
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  , emphasizing the joys of discovery.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans of
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  's many tough encounters will find a similarly rewarding challenge in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is perhaps easier than other FromSoftware games (pending a number of intense boss fights), that shouldn't deter players from exploring The Lands Between and enjoying an epic adventure that can hit many of the same highs as
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  .

  Given their expansive nature,
  <strong>
   open-world
  </strong>
  projects
  <strong>
  </strong>
  tend to be some of the
  <strong>
   longest games
  </strong>
  in existence. It's possible to pour hundreds and thousands of hours into a single open-world game without exploring every nook and cranny. They are meant to keep someone engaged for weeks or months, and when done right, they can be absolutely spectacular. Now, longer does not always mean better, but when a project hits the mark, that can certainly be the case.

  While there are short open-world games out there,
  <em>
   Shadow of the Colossus
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mafia
  </em>
  immediately come to mind, most entries in the genre require a significant time investment. That's part of the reason these titles are so popular – they reward commitment with content and immersion. These titles are designed to be played for weeks or months on end, taking players on an epic journey across (usually) expansive worlds. Let's take a look at the
  <strong>
   longest open-world games

    Updated February 25, 2025 by Mark Sammut
   </strong>
   : 2025 has gotten off to a pretty exciting start for open-world games, and there are quite a few major releases scheduled for the next few months. Although a lot of fun, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's main story is relatively short by the franchise's standards. While that title has not made the cut, another 2025 release is among the longest open-world games ever. Click below to jump to this new game.

  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  had an incredibly rough launch. When it was first released back in 2016, it was met with ire by much of the community. Players cited the lack of content and a failure to deliver on promises made by the developer as the biggest issues, with a general feeling that the game was unfinished. Thankfully, developers listened to the community and stuck with the project, pouring extra work into creating the game that they envisioned from the start.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nowadays,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  is much improved and has seen a couple of DLC releases to help pad out its content even further. In fact, there is not so much to do in the sci-fi exploration and action release that deviating from the main story and doing all the side content will take over 100 hours. There is replayability here too.

  Thanks to
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , Larian is well-established as one of the best modern RPG developers. While both of those games provide room for exploration and free roam, they are not open-world in the traditional sense but rather feature open areas. However, 2002's
  <em>
   Divine Divinity
  </em>
  is a more standard representative of the concept, even if it is fairly dated in a lot of ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blending
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  -style combat with classic PC RPG elements,
  <em>
   Divine Divinity
  </em>
  does a pretty good job balancing out the two subgenres, delivering a fairly accessible hack and slash system alongside stat-fueled progression and builds. Players are free to explore the world as they see fit, tackling side quests at their leisure. While a bit rough around the edges, this title still has plenty of charm.

  An indie open-world survival game,
  <em>
   Dysmantle
  </em>
  establishes a gameplay loop that is irresistibly addictive. Set in a post-apocalyptic world featuring zombies, this title's bare-bones sound rather unspectacular, but everything comes together quite seamlessly for one main reason: progression is constant and highly enjoyable.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players spend the majority of their time in
  <em>
   Dysmantle
  </em>
  destroying everything around them, and each action grants XP points that can then be used to forge better tools to cause even more devastation. It is a cycle that works brilliantly and ensures that grinding never feels pointless. The world is reasonably large too, even if the isometric camera angle makes the map seem smaller than it is.

  Rockstar's latest adventure was so well-received by the community that it continues to see updates and re-releases on consoles.

  is one of the largest and most ambitious releases in Rockstar's franchise, with a main campaign that spans three separate playable characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the main story is engrossing enough, there are tons of sidequests and stranger-style missions to complete. It'll take players quite a bit of time and effort to see all there is to see in Los Santos and all the surrounding areas. From there, players can also hop into
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto Online
  </em>
  , for even more stories and side-content to tackle.

  Although it certainly shows its age nowadays,
  <em>
   Space Rangers 2: Dominators
  </em>
  was an impressive sci-fi title when it debuted in 2004. The Russian game blends a surprising number of genres, from trade simulators to shoot 'em ups and RTS. The base game launched with hardly a shortage of content, but 2013's
  <em>
   Space Rangers HD: A War Apart
  </em>
  adds even more material to it, expanding this title to enormous lengths.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Space Rangers HD
  </em>
  takes place in a universe where evil robots called Dominators are trying to take over everything. The player steps into one of the game's various civilizations and must set out to complete faction missions, take a few trips to hyperspace, and make enemies and friends along the way. Not everything about
  <em>
   Space Rangers HD: A War Apart
  </em>
  has aged gracefully, but the game's open-ended nature is admirable and greatly enhances its replayability, making it one of the
  <strong>
   longest open-world games
  </strong>
  ever.

  Ubisoft created one of the definitive pirate games in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag
  </em>
  , a project that was so successful that a spiritual successor removed from that franchise seemed inevitable.
  <em>
   Skull and Bones
  </em>
  took a very long time to materialize, and it went through a rather notoriously development cycle; by the time of its 2024 debut, the game had lost most of its momentum following an array of underwhelming reports and previews. While not without positives,
  <em>
   Skull and Bones
  </em>
  was undeniably a disappointment, particularly its limited gameplay, which felt more restrictive and one-note than the much older
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite technically containing a main story, this title follows a live-service structure that is meant to encourage indefinite sessions, sort of similar to something like
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  . Even if it is not the focus, the campaign is fairly lengthy, and it mostly revolves around targeting specific pirates (who have very little personality). It took
  <em>
   Skull and Bones
  </em>
  roughly three months to poll just four main story times on HowLongToBeat, which is ridiculous for such a major release.

  Usually, fantasy RPGs cast players as prominent figures, heroes summoned by the stars to change the course of history.
  <em>
   Outward
  </em>
  opts for a different take as its protagonist starts as a common adventurer who is merely trying to pay off a debut, and it takes a while for them to become involved in a more important narrative.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Outward
  </em>
  has plenty of issues such as unsatisfying combat, the game nails its open-world. Players are allowed to explore the map to their hearts' content, and the game opens up very quickly. Sure, some routes lead to death, but that is to be expected in this sort of fantasy world.

  Following in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  ' footsteps,
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  were the first main entry projects in Game Freak's franchise to go down the open-world route, a decision that attracted excitement and trepidation in equal measure. The ninth-generation games got a decisively mixed response, particularly due to pretty bad performance and bugs. Visually,
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  also leave quite a bit to be desired and are fairly rough around the edges.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, they are
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games that, for the most part, manage to preserve the traditional loop that has proven popular for the best part of three decades. Sure, the story might be reluctant to provide any significant challenge or try anything all that new, but neither of those things are game killers for
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  . The simple excitement of catching and training monsters will seemingly never grow out of fashion.

  When it comes to main stories,
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  is the longest entry in Bethesda's franchise, although most of the 3D games are similar in length. Obsidian's spin-off is generally hailed as the best post-
  <em>
   Fallout 2
  </em>
  entry, particularly due to its implementation of actions and consequences that make the player's decisions seem important.
 </p>
 <p>
  As with most Bethesda games,
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  ' content and longevity go well beyond the base content, at least on PC. These titles are kept alive for years through active modding communities that add a plethora of fresh material, including stuff like quests.

  Surviving a difficult production cycle,
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  launched to a generally positive reception, with most of the criticisms focusing on its technical state. Yes, the game had and still has its share of bugs and glitches, but the actual content is pretty darn great and arguably marks a new high point for the franchise (which is not a statement made lightly). Once again, players find themselves in The Zone, an area filled with radiation, mutants, and people trying to get ahead (and they are willing to kill for it).
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  is massive, offering a way bigger world than any of its predecessors. Although not devoid of empty areas, which makes sense considering the setting, the map is fairly stacked with content. Beyond that,
  <em>
   S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2
  </em>
  strikes a pretty great balance between survival, horror, and gunplay.

  is a popular open-world survival game with a permadeath mechanic; meanwhile,
  <em>
   Don't Starve Together

  frames many of the same ideas around multiplayer, acting both as a sequel and a standalone experience. As both titles have their positives and are worth owning in their own right, players will need to decide which title is better suited to meet their needs.

  <em>

  is their only choice.

 <p>
  <em>
   Don't Starve Together

  is the longer of the two projects, although the time required to complete playthroughs will vary greatly since this is one of those games that plays it fast and loose with its story.

  Piranha Bytes specializes in open-world games, an endeavor that goes all the way back to 2001's
  <em>
   Gothic
  </em>
  . Although typically known for their Eurojank, Piranha's projects are endearing and ambitious for the company's size.
  <em>
   Gothic 2
  </em>
  is probably the developer's most famous title, but the
  <em>
   Risen
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Elex
  </em>
  series also have their fans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Debuting roughly a week after
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Elex 2
  </em>
  was utterly overshadowed by FromSoftware's masterpiece. Now that the Lands Between has been fully explored, RPG fans might want to consider visiting Magalan for a fantasy sci-fi adventure.
  <em>
   Elex 2
  </em>
  wastes little time in cutting players loose so that they can explore its world, and the game even hands out a jetpack.

  A survival open-world game that came and went in 2019,
  <em>
   Fade to Silence
  </em>
  is not a highlight of either genre it represents; however, it offers enough positives in each area to warrant an unenthusiastic recommendation to people looking for a bit of both. Dropped into a winter wasteland, players are cast as Ash, a guy who will be spending all of his time exploring, collecting resources, and expanding their base. The game tells a story as well, but it is not too important and does not distract from the gameplay loop.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Fade to Silence
  </em>
  can be frustrating, particularly during scenarios that require engaging in combat. Nevertheless, players looking for a meaty survival game might enjoy what they find here, as long as they can deal with a few rough edges.

  Humanity seemed destined to always gaze at the stars, dreaming of a future when they may fly freely through space's endless expanse. While that reality is still far off, games present a way to experience a slightly similar thrill, all from the comfort of a gaming chair. While not lacking a story,
  <em>
   Starpoint Gemini 2
  </em>
  's main appeal is the freedom it grants players, allowing them to jump into their spaceship and explore to their hearts' content.
 </p>
 <p>
  A true sandbox experience, the game shines in its ability to reward aimlessness, crafting unique scenarios that can only be found if somebody is willing to just go where few have gone before. While not always smooth sailing and occasionally succumbing to repetition,
  <em>
   Starpoint Gemini 2
  </em>
  is generally an impressive outing, especially for a relatively small release that is more than a decade old by this point.

  2012's
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  is a great action RPG, and
  <em>
   Dark Arisen
  </em>
  adds roughly 10 hours of awesome content to the base game; however, according to HowLongToBeat, the vanilla version is actually the longer of the two games, at least when it comes to completing the main story. In reality,
  <em>
   Dark Arisen
  </em>
  might have been a revisit for quite a few players, so they got through the standard quests quicker since they were already familiar with the gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Capcom drops players in Gransys, a gorgeous open-world densely populated with monsters. While not colossal, the map is expertly crafted to maximize gameplay and combat, the latter of which is fantastic.
  <em>
   Dark Arisen
  </em>
  introduces Bitterblack Isle, a post-campaign area that significantly ramps up the difficulty and dread.
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  does not have much in the way of memorable characters or writing, and the game's storytelling is unlikely to leave much of a lasting impression. However, almost everything else is well above average, and the simple act of exploration is satisfying.

  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  is a multiplayer-driven looter shooter that is designed as a live service game, so its "full" length is hard to predict since the project should be receiving new content fairly frequently. As a free-to-play option that has a couple of shortcomings, Nexon's title is worth playing simply for its gorgeous visuals and fun combat, particularly if a player plans to make use of its co-op support.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite being live service,
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  tells a traditional story to an extent, including an endpoint; consequently, it can be at least somewhat experienced as a conventional third-person shooter if that is what somebody is craving. That said, the story is far from the best thing about the game; honestly, the open-world is not particularly great either.

  Due to still being in development,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  's actual length is not set in stone, a fact amplified by the project's survival mechanics. While not completely devoid of story beats, the game is designed to encourage players to pursue their own goals without too much direction. As such, players will spend most of their time tracking down different Pals to catch and add to their party or use as workers around their bases. Although incorporating standard survival staples,
  <em>
   Palworld's
  </em>
  focus gradually shifts to crafting, farming, and combat, especially once players develop a solid routine that ensures they always have their basic needs met.
 </p>
 <p>
  Early access games are nearly always evolving, with developers using feedback from the community to improve their project's core ideas as they work towards a full release. Consequently, these titles are usually lacking in a few areas, with story missions being common culprits. While these things apply to
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  , Pocket Pair's game is already in a very good state.

  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  is one of those titles that someone can easily sink more than a thousand hours into, however, the survival game comes with such a steep learning curve that it can be really difficult to get into.
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  does have a story that can be somewhat followed, but the majority of the experience revolves around the basic gameplay loop of scavenging, crafting, building, and interacting with other players.
 </p>
 <p>
  In some ways, this open-world game is similar to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , at least when it comes to the sandbox.
  <em>
   Conan Exiles
  </em>
  has amassed quite a dedicated fan base since its launch, and the game still averages thousands of players on Steam.

  Kojima Productions'
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  is an acquired taste, although nobody can say that the game failed to deliver a huge world. Set in a post-apocalyptic United States, Sam basically acts as a postman who travels across the nation delivering packages while also connecting a network. Isolation is a central theme of
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  , and the game does a stellar job of emphasizing the importance and challenge of Sam's mission.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some open-world games take place in lavish kingdoms stuffed with NPCs and quests, while others envision desolate landscapes featuring splashes of humanity –
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  falls in the latter category.

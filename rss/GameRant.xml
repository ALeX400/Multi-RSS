 <p>
  One of the greatest things about open-world games is that they offer a ton of possibilities to players, including multiple upgrades, side quests, NPCs, and massive skill trees. And while having so many options available is often great, sometimes grinding is required to get to a certain level or obtain a certain skill.

 <p>
  Since open-world games are so big, getting to a certain level should not be a tedious process; however, in many cases, even after exploring for hours and completing several side quests, the earned skill points can fall short, putting players in a position where they have to engage in tedious, repetitive actions. To avoid this, here are
  <strong>

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
   </em>
  </strong>
  revolutionized the concept of open worlds and brought the franchise back to the spotlight in the best possible way. Instead of relying on traditional grinding mechanics to get certain items or reach certain levels, the game veered toward letting players explore the vast world at their disposal to upgrade and grow stronger. Virtually every area in the game can be accessed from the start, giving players a lot of control in terms of how they want to progress and how challenging they want their experience to be.

 <p>
  Naturally, areas meant for the later stages of the game will be more difficult, but if players want, they can take on them and collect items to increase their health and stamina. More than relying on demanding specific levels from players,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  opts for puzzle-solving and creativity.

  Set in a fictional version of the real-life Japanese island of Tsushima,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Tsushima
   </em>
  </strong>
  puts players in the shoes of Jin Sakai, a nobleman who must reclaim his beloved homeland from the Mongols and rescue his uncle in the process. Since the game emphasizes story-driven progression and many combat upgrades require players to complete certain missions, there's no real use for grinding. As in other open-world games, players can choose to take on enemies much stronger than them if they want a challenge or visit lower-level areas to breeze through and gain skill points.

Exploration is also a key aspect of the game, as it allows players to discover shrines, hot springs, and other points of interest.

  Moving away from feudal Japanese stories, there's
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Outer Worlds
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which takes on an entirely different concept and focuses on deep space exploration. In this game, players can explore various planets and space stations as they engage in quests given by the different NPCs spread throughout the galaxy. Character progression comes more from personal decisions and the natural discovery of every area rather than senseless grinding. This title's combat system is rather flexible, allowing players to take on enemies and other challenges in the way they prefer.

 <p>
  As in other games in this genre, leveling is recommended, but not mandatory, allowing players to decide whether they want to take on a specific area or enemy with all the tools they need, or at the bare minimum, to face a true challenge.

  Taking on the role of Batman once again, in
  <strong>

  players will have to save Gotham from the forces of villains like Scarecrow and the Arkham Knight, whose identity is a mystery. The game features a big open area of Gotham that players can explore however they want and is filled with many stories, side quests, and various optional activities.
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Knight

  This title also requires players to use more than their fists, as puzzle-solving plays an important role in game progression.

 <p>
  Saying that
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Witcher 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  requires no grinding would probably spark debate, as there is a strong upgrade system that is unlocked through skill points and victories over monsters and other creatures. However, the game is so vast, that gaining skill points and leveling up comes naturally as players progress through the game. Even those who only want to focus on the main story's missions and leave the great side quests in the game behind should have no trouble unlocking the abilities they want without ever feeling like they're having to grind for them.

  Besides, side quests are so well crafted, that not only is skipping them advised against, but almost impossible, as they're all over The Continent and have the power to draw players without them even noticing. So, in any case, while leveling up is recommended in
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  , it's unlikely that players will ever have to repeat a single task to do so.

  has a prologue demo currently available on all platforms, letting players try out the first few hours of the game for free. While some demos aim to give players a taste of what to expect later in a game, the demo for

  instead focuses on the very beginning of the game.

  Players are able to try out the prologue demo to see how they like the combat and see the seeds of the greater story being set up, without the need to pre-ordering the game. Here's how long players can expect to spend on the demo and if saved data carries over the main game upon release.

  Players can expect to
  <strong>
   spend between 4-6 hours on the demo
  </strong>
  depending on your playstyle and the difficulty you pick. This demo is the first few hours of the game, offering tutorials for the basics of the game along with dungeons that are a bit more open, letting players explore and fight various enemies, or simply run ahead to the next boss.

  In total, the demo includes four dungeons and three or four boss fights for you to complete. The dungeons aren't very large, but players can spend as much time as they'd like grinding and leveling up their party and their Archetypes. Players are given
  <strong>
   full customization of their party during the demo
  </strong>
  , letting you switch out each character's Archetype between those available up to this point, along with finding or buying new gear.

 <p>
  There are multiple difficulties that can be chosen and switched between at any time. The demo can also be played through multiple times letting you try out the basics of different builds or try different builds on bosses to see all the game's combat system has to offer. While
  <strong>
   about an hour and a half of the demo is on rails or cutscenes

  , the remaining time can be stretched or shortened a lot to let players get what they want out of the demo.

  With the arrival of the new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Crusader Kings 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  DLC,
  <em>
   Roads to Power
  </em>
  , Paradox Interactive has introduced a groundbreaking mechanic into one of its flagship strategy games: Landless Adventurers. This feature allows players to control characters who do not own titles, adding a fresh dynamic to the gameplay by offering a diverse range of options.

 <p>
  In addition to the innovative mechanics added for this mode, the developers have also created significant historical figures, enabling players to control important figures from the Middle Ages. Thus, the
  <strong>
   best Landless Adventurers in
   <em>
    Crusader Kings 3

  One of the main content additions in the new update of
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  significantly enhances role-playing potential. Especially when played as a Landless Adventurer, the game transforms into an immersive RPG experience. Although it may not be as complex as other genre-specific games, the bookmarks provide perfect opportunities to create custom characters.

  For instance, fans of
  <em>

   Uhtred Uhtredsson

  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  . There are also other interesting characters who can be recreated with this mechanic. Unleashing creativity allows for crafting incredible stories within the game.

  The new
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  DLC,
  <em>
   Roads to Power
  </em>
  , has added a substantial amount of new content to the game. Players who wish to explore all the new mechanics and items introduced might need some time. However, one such opportunity is playing as
  <strong>
   Strategos Michael II
  </strong>
  , a Landless Adventurer in the Byzantine Empire.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Being from the Byzantine Empire means that the character is in a place of administrative families, which is another novelty added in this expansion by Paradox Interactive. Therefore, for players who want to experience the new mechanics all at once without creating different saves, this is one of the best opportunities. Michael is a new character who can have a long lifespan, allowing for a deep exploration of the new features.

  <strong>
   Master Ziyar
  </strong>
  begins the journey as a Landless Adventurer, actively participating in the Iranian Intermezzo. This period of intense civil conflict in the Arab Empire offers Ziyar the opportunity to capitalize on the instability to assert independence and build an empire from the ruins of Baghdad. His actions can shape the fate of the region amid the chaos.

 <p>
  At 26 years old, Ziyar possesses random attributes that vary in each game, providing a unique experience every time the game is played. Being young, there is ample room for growth and evolution during the Iranian Intermezzo. This allows Ziyar to become an influential figure in the events of this conflict, leaving a mark on the historical chronicles of
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  .

  Although, during this historical period, Vikings are best remembered for their battles and power struggles in the British Isles, the homeland of these Norse people was still full of opportunities. Therefore, for players who wish to be one of these formidable warriors in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  ,
  <strong>
   Master Hrolf
  </strong>
  is an excellent choice.

  In the

  DLC, he starts as a Landless Adventurer with outstanding combat attributes and is still young, having plenty of room to evolve and thrive. Players have great freedom in what can be done with him during the journey through the game. Options include continuing as a mercenary, selling his services for gold coins, or invading France, as the real
  <strong>
   Rollo
  </strong>
  did.

 <p>
  For enthusiasts of Viking conquest sagas,
  <strong>
   Ubbe Ragnarrsson
  </strong>
  emerges as one of the most captivating characters of this historical period in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  , thanks to the
  <em>
   Roads to Power
  </em>
  DLC. Now, Ubbe can be played more accessibly as a Landless Adventurer, allowing leadership through war-torn England and participation in Viking raids.

 <p>
  Despite being 40 years old, a considerable age for the time in 867, Ubbe remains a formidable warrior. His leadership and strategic skills can significantly influence the course of the Viking invasions. In the game, there is the opportunity to alter the fate of the kingdoms that would eventually unify as England, deciding whether the Norse prevail or embark on new journeys.

  <strong>
   Wallada bint al-Mustakfi
  </strong>
  , the last descendant of the Umayyads in 1066, is known for her literary legacy, wealth, and for challenging the social norms of the time in Cordoba. Recognized as a poet and mentor, her life stood out for the strategic use of romance and seduction. This makes her a unique figure among the Landless Adventurers in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  In the game, Wallada presents mechanics involving the development of an adopted successor, the use of poetry to increase prestige, and the establishment of a literary salon. With the
  <strong>
   Violet Poet
  </strong>
  trait and the
  <strong>
   Double-Moon Tome
  </strong>
  artifact, there is the possibility to accumulate wealth and influence through the sale of poetry. Strategic romances expand her power and can ensure a lasting legacy.

  <strong>
   William of Normandy

  By eliminating Normans and mobilizing locals against the invaders, Hereward enhances his unique trait. He becomes an increasingly effective guerrilla warrior in the fenlands of eastern England. For those interested in playing with him in the new

  DLC, the character starts the story as a Freebooter, faithfully reflecting the historical trajectory of his battles.

  The figure of
  <strong>
   Hasan Sabbah
  </strong>
  is highly revered, appearing in various works of pop culture, such as the
  <em>
   Fate
  </em>
  franchise. However, in the
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  DLC,
  <em>
   Roads to Power
  </em>
  , he is still a Landless Adventurer who is a bit distant from becoming the legendary Old Man of the Mountain, where most of the legends that make him famous are centered.

 <p>
  In the game, Hasan Sabbah has a journey focused on the rapid religious conversion of counties, paving the way for his rise as the leader of the feared
  <strong>
   Hashashins
  </strong>
  . When summoned to Egypt, Hasan can adopt
  <strong>
   Nizarism
  </strong>
  and face the powerful
  <strong>
   Seljuk Empire
  </strong>
  . The success of these conquests can lead to founding the assassins, carving his name into history.

  Perhaps the figure of
  <strong>
   El Cid
  </strong>
  is the historical definition of what a Landless Adventurer means in
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  , as his story is of someone who fought for power and managed to reclaim it, ruling Valencia for a certain period. Now, thanks to the
  <em>
   Roads to Power
  </em>
  expansion of the game, it is possible to relive several events from El Cid's life.

 <p>
  What makes playing with him more interesting is that, like a few other characters in the
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  expansion, the developers have created scripted events related to his history. Players can take part in the Iberian Struggle, deciding the future of the region while controlling one of the most important historical figures of the Middle Ages.

  Among the many things that are possible when playing open-world games, there's hunting and fishing, which add another layer of complexity to any game, especially if there's resource gathering and management involved. Players can use what they catch and either eat it or sell it to make some money and buy other things they might need.

  While some open-world games have clunky fishing game mechanics or the surrounding concept is simply uninteresting, others build on it, delivering an entertaining experience that players keep coming back to. Here are some of

  <em>
   <strong>
    Animal Crossing: New Horizons
   </strong>
  </em>
  offers an in-depth look into a peaceful island where fishing, along with other activities, has a central role in the lives of its inhabitants. Players can fish in different areas, including lakes, ponds, and even the ocean, using a simplistic rod mechanic that feels great and isn't hard to get the hang of. The variety of fish that are available to catch is also quite decent, and it changes depending on the weather, the time of year, and the time of day—just like it would happen in real life.

 <p>

  With a heavy focus on farming and robust fishing game mechanics,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  offers a fun experience for anyone who wants to play it. Similar to
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  , this game features fishing in several different bodies of water, including lakes, rivers, and oceans. The game also has fish variety that changes monthly depending on the season; however, it feels different enough that it doesn't feel like a copy of
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

 <p>
  Fishing requires skill and the right timing, so failing on either one will result in a day with no catches. Once players hone their skills and become master fishermen, they can sell their catches of the day for profit or cook them for nourishment.
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  features a beautiful take on pixel art that fits well with the wholesome, relaxing atmosphere around it.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Valhalla
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not only great for keeping the famous
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  franchise alive and presenting players with a new installment in the epic Viking era, but also because of its neat game mechanics, story, and, of course, fishing. While some people might think that there's no way fish can live in such cold weather, there are, in fact, many species that Eivor can catch in the rivers, lakes, and coastal areas around Norway.

 <p>
  Fishing is not something Eivor does just for leisure, but rather to progress through the game, as anything they catch can be used to trade for upgrades, prepare feasts and even sold for silver. It's important to remember that back in those times, trading was a key element to any settlement's economy, so being a fisherman was a great way to earn daily bread. While
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Valhalla
  </em>
  isn't as relaxing or family-friendly as the previous two entries on the list, it still offers a great fishing experience.

  Set in the fictional Hope County in Montana,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  offers players the opportunity to have a taste of what country life looks like in the rural areas of the US. Fishing takes a significant role in the game, and players can use rods, reels and different lures to catch a wide variety of fish in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water.
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  kicks things up a notch by implementing fishing challenges that are required to complete certain side quests and earn money, so fishing is no longer just about eating or relaxing.

 <p>
  The game also features legendary fish, which can be hunted and caught for special rewards that players will not want to miss out on. While

  's main focus isn't fishing, but rather firearm combat, stealth and survival, this game mechanic can provide players with a nice breather when they feel like they need to touch grass and spend a little while relaxing near their favorite river.

  When it comes to tracking and hunting down wild animals or fishing for massive swimming creatures, few games do it as well as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Not only does this title feature one of the most complete hunting game mechanics in gaming thus far, but it also rewards players with different outfit possibilities and sizable payments if they choose to sell what they hunted/caught.

 <p>
  Players can sit near lakes, rivers and ponds while using different baits and lures to try to catch all sorts of fish varieties. Similar to
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  , this title also features legendary animals, including legendary fish that Arthur can catch, which is very fun, but also quite difficult. The overall fishing mechanics of the game feel very realistic, as the fish behave like real-life fish would, pulling away from the coast in an effort to escape.

  Given how expensive it can be to make video games, it's easy to see why developers rely on established IPs and sequels instead of taking a bold risk with a new game that has no attachment to other titles. If these games catch a whiff of success, publishers won't waste any time in turning them into a series that fans can get invested in.

 <p>
  Western RPGs can be rather tricky and expensive to develop, since developers have to create brand-new worlds with interesting lore to keep players engaged. This is why it can be odd to see certain Western RPGs be one-and-done experiences despite having the potential to become a series.

  BioWare wanted to try something different with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Jade Empire
   </strong>
  </em>
  , attempting to evolve their role-playing gameplay by integrating action-packed loops instead of passive, tactical ones. The end result is an excellent RPG with fun combat and a great story that lets players use a whole host of martial arts to take on their opponents in style.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Jade Empire
  </em>
  's wuxia elements and inspired gameplay made it a joy to play through, the game failed to attract a ton of interest. This meant that BioWare had to abandon this title instead of building up on it with a sequel, which is a massive shame.

 <p>
  Obsidian Entertainment has a track record of developing amazing Western RPGs that are loaded with bugs, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alpha Protocol
   </em>
  </strong>
  is no exception here. This is a shame since the idea of playing an espionage RPG was engrossing and could've attracted a ton of eyes.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, a lack of technical polish and weird UI elements meant that
  <em>
   Alpha Protocol

  was dead in the water when it launched. Behind all these issues was a genuinely entertaining title that let players pursue missions in whatever manner they saw fit and interact with a whole host of memorable characters.

 <p>
  Not many RPGs explore what it truly means to be evil, which is why
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tyranny
   </strong>
  </em>
  is such a joy to play through. The writing has a distinctive flavor that makes it one of the most unique CRPGs that gamers can get their hands on, but Obsidian simply didn't have the funds to achieve the full vision of this game.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1001} -->

 <p>
  So, despite a bombastic introduction and great plot progression following some epic moments, the finale of
  <em>
   Tyranny
  </em>
  has to hastily wrap things up instead of giving its narrative the closure it deserves. It also didn't help that the game didn't attract enough sales, leading to Obsidian abandoning this IP altogether despite the amazing writing that was rife throughout.

  The writing of

  is superb and one of the strongest parts of the experience, so it's a shame that the developer who helped this title become a reality imploded. Even if this game gets the sequel it deserves, the absence of the team that helped create it almost guarantees that

   Disco Elysium 2

  will be a shadow of its former self.

  Numerous Western RPGs faced the problem of having a massive scope that simply couldn't be achieved given the development constraints. This is ultimately what prevented
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader

  </strong>
  from being a fun, action-packed CRPG series, which is a shame, since fans likely still remember that amazing moment when they come to Barcelona and slowly uncover the deep role-playing options present in this city.

  The game falters and has to reduce its scope after players leave the city, turning into a linear title with combat encounters that are disapointingly rigid. If
  <em>
   Lionheart
  </em>
  had achieved its vision, then there's no telling the heights this game could've reached with the amazing scope and detail teased in the opening act.

  Daniel Fedor, a former BioWare employee, split from the company and decided to make his vision of a hardcore survival RPG a reality. This led to the creation and development of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Neo Scavenger
   </em>
  </strong>
  , one of the toughest survival RPGs that gamers can get their hands on.

  Managing Philip's stats and ensuring that he doesn't die at the hands of enemies or debilitating illnesses is easier said than done. This game has a niche fanbase and isn't going to single-handedly establish an IP, but those curious likely won't mind as long as they get to check out an excellent Western RPG that they will have a great time with.

  Sometimes, it's good to embrace video games as a power fantasy. Having the ability to jump three times the height of the average human, demolish waves of enemies with the press of a button, and solve all problems with violence can be so satisfying. The logical conclusion in many cases is that the protagonist (and often the villain) becomes so much of a threat that they ascend to godhood.

 <p>
  Stories of human beings rising up to divine power are not unheard of. However, seeing them depicted in stories or movies is one thing, but playing through the experience and living the ascendance vicariously (or at least witnessing it firsthand) through the medium of video games is quite another. Through whatever means available, these video game characters have reached the pinnacle of power. Beware of heretical spoilers ahead.

   <em>
    Final Fantasy 6

  </strong>
  , Kefka Palazzo begins his journey as an eccentric, power-hungry court mage whose ruthless ambition quickly escalates into one of the most memorable villainous ascensions in gaming history. Kefka's obsession with power leads him to betray his emperor at his moment of triumph by absorbing the power of the Warring Triad, ancient masters of magic, and ultimately becoming a god of magic.

  With his new power, Kefka commits unspeakable atrocities and ultimately succeeds in reshaping the world in his own twisted image, spreading despair and destruction across the land.

  The
  <em>
   Legacy of Kain

  series, known for its deep explorations of cycles, rebirth, and time paradoxes, is perhaps best known for the iconic vampire wraith, Raziel. However, the titular vampire lord, who first appeared in
  <em>

    :
   </em>
   Legacy of Kain
  </em>
  , began as a simple nobleman resurrected into a life of undeath. Through the course of his adventure, he attempts to cure himself of vampirism and restore balance to the magically corrupted Pillars of Nosgoth.

  <em>

  </em>
  , 1500 years later, it is established that rather than sacrifice himself to purge the pillars and save the world, Kain embraced his vampirism and the evil ending by taking control, ruling the realm as a vampire god powered by the nine pillars.

  As he appears in
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind
   </strong>
  </em>
  , Vivec appears as a contradictory and opaque deity. As a living god, he can be interacted with at his palace in Vivec, the city with his namesake. Long before the events of
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  , he and the two other members of Morrowind's Tribunal took it upon themselves to tap into a divine artifact, the Heart of Lorkhan, which imbued them with divine abilities.

  While the details of his ascendancy from mortal Chimmer (a forerunner of the dark elves) are spotty and mysterious, Vivec presents himself as the personification of duality and contradiction and, by doing so, leaves clues to the Trubuneral's heretical betrayal of Azura and their former friend, the Nerevarine. Although Vivec is powerful enough to battle an army single-handedly and hold a meteorite off with his will alone, he can technically be killed by the player and his soul captured in the Daedric soul gem, Azura's Star.

  In the "Shivering Isles" expansion, the Hero of Kvatch, AKA the Champion of Cyrodiil, achieves godhood by "mantling" Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness, effectively becoming his successor. This transformation resolves the cosmic "Greymarch" cycle, a period of destruction in the Shivering Isles that was initiated by the curse put upon Jyggalag, the Daedric Prince of Order, by the other princes. The Hero of Kvatch even shows up in
  <em>
   Skyrim

  for a little wine and cheese with the new protagonist.

 <p>
  Whether it's being choked out by Pyramid Head or split in half by a Schism, there are seemingly endless ways to die in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise. While some of the older
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  titles aren't very inventive with their death animations (James falling to his knees in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  starts to get old), there's a lot to be said about some of the creative ways that characters can perish, especially in some of the newer series entries.

 <p>
  While some deaths occur from low health in combat scenarios, others play out depending on if the character obtains or uses certain items, fails to solve puzzles, or doesn't hit QTEs in time. Each monster attacks differently, so they have their own ways of harming—and even killing—the protagonist if players aren't careful.
  <strong>

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill 2
   </em>
   and its remake
  </strong>
  , it is not possible to save Maria from Pyramid Head and all her deaths are inevitable save for the last one, which is determined based on the player's actions throughout the game. In order to get the 'Maria' ending, in which Maria survives and leaves Silent Hill with James, the requirements are essentially to stick by Maria's side, ensure she doesn't get harassed by monsters, and refuse to read any of Mary's letters or examine Angela's knife.

 <p>
  Basically, James needs to make it look as though he's invested in Maria and cares about her well-being. When James and Maria are running from Pyramid Head in the hospital, Maria gets impaled by Pyramid Head's Great Knife right before entering the elevator to salvation. Maria's death is a canon event here, so it doesn't matter how fast James runs.

 <p>
  In the demo for
  <em>
   Silent Hills
  </em>
  , a project which sadly never saw the light of day, the player can be attacked by a ghost named Lisa. While it is possible to avoid Lisa entirely in
  <strong>
   <em>
    P.T.
   </em>
  </strong>
  , there are scripted segments where she can kill the protagonist and reset the corridor loop.

 <p>
  For example, when examining the radio on the dresser near the photograph, if the radio transmission says "look behind you" and the player does so, Lisa will spawn and incapacitate them. When Lisa appears before the protagonist, she lifts them off the ground and snaps their neck. Once this happens, they respawn in the starting room and the loop begins all over again.

  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill: The Short Message
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Anita struggles to evade a monster covered in cherry blossoms (officially dubbed "Sakura Head" by the
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  community) in an abandoned complex, which turns out to be a popular suicide spot for teenage girls. Whenever it appears, Sakura Head will relentlessly chase Anita with violent twitching and writhing movements, and will gain sudden bursts of speed to pursue her.

 <p>
  Anita cannot fight back against Sakura Head and instead must escape the labyrinthine structure in which it spawns. If Sakura Head catches Anita, it will drive its entire arm through her throat, similarly to how the Wendigo kills Samantha Giddings in
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  .

  Exclusive to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Silent Hill: Homecoming
   </strong>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Silent Hill: Book of Memories
  </em>
  , Schisms are lanky humanoid creatures with an elongated head resembling a mix between a hammerhead shark and a pendulum. Like Lickers in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise, Schisms are completely blind and rely on their other senses to find their prey.

  They cannot detect Alex if he moves quietly and keeps his flashlight turned off. If the Schism grabs Alex however, and he fails to release himself, it will use its razor-sharp head to slice him in half. Alex can avoid this gruesome fate but button-mashing when the prompt appears.

  Unlike many of the enemies in

Initially, Alex can distract the Bloodsucker using a blood pack found in the storage room, but when the creature reappears in the kitchen in Nowhere, Harry must ensure it remains trapped inside the fridge to avoid an untimely death.

  Harry can use the Ring of Contract to reinforce the chain around the fridge and keep the Bloodsucker contained. If he fails to do this, the Bloodsucker will emerge from inside the fridge, ensnare Harry, and drag him in.

  When Murphy Pendleton is navigating a large ventilation system in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Silent Hill: Downpour
   </em>
  </strong>
  , he can come across a few environmental hazards, namely some large rotating fans. Murphy must find ways to shut off the fans in order to progress safely, but if he tries to pass them without shutting them down, he will be sucked into the giant blades and blended up like a smoothie.

 <p>
  It's one of the more brutal deaths to come from
  <em>

  , which seems to have a special interest in utilizing spinning blades in a variety of gruesome ways. There's another segment where Harry slides down a water chute and must maneuver himself to avoid—of course—more spinning blades.

  In Room 203 of the Operating Theater, Alex finds a wall with a large hole in it from which blood continuously seeps. Alex needs to reach inside to obtain the Robbie toy, but if the player doesn't successfully complete the QTE sequence, Alex will get his arm ripped off by whatever monstrosity lives inside the bleeding wall. The Robbie toy can be used to unlock the gate to another corridor, at the end of which Alex finds an elevator.

  The Mirror Room is one of the most iconic locations from
  <em>
   Silent Hill 3
  </em>
  . When Heather enters the Mirror Room, a gurney in the corner of the room begins leaking blood, which reaches across the floor with spider-like tendrils. If Heather tries to leave, the door will be locked, forcing her to stay in the company of her own reflection for a while.

 <p>
  As the bleeding intensifies, the room grows darker. In order to escape the room, timing is key, as once Heather's reflection stops moving, she can rush back to the door and try it again. This time, it will open. However, if Heather remains in the Mirror Room for too long, she will collapse and die.

  James Sunderland has become one of the most recognizable protagonists in the video game horror genre ever since he first appeared in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Silent Hill 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  back in 2001. What makes James so fondly remembered by horror fans is how relatable he is as a character. He isn't a special agent sent in to clean up the streets of Silent Hill from monsters, but instead, is simply a troubled man whose overwhelming grief leads him down a long and very dark path.

 <p>
  Throughout this personal journey, James comes out with several quotes that have ended up being quite impactful, whether because they revealed a lot about the character or just the sick and twisted nature of Silent Hill itself. James has had his fair share of memorable lines throughout his respective game, but the ones listed below have stood the test of time as fan favorites since the release of the original
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  . Before jumping in, please be advised that this list will contain minor spoilers for the story of

  <em>
   Though the Silent Hill 2 Remake didn't take too many creative liberties with the story and characters, it still did an excellent job at improving upon everything that made the original so special. This most certainly includes James Sunderland himself who, while still very true to his original counterpart, has been fleshed out to feel a lot more relatable and sympathetic.

 <p>
  As a result, the man himself has thrown out a few extra quotes that go a long way in defining the character and providing a glimpse into why exactly he decided to wander back into Silent Hill in the first place.

 <p>
  Though he doesn't realize it until much later in the story,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  is all about James facing his guilty conscience, which includes him finding a way to punish himself for his past actions. Nowhere is this more clear than at the beginning of the game during James' baffling interaction with Angela. At first, James seems cautious about whether the Silent Hill town is dangerous or not, but after a moment, he realizes deep down, he doesn't care "If it's dangerous or not."

 <p>
  The truth is, James could be walking into a literal minefield, but the guilt that constantly hangs over his head has made him numb to the fear - pushing him to constantly put his life in danger as a form of self-punishment. It's a haunting line that provides an early indication of James' fractured mental state, and his numbness to the horrors that surround him.

  James utters this line during the new story cutscene between him and Maria in the
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  . After saying that she would lead James to an area where Mary might be waiting for him, the pair ends up arriving at a gloomy-looking Lady of the Water statue, which Maria proceeds to discuss the history of to a pretty miserable-looking James.

 <p>
  Unsatisfied with the situation, James, in a moment of frustration, says bluntly to Maria "She's not here," in reference to his late wife Mary. On the one hand, this is one of the rare moments in the remake where James shows raw emotion outside of his disillusionment, but it also references the fact that Mary isn't in
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  at all, something that James may have started realizing at this very moment.

  The
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  games don't often get much of a chance to insert comedy into their dark stories, but one hilarious bit of dialogue that has stuck with many fans over the years comes during James' talk with Eddie in the bowling alley. James, having just fought through hordes of horrific monsters, is shocked to see Eddie sitting down and enjoying a fresh box of pizza as if he's completely oblivious to what's happening in the town.

 <p>
  The truth is, while this line initially comes off as pretty funny, it's also a subtle bit of foreshadowing of Eddie's personal insecurities, and what drove him to Silent Hill in the first place. James was let off the hook this time, but things don't end quite as smoothly when he mocks Eddie about food later in the game.

 <p>
  This quote is said by James during his first encounter with Maria in the remake. Though the awkward exchange between the two is kept largely identical, this piece of dialogue is brand new, and it's fair to say that it's caused quite a bit of speculation online.

 <p>
  When Maria asks him about this "special place" that James is searching for, he proceeds to look into the foggy distance and says "There was something...I just" before Maria pops back into the frame. This seems to be an early indication that James is beginning to at least partly remember what happened to Mary before Maria comes in to "distract" him again. According to some people though, this could be a hint to the theory that the remake is actually a loop and that James is replaying the same memory over again.

 <p>
  At first, it might seem like James is the only sane person left in Silent Hill, especially after running into Angela and Eddie, but it doesn't take long to realize James too is also losing his grip on reality, despite how much he likes to claim he isn't. What makes this quote so chilling, aside from Guy Cihi's incredibly eerie vocal delivery, is the fact it shows James is truthfully uncertain about why he even came to Silent Hill, and why he's going through all of these 'trials' to find someone who he knows is already long gone.

 <p>
  It's also a subtle way to suggest to players that James is an unreliable narrator who could very well be making up all of this in his head. While this line is toned down a little in the remake when it comes to the line delivery, it still serves as an easy indication that James is far from a reliable narrator. Making James this vulnerable as a character is one of the many reasons why so many horror fans have come to see him as such an amazing protagonist.

 <p>
  On the surface, this quote might seem like an obvious statement if it were coming from anyone else, but for James, it says a lot about his conflicted mindset and hypocrisy. During his small monologue at the beginning of the game, James is constantly trying to convince himself the mysterious letter he received couldn't be from his wife, even going as far as to clarify to himself that "A dead person can't write a letter."
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":8,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":8,"nbrPlacementsScanned":8,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":995} -->

 <p>
  It's a clear indication of James' mind going back and forth on whether to believe his wife really could be out there somewhere, waiting for him in their "special place". Right from the get-go, the game reveals that James isn't exactly in the best state of mind for starting his journey, and it immediately creates a sense of mystery about the character, and forces players to question why he's honestly venturing into the depths of Silent Hill.

 <p>
  It's been well documented that the monsters in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  all act as metaphors for the underlying feelings and suppressed emotions of the characters, and for James, the Pyramid Head is an executioner who is constantly trying to kill him as a way to atone for his sins. Though the Pyramid Head makes several appearances throughout the story, it's not until the end of the game when two pop up at once that James finally realizes who they are, what they mean, and what he must do next.

 <p>
  Most players will start to piece these ideas in their head throughout their playthrough, but seeing James himself acknowledge his desire for punishment, and starting to stand up against it, is a very memorable and pretty epic moment in the series. What ensues after this classic quote is a brutal fight which is often seen as among one of the hardest in the game.

 <p>
  At the very end of the original
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  , James has one final confrontation with a horrifying creature that, at least initially, assumes the form of Mary. Despite this being a pivotal moment in the game, and the end of James' self-torment, the conversation ends pretty quickly in the original, but in the remake, it's been extended to feel like much more of an emotional gut punch.

 <p>
  James, having realized that he's been running from the truth all along, finally accepts that Mary is gone and that he "Can't just keep pretending" if he truly wants to move on with his life. After a dark and depressing journey, this single quote fills the player with the hope that maybe, just maybe, James has broken the illusion, so long as they get one of the good endings, at least.

 <p>
  Though it's only a single word, this quote is said by James many times throughout
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  , and it's emblematic of his confusion of current events, and his denial of the past. James is always chasing his wife, Mary, even though he knows deep down she's gone, and as a result, he manages to see glimpses of his late wife in a new character who looks just like her, that being Maria.

 <p>
  James mistakenly calls Maria Mary on a few occasions throughout the game, and it's as if he's desperately trying to convince himself that he's found her, even though the two women have completely different personalities. It can also feel as though James is speaking to his wife directly when bringing up her name, which becomes much more relevant in the later stages of the story where he does finally manage to make peace with himself after talking with her one final time.

   <strong>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </strong>
  </em>
  , usually abbreviated as
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  , is another game by
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  developer, HoYoverse. However, unlike
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  is set in a different universe outside the Honkaiverse.
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  storyline takes place in New Eridu, a futuristic metropolis where people live after surviving the apocalypse called the Hollows. This disaster generates anomalies in the dimensions and causes monsters called Ethereal to appear, creating an immense number of casualties within humanity.

  In
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , players are renowned Proxy under the code name
  <strong>
   Phaethon
  </strong>
  . However, due to unexpected circumstances, the protagonist must scrap all their hard work and rebuild their reputation under a new alias. A Proxy is someone who guides Hollow Raiders inside the Hollow. Phaethon does their job by syncing with a Bangboo and entering the Hollow, leading the Hollow Raiders from the safety of their headquarters.

 <p>
  Bangboo is an AI device originally made to help people evacuate from the Hollow apocalypse. However, after the residents established stability, Bangboo is now used for more diverse roles to help in daily life. In
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  , players can get Bangboo by "pulling" them from a banner, but unlike with characters, this act will not cost precious Polychromes. This means the resource can be used for better purposes, such as getting new Agents or refilling Battery (energy). Other than through daily missions and quests, players can also earn goodies from redeem codes. Therefore, this article will serve as a place where Proxies can check for new
  <strong>
   <em>
    ZZZ
   </em>
   codes
  </strong>
  whenever they become available.

  Just like in other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, players must redeem a code before receiving rewards. Fortunately, in
  <em>
   Boxing Beta
  </em>
  , this is not difficult and should take only a few seconds. Here are the steps to follow to redeem a code:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
   on the device and open it in
   <em>
    Boxing Beta
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Pay attention to the left side of the screen. Among all the other icons at the very bottom, there will be a button Codes.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click on the Codes button.
  </li>
  <li>
   An input field will appear on the screen where users need to enter the code manually or copy and paste it. Be careful, because if the code is entered incorrectly, there will be no rewards.
  </li>
  <li>
   When the code is entered, click the REDEEM button to receive the rewards specified in the description.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In just a few minutes, gamers can activate all the codes and get the available bonuses. It is worth noting that the codes listed above will expire soon, so users should follow the updates and this article to get more new codes.

      <title>Fortnite Festival Could Be the Perfect Blueprint for One Classic PlayStation Franchise's Revival</title>

    <strong>
     Fortnite
    </strong>
   </em>
   has evolved far beyond its early battle royale days. Epic Games' hit multiplayer game has quickly become a juggernaut in the industry, boasting a continuously growing roster of multiple games in one setting. From LEGO Fortnite to Fortnite Festival, the meteoric rise of
   <em>

  The popularity of
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  has greatly influenced the gaming landscape, and the newer modes that continue to be included in the game are likely to inspire other developers. Fortnite Festival may not be an original idea, but it serves as a reminder of how fun rhythm games can be. This genre has been pushed aside in recent years, but Fortnite Festival makes a case for its return. Of course,
  <em>
   Guitar Hero
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rock Band
  </em>
  are some of the most notable rhythm games, but Fortnite Festival could set the stage for a classic PlayStation franchise revival;

  Showcasing a PlayStation Classic in a Fresh Light
 </h3>
 <p>
  It's been a long time since
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  made waves. An ill-fated remaster was released back in 2017, but there has yet to be a fresh take on the franchise.
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  continues to be a charming reminder of how far games have come since the 90s. Its colorful cartoon aesthetic and simple rhythm controls made it a pioneer in the genre, and taking an online multiplayer route with the title could be the perfect way to bring the PlayStation icon back from the grave.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it could be possible for
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  to eventually collaborate with
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  in Fortnite Festival, Sony going the extra mile and bringing its own full-blown online multiplayer rhythm experience could serve as fun competition. Bringing back
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  's cast of characters with overhauled mechanics has the potential to breathe new life into the series. There may not be much room for
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  in the world of premium games anymore, but a free-to-play multiplayer entry where players can rack up in-game rewards may work wonders.

      The first
      <em>
       PaRappa the Rapper
      </em>
      game was released in 1997, and its sequel launched in 2001. Although the series has received ports, a third installment has yet to be released.

  Fortnite Festival's approach to the rhythm genre has set up a solid formula to bring back players with its continuously added content. Although
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's embrace of microtransactions can be controversial,
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  could compete with this by making most of its awards more easily achievable through building XP instead of in-game currency and purchases. Instead, more traditional microtransactions could be spared for the most exclusive content, like major hit songs.

  The Legacy of PaRappa the Rapper Lives On

 <p>
  While
  <em>

  may not boast a long history of releases, its influence on the industry cannot be mistaken. From
  <em>
   PaRappa
  </em>
  's cameo in
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  to helping pioneer the entire rhythm genre,
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  holds icon status for a good reason. It's unclear if
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  will ever get a second chance at making a statement in the industry, but there could also be a surprise waiting on the horizon.

     There was even a

  Over the summer, there were rumors making rounds on the internet that a new
  <em>
   PaRappa the Rapper
  </em>
  starring Playboi Carti was being developed by Sony, but this remains unconfirmed. Since rumors and leaks should be taken with a grain of salt, such a revival still seems unlikely at the moment, but one can always hope.

  The Decades Challenge
  <em>
  </em>
  is a popular legacy challenge where players guide their Sims through the eras, starting in the 1890s and advancing decade by decade while adapting to the changing historical norms, technology, and lifestyles of the times. This unique
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  challenge emphasizes creativity, storytelling, and historical accuracy, requiring players to mimic real-world events and societal shifts.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the base game provides a foundation, mods can enhance the experience by adding realism, historical details, and new mechanics tailored to specific time periods. From custom careers and traits to reimagined worlds and intricate gameplay systems, mods help players dive deeper into their historical narratives. These tools bring added depth and immersion, allowing for more engaging and authentic gameplay as Sims evolve through the decades.

  The

   All Worlds Are Residential
  </strong>
  mod unlocks the ability to turn any destination world in
  <em>
   The Sims 4

  into a residential haven for Sims. Whether it's settling in the serene wilderness of Granite Falls or embracing the rich history of Selvadorada, players can now create homes in worlds previously reserved for vacations and outdoor adventures.
 </p>
 <p>
  This flexibility is invaluable for storytellers recreating different eras, as it expands the variety of settings where Sims can live and thrive. Instead of limiting Sims to modern neighborhoods, players can fully immerse themselves in unique and time-appropriate environments. From remote cabins to ancient villages, this mod ensures Sims' homes perfectly complement their evolving narratives.

  The
  <strong>
   Historical Mods
  </strong>
  are a game-changer for anyone looking to add depth and realism to their historical gameplay. With seven distinct mods, this collection enhances the challenge by removing modern conveniences and introducing historically inspired mechanics. From Candles Last Twice, which extends the life of handmade candles, to Mop the Dust, which replaces vacuums with manual cleaning, these mods ensure Sims live authentically within the constraints of their time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Deadly Dickensian Sicknesses mod adds a dramatic layer of risk with four Victorian-era diseases, while No Fire Insurance forces Sims to bear the financial burden of fire damage, just as they would in the past. Whether it’s manually weeding gardens or contending with blighted crops, these mods immerse players in the hardships and triumphs of a bygone age, making historical storytelling richer and more engaging.

  The
  <strong>
   Handcrafted Dyes &amp; Wool
  </strong>
  mod is a fantastic addition for Sims pursuing creative hobbies in the Decades Challenge, whether in the early eras or modern ones. By removing the need for computers, this mod stays true to historical immersion while allowing Sims to craft dyes for knitting, cross-stitching, and fabricating.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the new Homestead Helper Basket, Sims can create natural dyes on a stove, adding a hands-on element to their crafting routine. This mod fits perfectly with the self-sufficient lifestyle of earlier decades, while also serving as a meaningful tradition for Sims in later generations. It’s a beautiful way to blend creativity, history, and storytelling across time.

  The
  <strong>
   Hunting &amp; Foraging
  </strong>
  mod is perfect for the earliest decades of the challenge, where Sims must rely on nature to survive. This immersive mod lets Sims explore new areas, like "The Forest" for hunting, "The Mountains" for mining, and "The Docks" for fishing and gathering water.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the new Hunting and Foraging skills, Sims can provide for their families by catching rabbits, gathering herbs, and crafting supplies. The dynamic weather system adds realism, as harsh winters make food harder to come by. Whether crafting bait at the Hunter’s Crafting Table or foraging for essential resources, this mod captures the struggle and resourcefulness of life before modern conveniences.

  This mod simplifies one of the most pivotal aspects of historical challenges: sending Sims off to war. Designed with rules like those in the Decades Challenge in mind, it allows Sims to register for the draft, leave for a few days, and return with their fate decided by a 50/50 chance of survival. Surviving Sims earn the Veteran trait, complete with a weekly pension and emotional depth through occasional negative moodlets.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Sims who don't make it, the game delivers an impactful goodbye as they pass away at home. Beyond the challenge, the
  <strong>
   Enlist In War Mod
  </strong>
  enhances storytelling and roleplay, offering players a meaningful way to explore the emotional and generational effects of war on their Sims and their legacies. Rather than relying on cheats and a low-risk military career, players can use this mod to aid their journey with this challenge.

  For a deeply immersive experience, the
  <strong>
   Child Birth Mod
  </strong>
  lets players explore the evolution of pregnancy and childbirth throughout history. From home births and natural deliveries in earlier eras to the advent of cesarean sections and modern medical interventions, this mod mirrors the changes in how labor and pregnancy have been managed over the decades.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sims can host gender reveal parties or attend Lamaze classes, capturing the growing cultural significance of pregnancy milestones in modern times. Beyond the birth itself, traditions like playing music for the baby bump or celebrating the arrival of a newborn reflect the timeless joy of family. This mod enhances realism and storytelling for historical challenges by tying pregnancy experiences to the era-specific practices and customs that define each generation.

 <p>
  South Korean publisher
  <strong>
   Krafton Inc.
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  has laid out its 2025 business strategy, outlining its intended approach to management, resource allocation, IP acquisition, first-party game development, and more. Krafton serves as both publisher and parent company to
  <em>
   PUBG: Battlegrounds
  </em>
  , the hugely successful battle royal game developed by its subsidiary PUBG Studios.
 </p>
 <p>
  The games industry giant, which is currently valued at over $10 Billion USD, has acquired a number of studios and IPs since its 2018 inception and has had a hand in the development and release of a wide range of titles, including
  <em>
   The Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   [REDACTED]
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   New State Mobile
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Moonbreaker
  </em>
  . Krafton also recently bought out the shuttered Tango Gameworks, formerly under Microsoft control, along with the right to any future games in the
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  During a company-wide town hall meeting onJanuary 16, 2025, Krafton announced its plans to expand first-party production in an effort to secure new franchise IPs. The company intends to step up investment in its 14 creative studios to increase its output of new releases and entice industry talent. Alongside an expanded slate of new releases, the company is also looking to incorporate so-called "Second Party Publishing and Licensing" tactics as it seeks to grow existing user bases for both new and current IPs, like Krafton's upcoming
  <em>
   Subnautica 2
  </em>
  , from Unknown Worlds.

  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  Citing "mid-to-long-term objectives and sustainable growth" as key motivators, the company also outlined its intentions to change up its management system and prioritize efficiency in its resource allocation across the entire development lifecycle. As stated by CEO Kim Chang-han, “Our new titles will officially launch starting this year. We are fully committed to securing a new ‘Big Franchise IP’ that will build on the success of
  <em>
   PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS
  </em>
  ."
 </p>
 <p>
  With Krafton's realistic life simulator
  <em>
   i
  </em>
  <em>
   nZOI
  </em>
  announced at Gamescom 2024, and mobile versions of
  <em>
   Dark and Darker
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  in development due to recent Krafton partnerships, the company looks to be gearing up for a significant expansion across a variety of markets. The diversification of interests and reluctance to rely on its flagship IPs could also be seen as insurance against the games industry contraction of 2023-24.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the critical failure of Krafton's
  <em>
   Callisto Protocol
  </em>
  , the company seems well-positioned to continue its steady increase in market value. Its recent investments in a number of new studios and non-gaming ventures point toward a company that's both able to absorb the occasional misstep and primed to maintain its track record of expansion. What exactly its new banner IP will look like is hard to tell, given the broad array of genres it's dabbled in thus far, but whatever it is will likely arrive with fanfare that's difficult to miss.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set to see Goro Majima headline a game once again, this time as an amnesiac pirate captain sailing around the Hawaiian islands. The wacky premise and tone of
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  are fitting for the character, and serve as a nice contrast to the much more emotional stories of the previous games in the series,
  <em>
   Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  . However, this doesn't mean a serious game starring Majima could never work, and one fan-favorite entry in the franchise proves this.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Recently, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto claimed in an interview with TheGamer that "you can't make a serious Majima game" and that any game made around him is going to be over the top. While it's largely true that Majima is one of the franchise's most over-the-top characters,
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  showed a much more subdued side of him that helped elevate him to the fan-favorite character he is today. Ignoring the success of Majima's story in
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  does a disservice to the character, and he shouldn't be disqualified from having a more serious game again in the future.

  Majima's Yakuza 0 Portrayal Shows the Character Can Be at His Best with a Serious Tone
 </h3>
 <p>
  While fans have become accustomed to Majima's antics over the years due to his portrayal as the Mad Dog of Shimano, he hasn't always carried this persona.
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  serves as a prequel to the series wherein Majima is forced to play the role of cabaret club owner as a punishment for his failure during the infamous Ueno Siwa Hit. During this time, Majima takes on his Lord of the Night persona, leaning into the suave club owner and bowing to the whims of club patrons in order to earn enough money to wipe away his debut and rejoin the Tojo Clan.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite first portraying Majima as a wacky side character through his Majima Everywhere side quest in the original
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  game, the growth his character undergoes during the events of
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  shows he has the potential to be far more well-rounded than the one-dimensional over-the-top character the series tends to portray him as. In fact, it's through his efforts to protect Makoto Makimura, rather than assassinate her as he was ordered to do, that Majima grows into a character that many fans find far more interesting than he was previously. His Mad Dog persona largely grew out of a response to feeling caged by his duties at the Grand Cabaret in Sotenbori, and other glimpses of a serious Majima can be seen in flashbacks throughout the series.

  Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's Amnesia Plot Would Have Been Perfect for a Serious Majima Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Mad Dog persona has started slipping again in the post-Great Dissolution era of
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  , and an aging Majima working as a fisherman alongside Saejima and Dojima in Hokkaido looks far different from the zany character of the series' past. With Majima waking up on Rich Island with amnesia at the start of
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  , it would make sense for his Mad Dog persona to have slipped away even more. Instead,
  <em>
   Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  seems to double down on this persona, which while fun for many fans, misses the opportunity to tell another serious Majima story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without the knowledge of his past to motivate the Mad Dog, seeing Majima regress into his pre-
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  personality would have delivered an interesting take on the character. It's not often that players get to see that version of Majima, so even if
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii
  </em>
  does not embrace that side, another prequel game starring Majima should still be on the table in the future.

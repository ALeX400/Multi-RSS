      <title>Final Fantasy 14 Mobile's Leaked UI Can't Be Restricted to One Platform</title>

 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14 Mobile
   </em>
  </strong>
  is, as its name suggests, a mobile game adaptation of the hit MMO
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  <em>
   Online
  </em>
  . It's a bit of an anomaly in Square Enix's portfolio, considering the publisher generally doesn't release iOS/Android versions of its modern AAA console games. There have been mainline
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games on mobile phones before, of course, but the majority of them are ports of older entries, like the
  <em>
   FF Pixel Remasters
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14 Mobile
  </em>
  , on the other hand, is less like the
  <em>
   Pixel Remasters
  </em>
  and more like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15: Pocket Edition
  </em>
  . In other words, it's more of a new, standalone game inspired by the console title of the same name, rather than a one-to-one port.

  When
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14 Mobile
  </em>
  was officially announced by Square Enix and developer LightSpeed Studios in November 2024, no gameplay footage was released. The only thing that was shared was a four-minute teaser trailer that mostly showed in-game cinematics and developer commentaries. However, earlier this month, some screenshots from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14 Mobile
  </em>
  's closed beta tests were leaked online, giving players their first, unofficial look at the game in action. Unsurprisingly,
  <em>
   FF14 Mobile
  </em>
  's gameplay looks very similar to that of
  <em>
   FF14
  </em>
  <em>
   Online
  </em>
  , but it seems to feature some new UI elements that make it stand out.

     Square Enix dropped an official gameplay reveal trailer for

     </em>
     on December 9, thus confirming the legitimacy of the leaks.

  Final Fantasy 14 Mobile Uses Ability Wheels Instead of Cross Hotbars
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14 Mobile
  </em>
  's leaked screenshots don't really show off any combat or NPC interactions, but they do provide an in-depth look at the game's menus. The UI clearly takes a lot of inspiration from the original
  <em>
   FF14
  </em>
  ; not only does it have a minimap in the upper right corner of the screen, it also has HP and MP bars right at the very bottom. The one aspect of
  <em>
   FF14 Mobile
  </em>
  's UI that differs, however, is its hotbar layout. In the bottom right corner of the screen, there appears to be an ability wheel that players can use to access skills and perform attacks. This UI element seems to be a replacement for the cross hotbars in
  <em>
   FF14 Online
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Cross hotbars, for those who are unaware, are UI elements unique to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14 Online
  </em>
  that are meant to make playing with a controller easier, especially on consoles. Players can utilize the cross hotbars to access the skills they want to use during combat (and other situations), without having to sift through tons of menus. To put it bluntly, they're basically just advanced versions of shortcut keys, much like the ability wheels from
  <em>
   FF14 Mobile
  </em>
  . Each cross hotbar has 16 individual skill slots, and there are a total of 8 cross hotbars in
  <em>
   FF14 Online
  </em>
  . As such, players can technically use up to 128 slots at any given time.
 </p>
 <h3 id="ability-wheels-would-be-easier-to-use-on-a-controller-compared-to-cross-hotbars">
  Ability Wheels Would Be Easier to Use on a Controller Compared to Cross Hotbars
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although cross hotbars do convert the MMO keyboard-and-mouse experience to controllers quite well, they're still a bit finicky to use. In order to select one of the skills in these hotbars, players need to hold one of the LT or RT buttons (L1 or R1 on PlayStation) on their controllers and press either a face or D-pad button. The use of button combinations does allow for more intricate control schemes, but it makes the
  <em>
   FF14 Online
  </em>
  gameplay experience less user-friendly on consoles.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14 Mobile
  </em>
  's ability wheels seem like they would work far better on consoles than the cross hotbars. If players could select a skill by holding down a button and moving a thumbstick around in a certain direction, playing
  <em>
   FF14 Online
  </em>
  on a controller would probably become a lot easier.
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Therefore, Square Enix should consider adding
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14 Mobile
   </em>
  </strong>
  's new control layout to the original
  <em>
   FF14
  </em>
  sometime in the near future, at least on current-gen consoles.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon TCG Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  has just launched its latest mass outbreak event, offering players new opportunities to collect Electric-type Pokemon cards. This time-limited event gives
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  players increased chances to get specific Pokemon cards they may be needing for their collections.
 </p>
 <p>
  For those unfamiliar,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  is a mobile adaptation of the
  <em>
   Pokemon Trading Card Game
  </em>
  . Players can collect and battle with their favorite Pokemon cards, taking on both AI challengers and real opponents worldwide. While
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  is free to play, players can purchase various items in-game, from cosmetic elements to extra boosters to open in hopes of collecting a rare card. Less than a month after its initial release in October 30, Pokemon TCG Pocket made over $120 million, and its popularity shows no sign of slowing down.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  launched a Electric-Type mass outbreak, focusing on adding electrifying new cards to playersâ€™ decks. During the event, players will have an increased chance of encountering and obtaining Electric-type Pokemon cards, like Zapdos, Magnemite, Helioptile, or the most famous Electric-type Pokemon of them all, Pikachu. Players can get these cards through Bonus Picks and Rare Picks in the Wonder Pick pool. On top of these cards, this Electric-type Pokemon mass outbreak event comes with six missions to complete, granting Wonder Hourglasses and Shop Tickets upon completion. This mass outbreak in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  will run from December 26, 2024 to January 1, 2025.

  This isnâ€™t the first time

  has held a mass outbreak event. Earlier this year,

  introduced a Fire Pokemon-themed mass outbreak, starring the cards of pocket monsters like Moltres, Charizard, and Arcanine ex. Similar to the Electric-Type mass outbreak, the Fire event featured unique rewards, collectible cards, and a series of in-game tasks to complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking ahead, fans of
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  can hope for more events and extra cards to add to their collection. A recent
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  leak revealed plans for late 2024 and early 2025, accurately teasing the Mythical Island-themed PvP event and this mass outbreak of Electric-type Pokemon. According to the leak, the next major event in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  will take place from January 1 to 15, with a new Solo Battle event and a Blastoise promotional card. The next mass outbreak event is reportedly set for January 23, starring Psychic-type Pokemon and an exclusive Mex ex card.

  Several
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  players have expressed their disappointment with the Rediscover Kanto spawn pool changes, which has been around since April 2024. Some
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  fans feel like the gameâ€™s spawn system could use a serious update.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Rediscover Kanto event was introduced as part of a larger
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  update that brought various quality-of-life improvements. This update refreshed biomes, making specific Pokemon appear in settings similar to their natural habitats. Rediscover Kanto makes Generation 1 Pokemon appear more often, giving players more opportunities to catch creatures like Mankey, Machop, Rattata, or Koffing. It changed the spawn pool of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  accordingly, featuring more of these Pokemon compared to other creatures.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eight months after its debut, the Rediscover Kanto is starting to wear on
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players. While it was made as a way for players to relive nostalgic memories, it appears that the same Kanto Pokemon keep appearing, preventing players from capturing other creatures. Players on Reddit have been voicing their frustration, pointing out how the overwhelming presence of Kanto Pokemon in the wild is making it tough to find newer or more diverse Pokemon. For some, this has made gameplay feel stale, particularly for veteran players who have long completed their Pokedex for the Kanto region.

  Pokemon GO Players Disappointed With 'Rediscover Kanto'
 </h2>
 <p>
  This isnâ€™t the first time Niantic has faced criticism over the spawn pool changes brought by Rediscover Kanto. Players already expressed disappointment over the heavy Gen 1 focus, with many feeling it alienated those interested in catching Pokemon from later generations. While some appreciated the accessible tasks and rewards, others argued that the eventâ€™s extended duration took away opportunities for more balanced spawn rotations. Some
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players also expressed concerns about the Rediscover Kanto Special Research tasks, finding them daunting or outright boring.

 <p>
  Players have also raised concerns about other spawn-related issues, such as the lack of variety in Pokemon spawns during the holiday season. Many expected Ice-type Pokemon to dominate the event, but instead found themselves swarmed with less festive creatures, as Dark and Poison-type Pokemon dominated spawn points.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players expressed their concerns to Niantic, as they hoped for more holiday-themed creatures and more variety in the Pokemon they can capture throughout the year.

  The success of the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series debut on Prime Video earlier this year has managed to not only elevate the IP, but the popularity of the universe's distinct post-apocalyptic locations. Through featuring a focus on the West Coast of the United States largely unseen since Bethesda obtained the rights to the games, the well-received
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  TV show has more in common with the early days of isometric RPGs than newer titles in several ways. As
  <strong>
   <em>

  show is set in Los Angeles, bringing a new spin to the series' Californian origins. After several games set in the East Coast changed the perception of the series, a return to a sunnier, arid environment juxtaposed with corruptions of recognizable urban landscapes has yielded a measurable spike in popularity for the Fallout franchise as a whole.

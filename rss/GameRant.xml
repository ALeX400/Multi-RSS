  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has created a detailed version of Kansas City, revealing what the real-world location would look like in the blocky game. Over the years since
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  was released, fans have taken what’s possible in the game to new levels. For example, this recreation of Kansas City involved the player developing software to make this version of the city possible, and the community has taken notice.

 <p>
  It is no wonder
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  has become many players’ go-to game for building almost whatever they can imagine.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  features numerous blocks and items, and Mojang continues to add even more content to the game through updates. In addition, mods and other fan-related content have broadened what is possible in the game even further, resulting in numerous building projects by artistic and architecturally minded players.

 <p>
  One of the latest building projects was shared on Reddit by a user known as AtmosphericBeats. As illustrated in an image, the player had recreated Kansas City in the blocky world of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , complete with numerous details. The city recreation was on a 1:1 scale, featuring skyscrapers and many smaller buildings composing the downtown region. Beyond this central area, AtmosphericBeats included the suburbs, with numerous roads weaving among the structures. Patches of grass and trees, presumably for parks and other open areas, also dotted the landscape.

 <p>
  After uploading the Kansas City recreation to Reddit, many fans took notice, with some wondering how long it took to build. In the comments, AtmosphericBeats revealed that the
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  version of Kansas City was made using software they had developed over the past four months. According to the Reddit user, this custom software allowed them to create the city in only 36 hours, noting that the process was “fully automated.” In addition, AtmosphericBeats detailed the creation process, noting the software "uses the data from various sources including OpenStreetMap and USGS to create a Minecraft World with buildings, roads, and natural features based on the data" to help create a "more realistic" environment. They also provided a download link and more details about the project in the comments section of the Reddit post.

  It is worth pointing out that this is not the first city that AtmosphericBeats has recreated in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  . They previously showcased in-game versions of Baltimore and Anchorage City, to name a few. In addition to AtmosphericBeats recreations, numerous other players have used
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  to make blocky versions of real-life locations and objects. Recently, one player built France’s Eiffel Tower in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , while others have generated incredible custom environments in the game.

 <p>
  As these creations evidence,
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  features nearly limitless creativity for gamers. This freedom to build whatever comes to mind is a significant reason for the game's continued success. Considering the ample real-world locations still waiting to be built in
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , players like AtmosphericBeats could continue to recreate cities and landmarks for many years.

  's trials are an important part of the game, although the story's level of difficulty might not be enough for some players. For those who want to face the game's amazing bosses in more challenging fights, there are the Extreme trials. These trials add more mechanics and demand more precision to complete successfully.

  To unlock every Extreme trial that
  <em>
   Endwalker
  </em>
  added, the most obvious requirement will be to
  <strong>
   reach level 90 with one of the combat jobs.
  </strong>
  Keep in mind that each trial also has a necessary item level in order for the player to access it, with the highest item level required being 640. It's also important to note that you must complete each trial before the Extreme version is available. This can be achieved through completing the Main Scenario Quests. The last quest necessary for all trials to be available is "Down in the Dark."

 <p>
  It's very simple to access the Extreme trials, as all of them are unlocked in the same place. Speak to the
  <strong>
   Wandering Minstrel
  </strong>
  (X: 12.7, Y: 14.3) in Old Sharlayan (Scholar's Harbor is the nearest aethernet shard) and pick up the quest
  <strong>
   "I Wandered Sharlayan as a Minstrel."
  </strong>
  There are no steps to complete this quest; just talking to the NPC will initiate it and complete it.

  After that, it will be necessary to speak to this character each time you want to unlock one of the Extreme trials. By interacting with him, different dialogue options will appear. Choose to talk about each boss to unlock the corresponding trial. For example, to unlock The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall, choose the option "Talk about Zodiark." This is all it takes to unlock the more challenging version of the trial. The same goes for every other trial; for example, if you choose to "Talk about Zeromus," this will unlock The Abyssal Fracture (Extreme).

 <p>
  Pride Demons are one of the most difficult types of demons in the game and pose as a tough challenge for anyone. There are some Pride Demons that are named, and these are among the hardest ones that players can face. There are quite a few Pride Demons that are found in the game, including during the quests
  <strong>
   "All New, Faded for Her," "Way of the Tempest," "The Wrath of Heaven," and "Here Lies the Abyss."
  </strong>
  However, these are not the only Pride Demons that will show up in the game. One terrifying thing about these demons is that they can make themselves appear like humans, making them hard to spot sometimes, allowing them to shock the player.

 <p>
  Pride Demons can be a tough opponent, especially on the
  <strong>
   Nightmare difficulty
  </strong>
  . Thankfully, if players know what they're doing, it isn't as difficult as it first seems to be. The truth is, fighting these enemies can sometimes take a lot of micromanaging the party that is with the player in order to ensure that they can be defeated. Players will want to use whatever companions they have with them to their advantage. Here's the best strategy for dealing with the one at the beginning of the game (and this works with others as well).

 <ul>
  <li>
   Ensure that the Auto Barrier is turned off for Solas. This allows players to switch to him and cast it when it is needed.
  </li>
  <li>
   Also, have Solas stay wherever is best for the player. (It can be helpful to do this with Varric as well.)
   <ul>
    <li>
     Have them both take on any spawns that the Pride Demon summons. This will also keep the spawns off the player if they are disrupting the Rift.
    </li>
    <li>
     Use Barrier on them both whenever they need one. If the player knows Barrier, then it will be easier than just having Solas with the spell.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Make sure that Cassandra is the one tanking the Pride Demon; that way, it will not attack the player.
   <ul>
    <li>
     Use Barrier on Cassandra when needed.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Constantly disrupting the Rift is so important. It will stun the Pride Demon and cause it to take damage, which is how it can be killed.
  </li>
 </ul>

    <p>
     Some players who have had difficulty with this say that if players just zip around the area and constantly disrupt the Rift while their party deals with all the enemies, they have had success. If all else fails, trying this strategy may allow players to defeat this enemy.

  In

  , each of the classes allows players access to different abilities that will prove useful in their adventure. The Monk is a hand-to-hand combat class that enhances its capabilities by using Ki, the Life Energy found in all things. Each of the Monk's subclasses utilizes Ki differently and gains different special abilities to use in combat and when exploring the world.

  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  offers three subclasses for the Monk. The Way of the Open Hand focuses Ki to disrupt enemies and strengthen the Monk, able to modify their "Flurry of Blows" and weaponize the Ki within other creatures to destroy them from within. The Way of Shadow Monk uses Ki to become a master of stealth, manipulating shadows to blind foes and silence spellcasters or even to step through shadows and deliver a blow that strikes a creature's mind. Finally, The Way of the Four Elements allows them to focus their Ki into elemental magic, blanketing their foes with fire and lightning or obstructing their foes with ice.

   Now that Baldur's Gate 3 has been out for a while and players have tracked down all of the best magic items, it's important to re-examine each subclass and consider the gear that works best for them. This guide has been updated to include suggestions for Act 3 Equipment that enhances each of the subclasses, with appropriately labeled sections to help players avoid spoilers while reading the guide.

  By choosing The Way of the Open Hand at level 3, the Monk immediately gains three new Flurry of Blows variants. These allow the Monk to rob a foe of their reactions, push them back, or knock them prone when performing their Flurry of Blows. At level 6 they gain three "Manifestation" skills: Body, Mind, and Spirit. These allow the Monk to add Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant Damage to their strikes, allowing them to deal additional damage and exploit the weaknesses of certain foes. This is also the level where they gain "Wholeness of Body", allowing them to spend an action to heal and regain half their Ki Points.

 <p>
  At level 9, the Way of the Open Hand Monk will gain Ki Resonation. This allows them to strike a foe with an attack that causes their Ki to resonate with that of the Monk as an Action or Bonus Action. Afterward, they can use Ki Resonation: Blast to detonate a foe whose Ki is resonating for 3d6 Force damage, which also hits all foes within 5m of the creature. Finally, at level 11, they gain Tranquility. This gives them the benefits of the Sanctuary spell after taking a long rest, preventing foes from targeting them until they attack or otherwise harm a creature.

 <p>
  When running a pure Monk, without dipping into any other classes, The Way of the Open Hand is probably the strongest option available. Their manifestations allow them to dish out tremendous damage and exploit enemy weaknesses, with Psychic damage, in particular, being very rarely resisted. Radiant damage proves invaluable during Act 2, where undead and other dark creatures are prevalent, and Necrotic damage is typically useful against anything that isn't dead. By collecting Radiant Orb equipment during Acts 1 and 2, players can impose an attack penalty on enemies simply by striking them with Radiant damage and further amplify the Open Hand Monk's defensive abilities. As with all Monk variants, the Kushigo Item Set will also prove highly effective.

  In Act 3 you can pick up the pieces of the "Soul" armor set, which is designed for Monks and can be an excellent late-game choice. The Mask of Soul Perception (found in a Locked Chest, in Helskir's Room, on the upper floor of the Devil's Fee) grants +2 to attack rolls, initiative rolls, and perception checks, while also allowing you to cast Detect Thoughts once per short rest. The Vest of Soul Rejuvenation (Sold by Rolan or Lorroakan's Projection in Sorcerous Sundries) provides a +2 AC bonus, restores HP whenever you succeed a saving throw against a spell, and allows you to spend your reaction to counterattack with an unarmed strike whenever somebody misses you with a melee attack. Finally, the Gloves of Soul Catching (rewarded at the end of the "Save Hope" quest) give you a +2 Constitution Bonus, 1d10 Force Damage on unarmed strikes, and restores 10HP once per turn when you land an Unarmed Strike. You can also forego that healing to gain advantage on attack rolls and all saving throws until the end of your next turn.

  The Way of Shadow Monk gains access to four "Shadow Arts" at level 3. These allow the Shadow Monk to Hide as a Bonus action and cast the following spells: Pass Without Trace, Darkness, Darkvision, &amp; Silence. This gives them incredible utility for manipulating and evading their foes, aided further by them automatically learning "Minor Illusion" as a cantrip. At level 5 they gain Cloak of Shadows, allowing them to use their action to turn invisible if they are currently obscured. Simply being out of an enemy's line of sight or otherwise in shadow should suffice, and the Darkness spell can be the perfect cover for using this.

  At level 6 they gain Shadowstep, allowing them to teleport from shadow to shadow (teleport while hidden) as a bonus action and gain advantage on their next attack roll when doing so. Since this doesn't cost anything except a bonus action, they can essentially always have an advantage on their next attack roll when the area isn't brightly lit. Finally, at level 11, they gain Shadow Strike. This allows them to teleport to a foe from a hidden position and attack immediately, dealing their normal attack damage and an additional 3d8 psychic damage.

  This subclass is decent on its own, but also performs excellently when paired with a few Rogue levels. Players looking to maximize their damage output should grab 3-4 levels of Rogue and take the Thief Subclass, gaining an additional bonus action that can be used on Flurry of Blows or unarmed strikes. This will also provide them with the ability to dash, disengage, and hide with a bonus action without spending any Ki Points, giving them more to spend on their Flurry of Blows. As mentioned earlier, the Kushigo Item Set works well on Monks, but here are some other great options:

 <p>
  Players taking the levels in rogue gain proficiency in light armor, which can allow them to utilize equipment like the Spidersilk Armor and the Shadeclinger Armor for better AC. They can use the Knife of the Undermountain King for improved critical hits on their main-hand attacks, and it additionally boosts effectiveness against obscured targets, which is useful when the subclass is all about taking advantage of darkness.

 <p>
  Players looking to take advantage of being obscured or fighting enemies in darkness should also look for the Covert Cowl, Ring of Twilight, Shadow-Cloaked Ring, and Shadow Blade Ring. They might also get some great utility out of the "Least Expected" bow and Shifting Corpus Ring.

  When entering Act 3, you can pick up Sarevok's Helm from the Murder Tribunal (just casually beat up the villain of Baldur's Gate, it'll be fine) to further enhance your critical hit capabilities. Viconia's Priestess Robe (acquired by beating Viconia DeVir during the "Daughter of Darkness" questline) also pairs well with this subclass, granting advantage on stealth checks and giving a +2 bonus to all saving throws whenever you're under the effect of the Shield of Faith spell. It also provides +1 AC while still being treated as clothing, allowing you to use Unarmored Defense. You can also consider equipping Bloodthirst and Crimson Mischief, Orin the Red's weapons, to provide a critical boost and deal extra damage against enemies at half health or less.

  The Way of the Four Elements Monk learns to use their Ki to cast spells from a small pool of elemental spells. At level 3 they choose three spells to learn and additionally gain "Harmony of Fire and Water." The latter allows them to regain half their Ki Points (rounded down) whenever they aren't in combat, helping them to retain access to their spells even after a long dungeon. At levels 6 and 9 they gain a new spell from the list. They also gain "Improved Elemental Casting" at level 9, adding an extra dice of damage to all of their damaging spells, allowing Clench of the North Wind to grab an extra target, and allowing Embrace of the Inferno to fire an extra ray.

  While arguably the weakest of the three Monk Subclasses, The Way of the Four Elements Monk fits perfectly with a wide assortment of elementally themed magic items found throughout the game and offers tons of utility when exploring. Players might consider specializing in one or two elements and grabbing item sets that benefit from inflicting that damage type to greatly enhance their experience with this subclass. Here are some suggestions:

 <p>
  The Mourning Frost Staff can be found early and used to apply some cold damage using your Monk Weapon attacks, which pairs excellently with Hoarfrost Boots and Winter's Clutches gloves. Add the Snowburst Ring found early in Act 2 and make sure to pick up spells like Blade of Rime, Chill of the Mountain, and Sphere of Elemental Balance to dish out as much cold damage as possible. With this setup the Monk can create icy surfaces that will knock their foes prone, encrust them with ice to weaken their dexterity saving throws, and eventually freeze them solid. Players could also grab the Frost Prince Amulet to have access to a free Ice Knife once per long rest, and the Icebite Robe to make use of the "Armor of Agathys" spell.

 <p>
  Alternatively, players could specialize in lightning damage and take full advantage of the many weapons and items that generate lightning charges. These can almost all be found in Act 1 and allow Monks to build up charges and dish out lightning damage with tremendous efficiency. The most important items here are the Sparkle Hands, Water Sparkers, and Spellsparkler. Fire is also an option, using the Gloves of Flint and Steel alongside the Cinder Shoes while grabbing the Obsidian Laced Robe to get some much-needed fire resistance. The Ring of Self Immolation and the Fireheart can also be useful here.

  Whether you choose to focus on a single element or not, it's important to eventually grab the legendary staff "Markoheshkir" on a Four Elements Monk, gaining access to spells and abilities themed around an element that can be changed every short rest. This legendary staff can be found in Act 3. The Robe of the Weave, found alongside Markoheshkir, can also be useful for the Four Elements Monk subclass. This robe heals the wearer whenever they succeed a saving throw against a spell, while also boosting the Attack Rolls and Spell Save DCs of the wearer's own spells. This can be great for enhancing the elemental spells used by the Four Elements Monk. If you want to go all in on boosting your spells you can add in the Hood of the Weave (Sold by Mystic Carrion in Philgrave's Mansion) and the Cloak of the Weave (Sold By Helsik at the Devil's Fee after you unlock her special stock) to further amplify your spell attack rolls and spell save DCs.

  A talented
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has made the three Johto starters in crochet form, with adorable results. The trio of starters made their debut way back in
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  , but each still have many fans in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon Gold and Silver
  </em>
  introduced Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile as the Grass, Fire, and Water-type starters, respectively. The three fulfilled the difficult task of being cute, powerful, and appealing after fans had already fallen in love with Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle from
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  . Every generation's set of starters brings back fond memories for fans, especially when it's a player's first introduction to the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series. These three crochet dolls would likely appeal to anyone who remembers the second generation of Pokemon with fondness.

  Pokemon crochet artist ConstanzaL shared their creations with fans on the Pokemon subreddit. The three crochet dolls recreate Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile in excellent detail. The three can sit up on their own and are made out of vivid colors that pop. The starters aren't missing a single detail, from the little buds around Chikorita's neck to a layer of fluff standing in as Cyndaquil's flames on its back.

 <p>
  Fans in the comments have been quick to shower ConstanzaL with praise for their creations. Those who are particularly interested in these three or who want to make their own versions of them are in luck. ConstanzaL sells their plush crochet creations in their Etsy shop, and for the more creatively-inclined, they also make their own patterns available for purchase. While crochet projects like these aren't the easiest thing in the world, lots of Pokemon fans seem to also be Amigurumi enthusiasts, so there's probably some who would happily make their own versions.

  The Pokemon Starters May Play a Role in Pokemon Legends: Z-A
 </h2>
 <p>
  The next major game in the series,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , is bringing back Mega Evolutions. As starters, Cyndaquil, Chikorita, and Totodile have received Mega Evolutions previously, so there's a good chance that they'll show up in some respect in the upcoming title. While many fans are curious about what Pokemon will get Mega Evolutions for the first time, it seems highly likely that the series isn't going to leave out any Pokemon that previously got the upgrade.

 <p>
  Whether the game takes Mega Evolutions any further remains to be seen, but the developer has barely scratched the surface of revealing the game's contents so far. Chances are there will be some surprises in store, so fans should keep an eye out for further announcements.

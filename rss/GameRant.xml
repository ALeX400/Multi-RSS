  A new rumor from a trusted insider claims that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty
   </em>
  </strong>
  2025 may still be released on the last generation of consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. While many fans were shocked to see 2024's
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  still launch on the 12-year-old consoles, it looks like publisher Activision remains committed to the ageing hardware as the next entry in the franchise is reportedly still not ditching the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
 </p>
 <p>
  The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are now well over a decade old, with both consoles releasing in 2013. Despite this, some developers and publishers still insist on supporting the hardware, even with the current generation of consoles now in the latter half of their life cycles. Sony even recently gave its flagship console a refresh with the release of the PlayStation 5 Pro, which is supposedly lagging behind the PlayStation 4 Pro when it comes to sales, which many expect to be primarily due to the $700 price tag attached to the console.

  Call of Duty 2025 Could Be Coming to Xbox One and PS4

 <p>
  According to a new report from insider CharlieIntel,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  2025, which is heavily speculated to be a direct sequel to 2012's
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 2
  </em>
  , may still release on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. CharlieIntel says they have heard that "the game is in development for the old consoles," and also speculated that development for the last generation of consoles could be why
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  is incapable of rotating between two large scale maps, similar to other Battle Royale titles such as
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  does receive new maps regularly, they often replace their predecessor. Resurgence maps, which are much smaller in size than standard Battle Royale maps, have been known to rotate every 15 minutes.

  The next entry in Activision's critically acclaimed series has yet to be announced, but this isn't the first rumor to circulate surrounding
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  2025. Various insiders and leakers have claimed that this year's
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game will be a direct sequel to
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  , with the game's multiplayer maps all being remasters from the 2012 shooter. However, with Treyarch Studios' new omnidirectional movement system here to stay, some significant new features are also expected for the title, including a supposed new wall-jumping system.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  2025 was also expected to bring a new
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  map along with it, but a recent rumor suggests the map, titled Avalon, has been canned or delayed. Many of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's multiplayer maps are set in Avalon, which was supposedly going to be the next large scale Battle Royale map for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​before Activision opted to bring back Verdansk. The studio has confirmed that the game's very first map will be returning in Spring 2025, and new leaks have indicated that its return could now be set for Season 3, which is just a matter of weeks away.

  ’s Sanctum Showdown event introduced three new cards, including Uncle Ben—a character many see as more of a meme than a game-changer. As expected, he isn’t a must-have, and like most recent free cards, he’s just a decent addition to your collection. Still, we decided to put

  ’s Uncle Ben to the test and built a standard destroy deck where he fits surprisingly well. Here’s how you can try it out for yourself.

  A no-brainer setup for Uncle Ben is a classic destroy deck featuring Knull and Death. To recreate this lineup, include the following cards: Uncle Ben, Knull, Death, Killmonger, X-23, Wolverine, Carnage, Nova, Deathlok, Venom, Deadpool, and Bucky Barnes.

  How to Play Uncle Ben Effectively

 <p>
  Uncle Ben is a straightforward card, played similarly to X-23 or Deadpool. However, his secondary effect offers a strategic advantage. To take full advantage of it, play him in a lane with enemy cards that synergize. His summon, Spider-Man, will move one of those enemy cards to a different location, potentially disrupting their strategy.

  To prevent Uncle Ben from summoning Spider-Man, focus on disabling the enemy's destroyer cards. One option is Armor, which can protect against destruction. Alternatively, since most destroyer cards are On Reveal, Cosmo is another effective counter.

  : he’s not essential, but he’s a fun addition to some decks. The only free card that's truly a must-have is Cassandra Nova; others, like Uncle Ben, are mediocre at best.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you typically run a destroy deck or enjoy that archetype, Uncle Ben can add some crowd control to your lineup, so it's worth giving him a shot. However, if you don’t, it’s not worth trying to fit him into other decks, as the chances of him improving your setups are slim.

  The most recent entry in the MCU,
  <em>
   Captain America: Brave New World
  </em>
  , brought fans a Sam Wilson-led Captain America story. While the film received mixed reviews from critics, a lot of fan reception has been quite positive. It's a new era for the iconic hero, which is exciting, but what's even more exciting is that an awaited video game starring Captain America could be sitting on the horizon.

  Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra Still Remains Mysterious

  <li>
   The game follows Steve Rogers as Captain America and Azzuri as the Black Panther trying to fight Hydra during the events of World War 2.

   <em>
    Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra

  In addition to Captain America and Black Panther, Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones and Wakandan Spy Network leader Nanali will act as the other two supporting characters. Captain America and Black Panther are forced to form an uneasy alliance in order to stop the much larger threat of Hydra, teasing an exciting Marvel chapter. However, it's unclear when exactly the game will see the light of day.

  Last year, developer Skydance revealed the full title with a cinematic trailer that offered a glimpse into what players could expect. Between this tease and the impressive use of Unreal Engine 5, intrigue regarding the project quickly rose. There have been a lot of questions about
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  , with one of the biggest being the game's release date. As of now, the game is set for a 2025 launch, but the general timeframe is currently a huge mystery.
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  is one of many games planned to be released this year that have kept their launch dates locked away, but if the project remains on track, a 2025 debut is still likely.

  Of course, not every MCU fan plays video games and not every gamer is into the MCU. However, for a lot of fans whose interests overlap,
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  is an exciting prospect. There are also bound to be plenty of gamers who are drawn to the game simply for a fun action-adventure experience. Either way, three major Captain America-focused projects in one year is quite a big spotlight for one character.

 <p>
  With so many games looming in the distance without official release dates announced, 2025 has felt a little bit like being in limbo so far. Granted, there are plenty of games that have already announced launch windows for the first half of the year, but the latter half of 2025 is looking bare at the moment. The launch date for
  <em>
   Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra
  </em>
  could technically arrive any day now, and when that time comes, it hopefully locks in a 2025 slot.

  In
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 1 will debut three new 6-versus-6 multiplayer maps: Hideout, Heirloom, and Extraction, which are all based on an ongoing storyline involving
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  operator Sev and a conflict with the Lutazzi crime family. Two new multiplayer modes will also launch in Season 1. Ransack will be available first, and involves teams fighting over gold in crates around the map. Prop Hunt, the fan favorite
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  party mode that turns "Prop" players into random map objects and tasks "Hunter" players with finding them while they try to hide.

  <em>
   Black Ops 6

  Season 1 include new events like Hit List, a mode where players are given a board of assassination contracts to carry out, and new weapons and attachments. The new weapons include the Krig C assault rifle, Saug SMG, and special and melee weapons like the Sirin 9mm and Power Drill. New attachments also include the popular Dragon's Breath rounds for shotguns and items to improve the XM4 and Kompakt 92 weapons.

     Throughout the pre-season we have seen a steady and healthy variety of weapon usage. Most weapons sit quite closely in both performance and pick rate, with no weapons dominating in both areas. As such our first round of Season 01 tuning changes will not be introducing any major shifts to the current state of weapon balance, and instead focus on elevating some of the weapons at the bottom of the pack. We are also addressing feedback regarding Assault Rifle damage in Hardcore and completing our adjustments to the shotgun slug attachment.

     We are adjusting handling stats on the burst rifles so that they fit more squarely into their intended roles. The Swat 5.56 has a slower fire rate within each burst and more recoil, making it better suited for mid-range engagements. Meanwhile the AEK-973 has better stability and precision, but a longer burst delay makes it a riskier pick when playing aggressively. We are also significantly reducing the power of the AEK-973 Rapid Fire, which was too strong not to take.

     We have been monitoring feedback on Sniper Rifles and are making some changes to promote more build diversity and improve the sniping experience before gaining access to a complete attachment set. We are lowering the baseline flinch on all Snipers and reducing the Flinch Resistance given by stock attachments. The resulting received flinch values are much lower up front and just a bit lower overall after equipping the stocks. We are also increasing Aim Walking Movement Speed bonuses on stock attachments to make those choices more valuable.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Lastly, we are improving the ADS Idle Sway delay by default on all Snipers, meaning that on average there will be less deviation from your point of aim when entering ADS. Our goal is to support the various sniping playstyles you all enjoy through several viable weapon builds. We will continue to monitor weapon and attachment data as well as your feedback to ensure that all sniping playstyles are fun and rewarding in Black Ops 6.

 <p>
  The recent changes to Assault Rifles in Zombies were an unintended carryover from a global weapon tuning pass. We do not intend to inherit all MP weapon tuning without looking at how it affects Zombies tuning as well.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":23,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":23,"nbrPlacementsScanned":23,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":217} -->
 <p>
  We have corrected this in this update, while also making a pass on increasing the damage performance of ARs in Zombies. All ARs have had their Pack-a-Punched base damage and overall critical damage increased. While you may see the word "decreased" in a few places, the performance for these weapons is still increased overall!

 <p>
  Additionally, the HE-1 Launcher has gotten a buff to become more useful at stopping hordes of zombies. When Pack-a-Punched, it will now have more stock ammo and a larger explosion with more overall damage.

    New Map - Area 99
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Season 01 introduces Area 99, a new Warzone map designed by Treyarch and inspired by Nuketown's high-paced gameplay. This map is set in the Nevada desert at the Echo Ridge Weapons Station — a hidden 1950s government site abandoned after a reactor leak. The map offers intense, tactical combat through desert roadways, open trenches, and pipework around a central Reactor “bullseye,” anticipated as the hottest drop zone. Another key point of interest is a massive crane suspending a Nuketown house in the Loading Bay, adding to the map's unique and dynamic environment.

   This mode is a squad-based mode where accumulating Cash is the main objective. The squad that gathers the most Cash by the end of a timed period - extended into overtime once a squad reaches $2 million - claims victory. Cash can be earned by eliminating players and collecting their valuables, searching ground loot and Supply Boxes, and completing Contracts and in-game events. Operators can start with a custom Loadout and redeploy after each elimination throughout the entire match.

             The duration of the shock effect when falling from a near-death height has been reduced to 2.1 seconds from 3 seconds.

            <li>
             This change is made to better enable the movement opportunities that the Black Ops 6 integration allows.

           Warzone continues to provide an extensive selection of lethal and tactical equipment, allowing players a range of options to suit their combat style. With the release of Black Ops 6, players can explore new additions to the equipment lineup, some of which we suspect may become fan favorites. We’ve also made several visual and balance adjustments to classic equipment, ensuring a diverse arsenal to choose from.

             Killstreaks in Warzone, much like Multiplayer’s Scorestreaks, are game-changing tools that players can find via ground loot, Supply Boxes, or as rewards from contracts and events. Many of these Killstreaks are lethal, unleashing devastating airstrikes and explosions that can decimate enemy squads from above. Others are tactical, offering valuable intel on enemy positions or on ideal positioning for upcoming fights. With Black Ops 6, a few new Killstreaks have been introduced designed to give players a real advantage in the heat of battle.

               <li class="cmp-text">
                We've expanded the Warzone arsenal to include weapons from the launch of Black Ops 6 in October 2024, giving players even more options to customize their loadouts. Dive into Warzone with these powerful additions, now available alongside fan favorites from previous titles.
               </li>
               <li class="cmp-text">
                At launch, Black Ops 6 weapons in Warzone will share similar values to their Multiplayer counterparts such as ADS speed, sprint to fire, and recoil. However, damage profiles for a number of weapons have been modified to establish a baseline for Warzone. We encourage new and returning players to study their favorite weapon’s details in the Gunsmith.
               </li>
               <li class="cmp-text">
                With the integration of Black Ops 6, we also now have new tuning options for weapons that weren’t previously available, allowing us to adjust aspects like handling (ADS speed and sprint to fire), magazine sizes, recoil, and more. For instance, while the AS VAL has a default magazine size of 20 in Multiplayer, we’ve set it to 30 for Warzone.
               </li>
               <li class="cmp-text">
                Our goal is to make weapon adjustments faster to keep the available selection dynamic and engaging, without making any weapons feel obsolete. With these new tuning options, we aim to refine each weapon’s identity and role specific to their use in Warzone, such as emphasizing Assault Rifles as strong long-range options.
               </li>
               <li class="cmp-text">
                Additionally, all bolt-action snipers and pump-action shotguns (while aiming down sights) from Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, and Black Ops 6 will have a one-shot headshot potential within their respective max damage ranges. Additionally, in order to incentivize intentional aim, all shotguns will fire 5 pellets while ADSing versus 4 when fired from the hip.
               </li>
               <li class="cmp-text">
                We want players to feel that weapons from Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III continue to remain solid, viable choices in Warzone. Our goal is to create a unified combat system that makes each gun enjoyable to use, regardless of its origin. We’ll continue to improve legacy weapons and attachments throughout the coming year to further support this vision.

                 Barrel and stock attachments from Modern Warfare II have also had their penalties reduced. Additionally, a significant balancing pass has been completed for underbarrel and muzzle attachments from both Modern Warfare II and III. All cons have been removed from these attachments, meaning they now only provide stat boosts, with each subcategory of underbarrels and muzzles functioning identically except for cosmetic differences. AMP attachments in these slots, however, retain their unique functionality and balancing.

          <li class="article-image-text-component_text-container">
           When you pick up a Bounty contract, a nearby player will be selected as your target. A circle will appear on your tac map, periodically updating to show the target’s location. The target will be somewhere within this circle each time it updates, and the circle gradually shrinks as you move closer. The target can also see an indicator on their HUD showing how close the closest player from your hunting team is; this is displayed as a three-level "threat indicator." Completing the contract by killing the target rewards cash, XP, and a singular ping from the bounty target’s body. If another team kills the target, your contract ends with a "poached" outcome, offering a lesser reward. Allowing the timer to run out or losing your team will fail the contract.

             Upon picking up a Scavenger contract, three scavenger caches will spawn near the pickup spot. You’ll be directed to each cache one at a time, with the next cache revealed only after you open the previous one. Opening a cache adds 45 seconds to the contract timer. These caches contain slightly better loot than usual, and each will drop a lootable perk. Opening the third and final cache completes the contract, rewarding your team with cash, XP, and an armor satchel from the last cache. Failing to open all caches before time runs out, or having your team wiped, will fail the contract.

Opponents who kill the Most Wanted target receive cash and XP, while the Most Wanted team can reduce their contract time by obtaining kills and opening loot caches (10-second reduction per cache, 25-second reduction per kill). If the Most Wanted target survives the full contract duration, the contract is completed, and the team earns cash, XP, and revives any dead squad members. Whether the contract ends in success or failure, a "VIP reward crate" appears near the VIP’s location, containing ammo, plates, a killstreak, a weapon, a Gulag token, and cash.

                The upcoming Season 01 update for Call of Duty: Warzone introduces a revamped, fully integrated user interface. The primary game tiles on the Home tab will feature Black Ops 6 and Warzone, allowing for instant access to gameplay.

     <li>
      Sea of Thieves offers a variety of weapons but choosing a playstyle is essential due to weapon combinations.

      Blunderbombs are useful for causing AOE damage and knockback but lack the ability to damage ships.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Sea of Thieves
   </em>
  </strong>
  has a unique combat system that might seem quite basic at first, but there are a lot of layers to the weapons in the game. Players are limited to carrying just two weapons at any one time and, usually, one of those slots will be taken by the humble cutlass.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Unlike some progression-based games, all the weapons are available to new players as soon as they start the game. The only real problem for each player is choosing a playstyle or finding the right weapon combination. Some combinations are ideal for specific
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  adventures, while others are more well-rounded. There are pros and cons to each weapon.

    Updated November 13, 2024 by Gemma Johnson:
   </strong>
   Sea of Thieves is an evolving pirate adventure game that continues to add more features to its sandbox, including new weapons and tools. While there are core weapons in the game like the traditional pirate cutlass and pistol, weapons in Sea of Thieves continue to grow. Sea of Thieves Season 14 gives players even more weapons or tools to choose between, from Blowdarts to the Grapple Gun and more.

  With so many weapons available, many players may be eager to know what
  <strong>
   Sea of Thieves' best weapon is
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Although this somewhat comes down to players' preferred playstyles, each weapon undoubtedly has pros and cons, with some standing above the rest for various reasons. This
  <strong>
   Sea of Thieves weapons tier list
  </strong>
  adds two new entries and updates the ranking order.

  <strong>
   Blunderbombs
  </strong>
  are a type of throwable
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  weapon that explodes shrapnel upon impact, causing damage to players within a given AOE, albeit rather minimal as a weapon that focuses more on knock-back, such as knocking a player off a ship. They can be shot out of cannons or thrown, but players can only carry a limited supply of up to five at any one time, although players could buy or obtain more across the seas.

 <p>
  The main disadvantage of Blunderbombs is they only damage players, not ships, but could deploy some knockback effects if deployed strategically.

  While not necessarily a fan-favorite, the
  <strong>
   Trident of Dark Tides
  </strong>
  offers some of the most varied shots compared to other
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  weapons. It fires small, medium, and large charged bubbles that damage and knock back enemies. The longer a player charges it up, the bigger the bubble becomes. On one hand, it works well as a powerful, long-range weapon that does splash damage, making it great for fighting multiple enemies.

 <p>
  On the flip side, it's weaker in close combat owing to its slow charge-up. Tridents also only contain 30 shots and will disappear once used. Players must search the open world for one as loot as it is not accessible from the armory.

   Firebombs

  While not a traditional weapon as such, gunpowder barrels are a type of explosive in
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  which are primarily a piece of loot that players can sell for around 200–2,000 gold coins, dependent on the players' Emissary level. While they can spawn almost anywhere in the game, they are most commonly found in Skeleton and Sea Forts, plus are carried by Gunpowder Skeletons, who can also use them as a weapon against players when set alight.

 <p>
  Although not new, they can be a handy weapon to use against other players during PVP if players can sneak one aboard another player's ship, or shoot one they are transporting. This makes them some of the riskiest loot to keep aboard, as they can inflict devastating damage on players and their ships as perhaps the most powerful explosives in the game. However, they can't be thrown like other explosive weapons, limiting their usage somewhat.

  There is little to rival the panic that players can cause with a burning
  <strong>
   Ashen Winds Skull
  </strong>
  that carries the flaming power of an Ashen Lord when looted from its corpse. While it's powerful in setting fire to players and ships during naval combat, it doesn't cause that much damage immediately as another damage-over-time weapon. Sea of Thieves Season 13 also introduced a variant design called the Obsidian Ashen Winds Skull, which seems to offer similar levels of value and effects being worth approximately 2,500-3,000 gold depending on usage and player Emissary Level.

  Although Season 11's
  <strong>
   Skull of Siren Song
  </strong>
  is multi-functional, in many ways, it is more valuable as a treasure than as a weapon. While it looks extremely cool, it's not a high-damage weapon and doesn't inflict as much damage as some players might expect. However, it does have some advantages over the Ashen Winds Skull, given that using it as a weapon doesn't decrease its value in any way. Players can still sell it for a whopping 50,000, as potentially one of the best ways to make money in
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  However, it can be time-consuming and challenging to acquire, especially when fighting or racing against other players for it. That said, it is possible to obtain the Skull of Siren Song without any opposition at all, so it's worth a try, provided players are willing to become a potential target on the map in doing so.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Bone Caller
  </strong>
  is, in many ways, one of the best weapons in
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves,
  </em>
  at least in the throwables category. When playing solo in
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  , it's a fantastic way to even the odds in combat when fighting groups of enemies. When thrown, it summons a group of skeletons to fight on players' behalf until they are destroyed, giving players their own personal skeleton army. Throwing the Bone Caller onto PVP is a fantastic distraction technique, potentially giving players time to quickly drop a ship's anchor.

 <p>
  However, as it stands, there is no way to strengthen Bone Caller skeletons, so they don't necessarily last that long. Although they have hilarious randomized name markers, it can sometimes also feel tricky to spot who is an enemy and who isn't in skeleton battles amid the battle chaos, and throwing a second Bone Caller will just despawn the first one's skeletons, rather than increasing their numbers.

  Despite the name,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  ' Grapple Gun is more of a tool than a weapon and was introduced in Season 14. That said, it is still capable of inflicting smaller amounts of damage, such as defeating Phantoms in a couple of hits. It is also a unique addition to the
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  armory in that it helps players traverse the world more easily by attaching to things like islands and certain parts of ships.

 <p>
  Players can also use the Grapple Gun to harpoon treasure and even other players, making it more of a tool that can be used effectively with other weapons. For instance, a player could use the Grapple Gun to quickly harpoon a player close to them or vice versa to close the distance, following up with a deadlier weapon like the Blowpipe when shooting Poison Darts. The Grapple Gun could also help players get onto another player's ship, potentially helping to turn the tide of battle.

  <strong>
   Double Barrel Pistol
  </strong>
  is essentially a cross between the Flintlock and Blunderbuss. It fires relatively quick, high-powered shots at close range without the Blunderbuss' often less accurate spray. It is also a versatile weapon, as it gives players the choice of whether to fire a single or double shot or even team it with another gun for potentially some triple-gunning tactics. However, it's not very effective at mid-to-long range, making the Flintlock a better weapon all-round.

  <strong>
   Throwing Knives
  </strong>
  are a fun alternative to the Cutlass and may remind some players of using throwing knives in Rare's classic FPS game,
  <em>
   Goldeneye
  </em>
  . Players have the option to throw up to five knives or attack with them through small stabs or a charged, high-powered swipe that's perfect for stealth attacks. This makes them a versatile weapon that's also pretty powerful with the ability to take out some enemies in a single throw, such as Coral Skeletons.

 <p>
  As long as players retrieve the knives when thrown, they're also the only
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  weapon with the potential for unlimited ammo. However, that's assuming players can find them once thrown, as they can get lost in the environment or picked up by other players. They can also be more challenging to wield in combat compared to the Cutlass, especially against groups of foes.

  Introduced in Season 14,
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  ' Blowpipe weapon can be a surprisingly lethal and effective weapon, and perhaps more so than some players might expect, depending on the choice of Dart. For instance, shooting a Phantom with a Poison Dart in PVE combat can kill them in one shot within a few seconds. Poison Darts can also make it easier and quicker to defeat tougher enemies as they work similarly to getting bitten by a snake in the game, with the victims' health diminishing surprisingly quickly and killing some PVE enemies, like Phantoms, in a single shot.

 <p>
  Other darts players can use the Blowpipe are the Lure Dart, the explosive Black Powder Dart, and the Mimic Dart, with the latter anticipated for later in Season 14. Black Powder darts can be powerful and dangerous, it is sometimes easy to get caught in the crossfire with a slight explosion time delay. The Lure Dart also doesn't cause damage but can lure PVE enemies to attack others or create a false signal for other players. Although Darts are best used at close-to-mid-range for the best accuracy, they can also travel surprisingly far.

 <p>
  For a long time, the
  <strong>
   Blunderbuss
  </strong>
  was considered by many as a master of close-range execution in the hands of a skilled pirate with its former one-shot kill capabilities. However, balancing changes to the Blunderbuss in recent times make it more of a defensive rather than an offensive weapon. At close range, the Blunderbuss dishes out knockback effects capable of knocking other players off a ship and its bullet spread power is wider than previously. While it is still effective at close range with 90 damage, it can no longer one-hit-kill a player at full health, lowering its ranking slightly.

 <p>
  That said, for some players, the Blunderbuss is still a decent weapon when up close. It could also potentially be used defensively as an anti-boarding weapon without the need for other knockback weapons, like the Blunderbomb. However, others may prefer the Flintlock for its overall versatility.

 <p>
  Not everyone’s favorite gun, but a good staple for many starting in their pirate career that can be very effective. Everyone who begins
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  will start automatically with a Cutlass and
  <strong>
   Flintlock pistol
  </strong>
  . The Flintlock should typically be used at close- to mid-range due to its weakness at long-range, but when used well, it is powerful and can kill enemies in one or two shots. However, it has a notorious bullet drop and can be hard to master when fighting other players in
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  PVP. It also performs much better at longer distances when aiming down the sights.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Flintlock has a decent reload speed and can be fired accurately without having to aim down sights. One bullet could reduce a player's health by around half, so it may only take two shots to kill them. One way to learn how to use this weapon effectively is to pick up a skin that offers clearer iron sights, which helps considerably with aiming.

  The Blade of Souls is a reward that's also a weapon capable of inflicting fire damage on impact and knockback effects, making it perhaps the most powerful melee weapon in the game yet. However, players can only get it by defeating the Burning Blade ship in
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  , a world event introduced in Season 13 where players can effectively become the villain or choose to take it down.

 <p>
  While its extra fire ability adds an extra layer of damage compared to the standard cutlass, the only consideration that holds it back is how less practical it is. Instead of becoming a weapon that temporarily sits in the player's armory, it can only be placed on the ground when players stop to do other things like replenish health, making it less convenient to use. Placing it on the ground also allows other players to take it for themselves during combat, plus obtaining it places a marker on the map and makes it a risky weapon to keep for long.

  A close call above the Blunderbuss is the pirate classic, the
  <strong>
   Cutlass
  </strong>
  . The Cutlass is devastating when used correctly, but there is a skill and nuance to it. Many players begin sword fighting with a slash-and-hope method until they learn the timing. Slashes damage any enemies within reach in a wide arc, perfect for when players are fighting multiple enemies.

 <p>
  The Cutlass' heavy attack lunges the player forward causing deadline damage. It can be hard to time but devastating if it lands. Hitting an enemy with the Cutlass will also interrupt their actions, so landing chain hits will usually result in victory. Combined with gun combat, the Cutlass will often put the finishing touches on any
  <em>
   Sea Thieves
  </em>
  PVP battle.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Eye of Reach
  </strong>
  is arguably the
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves'
  </em>
  best weapon yet, but in many ways, the hardest gun to master, albeit with the most rewards in terms of its skill cap. This pirate-themed sniper rifle is deadly at both long and short ranges. If a player can master a quick-scope mechanic or hip-firing then this gun can even beat other high-powered guns in close-range combat.

 <p>
  At long range, it comfortably beats the Pistol in terms of bullet range, making it easier to predict shots. The downside is its slowest reload time, but one shot could damage a player’s health by around 70%. A quick Eye of Reach shot and Cutlass lunge is all it takes to end a fight. It also may be a tough call between the Flintlock, Cutlass, and Eye of Reach for the best
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  weapon for some players, as each offers different benefits according to players' skill level and preferences. However, the Eye of Reach still steals the top spot in our
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  weapon tier list, at least for now.

  The twist behind why Lina replaced Lana in the salon adds depth to the game’s story, and the 2024 Halloween Update revealed more of the background. While you can free Lana by completing the Halloween quest, you’ll still need to go through a forest and finish the maze to unlock the white mystery dress (also known as the Lana Stitch Dress). Here's

  Much to
  <em>
   DTI
  </em>
  fans’ surprise, the Lana Stitch Dress can only be unlocked by
  <strong>
   entering a forest and completing a maze in a different game
  </strong>
  . To access the dress,
  <strong>
   search for 'Forest'
  </strong>
  in the Roblox search bar and select the game with the black-and-white icon showcasing Lana’s images. You can also find this game by typing
  <strong>
   ‘LanaDoesNails’
  </strong>
  in the search bar and opening through the 'Creations' section.

  Once you're in the game, your avatar will drop into a dark red forest. The goal here is to
  <strong>
   reach the portal at the map's end and activate it
  </strong>
  with three other players. The red forest is dangerous, with Lana’s doppelgangers chasing you from all directions, so stay alert as you head to the portal. If a doppelganger catches you, you'll respawn at the starting point.

  <li>
   Start by heading over to the area with
   <strong>
    Lana’s giant floating avatar
   </strong>
   and a frame on the ground. Walk onto the black patch, climb a small hill, and
   <strong>
    go toward the tree
   </strong>
   .

  <li>
   After spotting another Lana statue, move in that direction and
   <strong>
    jump over the massive lava blocks
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Next, sprint north, jumping along the way, as one of Lana’s doppelgangers will try to get you. Soon, you’ll see big hands on the left—
   <strong>
    turn left there, and run straight to approach the portal.

     The maze is really dark, so use the light feature to help you see the path. Just click the red circle at the bottom of your screen to
     <strong>
      turn on the light.

 <p>
  The best strategy is to
  <strong>
   move forward as a group
  </strong>
  with other players. Since the maze can get confusing,
  <strong>
   follow Lana's paintings
  </strong>
  on the walls to guide you to the final door. In the meantime, avoid Lana’s doppelgangers by
  <strong>
   sprinting as fast as you can
  </strong>
  (hit ‘Shift’ on PC), and if one gets too close, run in the opposite direction while jumping to cover more distance.

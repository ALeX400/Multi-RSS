   <strong>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </strong>
  </em>
  lets players deeply customize their weapons, which includes putting up a scope to assist in aiming. There are a variety of scopes meant for different weapons. Not all weapons are compatible with a single type of scope, so if there's a particular weapon you want to attach a scope to, make sure you have the right one for it. Let's check out how exactly players can add a scope attachment to their weapons in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Attaching a scope/sight to your weapon is a little tricky in
  <em>
   Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  , as you can't just equip a scope you find directly. First, players need to head over to Lens or any technician and
  <strong>
   mod their weapon
  </strong>
  . Here's what you need to do to attach a scope to your weapon.

 <ol>
  <li>
   Check the description of the scope and verify if it's compatible with the weapon you're trying to attach it to. For example, the Holographic Sight is compatible with Viper-5, Integral-A, AR416, GP37, Fora-221, Kharod, Dnipro, RAM-2, SPSA-14, and M860 Cracker.
  </li>
  <li>
   If the scope/sight is compatible with your weapon, head over to Lens to modify the weapon.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select the "Scope Mount" upgrade for the weapon and install it.
  </li>
  <li>
   After your weapon has a Scope Mount now, head into your inventory and select the scope to install it onto your weapon. Players can also press the "D-Pad Up" button to quickly equip attachments on the weapon without going into inventory.
  </li>

  If you've just started playing
  <em>
   Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
  </em>
  , you can
  <strong>
   buy a scope from the trader "Hamster"
  </strong>
  in Zalissya. You can also find various attachments for weapons by looting stashes and dead bodies around the world. Even if you find a weapon, like a silenced pistol, that has an attachment you want, you can simply remove the attachment from it to use on your weapons.

 <p>
  The best thing about scopes or any attachments is that they don't have any durability gauge associated with them. This means even if your weapon becomes obsolete after losing its durability, players can still de-attach the attachments and use them on another compatible gun.

  Using Brewing Barrels is simple, but knowing what to put in them involves a fair bit of guesswork. You can't just pick something to brew like when cooking food and drink recipes in
  <em>
   Once Human.

  Here are the Brewing Barrel recipes that we've found so far to help you get your stock of drinks and ingredients up pronto.

   The Brewing Barrel remains a reliable source of some of the most coveted ingredients and consumables in Once Human. Even after all the patches the game has received, it still works the way it always has, and the available Brewing Barrel recipes are still the same as before. We've updated this guide to include more details on each recipe as well as some other important things players may want to know about Brewing Barrels in Once Human.

  While not necessarily mandatory,
  <strong>
   beer made from corn and wheat make for great Hydration items

 <p>
  Regular ale will keep your sanity from dropping for 30 minutes. Meanwhile,
  <strong>
   Deviated versions provide the Quick Reflexes buff
  </strong>
  , which increases your character's action speed by 20%. This only affects the speed at which you interact with things like using items or gathering materials. It does not make you move, shoot, or reload faster.

  Out of all these recipes,
  <strong>
   the one for Acid
  </strong>
  is likely to be the most important one for many players. Getting Acid is a tedious process in
  <em>
   Once Human

  — this resource is commonly dropped by Deviations like the Gnawers found in almost every POI, but considering how much Acid is used when crafting ammo, ingots, and other items, farming enemies becomes a chore.

 <p>
  Despite appearances, both of these types of ale are functionally the same. They both do the same thing, which is prevent you from losing Sanity while exploring or fighting Deviants. Even the Stardust variants of these consumables are the same. The only real determining factor on which one you should make in your
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  Brewing Barrels is ingredient availability. Feel free to make either one of these based on the ingredients you have in stock.

   <strong>
    Dragon’s Dogma 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  players may have exciting content to look forward to in Capcom’s roadmap for the action RPG, thanks to a recent datamine’s reveal of a potential multiplayer mode and DLC in the game’s future. Leaks must always be taken with a pinch of salt, but often, these discoveries are good indicators of what’s to come, or they at least give players a glimpse behind the veil of development.
  <em>
   Dragon’s Dogma 2
  </em>
  was one of the most successful games in 2024, and fans hope its extensive open world has more gameplay to offer.

 <p>
  Set in a fantasy-themed expanse, players control customizable Arisen heroes in a quest to thwart the dragon that marked them. Boasting a map four times larger than its 2012 predecessor,
  <em>
   Dragon’s Dogma 2
  </em>
  was an instant hit and received unanimous praise for its engaging narrative and innovative Pawn system.

  fans hope a potential third installment will continue one interesting approach regarding character choices, but for now, the player base hopes the rumored additional content comes to fruition.

  Posted and discussed on Reddit, a new datamine was shared within the
  <em>
   Dragon’s Dogma
  </em>
  subreddit. The first and most notable finding was the existence of a multiplayer mode, but it was noted that this feature could have been content cut from the game or a possible preview of what’s to come. Co-op play was substituted by Capcom’s impressive in-game companions in the sequel, and
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  ’s Pawn system was innovative enough to meet the heights of Warner Bros.’ Nemesis experience.

  A second post shared on the Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit highlighted mention of a possible DLC titled, "Tower of the New Moon," lurking in the sequel’s data files. After the Denuvo version had been obtained, dataminers allegedly found game files relating to extra content, including the aforementioned multiplier mode and a "Boss Rush" mode.

  Former

  and

  director Hideaki Itsuno recently revealed a new studio, leading a new branch of Tencent's LightSpeed Studio.
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  was Itsuno's final project working with Capcom, prior to departing the developer back in August. If the sequel does end up releasing more content for players to soak up, there’s a good chance Itsuno had a hand in tailoring some of these uncovered features.

   <em>
    Control
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most unique games to have been released in the past few years. Developer Remedy Entertainment is well-known for its mind-bending story concepts, and
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  brought those qualities to the next level. The game's story surprised players by connecting itself to the
  <em>
   Alan Wake
  </em>
  series, setting the stage for an extended Remedy universe. Many have been awaiting news about
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  's sequel, and Remedy has recently revealed that there is a lot to look forward to at the beginning of 2025, as
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  will get a free update.

  Yesterday, Remedy took to X to make a few exciting statements about what
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  fans can look forward to next year. From an announcement revealing
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  's free update sometime in "early 2025" to the confirmation of what genre the sequel will be, these little bits of information from Remedy could potentially be hinting at something even bigger on the horizon, as well.

  The free update and planned Mac launch are exciting enough, but one of the most fascinating pieces of news Remedy casually dropped is that
  <em>
   Control 2
  </em>
  will be an action RPG. With Remedy classifying the first
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  game as a third-person action-adventure title, this implies a massive genre departure for the sequel. The growing Remedy universe has embraced experimenting with other genres, but this is a surprising update for the highly-anticipated sequel. Also, although this update lists a lot of exciting points, it ultimately raises even more questions.

  Remedy is being incredibly secretive about what this "previously released content" could be. It makes one wonder why there is so much secrecy surrounding already-released content. Of course, this could just be a way to ignite excitement for a free update, but it hopefully means some fun Easter eggs or hints at
  <em>
   Control 2
  </em>
  are hidden inside. With news of
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  's cut content, maybe this free
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  update will also surprise with some cut content of its own, but this is just mere speculation.

  Anticipating the Reveal of a Long-Awaited Follow-Up
 </h3>
 <p>
  Nominated for 2019's Game of the Year award,
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  surprised and compelled many with its eerie and action-packed story. Now that it's confirmed that
  <em>
   Control 2
  </em>
  will be more of an action RPG than a third-person shooter, it will be fascinating to see how Remedy defines that switch. Although there has yet to be any official announcement scheduled, revealing
  <em>
   Control 2
  </em>
  in tandem with the free update would make sense.

 <p>
  It feels like an announcement could arrive any day, though. As of now, there haven't been any leaks or rumors suggesting Remedy will reveal the sequel at this year's upcoming Game Awards, but that's always a possibility for big announcements. If that isn't how the developer chooses to showcase a first look at
  <em>
   Control 2
  </em>
  , then its early 2025 plans could be planting the seeds for an announcement to blossom.

 <p>
  Even if
  <em>
   Control 2
  </em>
  isn't announced in 2025, Remedy is already set to have a big year. Next year's
  <em>
   FBC: Firebreak
  </em>
  is both the developer's first self-published and multiplayer title. Since Remedy loves experimenting with genres, it's going to be exciting to see how a multiplayer game drenched in the lore of
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  is approached. As the wait for
  <em>
   Control 2
  </em>
  continues, this planned free update is hopefully signaling more news is on the way.

  Once you've unlocked both Mulan and Mushu in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  , you will be able to give them items and level them up. When you reach Level Two with Mulan, you will unlock her first friendship quest. As Mulan tries to get settled in Dreamlight Valley, she needs help setting up a training routine. While this quest is pretty standard in terms of friendship quest objectives, it does take some time to complete due to the second step. Here is how to complete A Daily Regime in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  .

  For the first part of this quest, you will have to make two Vegetarian Pizzas. Mulan gives you the recipe, even if you have already learned it. To make both Vegetarian Pizzas, you will need to gather two carrots, two cheeses, two wheat, and two tomatoes. Everything can be grown except for the cheese which is purchased from Remy at his restaurant.

  After you give Mulan the pizzas, she will have a new task that is part of her training routine. You will need to gather gems from mining. To be specific, you must obtain three Topaz, four Aquamarine, six Garnet, and six Peridot. Unfortunately, gems you've already acquired do not count, so you will be starting from scratch.

 <p>
  It is unclear if this is a bug or not, but gems that are spawned by a companion with the mining role don't seem to count for this quest. To make matters worse, having a companion with you seems to also make any gem you obtain not count. If either of these situations are bugs that end up getting fixed later, this guide will be updated.

  After you have finally gathered all of the gems, find Mulan and talk to her. You don't need to give her the gems, so once you've talked to her you can just sell them if you want.

  For the next step, Mulan wants you to bring some crates of tea back from her realm. Unfortunately she is unable to return their as she will lose her memories, so that means you have to go in her stead. The Crate of Jasmine Tea is to the left of the crafting station inside the camp.

  After finding all three, head back to Mulan. When you give her the crates, she gets the idea to make a tea stall where all the villagers can go and get some tea. Pick a spot in Dreamlight Valley, place it, and then talk to Mulan once again.

      <title>A Future Starfield Expansion Could Fill Out its Universe by Following Fallout's Lead</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Shattered Space expansion is set for a release window of Fall 2024. The massive scale of the title in terms of its exploration perfectly compliments post-launch expansions such as this, with there being an immense amount of narrative leeway to expand the game's lore.

 <p>
  The Shattered Space expansion for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  recently got some attention at the Xbox Games Showcase, with its time at the presentation confirming the major involved factions and locations of the DLC. While Shattered Space smartly places more emphasis on one of the most underused pre-existing factions in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , the title could easily take a page out of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's book for its future expansions. In particular, new major groups and factions in
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  have consistently been added to the franchise over the years, and
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  could use its scope to do the same thing through future DLCs.

 <p>
  Despite a lot of the pre-release marketing for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  focusing on its massive scale, there are only five major factions that populate its vast game world. Of course, implementing even more major factions into the base game may have risked bloating the side content of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , but there is still clear room for more stories to be told within the franchise.

 <p>
  While most of these five pre-existing factions get a fair amount of development and story content in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , many fans felt that the mysterious and hyper-religious House Va'ruun did not get nearly enough attention in the game. The upcoming Shattered Space expansion for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  has clearly taken these criticisms on board, with House Va'ruun being at the center of the upcoming story.

 <p>
  Despite not getting much love in the base game of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , House Va'ruun is arguably the game's most interesting faction, with its members worshiping a deity known as the Great Serpent. The isolation and deep devotion of House Va'ruun is a perfect way to instill mystery in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's setting, with the game clearly having all the tools necessary to craft even more fascinating factions in the future.

 <p>
  It has already been confirmed that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  will receive at least one more major expansion following the release of Shattered Space, with Bethesda clearly believing that there is still a lot of unexplored narrative potential for the title. While it only seems fair that Shattered Space should finally elaborate on House Va'ruun, subsequent expansions could easily introduce brand-new factions, much like how
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  has over the years.

 <p>
  While the likes of the Brotherhood of Steel have appeared in the IP for quite some time, fan-favorite titles like
  <em>
   Fallout New Vegas
  </em>
  owed a lot of their success to the new groups they explored, with
  <em>
   FNV
  </em>
  famously introducing factions like Caesar's Legion. These factions are often deeply tied to the different areas that
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  explores, with
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's Boston setting giving way to the Minutemen faction, which is inspired by Minutemen of New England in the Revolutionary era.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  having so many star systems and planets to explore, the title is in no shortage of locations that can potentially be expanded to inspire factions in future DLCs for the game. Locational factions have been a huge part of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's continued success and expanded lore over the years, and Bethesda should definitely consider transferring this ethos to its most recent release to give more justification for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's massive size through any future DLCs.

      <title>6 Best SNES RPG Side Quests</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/best-snes-rpg-side-quests/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Side quests are often associated with 3D RPGs in a post-PS1 world. It’s easy to see why, since the 3D era helped evolve the storytelling of games. When discussing the best side quests in gaming, players often refer to expansive worlds such as those in
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   The Witcher 3,
  </em>
  which have giant open-world and hundreds of quests to take on. However, side quests did not originate in the 3D era.

  Some of the best RPGs of the SNES era have side quests that stack up next to entries in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchises. Let’s take a look at some cool side quests in games on the SNES, which contribute to their status as great SNES RPGs overall.

  A good portion of
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  sets up Magus as the big bad of the game. After defeating him, he disappears into the void once he manages to summon Lavos. Lavos then becomes the boss whom Crono and the others have to stop.

 <p>
  Near the end of the game, players can start to hear rumors about Magus from townsfolk across timelines. If players then travel to the North Cape in 12,000 B.C., they can find Magus once again. He will challenge the party to a fight, and if players do cross swords with him, he will die. If players instead walk away, he will follow Crono and join the party. It’s worth sparing Magus because it gives a former villain a redemption arc, not to mention the fact that he is incredibly strong.

  <em>
   Dragon Quest 5: Hand of the Heavenly Bride
  </em>
  is the first game in the
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  series to focus on one party member who fills up his party roster with monsters. After battle, players have a chance to befriend monsters from Slimes to Drackies. It was like
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  before that franchise blew up. There are about forty in the SNES version, and the roster was expanded in later releases.

  The first time North America got to play it, for example, was on the DS. This version did offer some monster upgrades, but before this, there was a fan patch for the original version. This included a meta-side quest in the game to collect all the monsters. It’s not a direct side quest with a big reward at the end, but getting through the game with this horde of monsters did feel like an accomplishment.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  has a lot of great side quests in it, like most entries in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series. One of the most memorable and challenging revolves around Bahamut. The king of dragons appeared in the first game, but became a Summon in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 3,
  </em>
  which was also the first game to feature that type of class.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  , Bahamut resides on the moon in the aptly titled Cave of Bahamut. Players have to defeat it, which is not easy as Bahamut hits hard. Afterward, it will become a Summon for Rydia, and will boost the party’s power considerably. It might be the hardest boss fight against Bahamut from any
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game, but it all ultimately depends on how much players grind EXP.

  Shadow is a ninja who is an on-again-off-again party member in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  . Players can eventually recruit him, but there are many steps. First, players have to make sure and wait for him on the floating continent before the world ends. Then, in the World of Ruin, players should go to the Cave on the Veldt, which will end with a boss fight against the Behemoth King.

  Once Shadow is saved, he will depart for the Dragon's Neck Coliseum, wherein players will have to get lucky in their battle to defeat and recruit him. It’s worth the hassle, as Shadow is the coolest character in the game, from his move set to his whistle theme to his trusty dog Interceptor.

  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
  </em>
  is not a classic RPG with EXP, but this action-adventure epic has plenty of RPG elements, like a health system and magic, as well as one of the most epic quests in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  series. After obtaining the Master Sword and traveling to the Dark World, players can find the Dwarven Smith’s brother from Kakariko Village. In the Dark World, he is a frog and lost in a maze of confusion.

  When led back to the Light World via the Magic Mirror, the two brothers will temper the Master Sword for Link. This changes it to an orange hue. The sword can then be upgraded a second time via the Cursed Fairy in the pyramid-like temple, which changes its color to yellow. This is the final sword in the game, and both of these upgrades are optional.

  <em>
   Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars
  </em>
  features tons of Easter Eggs, with sources ranging from other Mario games to Square Enix titles. The biggest Easter Egg of all is Culex, who is framed as an interdimensional being that appears to be from a
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game. While Culex is an original creation, it does use Crystals as weapons and has the boss music from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 4
  </em>
  .

  To fight him, players must first obtain the Shiny Stone in Moleville by buying fireworks and then trading with a little girl. The Shiny Stone can then open the locked door in Monstro Town, which leads to the Culex fight. In addition to the boss being memorable, the reward after is great. The Quartz Charm can halve damage, increase attacks by 50%, and prevent mortal blows.

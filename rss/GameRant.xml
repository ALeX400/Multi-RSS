  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset. Over the weekend, Bungie kicked off the first ever Dungeon Race for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Vesper's Host. While typically reserved for raids, the Vesper's Host dungeon race featured Contest Mode for the first 48 hours, where teams could compete to see who would finish in fiurst, while also earning a special emblem and the Icebreaker exotic sniper rifle for completing it.

  The news kept coming as the long rumored
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  mobile spinoff was confirmed.
  <em>
   Destiny Rising
  </em>
  is a mobile game developed by NetEase, featuring unique characters, abilities, and a story set in an alternative timeline. The RPG Shooter has already garnered significant attention for some of the weapons and abilities shown off in the debut trailer, including a Void Scythe wielding Warlock, leaving many fans wanting to see similar powers brought forward to
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . A planned Alpha test that players can sign up for is set to begin on November 1.

  The original
  <em>
   Life is Strange
  </em>
  studio
  <strong>
   Don't Nod
  </strong>
  has announced a wave of layoffs as a result of its most recent games,
  <em>
   Jusant
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden,
  </em>
  financially underperforming. Don't Nod is currently working on a new
  <em>
   Life is Strange-
  </em>
  like narrative adventure game titled
  <em>
   Lost Records: Bloom and Rage
  </em>
  , which is aiming to release in two parts in early 2025.

 <p>
  Not even a month ago, Don't Nod shared that
  <em>
   Jusant
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden
  </em>
  failed to meet the company's sales expectations. The former, an indie-style platforming adventure game, was released last October, and largely flew under the radar during a hectic Fall season filled with major releases.
  <em>
   Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden
  </em>
  was released in early 2024 and garnered more attention from gamers as a more triple-A style action adventure experience. Despite the game receiving critical praise for its storytelling and third-person action gameplay, it struggled sales-wise, leading to the studio having to refocus its resources and pause development on two unannounced games.

 <p>
  Now, IGN has reported that Don't Nod is preparing to lay off almost 70 of its workers, amounting to about 21% of the studio's staff. Don't Nod explicitly cites the financial underperformance of
  <em>
   Jusant
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden
  </em>
  as the reason for this move, which resulted in an 11% year-over-year decline in revenue over the first half of the company's financial year. "The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness. As a result, today we presented a reorganization project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory," said Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert.

  Earlier this year, the French video game union Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Video (STJV) criticized Don't Nod for poor communication, understaffing, and other forms of studio mismanagement. In response to these new layoff plans, STJV voiced its displeasure with Don't Nod, calling the layoffs unlawful as studio management failed to inform its staff of such job cuts, adding that the studio's workers have been asking for transparency on the issue for months but have been ignored. Don't Nod will need to negotiate with STJV and other video game unions before going through with its planned layoffs.

      <title>Rockstar's Bully is 18-Years-Old, but The Franchise Still Needs to Grow Up</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/rockstar-bully-anniversary-sequel-missing-reasons-rumors-why/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  It's easy to forget these days, but
  <em>
   Rockstar
  </em>
  was once known for more than
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  . While
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  has been the studio's best-selling franchise for quite some time, more experimental projects like
  <em>
   Manhunt
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Bully
   </strong>
  </em>
  allowed for greater risk-taking and growth, often showcasing the developers' boldest ideas. With the latter turning a whopping eighteen years old now, the absence of this ironically adolescent-focused series is particularly poignant.

  Though mired in controversy upon release, mostly because of its evocative title,
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  has proven itself to be quite an enduring game. To this day, anyone who grew up with
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  looks back on it fondly, as its core mechanics, storytelling, and even visuals have aged far better than one might expect.
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  follows Jimmy Hopkins, a teenager with an attitude problem but a heart of gold. While players can engage in some stereotypical "bully" activities, most of the game is actually about standing up against both child and adult bullies, with Jimmy making friends with outcasts and ultimately carving his own path as a misfit. It's a story about identity and justice that transcends its era, and it's an absolute shame that it never got a follow-up.

 <p>
  While some may hold out hope for a new
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  game, a continuation of the franchise feels like more of a pipe dream in the modern age. It's not that the world of
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  doesn't have potential‚Äîits potential is the main reason why so many gamers are clamoring for
  <em>
   Bully 2
  </em>
  ‚Äîor that there wouldn't be demand for a sequel, but Rockstar clearly has other priorities. Rumors about
  <em>
   Bully 2
  </em>
  have popped up over the years, but most reputable sources claim that the game never got far into development before being canned or delayed indefinitely.

 <p>
  There may be an easy culprit for this:
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . The unbelievably successful multiplayer component of
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  arguably hijacked Rockstar in the 2010s, its rampant popularity making it unthinkable to spend development resources on much else. And even though it's been well over a decade since
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  came out, the franchise seems more popular than ever, meaning that there's almost no chance Rockstar is working on something like
  <em>
   Bully 2
  </em>
  alongside
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , the most hotly-anticipated game of next year. There might be a minuscule chance of revisiting the IP after
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , but a new
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  game seems like a more likely prospect, for better or worse.

  It may not have the mass marketability or social footprint of
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  is a uniquely compelling property that deserves to be continued. The intricacies of teenage life are often explored in JRPGs like
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and myriad visual novels, but rarely do games offer a window into American adolescence. More specifically, it's exceedingly rare to experience a grounded coming-of-age story in the world of gaming‚Äîdemons, aliens, zombies, or some other supernatural force usually intervenes.

 <p>
  It may be absurd and implausible at times, but
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  isn't about saving the world or learning how to use special powers. It's a story about fitting in, struggling with identity, and standing up for one's friends. In this way, it has a lot in common with Rockstar's other leading titles, which explore the human condition in relation to society. For as much controversy as it stirred up when it launched,
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  is actually a remarkably mature and nuanced game, both in terms of storytelling and gameplay, and it's fair to say that it's among Rockstar's greatest achievements. It's dormant now, but the IP should see the light of day sometime relatively soon.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Red Dead Redemption
   </strong>
  </em>
  franchise has enjoyed a huge amount of success over the years, being the only other major Rockstar IP to rival the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  franchise and carving out its own legacy in modern pop culture. A lot of this success can be attributed to the clear level of care and detail that Rockstar weaves throughout the
  <em>
   Red Dead
  </em>
  games, but this can lead to huge periods of downtime when fans are left wanting more.

  Despite the lingering acclaim and success that
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  still maintains thanks to the release of
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  , fresh content for the franchise has been few and far between in recent years. While this is fairly understandable as Rockstar gears up for the massively anticipated launch of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  , there is still a feeling that
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  did not achieve all that it could have throughout its post-launch life. These recent trends for the franchise are starting to change, however, with the closing months of 2024 bringing some excellent updates that hopefully spell brighter days for the IP going into 2025.

  The legacy that

  possesses to this day is a testament to just how successful the game has been since its launch in 2018, with the title being considered by many as one of the best story-driven experiences to ever come from the gaming medium. With over 65 million copies sold and with the title controversially missing out on the Game of the Year award in 2018, the earlier days of
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  painted a bright future that many fans were expecting to maintain the tremendous momentum that the franchise had built.

 <p>
  Having said that, the post-launch life of
  <em>
   Red Dead 2
  </em>
  has been quite dormant, with new developments for the franchise being few and far between since 2018. Many fans had hoped for a remaster of the original
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  in the wake of
  <em>
   RDR2,
  </em>
  for example, but this never materialized; instead, the game received ports to consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Rockstar also infamously continued its recent trend of not releasing any post-launch story DLC for
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , after the wildly-successful
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  faced the same fate.

  While
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  had the hugely popular
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  to fall back on to make up for this,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is a much more story-driven title, with its lack of narrative DLC being all the more bizarre given the franchise's excellent track record with this kind of content. 2010's
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  famously featured the
  <em>
   Undead Nightmare
  </em>
  expansion, for example, which is considered by some to be some of the best single-player DLC ever made.

 <p>
  Things also initially looked promising for
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  , with this potentially being a great conduit for post-launch
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  content, but this was quickly halted. In 2022, Rockstar surprisingly announced that
  <em>
   RDO
  </em>
  would not receive any more major content updates, leaving the game in a much weaker state while being completely reliant on seasonal events and community-made content.

 <p>
  Despite these recent pitfalls, the
  <em>
   RDR
  </em>
  franchise has been picking up a lot of positive momentum recently, with it being announced that a fully optimized PC port is finally coming for 2010's
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Undead Nightmare
  </em>
  on October 29. This marks the first time that the original
  <em>
   RDR
  </em>
  has ever been officially available on PC, marking the end of a 14-year-long wait for some players.

 <p>
  To compound this, a significant amount of effort went into the recent October update for
  <em>
   Red Dead Online
  </em>
  , with a range of brand-new challenges and cosmetics accompanying the return of limited-time modes based around Halloween. While there is still a long way to go for the
  <em>

  </em>
  franchise to live up to a lot of the post-launch expectations that were built around
  <em>

  , Rockstar is clearly taking a step in the right direction to finish off 2024.

      Activision fixed an exploit in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 allowing players to ban others, causing many to be mistakenly banned.
     </li>
     <li>
      An anti-cheat scan triggered by the chat term "Trigger Bot" caused bans, impacting legitimate players.
     </li>
     <li>
      The fixing of the exploit could lead to cheaters potentially being unbanned alongside falsely banned players.

  Activision has disabled an exploit that allowed
  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  players to ban their opponents by simply sending them a message or a friend request, causing many legitimate players to be unable to play the game. While the developers have stated that they have unbanned accounts that fell prey to this exploit,
  <em>

  </em>
  fans are quite unhappy about the whole fiasco.

  <em>

  and
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  players have been frustrated with cheaters for quite a while now. There was also a huge surge in the number of cheaters after
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  debuted on Xbox Game Pass. Although the developers have made some improvements to the anti-cheat to address the situation, encountering cheaters in every other game is still fairly common. To make things even worse, some legitimate players were accidentally banned in the past few days.

  In a new tweet, Activision reveals a crucial fix it is implementing for the RICOCHET Anti-Cheat in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  . For the past few days, some players have been using an exploit to ban their opponents in the game. As a result, many legitimate players have been banned from the game. Activision has not detailed the specifics of the exploit, but it has stated that all accounts that were banned due to the issue will be unbanned.

  However, fans have actually found how the exploit worked. As Twitter user zebleer explains, the ban capitalizes on the signature scanning strategy that is used by RICOCHET Anti-Cheat in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  . Basically, the anti-cheat looks for signatures in the memory to detect the use of cheating software. One of the signatures it looks for is the word "Trigger Bot", which is a common cheating tactic used by cheaters to automatically shoot while pointing at an enemy. Due to this, any player could write the word "Trigger Bot" in the chat or set it as their profile name and send a friend request, and this would result in the opponent getting banned altogether.

 <p>
  The repercussions of this exploit go way beyond banning single players, as it is stated that there were hotkey scripts that could get entire lobbies banned in
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  . The tweet also notes that Activision reversing the bans could potentially restore the accounts of cheaters who were banned due to signature scanning. Additionally, while Activision stated that a small number of accounts were impacted, many in the community believe that thousands were falsely banned due to the exploit.

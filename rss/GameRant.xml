 <p>
  While it first appeared as though Game Science's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  would put players in direct control of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King from the 16th-century Chinese novel
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  , the action RPG is set some time after the events of the novel. Ultimately, this means that
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is separated enough from
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  that it can attempt to establish its own identity as an original story, as opposed to being a direct adaption of the novel. As a result, rather than playing through
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  as Sun Wukong himself, players experience a reimagining of the world brought to life by
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  through the eyes of a humble monkey simply referred to as the "Destined One" — an almost identical physical copy of Sun Wukong.

 <p>
  In many ways,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  could be considered a sequel to
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  , as it makes regular past-tense references to the original story throughout its own roughly 30-hour narrative. However,
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  is more the bones of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  than the muscles, with the novel essentially only serving as the foundation for the moving story and enchanting world Game Science has crafted here. It certainly doesn't shy away from including some of the most notable characters from
  <em>
   Journey to the West —
  </em>
  though many of them have been reconceptualized for the game — and its heavy reliance on Eastern mythology helps to fill in any gaps left in the wake of its semi-adaptive format.

 <p>
  While the Destined One is an original character created specifically for
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , many of the game's other major characters are almost explicit copies of those from
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  . As the game's story takes place five centuries after the events of the novel, these characters help maintain the game's connection to its "past" and, in turn, give substance to its present. The major boss of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's first chapter, for instance, is the Black Wind King, who is based on the Black Wind Demon from
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  . Both the Black Wind King and the Black Wind Demon wield a Black Tassel Spear, can transform into a ferocious black bear, and serve as the guardian of Black Wind Mountain. The Black Wind King is also the first character to confirm
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's place in
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  's
  <em>
  </em>
  timeline when he mentions it has been 500 years since his last encounter with Sun Wukong.

  One of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's most complex and developed characters is Bajie, a major character in
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  who now fills the role of partner, mentor, and guide to the Destined One throughout most of the game's story. In the novel, Bajie is characterized by his laziness to some degree, but his respectful and soft-hearted side is often revealed in his love for Sun Wukong, whom he affectionately refers to as "brother." His relationship is best defined as warm, and it's easy for readers to endear themselves to him as a result. In
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , on the other hand, Bajie's most prominent characteristics are his arrogance and recklessness. However, his unbridled commitment to the game's protagonist often exposes the same tenderness of the character he is based on, as he can't help but see his old friend when he looks at the Destined One. The unifying element among these takes on Bajie is how likeabe he truly is.

  The game also features many of the same locations from
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  , though they have been meticulously crafted from the ground up to provide plenty of room for exploration and
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  's countless bosses.
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  locations like Black Wind Mountain, Yellow Wind Ridge, the Flaming Mountains, and Mount Huaguo are all explorable locations in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  . However, they have been designed to reflect time-driven change and their current role in a brand-new story centuries ahead of the novel. This helps
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  to set itself apart from
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  as a standalone experience.

 <p>
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  may dig its roots into
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  , but the significant time gap between the two stories doesn't require the game to remain true to every single element of its source material. This ultimately grants some leeway for Game Science to include characters not found in
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  , while still honoring its nature as an Eastern mythology-inspired story.
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  therefore introduces new characters — primarily enemies — not originally found in
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  that are largely inspired by Eastern mythology, in addition to new and revised locations from the novel to reflect the passage of time.

  <em>

  is a pantheon of celestial beings, deities, and mythological creatures known as Yaoguai, and

  is perhaps even more so with its inclusion of Yaoguai not found in the novel. The Destined One encounters dozens of "lesser" Yaoguai in

  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  certainly relies on the story, characters, and locations of
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  to establish context for the Destined One's journey. At the same time, this is a story that takes some time after the events of
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  , so Game Science has ensured that it feels like a brand-new story by including new creatures based on Eastern mythology and new locations never mentioned in the book. Getting to explore these locations, undertake quests, and otherwise appreciate the beauty of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  will go a long way - beyond its boss fights. After all,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is not a boss rush - it's a journey through a Chinese mythology and
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  -inspired world. Its emphasis on original elements, engaging worldbuilding, and beautiful vistas ensures that even those unfamiliar with
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  should be able to appreciate
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  as an original adventure.

  The
  <strong>
   Quirky Girl
  </strong>
  is one of them, and just like her name suggests, she’s a little eccentric in her tastes. She’s looking for a videotape recommendation, and where else better to get one than the Random Play video store? She’ll probably pop up for most
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  players when they reach
  <strong>
   Video Store Level 6
  </strong>
  . So, keep an eye out for her and make sure she gets the correct tape.

  The
  <strong>
   Quirky Girl
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  is looking for something out of the box because she plans to open up a
  <strong>
   paranormal club
  </strong>
  . She’s looking for inspiration, and her only hope is a fantasy movie with some ‘wacky’ theatrics. The request is pretty simple, and when you filter out the options from the genre list, you’ll be left with two movies.

 <p>
  Both movies may seem to work due to their descriptions, but
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  loves to trick their players. The videotape description that sounds most like the one requested often doesn’t end up being the correct one.
  <strong>
   Never Overtime is the correct answer for the Quirky Girl
  </strong>
  . This can easily confuse players because its description is the complete opposite of a fantasy movie.

  <li>
   The

  Unfortunately, there is no grand prize other than that, but successfully recommending the correct videotape will help

   raise customer satisfaction

  . This can aid in raising your Random Play Video Store level and invite more

  NPCs to come to you for recommendations. This raises customer trust and influences your business positively. Some of the NPC recommendations are a little tough, so make it a point to keep an eye out and choose the right videotape.

  Aside from fighting enemies in the Hollow and saving the city of New Eridu from its constant threats, Proxies in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  have the most chilled-out main job. They run the Random Play Video Store, which also works as a home base for all their Hollow missions. The video store is run by the Proxies and is Sixth Street's go-to spot when looking for a decent movie to kick back and relax with.

 <p>
  During the day, various customers come and go, purchasing various movies to indulge in. Proxies in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  can open the store every day and simply wait for the extra money to flow in. Additionally, they’ll also come across some NPCs who come seeking recommendations for videotapes to watch. The
  <strong>
   Hapless Man
  </strong>
  who is looking for a Tragedy Videotape is one of them.

 <p>
  The Hapless Man’s Inquiry is pretty simple in comparison to the other NPCs that ask for a recommendation. This is because he’s already been through a lot and seems to be unconcerned with explaining himself. He’s pretty down on his luck with life and all he wants is a
  <strong>
   Tragedy
  </strong>
  movie to watch. He doesn’t want to feel like he’s the only one feeling miserable and this hint makes things a whole lot easier for players.

 <p>
  The correct answer for the
  <strong>
   Hapless Man is the Black Tales Videotape
  </strong>
  . You can filter your video genre to
  <strong>
   Tragic
  </strong>
  and two options will come up. Black Tales and Encore - however, Encore is
  <strong>
   not the correct one, and
  </strong>
  it will not give you any rewards. Black Tales works better because it’s a Level 3 videotape, whereas Encore is just Level 2. The Hapless Man will just be dissatisfied with the recommendation and you’ll have to wait awhile to see him again.

  The Black Tales videotape is only available after reaching
  <strong>
   Video Store Level 5 and Inter-Knot Level 35
  </strong>
  . You’ll need to speak to Anna at Random Play and only then will the video be added to your list. It hasn’t been confirmed whether she will immediately give it to you, but it’s a must to reach the specific levels.

  Once the Hapless Man is at the counter and you have obtained the videotape, simply recommend it to him and wait for the yellow interaction bubble. Speak to him immediately and he’ll thank you for the recommendation. You’ll receive 12, 500 Dennies and unfortunately not anything else. However, getting this right will help players build the Video Store's trust and reputation with its customers. Players can then look forward to more NPCs entering the Video Store and asking for more recommendations, helping the business flourish.

      <title>WoW SoD: Best Phase 4 Consumables For Every Class</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/wow-sod-best-phase-4-consumables-for-every-class/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Now that Phase 4 of
  <em>
   Classic WoW's Season of Discovery
  </em>
  is in full swing, players have reached the traditional level 60 cap and are exploring the endgame dungeons and raids, many of which have new features. What hasn't changed is the list of consumables that players have to take with them to raids, and these handy but temporary items can also be helpful in some of the endgame dungeons.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":396} -->

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: below first paragraph! -->
 <p>
  Players should choose consumables according to their raid role and the strengths of their class. Many of the consumables from Phase 3 are still useful in max-level raids, so players can stock the same items along with some other useful selections.

    <p>
     This is so important that the leaders of the raid often designate one person as their Alchemist, cook, fisher, or Herbalist since most of the best consumables are crafted.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Enchanted Sigil: Flowing Waters.
   </strong>
   A new Phase 4 buff is available from those who have a Revered reputation with the Hydrexian Waterlords and at least 290 in Enchanting, the source of this raid-wide consumable is an Enchanting spell. It gives everyone in the raid a +30 to damage and healing spells and attack power.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Might of Stormwind.
   </strong>
   A new Phase 4 world buff for Alliance players that's the equivalent of the Horde's Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer, it gives +15 to attack speed and adds 300 to the character's health.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Cooking Recipes.
   </strong>
   Runn Tum Tuber Surprise, Nightfin Soup, Grilled Squid, and other useful dishes are all crafted food items that are useful in raids and almost any class can use them. Rum Tum Tuber Surprise is the most difficult to find and make. The recipe only drops from Pusllian, one of the bosses in Dire Maul, and the rubers are only found in Razorfen Crawl.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Enriched Mana Biscuits.
   </strong>
   Available to those who have a Friendly reputation with the Argent Dawn, this is a cheap, high-level food from Phase 3 that restores both health and mana. Get to Honored and other more powerful consumables are available, such as Blessed Sunfruit.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Demonic Runes.
   </strong>
   These are a rare drop from demons and satyrs in both the open world and various dungeons. They restore mana, but at the cost of health, and are useful to any class that uses mana except Warlocks who already have the Life Tap ability.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Winterspring Doctor.
   </strong>
   If you bring Witch Doctor Mau'ari in Wintersrping trades a few E'kos, he'll turn them into powerful Jujus that provide better elemental resistance and improved attack and spell power. These are often more powerful than the equivalent potion or elixir.
  </li>
 </ul>

  With each subsequent game under its belt, FromSoftware continues to improve upon its now-beloved action-RPG formula. From more experimental boss designs in
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  , to the introduction of trick weapons in
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , to the grander scale and scope of
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  's story, each and every FromSoftware game has tried to take the formula at least one step further, and that's certainly the case with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  By far FromSoftware's most ambitious title to date,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  brings the developer's action-RPG formula to a gigantic open-world setting and packs that world with exciting bosses, mysterious dungeons, and rewarding loot. By all accounts,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is a massive step forward for FromSoftware's formula, but there are one or two things past games do slightly better, and
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  's approach to dragon bosses could arguably be one of those.

  Elden Ring's Dragon Bosses Are Epic But Repetitive
 </h3>
 <p>
  The first time players run into one of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's dragons is a pretty momentous occasion. More often than not, players' first dragon encounter will be with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Flying Dragon Agheel, located near the starting area of Limgrave. This boss fight is suitably epic, with the dragon's moveset containing a variety of impressive sweeping attacks and flying maneuvers. But while Flying Dragon Agheel is a memorable boss fight, it quickly becomes just one of many.

  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  features well over 10 dragons, with a handful more appearing in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. Though all of these dragons have different names and slightly different visual designs, many boast very similar movesets, albeit with a different elemental attack. These similar movesets eventually lead to some fairly repetitive fights, and after rolling credits on
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , some players will find that many of the game's dragon bosses have blended into one.

 <p>
  That being said, there are a handful of dragon boss fights in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  that stand ahead of the rest of the pack. Dragonlord Placidusax, Lichdragon Fortissax, and the most recent and impressive addition, Bayle the Dread all offer some of the best dragon boss fights in FromSoftware's catalog, with each one delivering impressive visuals, a bombastic score, and a distinct moveset.

  Sekiro's Dragon Boss Feels Truly Special
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  may only feature one dragon boss fight, but it's one of the most memorable in FromSoftware history. Located at the end of Fountainhead Palace,
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  's Divine Dragon sits at the end of an enormous, otherworldly arena. After taking out some tree-like dragon minions, the Divine Dragon reveals itself in all its ethereal glory, wielding a large blue sword unlike any from the real world. Players need to avoid the dragon's sweeping attacks, ride its conjured winds high into the sky, and rain lightning down upon its head. It may be an easy fight, but it's a truly epic one that manages to capture the majesty and scale of a dragon fight in a way unlike any of FromSoft's games before it.

  An Ideal FromSoftware Dragon Boss Fight Lies Somewhere In The Middle
 </h3>
 <p>
  If the next FromSoftware action-RPG is going to include a dragon boss fight, it should take a page out of both
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  's respective playbooks. The ideal FromSoftware dragon boss fight would capture the scale and elegance of such a fantastical creature, just as
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  's Divine Dragon did, but it would also borrow the faster-paced gameplay of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Bayle and Placidusax.

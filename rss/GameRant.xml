			<title>Pokemon GO Makes It Clear that Ultra Beasts Can't Stay on the Shelf</title>

	<em>
	 <strong>
		Pokemon GO
	 </strong>
	</em>
	continues to prove that, as one of the franchise's more unusual generational gimmicks, Ultra Beasts deserve another chance in the spotlight in a game that makes the most out of these bizarre but fascinating Pokemon. Alongside other new features (like regional variants) introduced in Gen 7's
	<em>
	 Pokemon Sun
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Moon
	</em>
	and their
	<em>
	 Ultra
	</em>
	counterparts, Ultra Beasts radically changed how players viewed the games by implying
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	was another gaming multiverse. But while the recent
	<em>
	 Pokemon Scarlet
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Violet
	</em>
	games attempted to replicate the Ultra Beasts' success with the likes of Paradox Pokemon, these extradimensional Pokemon remain unrivaled and in dire need of a comeback.

	Between the latest
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	Ultra Beast raids and research events and
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	games ranging from
	<em>
	 Scarlet
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Violet
	</em>
	to
	<em>
	 Pokemon Legends: Arceus
	</em>
	exploring ideas about space, time, and alternate dimensions, it seems that these underutilized Pokemon can still play a part in the larger series. Unfortunately, even with the substantial amount of lore added in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Ultra Sun
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Ultra Moon
	</em>
	, Game Freak has seemingly put Ultra Beasts on ice for the foreseeable future. However, if the once-retired Mega Evolutions can return in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Legends: Z-A
	</em>
	, then there may still be hope for Ultra Beasts.

 <p>
	As far back as
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	's earliest games, players have been speculating about the true scale of the franchise's universe, with infamous examples including potentially alien Pokemon like Clefairy, Deoxys, and Elgyem, as well as claims that Arbok was the first-ever regional variant. But theories about a
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	multiverse seemed purely fan-made until Gen 7 introduced Ultra Beasts, Ultra Wormholes, Ultra Space, and more. These changes recontextualized several other
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	games, such as connecting Giratina's Reverse or "Distortion" World to Ultra Space or suggesting that
	<em>
	 Pokemon Omega Ruby
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Alpha Sapphire
	</em>
	's Looker and
	<em>
	 Legends: Arceus
	</em>
	' Ingo fell through Ultra Wormholes.

 <p>
	In addition to this, other key details introduced during Gen 7's games raise some arguably stranger questions regarding Ultra Space and Ultra Beasts. For instance, while Pokemon fusions are highly uncommon,
	<em>
	 Sun
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Moon
	</em>
	feature an even rarer human-Pokemon fusion between Lusamine and Nihilego. Moreover,
	<em>
	 Ultra Sun
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Ultra Moon
	</em>
	established that entire societies existed in Ultra Space at some point, with cities such as Ultra Megalopolis and partner Pokemon like Poipole. The significance of these and many other world-changing details suggests that
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	's strange Ultra Beast gimmick needs deeper exploration in future games.

	Ultra Beasts Offer An Alternative to Legendary, Mythical, and Paradox Pokemon
 </h3>
 <p>
	Since Ultra Beasts are no longer classified as Legendary Pokemon and are more comparable to groups like pseudo-legendaries, they provide Game Freak with a means of introducing powerful Pokemon that are more unique and distinct from most others. Also, while
	<em>
	 Scarlet
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Violet
	</em>
	's Paradox Pokemon take on a similar role to Ultra Beasts, being based on existing Pokemon from either the past or the future arguably likens Paradox Pokemon to regional variants. Therefore, only Ultra Beasts offer the best of both worlds, enabling Game Freak to create odd, otherworldly Pokemon like Celesteela, Guzzlord, and Xurkitree while continuing to explore
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	's long-running interdimensional canon.

 <p>
	Despite the untapped wealth of potential Ultra Beasts and Ultra Space might have, it's understandable that Game Freak might prefer to develop new ideas for its mainline games to keep
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	fresh for players. However, as has since been revealed for
	<em>
	 Legends: Z-A
	</em>
	, there's nothing to prevent Ultra Beasts from returning in a future
	<em>
	 Pokemon Legends
	</em>
	or other spin-off game.
	<em>
	 Legends: Z-A
	</em>
	breaks the mold by returning to a largely abandoned mechanic; in the same vein, Ultra Beasts could be expanded on in a new modern game inspired by Gen 7 which dives into Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Space's mysterious, untold history.

	One
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Dragon Age: The Veilguard
	 </em>
	</strong>
	fan believes that they have figured out the factions of the game's companions. Their convincing theory subsequently made the rounds on social media, adding to the growing speculation surrounding
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: The Veilguard
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	First teased in late 2018, the next entry in BioWare's fantasy RPG series was officially announced as
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
	</em>
	in 2022. Two years later, the studio decided to rename
	<em>
	 Dreadwolf
	</em>
	to
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: The Veilguard
	</em>
	. The company said that the name change was meant to reflect the shift in the game's narrative focus from its antagonist to the protagonist's companions, who will presumably be part of the titular order. That occasion also saw BioWare announce that the upcoming RPG's gameplay reveal will arrive on Tuesday, June 11.

 <p>
	In the meantime, one fan may have already figured out some background information about the game's cast. Using BioWare's recent confirmation that each of the
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: The Veilguard
	</em>
	companions will come from a different faction of Thedas, Twitter user Andarateia put together a visual that speculates about which characters will represent which groups. The graphic incorporates some of the official character artwork that the developer had shared in the past.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":379} -->

 <p>
	Their designs do roughly match up with the factions that Andarateia had associated them with. According to their theory, the companions will represent Antivan Crows, Grey Wardens, Lords of Fortune, Mortalitasi, Shadow Dragons, Veil Jumpers, and Qunari. While each individual guess appears plausible, several seem all but certain. That group includes
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: The Veilguard
	</em>
	's Qunari companion, not least because her gray skin and horns are both unmistakable traits of the people of the Qun.

	Likewise, the shrouded character seen in the game's 2023 teaser appears likely to be a member of the House of Crows, also known as the Antivan Crowns. Doubly so because BioWare itself confirmed that the promotional video depicted Antiva City. Andarateia's graphic quickly spread on social media in early June, indicating that many
	<em>

	fans think that they may be onto something with their theory.

	BioWare is currently aiming to release
	<em>

	by the end of EA's ongoing fiscal year, which concludes in March 2025. The first and third entries in the series were released in November, while
	<em>
	 Dragon Age 2
	</em>
	debuted in March 2011. While the holiday season has historically been the most lucrative period of the year for game publishers, recent reports suggest that
	<em>

	may nonetheless hit the market in late winter, i.e., early next year.

	While it has yet to be officially announced,
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Persona 6
	 </strong>
	</em>
	has been the subject of speculation ever since the success of the franchise’s previous entry served to propel it further into the mainstream. Several releases have followed
	<em>
	 P5
	</em>
	in the form of spin-offs and a remake, but leakers have alleged that
	<em>
	 Persona 6
	</em>
	has been in development since before these recent titles were ever conceived. With cryptic but potentially insightful hints about what the game could be based around, it seems that the next
	<em>
	 Persona
	</em>
	is likely to repeat a storytelling pattern that its predecessors have established.

 <p>
	Multiple rumors have indicated possible directions that Atlus could take, but the apparent
	<em>
	 Persona 6
	</em>
	logo leak from known source Midori seems to be the most informative bit of news yet. It probably won’t act as the final version of the graphic, but the interwoven design of its “P” and “6” has been noted by the leaker as potentially being meant to evoke the upcoming game’s connection to the philosophical concept of yin and yang. Given the series’ history of betrayals and surprises, this theme of polarization might serve to set up some familiar yet compelling dynamics between characters.

 <p>
	The alleged placeholder logo that was revealed by Midori on X (formerly Twitter) corroborates prior claims about
	<em>
	 Persona 6
	</em>
	’s color theme being green, but the style of its text sparked speculation among fans which led the leaker to further elaborate with vague details. In response to a tweet attempting to make sense of the interlocked nature of the two characters, Midori replied with what seemed to be a clarification of its meaning:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":357} -->

 <p>
	It’s already known that the apparent codename for
	<em>
	 P6
	</em>
	is Edge, so this hint seems to be tying that detail into a broader statement about the game’s basis. Rumors have supported this through a reported emphasis on duality represented in mechanics, but there’s also one consistent trend of the greater franchise which this would almost certainly tie into.

	Players who have experienced multiple narratives of the
	<em>
	 Persona
	</em>
	series are likely to be familiar with the unexpected twists which have occurred in each mainline game, a part of the series which has ironically become quite predictable over time. These have become especially prevalent starting with the third entry, and these crucial plot twists have consisted of situations like the following:

 <p>
	Assuming that the concept of yin and yang serves as the foundation for
	<em>
	 Persona 6
	</em>
	, there are several different ways this could manifest in a similarly disruptive event. While it’s been rumored that two protagonists may be sharing the same role this time around, the reveal of this aspect is capable of being leveraged in various subversive ways that lean into duality.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
	One could represent yin while the other stands for yang, and these perceived roles can be flipped and challenged to shock the player. Given the focus on death and betrayal so far, there’s even potential for one of the protagonists to have an ulterior motive and switch sides, or for a new character who takes the facades of Tohru Adachi and Goro Akechi even further. If the light and darkness of ying and yang come into play in
	<em>
	 Persona 6
	</em>
	, there’s a solid chance that a sinister reality could be uncovered with more intensity than the series has ever seen before.

	The Pioneer Scouts of America in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Fallout 76
	 </em>
	</strong>
	was a pre-war organization in Appalachia inspired by Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson. The organization was loosely based on the Boy Scouts of America and emphasized outdoor activities and survival skills. The organization had three ranks: tadpole, Possum, and Squirrel. Although no longer active, players can still join the Pioneer Scouts, earn ranks, and collect badges to exchange for rewards.

	After completing the Order of the Tadpole side quest, players become eligible to earn Possum badges, which they can use to purchase Possum-related plans. Players must complete tasks and pass exams on various subjects to earn these badges. While passing these exams may seem time-consuming, the rewards, especially the backpack plans, make it worthwhile. Here are all the Possum exam answers in
	<em>

	A Debt Repaid is one of the more troublesome quests in Ghost of Tsushima, though not because of its contents. No, the reason it often gives problems is because of how difficult it is to find.

	For those aiming to 100% the game and earn a Platinum Trophy, ‘A Debt Repaid’ will likely be the very last quest they end up doing. This is because, unlike most other quests in
	<em>
	 Ghost of Tsushima
	</em>
	, no rumors point towards it, and unless someone stumbles upon the starting location by accident, there is no way to trigger a quest marker for it.

	A Debt Repaid can be started by talking to the bandit, Gomyo, found right
	<strong>
	 next to the Black Dye Merchant
	</strong>
	northeast of the Yarikawa Stronghold in Act 2. Gomyo can be encountered sitting next to a burnt cart, near some dead bodies. His exact location is hidden by the thick bamboo thickets that cover the area, making him somewhat difficult to locate.

	The easiest way to locate Gomyo is to fast travel to the Black Dye Merchant, turn directly south, and head into the forest. A pillar of white smoke wafts above the burnt cart next to him.

	Once Jin accepts Gomyo’s quest for vengeance, he will be led towards a large bandit camp nearby. There are three large groups of Bandits in the area. Jin will identify all three during the surveying stage.

	Feel free to use Standoff liberally here.
	<strong>
	 Each group is separate from one another

	, and they won’t set off an alarm to summon everyone if you attack them directly. Take out the lookouts first. Then, sneak over to the building in the middle and assassinate the sleeping bandits. Use Concentration to identify the targets. Afterward, either sneak attack or challenge all remaining bandits to clear the camp.

  Survival games appear somewhere on the list of most popular game genres year on year. These kinds of games offer players a unique challenge, pitting their wits against adversity to thrive and survive. Most commonly, the player will face an existential threat, such as a zombie apocalypse, that has left humanity in tatters, and turned a comfortable world into a hostile environment.

 <p>
  There are certain gameplay styles that are common to most survival games. Indeed, these are the definitive features that fans of the survival game genre look for. Almost all survival games will include some if not all of these gameplay features.

  Almost every survival game has some form of hunger and thirst mechanic. Generally, the player will need to eat and drink regularly just to stay alive. Some games simply have looted or harvested food the player can eat, others have advanced cooking systems to create food.

 <p>
  Food and drink in survival games are often tied to some kind of buff mechanic or healing. For example, in
  <em>
   7 Days To Die
  </em>
  , eating food will restore a portion of a player’s health bar, and drinking will increase the player’s stamina regeneration. Some games take the hunger and thirst mechanic even further, such as in the game
  <em>
   SCUM
  </em>
  , which completely simulates human metabolism, requiring the player to manage their nutrition on a macro scale.

  Survival games often require the player to perform actions that need specific tools. For example, an axe might be needed to chop down a tree. Additionally, the player may be able to equip certain items to increase their stats, such as armor or clothing.

 <p>
  These kinds of tools and equipment are generally either looted or crafted in survival games. Quite often, different levels of tools are used to gate certain resources. For example, in
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  , the player cannot mine copper until they have procured an antler pickaxe, which they cannot gain access to without killing the first boss.

  Fans of survival games know that resource gathering is one of the primary gameplay loops in most games that fit within the genre. Resource gathering can take a couple of different forms. Firstly, gathering using tools, such as using an axe to chop down trees. Secondly, resource gathering by looting, which is a common mechanic for procuring rare materials.

 <p>
  Resource gathering in survival games is often the precursor activity for more advanced gameplay loops, such as crafting, cooking, or base building. Almost every survival game will require some level of resource gathering to take place.

  Most survival games have some form of base building. This can range from creating a simple dwelling that is simply used for storing loot and materials, to advanced bases that are used for defense.

  Player-created items are a staple of survival games, to one extent or another. In some games, crafting is quite simple, and may simply consist of cooking food or similar consumables, relying on looting to equip the player with more advanced equipment.

 <p>
  Some survival games have complex crafting systems, requiring the player to collect and process raw materials into intermediary resources, before crafting a final item. Games such as
  <em>
   SCUM
  </em>
  favor this style of crafting, meaning the player needs to unlock recipes and track down rare materials to create new, powerful artifacts and equipment.

  Although it can be fun to run around in nature, collecting resources, and building a comfortable base, most players require some kind of challenge to overcome. Many survival games have points of interest that contain enemies such as monsters or zombies, which the player can take on in combat.

  Quite often, these same POIs are used as spawn points for valuable loot or rare crafting materials. This forces the player to meet the challenge of clearing the POI if they want to be able to get to this loot. POI also gives game designers locations within which to spawn quests or missions, or random enemy spawns.

  A survival game needs something the player is surviving from. There are a few games, such as
  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  , where simply surviving the harsh weather and environment is a significant challenge. However, most survival games pick an established trope such as a zombie apocalypse or alien incursion as the main threat the player must overcome.

  The deadly threat the player has to face will drive the overall flavor of the game. For example, players know that if they are playing a zombie survival game, they will be facing undead enemies, and that nighttime will be more dangerous. And of course, in PvP-enabled survival games, the deadly threat is the most deadly of all, other players.

      <title>31 Video Games With The Most Heartbreaking Endings, Ranked</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Who says video games can't be emotional? Granted, a lot of video game stories are fantastical, but once in a while, fans hit upon a golden nugget in a sea of mud. A good ending can leave a lasting impression in players' minds, and a sad ending even more so. A sad one tends to put the events of the story into another context, and it also helps fans remember the game and its story in a more positive light. A bad ending can ruin a story, while a good ending can make one.
 </p>

  This makes it important to have an ending in a video game that caps off a wonderful journey and justifies the many hours that players have invested in a game. This can be easier said than done, with players demanding the highest quality standards from their games and having extremely high expectations that can be hard to match. Thankfully, some of the
  <strong>
   saddest endings in video games
  </strong>
  end up being executed to perfection and make these games more memorable than ever.

   <strong>
    Updated on July 5, 2024 by Ritwik Mitra:
   </strong>
   There was a time when video games didn't feature nuanced storytelling, relying mostly on their gameplay to entice fans. While this approach still has many fans to this day, there's no denying that the holy matrimony of narrative and gameplay is what most video game players seek out, with the immersive medium of gaming allowing players to get immersed in a way that movies and TV shows simply can't accomplish. What really makes a video memorable is when it sticks the landing, and this is especially true in the case of
   <strong>
    games with sad endings
   </strong>
   that leave players with a sense of melancholic satisfaction.

  Despite how charming
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  may seem at the surface, there are some sinister and sad things boiling under the surface that take a while to uncover. At the end of disc 2, a mysterious figure starts narrating certain events in the show, making people wonder who this person is. By the end of the game, players will discover the truth about Vivi's existence and the finite nature of his lifespan.

 <p>
  It's a rather saddening plot point to uncover, giving the ending a melancholic touch when it turns out that Vivi has already passed away around this time. Despite how beautiful the conclusion of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  is, Vivi's fate is something that will take a while to digest after the credits roll for one of the
  <strong>
   sadder endings in video games
  </strong>
  .

  <em>
   Lisa: The Painful
  </em>
  is one of the funniest RPGs players can check out. The story focuses on Brad, a man who raises a girl in a world where all the women have disappeared. As one would expect, the post-apocalypse is not a great place for fatherhood, and Buddy is taken away when Brad is betrayed by his closest friends. This leads to a chase where Brad doesn't give up, come hell or high water.

 <p>
  His addiction to Joy ends up being his undoing, with the game slowly revealing that Brad was far from a model father. He is shunned by Buddy before eventually turning into a Joy mutant. It's a
  <strong>
   sad video game ending
  </strong>
  for a man who was abused by his father and had to witness a gruesome scene involving his sister, which would've obviously messed him up quite a bit.

  The great thing about Playdead games is that the narrative is never thrust into a player's face. Rather, it just cooks in the background and coaxes players to piece together the dots if they really want to know what's happening. Such is the case with
  <em>
   Inside
  </em>
  , the best game released by this studio that takes place in a mysterious half-destroyed world where players control a boy who is apparently being instructed by forces unknown.

  After breaking into a laboratory, the kid merges with an amorphous blob that has to crash through a facility, being both helped and impeded by humans. It's a bombastic conclusion that shows how the child was just a cog in the grand scheme of things, with the blob eventually attaining a twisted form of freedom. The secret ending isn't all that great either, with players essentially turning off the program that controls all these boys and stopping anything from happening altogether.

  The first act of
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  is a masterpiece, with players growing to hate Leshy and his manipulative ways. However, it turns out that this character just wanted to enjoy a good card game with the player, actually putting effort into the roleplaying process, unlike a certain dungeon master who takes over in the final act.

  When the game is being erased, Leshy sits down with the player for one more round of Inscryption. Players have grown to like this character, his sentient nature making it clear why one of the developers, Kaycee, found it downright impossible to delete
  <em>
   Inscryption
  </em>
  from existence. Even after the score tally disappears, Leshy plays on until he is deleted, making this farewell a bittersweet experience.

  It's a shame that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15
  </em>
  's development cycle was so cursed that the game was released in somewhat of an unfinished state despite being in development for way too long than it needed to. The game's story was so ambitious that a movie and an anime series were released for the title as well, with many people feeling that this hurt the effectiveness of the story instead of helping it.

  The game itself was memorable for the bond that the four characters shared while exploring the open world, with regular banter and emotional moments hammering in just how close this band of friends was. After Noctis is encased in the Crystal and the world slowly goes to ruin, he comes back and reunites with his friends to take out Ardyn once and for all. Unfortunately, taking out this malevolent entity meant that Noctis would have to give up his own life, making for a tearful farewell as he shares one last moment with the gang before sacrificing himself.

  <em>
   BioShock Infinite
  </em>
  is a great game that needs no introduction. Ken Levine's final work on the
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  franchise was absolutely masterful, bringing an emotional core to the story and the concept of parallel dimensions.

 <p>
  The ending of the game is a wild thrill ride with a pretty chilling conclusion. It turns out that Booker DeWitt needs to die for Elizabeth to stop being tormented, which makes for a pretty sad way to say goodbye to one of gaming's most memorable characters.

  As is the case with most FromSoftware games,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is a title that will wow players and make them feel lonely as they fight back against the oppressive nature of the Hunter's Nightmare. The game's dark Gothic atmosphere is just a front for the nightmarish Lovecraftian horrors that lay within, with players slowly uncovering a horrible mystery that seemingly has no end.

 <p>
  All three endings in
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  are pretty sad in their own right, and even the one where the player escapes the Hunter's Nightmare isn't without some horrible connotations of its own. The fact that the true ending of the game involves the player becoming a Great One is proof enough of how dark the game's ending is.

  <em>

  is a game that faced numerous controversies upon launch before slowly getting fixed over time. Regardless of its issues, there's no denying that

  Players will form a bond with V and Johnny by the end of this experience, which is why the ending hits so hard. Regardless of what choice players make, the ending will always be accompanied by a tinge of melancholy because of the events that have and will transpire.

  The story was pretty upbeat for a world that was being mauled by a massive evil presence over and over again. However, while the gang manages to beat Sin and save Spira, it turns out that Tidus was actually a dream of the Fayth along with Auron, who would disappear for good after the party fulfilled their end goal.

  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  is a pretty cheery and engaging title that fans will have a great time with. However, all the pomp and ceremony won't help fans get ready for a pretty emotional ending. Watching Aunt May die is a truly saddening event that is certainly meant to help Peter grow.

  When the sequel came out, fans could see just how much Peter was still hurting. The Symbiote had managed to target his insecurities, and it was only when Mr. Negative and Miles explored his psyche that they figured out how badly the original Spider-Man was hurting. Even now, the death of Aunt May makes for one of the
  <strong>
   saddest video game endings
  </strong>
  of all time.

  <em>
   Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons
  </em>
  tells the story of two siblings as they embark upon a brutal and unforgiving quest to find a cure for their father's illness. It plays around with some interesting mechanics which at the time of its release were fairly revolutionary. Granted, not all of them worked, and even those that did failed to have the impact that developer Starbreeze Studios might have been hoping for. It's an innovative and unique title nonetheless though.

 <p>
  With the boys' mother already dead, the importance of finding the cure takes on extra significance and drives them forward even in spite of the many dangers they face. The pair traverse many hostile environments and eventually encounter a young girl who helps them on their quest. As they near the end of their journey, however, she's revealed to be a gigantic spider that plans to eat them both. Although the two brothers prevail, one of them is mortally wounded and dies immediately after his younger brother procures the cure they have so desperately been searching for. The game ends with the remaining brother and his father standing next to two tombstones; tears trickling down their faces.

  <em>
   That Dragon, Cancer
  </em>
  is a beautifully crafted autobiographical game documenting the experiences of the Green family as they raise their infant son, Joel, who died at the age of five following a long battle with cancer. It's a heart-wrenching experience from start to finish and, sadly, like so many other stories involving cancer, the ending is far from happy. There's no sugarcoating to be found here, nor are players likely to make it to the end without shedding a considerable amount of tears.

 <p>
  The game is an incredibly depressing one but transcends the medium through its immersion and interactivity. It's difficult to articulate exactly why people should consider playing it as there's very little enjoyment to be found in the traditional sense. There's just something about the game that just draws players in though. To have been able to share Ryan, Amy and Joel's experiences is a privilege, but to do so also serves as a poignant reminder of how fleeting life really is and how lucky most of us are.

  Although
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  conforms to the typical Zelda formula in much of what it does, it is one of the series' more unique entries. For starters, there's no Princess Zelda to be found here, nor are there any signs of the Triforce either. Players can, however, expect to find a fun-filled journey that spreads itself across one of the series' most interesting and varied locales. The Switch remake obviously does a much better job of showing off all that Koholint Island has to offer, but the Game Boy version still holds up surprisingly well for one that's fast approaching its thirtieth birthday.

 <p>
  As already alluded to, the game's narrative chooses to ignore the more traditional good versus evil storyline and instead focuses on Link's quest to return home to Hyrule. As events begin to unfold though, players start to realize that Link's plan to wake the Windfish will have a catastrophic impact on the island and its inhabitants; many of whom Link (and by extension, the player) has grown incredibly close to. Unperturbed by the consequences, Link continues with his plan which causes all of the island's inhabitants to slowly fade away. It's technically possible to 'save' Marin by completing the game without dying, but she is just one of many who called the island of Koholint their home.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Professor Layton
  </em>
  series is usually lighthearted, so this might seem like a strange choice for those who aren’t incredibly familiar with the franchise. However, longtime fans know exactly why
  <em>
   The Unwound Future
  </em>
  makes it onto this list. Throughout the game, Layton is assisted by a woman named Celeste, the supposed sister of his deceased girlfriend, Claire.

 <p>
  The end of the game comes with the realization that Celeste is Claire, who had apparently died while trying to test a time machine prototype. While this would normally be a joyous reunion, Claire is unable to stay in the present and is forcefully sent back to the past, just before the time machine explodes and kills her. It’s a devastating experience for Layton and ends the game on a surprisingly somber note.

  <em>
   Ori and The Blind Forest
  </em>
  is a beautifully presented game with an incredibly compelling narrative, although it's book-ended by some tear-jerking scenes. The game begins with the death of the titular character's adoptive mother after a cataclysmic event decimates the forest that they call home. Given the game's primary themes include loss and acceptance, this was something of a necessity and, to the writer's credit, it sets up the remainder of the story perfectly. That doesn't make it any less distressing though.

 <p>
  Alone in the world and without a sense of purpose, Ori teams up with a light-based being called Sein to restore life to the forest. While on their journey, the pair encounter a giant owl named Kuro whose primary aim is to stop Ori. While Kuro is at first painted as little more than a textbook bad guy, it soon becomes clear that she too has experienced great loss and is acting in the best interests of her unborn child. As the game reaches its climax, Kuro sacrifices herself in order to prevent another catastrophe. Life returns to the forest and Kuro's final egg begins to hatch, but the child will emerge into a world in which it has no one or nothing.

 <p>
  Horror titles don’t usually have the most optimistic endings, and the
  <em>
   Corpse Party
  </em>
  series is no different. A sequel to the original game,
  <em>
   Book of Shadows
  </em>
  consists of seven main chapters, each expanding upon the stories of secondary characters from the first title. The prologue, Blood Drive, serves as a lead-in to the homonymous sequel, adding some new contentment that pushes the narrative forward.

 <p>
  The set-up for the sequel is pretty standard, with Ayumi and Naomi, two of the survivors from the original, setting out to find a way to bring back their dead friends. Things quickly go wrong and optimism turns to terror when Ayumi’s older sister is unexpectedly killed and Naomi is branded with a mysterious mark on her eye. It’s a sudden and shocking end that maintains the gruesome brutality the series is known for.

 <p>
  The original ending to Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter was so dark and depressing that subsequent releases featured a completely different conclusion. Given the game's target audience was primarily children, it's perhaps understandable why this decision was made. For all intents and purposes, the game is a lighthearted adventure that encourages players to experiment with drawing mechanics. From a gameplay perspective, it's a lot like Scribblenauts, but when it comes to their stories they could not be more different.

  The game takes place in a dreamlike world in which the protagonist, Mike, is trying to rescue his sister. Throughout the game, there are several allusions to 'that night' and plenty of signs that suggest something is not quite right. As the game nears its climax, the player learns that the protagonist is actually in a coma and that all of the people he's encountered throughout his journey will disappear when he wakes up. When he finally does so, it's revealed through a series of still images that Mike and his family were in a fatal car crash that seemingly killed both of his parents and left his sister with serious facial scarring.

  <em>
   Persona 3

  has been credited with having thrust the series into the mainstream. The critically acclaimed JRPG boasts a much darker tone compared to its successors. Death is a prevalent theme throughout the game, so it’s only natural for it to end on a tragic note.

  After defeating Nyx and saving the world, most players would expect the game to end on a high note. But the victory is short-lived, as players must watch as the main character dies in Aegis’ arms, just as their friends rush to them. The aftermath of the event is explored in

  The Answer, which offers the game’s cast and players some closure, even if some people aren't huge fans of this additional chapter.

  It's not the ending itself that is so heartbreaking, but the final half-hour or so of the game. Everything goes to hell once players reach the hospital, as they learn of Ellie's impending death, rush to rescue her, and escort her out of the hospital in a blaze of bullets and morose music.

  Yes, the ending proper is also very sad, as players can see Ellie's trust for Joel disintegrate in a second. It's certainly not as heartbreaking as some of the others on this list, but it's not very happy, either. This
  <strong>
   sad video game ending
  </strong>
  feels even worse if players know the events that transpire in

  is a multiplayer open-world survival game. The game has been announced for multiple platforms, which brings into question whether players will be able to play with their friends who are using a different device from the one they are playing on.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   short answer is yes
  </strong>
  , yes it will.
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  will feature cross-play across all announced devices. Having the game available across a wide range of devices will help to make it a very accessible option for gamers. Another way games can be made more accessible to a wider audience is if they adopt a free–to-play model, which is exactly the model that
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  uses.

  Players will be able to download and install
  <em>

  from either Steam or the Epic Game Store. The game has also been confirmed to be on the way for

  There is currently no official word if
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  will release on consoles. However, the console market has continued to rival both the PC and mobile devices when it comes to multiplayer games of all genres, and not releasing on these devices is something many fans might find disappointing.

  Another great facet of
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is that it supports Cross-Progression. This means players can spend a large portion of their time farming a resource such as ore on their PC, turn off their device, and then continue from the same save on their phone after they leave their home. This means they won’t need to wait until they get back home to put all that farming to good use.

 <p>
  Cross-progression is a feature that some players might not care much about, but for players that have to make long commutes to and from work, it is a great way to get in some gaming time while waiting for the weekend. Then they can enjoy all the fruits of their labor from the PC at home — so long as their PC is able to meet the requirements to play the game.

  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  was largely a success for EA even though fans had mixed opinions about it. As the follow-up to the celebrated
  <em>
   Dragon Age Origins
  </em>
  , the game had a lot to live up to, and ultimately delivered an experience that fell short of many fans' expectations. This was largely due to things like identical dungeon layouts, bugs, and frustrations about being limited to a single character origin story. With that said, it seems there's been one issue all along that's now bugging players.

  Reddit user Transcended_Sloot pointed out the issue, posting a pair of screenshots from
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  's character creation screen. Players are asked to pick a class and gender for their version of Hawke at the start of the game, and the screenshots show
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  's Rogue class across the two gender options. As Transcended_Sloot points out, the two versions of the description are identical, with the exception of a comma in the female version that shouldn't be there. The back button is also off-center, further adding to Transcended_Sloot's aggravation.

  Fellow fans in the comments have been quick to play along, talking about how this unbearable mistake has rendered the game unplayable for them. One joked about getting a refund for
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  after discovering this, even though the issue is only present in
  <em>
   Dragon Age 2
  </em>
  . Others asked for clarification on which was correct. The male version without the comma is the grammatically correct one, as the female version splits the subject from the predicate with the comma.

  Dragon Age Fans Have Bigger Concerns Than Commas About Dragon Age: Veilguard
 </h2>
 <p>
  EA finally released a new trailer for
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Veilguard
  </em>
  during the Xbox Showcase, which was received with mixed feelings from fans. Players have been eagerly awaiting more information about the title. However, initial responses to the teaser worried that the dark and grim tone of the prior games seemed to be absent, and that it was leaning into quippy dialogue like that seen in superhero movies in recent years. Since then, the game has revealed more of its content and mechanics, like reducing
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  parties from four members to three. Given the legacy of the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series, there are high expectations and hopes for the developers to meet. With any luck, the game will satisfy players and not contain any grammatical issues with unnecessary commas.

  Water is a useful resource in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Farming Simulator 25
   </strong>
  </em>
  that you need to keep your animals happy and keep the plants in your greenhouse(s) healthy. It's a bit of a process to get water, but there are a few sources you can use to make sure that you never run out or have an issue getting it when you need to.

  The first step to getting water in
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  is buying a container that carries water. These containers can be a bit difficult to spot at first, because they're in the barrels section under animals in the shop. There are four options you can choose from which let you carry a range of liquids at different capacities. At the start, though, you'll likely want to invest in either the ABI 550 or the 1600 variant, because they're cheaper and will let you carry water as you need around the farm.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Once you've bought your tank, you'll be able to pick it up at the vehicle shop in town. Once you have the container attached, you can drive up close to a water source and fill it up - usually by pressing "R" on a keyboard. Most towns have dedicated water sources which you can find on the map. They are usually indicated by water tank icons, and you can just drive to them and fill your container as you need. You can also drive up to any rivers and lakes and use the same key to fill up your container that way for free.

 <p>
  If you want to get water quickly, you can buy water tanks and place them on your farm. You can find water tanks under the construction menu in the container section. There are two types of water tanks you can buy: a regular water tank and an old wind wheel with a water tank attached to it. These are pre-filled tanks, so you'll only really get them if time is more of a concern than cost - because they can get pricey.

 <p>
  Once your water container is full, you'll need to transport it to where you want to use it. This will usually be in a greenhouse or a barn where you keep your animals. To unload the water, simply pull up the container to the designated water drop-off on either building and follow the prompts to unload it. You'll need to keep track of the water levels in your greenhouse and barns to make sure that your plants and animals always have access to fresh water.

 <p>
  Natural water sources are the best way to make sure that your farm has a good supply, but once you make enough money, having a few extra sources on your farm means that you'll be able to refill whenever necessary and without having to travel too far.

      <title>Why Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Sally Update is a Game-Changer</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley
   </em>
  </strong>
  has added a plethora of characters since its initial release in 2022. Last December saw the addition of Jack Skellington of
  <em>
   Nightmare Before Christmas
  </em>
  fame. It seems that this December will see the addition of his beloved Sally to
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  as well. In fact, Sally’s addition may change
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  a lot, and for the better.

  Jack’s addition to

  </em>
  back in Update 1.8 introduced some new and interesting elements to the game. If Sally’s addition is anything like the Pumpkin King’s,
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  could see not just some great new content, but some necessary feature changes.

 <p>
  Sally’s introduction to
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  was first teased in last year’s road map. She is being introduced to the game on December 4 in
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s “Sew Delightful” Update (1.14). Like other characters in the game, Sally will likely have a schedule, “Friendship Rewards”, and various quests. No information has been revealed about her story features, such as how to unlock her or the storyline derived from her quests, but
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  revealed and confirmed some aspects when announcing her.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1068} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Besides friendship rewards for Sally, two of her quests will include a date night and quilting; Jack Skellington will be integral to unlocking Sally in-game. Sally’s announcement also put heavy emphasis on her patchwork aesthetic. This makes sense since items included in friendship rewards tend to be based on the character they are tied to. For example, completing Level 3 of Jack Skellington’s friendship rewards earns players a design motif of his face, and completing Level 10 unlocks Jack’s Santa Suit. Based on the focus put on Sally’s design in the announcement, the items in her friendship reward track will be inspired by the patchwork elements of her dress and body.

 <p>
  It’s likely that other items outside of Sally’s friendship rewards will also be added to
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  . As seen with Jack’s addition to
  <em>
   Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  , these items will likely also be inspired by
  <em>
   Nightmare Before Christmas
  </em>
  and Sally’s design. However, Sally herself is not the biggest addition in the Sew Delightful update. Rather, a new feature for
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s build mode takes the cake for best addition in Update 1.14.

  Prior to the upcoming Sew Delightful update,
  <em>
   Disney Dreamlight Valley
  </em>
  ’s build mode only allowed players to rotate items in four different directions. Items would snap and lock automatically rather than free rotation. The Sew Delightful update changes this, giving players sixteen points of rotation in build mode. These rotation points don’t just apply to furniture, but also buildings, landscaping items, resources, and dropped items like prepared dishes. This feature currently doesn’t support fences and paths, but Gameloft confirmed that the feature will be updated in a future update to support these items.

  In addition to the new free rotation feature,

  is introducing Floating Islands for players to decorate. Each biome will have a separate Floating Island for players to decorate. Though these islands may have a certain theme or aesthetic, they remain a blank slate for players to allow their creativity to run wild. The Sew Delightful update will only release four Floating Islands, with new islands being introduced in future updates.

  While some publishers are striving to give new players a plethora of places to enjoy their bursting back-catalog of legacy titles, Sega has recently announced that their
  <em>
   Genesis/Mega Drive Classics
  </em>
  &amp;
  <em>
   Dreamcast Classics Collection
  </em>
  "will be delisted from virtual stores, becoming unavailable for new purchases." While some titles will be available on services such as Nintendo Switch Online, a laundry list of classic Sega titles is slated to be delisted and will not be playable unless purchased prior.

 <p>
  Ranging from 2D and 3D first-party classics from Sega's 16-bit peak and sixth-generation low, the catalog of titles that are slated to be delisted is astonishing.

  Set within the bounds of stylized comic book pages, and developed in-house for the 16-bit Sega Genesis, 1995's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Comix Zone

  </strong>
  shows a level of metanarrative storytelling and artistic flair that arguably even some of the best titles of the era couldn't compete with.

  Following the panel-smashing beat 'em up journey of Sketch Turner,
  <em>
   Comix Zone
  </em>
  is unashamedly of its time in its aesthetic and appeal, as the 90s charm almost bleeds from the virtual pages. Despite some spikes in difficulty and somewhat derivative gameplay,
  <em>
   Comix Zone
  </em>
  is not only a fantastic Sega title but one of the generation's most creative and expressive works.

  With a motion picture reportedly in the works by Universal Pictures, and acclaimed as one of the greatest video games of all time, 1989's
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Revenge of Shinobi
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not just a genre-defining action-platformer but a Sega staple. With stellar level design and tight 16-bit gameplay,
  <em>
   The Revenge of Shinobi
  </em>
  is arguably one of the fourth console generation's quintessential titles.

 <p>
  At its core,
  <em>
   The Revenge of Shinobi
  </em>
  is an archetypal sequel - having only been the
  <em>
   Shinobi
  </em>
  series' second console title - as it expands and elaborates on not only the gameplay and setting but also the title's 16-bit style. Despite some peculiar boss fights against Spiderman, Batman, and a T-800 Terminator that exude
  <em>
   The Revenge of Shinobi'
  </em>
  s 1980s pulp charm, the title is still an extremely enjoyable ninja-themed romp as players hack and slash through antagonistic Neo Zeed forces.

   <em>

  While Sega's hardware rival Nintendo had a thorough working relationship with RPG giant SquareSoft, that is not to say the library of the Sega Genesis was lacking in strong RPG content. The 16-bit Sega console had a seeming prevalence of tactical role-playing games, such as
  <em>
   <strong>
    Shining Force
   </strong>
  </em>
  , which went on to have a somewhat successful stint on Sega's ill-fated Sega Saturn console.

  Despite twenty-three years, and an Xbox-exclusive sequel, there is arguably no Dreamcast title that exudes the same amount of raw heart and attitude as Sega's internally-developed action-sports title
  <em>
   <strong>
    Jet Set Radio
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  While the pop-punk rebellious nature of the
  <em>
   Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
  </em>
  -esque rollerblading title has remained core to the series' identity, it persists as not only a title indicative of Sega's golden years but a touchstone for modern titles with creative movement systems.

  With a soundtrack featuring a whole slew of genres - from Acid Jazz and Dance tracks to Funk and Trip Pop - the eccentric creativity on display from one of Sega's effective swan song titles is on full display, all the time. With its foothold within Sony and Microsoft ecosystems, alongside ports to PC, iOS, and Android systems, the heart-thumping imagination of
  <em>
   Jet Set Radio

  remains a solid reminder of Sega's capabilities in the industry.

  Proclaimed as "the explosive finale" of Sega's internally-developed six-year fantasy RPG series that started in 1987,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Phantasy Star 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  's release continued the turn-based RPG exploration that Sega had cultivated. Now widely accepted as arguably the best role-playing experience on Sega's 16-bit system,
  <em>
   Phantasy Star 4
  </em>
  's gameplay, visuals, and narrative are all seemingly second to none in the fourth console generation.

  As a pseudo-prequel to
  <em>
   Phantasy Star 3
  </em>
  , Sega's 1993 RPG expanded the series' illustrative style and concentrated on the title's close relationships between gameplay systems. Having been brought into the fold of multiple Sega-themed compilations, and a
  <em>
   Phantasy Star
  </em>
  collection on Sega's poorly-received Sega Saturn, thankfully
  <em>
   Phantasy Star 4

  's unique polish and expanse have no real fear of being lost to time.

  It is relatively fair to state that the industry highs and nostalgic lows of Sega's Genesis and Dreamcast systems have been deeply represented through Sega's contemporary porting efforts. However, when it comes to the Sonic developer's fifth-generation console - the Sega Saturn - such heaped praise is a little harder to come by. As such, the dizzying quality and multimedia smorgasbord that is
  <em>
   NiGHTS Into Dreams
  </em>
  is arguably still - nearly thirty years later - as important to Sega's heritage as the Blue Blur.

 <p>
  What at first seems like a somewhat by-the-numbers 2.5D action-platformer is very swiftly replaced by the title's unique design and aesthetic, as its Freudian-esque soundtrack and visuals create a semi-psychedelic experience. However, while

  There's an impressive variety of mounts available in
  <strong>
   <em>
    World of Warcraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Owning a rare or unique mount is a major flex, and players who have earned their fancy rides like to show off. They are obtainable through questing, reputation grinding, dungeons, raids, and certain promotions. Plenty of completionist collect them just so they can say they have the rarest mounts in the game. While some mounts may no longer be obtainable, this does not diminish their rarity. Percentages provided below are from Data For Azeroth.

   <strong>
    Updated on November 16, 2024 by Paul Woodward:
   </strong>
   With the release of The War Within, there are even more mounts for players to obtain in World of Warcraft. Some mounts are easier to get than others, ranging from having a high enough Renown to purchase them to getting lucky on a rare drop/rare enemy. Regardless of rarity, more mounts means that players have more options and variety when they need to get from one zone to another quickly.

  Rare enemies have been in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  since the very beginning. However, it wasn't until
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  that rare enemies included a mount on their loot table. The Time-Lost Pro-Drake is a rare enemy that can be found flying around in the Storm Peaks. If players manage to find and kill it, they are guaranteed to get this rare as a mount.

 <p>
  Of course, there is a catch. It is estimated that the Time-Lost Proto-Drake respawns every two to eight hours. Not only that but there are several different areas in the zone where the Time-Lost Proto-Drake can spawn, making it difficult to get to before someone else does. To complicate matters further, Time-Lost Proto-Drake shares these spawn points with another rare known as Vyragosa. So when a rare enemy does spawn, it may not even be the Time-Lost Proto-Drake.

 <p>
  When Archaeology was added to the game back during
  <em>
   Cataclysm
  </em>
  , it added a variety of rewards for players to chase after. In addition to BoA epics, players could obtain toys, pets, and even mounts. The Ultramarine Qiraji Battle Tank was one of those mounts, and it was a rare artifact that could be obtained in Uldum. The problem with this is that there is several layers of RNG working against players that make getting this mount a long and tedious process.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":967} -->

 <p>
  Not only do players need to have a fairly high skill level in Archaeology to get dig sites in Uldum, but these aforementioned dig sites rarely show up. On top of that, the Scepter of Azj'aqir artifact that unlocks this mount is a rare project and players are entirely at the mercy of RNG. Layers of RNG aside, this mount is also rare due to the fact that it is the second Qiraji Battle Tank that can be used outside the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj.

  This mount has some interesting history, to say the least. It was originally known as the Big Love Rocket and had a suggestive icon. After the Blizzard sexual harassment controversy in 2021, the name of the mount was changed along with the icon in Patch 9.1.5.

 <p>
  History aside, this mount had an extraordinarily low drop rate when it was first added to the game back during
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  . The X-45 Heartbreaker could only be acquired during the Valentine's Day event in WoW known as Love is in the Air. It is estimated that the drop rate at the time was one in 3333, which meant it has less than a one percent chance of dropping. On top of that, the event only ran for two weeks. If players didn't get the mount during the event, they would have to wait until the next year.

 <p>
  The drop rate was dramatically improved with Patch 10.0.5. That said, this mount was very difficult to get for over 13 years which is why so few players have gotten it.

 <p>
  Since achievements were first added to
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  during
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  , there has always been a meta-achievement for each raid tier. By completing the achievements listed under that meta-achievement, players would earn a special mount to show off that they had gone above and beyond.

 <p>
  In order to unlock Glory of the Draenor Raider, players have to complete all 17 achievements for Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry. These achievements are not unlocked by simply defeating the bosses, and players often have to do the boss fights incorrectly or in a non-conventional way to complete them. As such, players hoping to get this mount will need a well-organized team. Even though
  <em>
   Warlords of Draenor
  </em>
  is no longer relevant content, this can't be soloed since one of the achievements requires 10 players. This kind of coordination against bosses that can be one shot by one player makes it difficult to obtain the Gorestrider Gronnling, let alone any other meta achievement mount.

  Rare enemies have been a common part of
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  since the beginning. Per the occasional tooltip on the loading screen, rare enemies will often have better loot than what players would get from normal enemies. Sometimes, these rare enemies can drop a mount, and this is the case for Beledar's Spawn which drops a mount with the same name.

 <p>
  The tricky part about getting Beledar's Spawn is that players can only obtain it when Beledar's Shadow (essentially nighttime) is active in Hallowfall. At the start of Beledar's Shadow, Beledar's Spawn will appear at one of 20 different locations in Hallowfall. Getting a group and reaching Beledar's Spawn before it dies can be tricky, but to complicate matters further, the mount has a low drop rate. Between that and only having one chance per day for the mount, this is one that will take some time for players to get unless they get really lucky.

  Players who managed to obtain Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, a legendary staff from
  <em>
   Cataclysm
  </em>
  , can transform into Tarecgosa's Visage and fly. Of course, the limitation for this was that you had to have the staff equipped. While Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest was originally a BiS for many caster classes, that was over 12 years ago. As is the nature of an MMORPG like
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  , all gear eventually gets replaced, even legendary weapons. So, if players really wanted to use this unique looking mount, they had to either swap weapons back and forth or use a macro.

  That changed in 10.1 when Blizzard added a questline for players who obtained Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. After reaching Level 70 and completing the Blue Dragonflight campaign, Kalecgos will offer a small series of quests for eligible players. Upon completing it, players get the Lingering Echo of Tarecgosa which allows them to transform into Tarecgosa's Visage without needing to equip the old legendary staff. This is the second legendary mount in the game, making it a unique and rare mount.

 <p>
  Mounts are often available to players as a gold sink, as there are players who have a ludicrous amount of gold to burn, especially with the WoW Token allowing players to legally buy gold. Some early examples of this include the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth (16,000 to 20,000 gold depending on reputation) and the Grand Expedition Yak (120,000 gold).

 <p>
  The Mighty Caravan Brutosaur takes the cake by being the most expensive item that could be purchased from an NPC. Back when this mount was released during
  <em>
   Battle For Azeroth
  </em>
  , it cost 5,000,000 gold to purchase. Even with the ability to purchase WoW Tokens, not many players have that kind of gold just lying around. Nowadays, the Mighty Caravan Brutosaur occasionally appears at the Black Market Auction House.

 <p>
  Naturally, anything valuable like this will start a bidding war. Players who want to get this mount should make sure they are gold-capped (9,999,999 gold, 99, silver, 99 copper at the time of writing) as it is very likely the mount will hit the aforementioned gold cap once the bidding starts. The number of players who have this much gold is astronomically low, which is why a mount that can simply be purchased is so rare.

  Blizzard has been gradually finding ways to bring back old content that was removed when
  <em>
   Cataclysm
  </em>
  revamped Azeroth. Between old gear from Zul'Gurub, Naxxramas, and Scarlet Monastery, players can get their hands on old items that have been unobtainable for many years.

 <p>
  In some cases, there are even new things for players to find. A good example of this is Valiance, the same mount used by Thane Korth'azz, one of the Four Horseman bosses in Naxxramas. Once players have completed the lengthy series of steps to unlock the secrets of Naxxramas, they will be able to obtain Valiance by purchasing a Rotten Delicious, feeding it to Valiance in the Military Quarter, and then Instructor Razuvious after using a Death Knight Understudy to bring the mount to the arena.

 <p>
  As is intended, secrets in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  are not something that Blizzard promotes as they want the community to discover them. So many players who do not actively engage with community Discord servers or browse places like Wowhead would not neccessarily even know that secrets like Valiance are even in the game. As such, not many players have Valiance since the steps to acquire it are not obvious. There are no breadcrumb quests that lead to these secrets either.

  The first raid instance to have mounts in the loot table was Zul'Gurub, which was first released back on September 22, 2005. Blood Lord Mandokir dropped the Swift Razzashi Raptor while High Priest Thekal dropped the iconic Swift Zulian Tiger. The Swift Zulian Tiger was especially attractive for Horde players since they didn't have nightsaber mounts like the Alliance did. Both mounts were rare drops, but they were taken out of the game when patch 4.0.3a was released.

  Nowadays, the Swift Zulian Tiger occasionally shows up at the Black Market Auction House. Just like with any other mount that is no longer obtainable, players should expect to pay millions of gold if they want to try and get this mount. Obtaining the Swift Zulian Tiger certainly wasn't easy back when Zul'Gurub was released, as it would require not only being in a 20-man raid group that was geared enough to do Zul'Gurub, but also winning the roll on the mount if it dropped.

 <p>
  Similar to the Time-Lost Proto-Drake, this mount drops off from a rare that takes awhile to respawn. The rare is known as Soundless, and it can be found roaming around in Nazjatar. The difference, however, is that Soundless can only be looted once per day.

 <p>
  Frustratingly, the drop rate on this mount is less than two percent. So, even if players do manage to find this rare, there is no guarantee that it will even drop the mount to begin with. In short, getting this mount will require no small amount of patience and time.

 <p>
  With one rare exception, every single "Glory of" achievement in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  awards players with a mount. Before
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  , there was only "Glory of" meta achievements for dungeons and raids. Since Delves were intended to be a new pillar of endgame content, Blizzard added a meta-achievement for them as well. If players manage to complete all the achievements listed under "Glory of the Delver", they will earn the Ivory Goliathus mount.

 <p>
  This means that players will need to complete every version of all Khaz Algar Delves, find all the Sturdy Chests, and complete all the special achievements like "Just Keep Swimming" and "Spider Senses". Not only that, but players will also need to beat Zek'vir on at least 'Tier ?' difficulty. With all of these steps required to get this mount, it is no wonder that so few players have managed to get this mount.

  Achievements were a big feature added in
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  . While most achievements rewarded players with points, there were some that rewarded cosmetics, titles, and mounts. One such example was the Black Proto Drake, which was earned by completing the meta achievement Glory of the Raider (25 Player). This required players to complete various achievements in Naxxramas, Obsidian Sanctum, and Eye of Eternity.

 <p>
  When Patch 3.1 was released, both the Black Proto Drake and the Plagued Proto Drake were removed from the game. The intent behind this was to make sure these mounts stayed rare and prestigious, which they certainly did. The Black Proto Drake and Plagued Proto Drake were only obtainable for 153 days, which is the amount of time between the release of
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  and Patch 3.1. Despite how much more accessible Wrath of the Lich King raids were at the start, only a handful of players ever managed to get this mount before it was removed. Unlike the Plagued Proto Drake, the Black Proto Drake cannot be obtained through the Black Market Auction House.

  With every Blizzcon, there has been some sort of in-game bonus for players who attended the convention. For Blizzcon 2008, attendees received a code for this mount. Those who purchased the Direct TV coverage of the event also got this mount. Not only is it a cool looking mount, but it also has an adorable murloc tadpole who joins players on their travels.

 <p>
  While this mount wasn't exactly hard to get, it was limited only to US-based Direct TV customers or those who could afford to travel to Anaheim, California where Blizzcon 2008 was held. For this reason, only a small percentage of the 11.5 million subscribers that
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  had at the time were able to get this mount. While unused codes for this mount can be found, they typically sell for $200 or more.

  At one point, every single mount obtained through the old WoW TCG could be considered rare. Through the Trading Post and promotional programs like Amazon Prime Gaming, several of these mounts are no longer as rare as they once were. Some TCG mounts remain exclusive to this day, and the Magic Rooster is one of them.

 <p>
  The Magic Rooster could be redeemed from a code that was on a card called "El Pollo Grande". Once the code was redeemed, players could take the mount and sell it on the Auction House if they wanted to as it wasn't Bind on Pickup. Nowadays, it is rare to see the Magic Rooster show up at the Auction House. Source aside, this is the only chicken mount in the entire game. While there was a promotional event in Taiwan that allowed players to get this mount, that offer never reached the EU or US versions of
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  .

  There is no shortage of rewards that players can obtain by dedicating themselves to PvP. But for those who want to spend a lot of time playing PvP, then the Prestigious Bloodforged Courser is for them. Of all the Courser mounts obtained through PvP, this is easily the rarest and most time-consuming mount to obtain.

 <p>
  It takes a lot of honor to reach Level 500. In order to level up Honor, players must earn 8,800 honor from various PvP activities like Arena and Battlegrounds. So, if a player started from scratch and went all the way to Level 500, they would need to earn 4,400,000 honor to acquire this mount. With just casually playing PvP, it would take several years for players to get this mount. Even for a hardcore PvP player, getting this mount is no simple task.

 <p>
  When Temple of Ahn'Qiraj and Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj were added to World of Warcraft in Patch 1.9, Blizzard did something truly unique. These raids were not available from the get go, and players had to complete a server-wide event to open the gate that barred entry. Both Alliance and Horde had to gather massive amounts of resources as part of the war effort.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  But that was just one part of this event. In order to open the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj, one player needed to complete an insanely long questline to rebuild the Scepter of the Shifting Sands. This was not an easy questline, as it required the support and backing of a guild capable of clearing Blackwing Lair and beating numerous world bosses that spawned as part of the questline.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":21,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":21,"nbrPlacementsScanned":21,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1030} -->

 <p>
  With the Scepter of the Shifting Sands in that players inventory, a new quest would appear at the Scarab Gong in Ahn'Qiraj. The reward for this quest was the Scarab Lord title and the Black Qiraji Battle Tank, the first legendary mount ever put into the game. Once this quest was completed, it was only available for 10 hours. During this time, anybody who had managed to get the Scepter of the Shifting Sands could get the Black Qiraji Battle Tank. Once the 10-hour event had concluded, this mount became unobtainable.

 <p>
  Considering the amount of effort it took for even one player to get the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, not many players got this mount back during pre-expansion
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  . While there were some bugs and server transferring shenanigans that allowed players to get this mount in
  <em>
   The Burning Crusade
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  , the Black Qiraji Battle Tank is not a mount that is seen often.

  If there is one mount that is almost never seen, it would be the original epic mounts that launched with
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  . Using Black Nightsaber as an example, these faster mounts could only be purchased once you had reached level 60. Not only that, but these mounts also cost 1,000 gold. This may not seem like pocket change in modern
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  , but back then almost nobody was that wealthy, and it would take a very long time to get that much money.

 <p>
  Ultimately, Blizzard removed and replaced these mounts with armored mounts in Patch 1.4, which was released on April 19, 2005.
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  was released on November 23, 2004. Essentially, players had a little under six months to get a character to level 60 and save up 1,000 gold to purchase this mount. Very few players ever got one of the original epic mounts, and they are easily the rarest mounts in the entire game for that reason alone.

   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  is a beautifully designed game on the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  platform where you can express yourself and even compete with other players to see who is more creative and inventive. The main goal is to create a unique, garish, and impressive look for a fashion model to win the competition.

  There are plenty of clothes and accessories that you can choose from to create an image, and you can even choose hair and makeup for the model separately. By redeeming
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  codes, you will receive unique clothes and accessories that you can put on the model and make her stand out from the crowd.

  Although the game has quite a lot of clothes and accessories that you can use for your model outfit, sometimes something is missing, and having a few exclusive items will be a great advantage. Fortunately, the game developers generously reward fans with such bonuses, and you can also get them by redeeming
  <em>
   Dress to Impress
  </em>
  codes. New codes appear occasionally, but their validity is limited, so be sure to redeem them as soon as possible.

  Fortunately, redeeming

  codes is not difficult and will take you a few seconds. There's no tutorial that will limit your access to redeeming codes, so you can do it as soon as you enter the game. If you have never redeemed a

  code before, here's how to do it:

   Launch
   <em>

   .
  </li>
  <li>
   When you're in the lobby, look to the left side of the screen, you will see several interactive buttons.
  </li>
  <li>
   Among them, find and click on the lowest one, an icon with three asterisks.
  </li>
  <li>
   This will open the menu for redeeming codes, where you will see an input field and a button with a checkmark icon.
  </li>
  <li>
   Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the active codes into the input field. All letters must be capitalized; otherwise, the system will consider the code invalid.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you have entered the code in the input field, click on the button with the checkmark icon to submit the reward request.
  </li>
  <li>
   If everything is successful, a notification about the item or accessory you received, and its icon will appear in the middle of the screen.

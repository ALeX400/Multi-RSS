  As with every DLC release for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Episode Heresy has brought a whole host of new weapons and reprised several fan favorites from years past. Episode Heresy also introduced the Sundered Doctrine dungeon, allowing Guardians to once again dive into Rhulk's pyramid ship in Savathun's throne world. The dungeon itself contains several unique mechanics, focusing on the newest enemy race, the Grim, and has Guardians looking through the lore to decode the truths and lies within.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the dungeon's release, Guardians got access to 5 new weapons, 4 legendary and 1 new exotic, with aesthetics inspired by the darkness, and a powerful new origin trait to match. This list looks at all of them and ranks them in order of how powerful they are in every facet of the game, with a focus on PvE content.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Best PvE Roll: Fourth Times The Charm and Bait and Switch or Elemental Honing
  </li>
  <li>
   Best PvP Roll: Lone Wolf and Closing Time
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Unvoiced is the latest addition to the Pinpoint Slug Frame shotgun family, firing a singular slug instead of the standard spray of pellets, making it a powerful single-target damage dealer, as well as giving it the ability to one-shot from ridiculous ranges in PvP. The origin trait present on all the legendary Sundered Doctrine weapons is Subjugation, which has varying effects depending on which enemies are being hit. On weaker, red-bar enemies, the weapon gains explosive rounds, against stronger, yellow, and orange-bar enemies the weapon exhausts them, reducing their outgoing damage, and finally, against other Guardians, these weapons have reduced incoming flinch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ideal roll for this weapon depends on where it is going to be used. In PvP, the best roll is Lone Wolf and Closing Time, both perks that increase the weapon's ease of use and range potential, making for a snappy one-shot-kill. In PvE, this weapon thrives as a single-target damage-dealing option, with Fourth Times The Charm refunding ammo on subsequent precision hits, and Bait and Switch or Elemental Honing both providing a potent damage bonus.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Best Roll: Rewind Rounds or Shoot To Loot and Detonator Beam or Elemental Honing
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Unsworn is one of two legendary Strand trace rifles, the other requiring a player to engage with Trials of Osiris which many players tend to avoid. As such, this weapon is a must-get for many players simply due to its unique position within the game's sandbox, even if it isn't the strongest weapon on this list. With the origin trait, this trace rifle is the only one capable of firing exploding rounds, making it a fun and unique experience, tearing through lower-tier enemies and dealing potent sustained damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best perk combinations for this trace rifle are Rewind Rounds or Shoot To Loot, both of which are great for refunding ammo, the main difference is the former requires sustained single target damage, whereas the other requires ammo drops from enemy deaths. Combining either of these with Detonator Beam for increased ad-clear, or Elemental Honing for a consistent and powerful damage boost can make this gun a force to be reckoned with in any PvE content.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Exotic Catalyst: Bait and Switch
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  With each new dungeon and raid, Guardians get a new exotic weapon to chase, and Sundered Doctrine is no exception. Finality's Auger is a power ammo linear fusion rifle with an interesting twist. Holding reload switches to a mode that consumes three ammo and fires out a turret that repeatedly fires shots at the nearest enemy. The user can then use the alternate fire mode to designate a specific target for the turret, focusing fire on the marked target and supercharging the turret for a short duration.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Finality's Auger can be used as a standard linear fusion, the way to maximize the damage output of the gun is to create a turret, mark a target, then switch back to the standard fire mode and focus on the same target. With the catalyst giving the weapon Bait and Switch, increasing its damage output by 30%, as well as the turret being able to activate Particle Reconstruction, this weapon has some powerful damage potential when incorporated into the right damage rotation.

   Best PvE Roll: Dragonfly or Hatchling and Elemental Honing or Tear
  </li>
  <li>
   Best PvP Roll: Rapid Hit or Killing Wind and Kill Clip or Closing Time
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Unloved is the first heavy burst hand cannon to be available with the Strand damage type, and only the third heavy burst hand cannon available in the kinetic weapon slot. This alone makes it a must-get for any Guardians who main the Hunter class and want a new weapon to include in a Lucky Pants build. Thanks to the weapon's damage type, it can roll with Hatchling and Tear, which allows it to fit into any Strand build, working with the subclass keywords. For a more standard, general-use roll, Dragonfly and Elemental Honing will provide good ad-clear capability and a powerful damage bonus.
 </p>
 <p>
  For PvP, this weapon can be a powerhouse thanks to the origin trait increasing its flinch resistance, and the ability to roll with Rapid Hit or Killing Wind, and Kill Clip or Closing Time makes it a versatile option for anyone comfortable with the kick that the heavy burst hand cannons have between shots.

   Best PvE Roll: Firefly or Ambitious Assassin and Voltshot or Rolling Storm
  </li>
  <li>
   Best PvP Roll: Rapid Hit or Keep Away and Zen Moment or Precision Instrument
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The final weapon on this list is Unworthy, a rapid-fire frame, Arc damage scout rifle. As a rapid-fire scout, Unworthy is a part of a relatively exclusive club which allows it to have a surprisingly high DPS output before even considering perk options. The origin trait adds to this, giving the weapon free explosive rounds when dealing with lower-tier enemies, simply increasing the damage potential for free. In terms of PvE rolls, Firefly and Voltshot are a potent combination that can easily clear a room thanks to the explosions upon precision kill and the jolt procs doing further area-of-effect damage. The roll of Ambitious Assassin and Rolling Storm is also a potent option for any Arc builds that focus heavily on Bolt Charge.
 </p>
 <p>
  For PvP, this weapon has access to Rapid Hit or Keep Away, both of which increase its neutral game usability, combined with Zen Moment for an impressively stable firing experience, or Precision Instrument for a stacking damage bonus that can lower the time to kill on subsequent enemies. Overall Unworthy is the most powerful weapon from Sundered Doctrine, largely due to its ability to stun champions with Voltshot, as well as easily clear a room, and deal consistent damage to higher health targets.

  When RPG fans think about tactical RPGs,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  tends to come up. It's one of the best in the genre and certainly one of the best
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  spinoffs to come out of the long-running franchise. It used grid-based gameplay for players to move characters around, similar to a chessboard.
 </p>
 <p>
  While great, there have been innovations in the field to give players more room to run around. These tactical RPGs don't use grids. Whether one style is better than the other is up for debate, but for now, let's look at why these games are great and rank them based on their overall quality and how they do away with the classic grid.

  <em>
   Dragon Ball Fusions
  </em>
  came out perhaps too late in 2016 when the 3DS was on standby as Nintendo fans hotly awaited the Switch in 2017. It’s not easy to find now, but players who do track down a copy will be rewarded with an original adventure that doesn’t rehash the same
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  arcs ad nauseam. Players can create their own characters and then interact with familiar faces through tactical battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players are free to fly around maps before engaging enemies with slick combos, made better when teammates are around. As the title suggests, fusing with others plays a large role in the gameplay and story. Some of these fused characters are a bit hard to unsee, but that’s what makes the game weird and special as a
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  adaptation.

  While there hasn’t been a new
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Tactics
  </em>
  game in quite some time, 2008 for North America to be exact, Square Enix has been putting out plenty of spiritual successors. For the grid-based fans out there,
  <em>
   Triangle Strategy
  </em>
  is a game that deserves more love. While not as immediately addicting,
  <em>
   The Diofield Chronicle
  </em>
  deserves some recognition, too, for trying to do something different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set in a fantastical medieval setting, players will go through a linear progression of missions, each harder than the last. Party offerings are small, and players can move units around in
  <em>
   The Diofield Chronicle
  </em>
  like an RTS before engaging the enemy. It’s a blending of genres that is better implemented with a later game selection, but again, the game should be checked out.

  <em>
   Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope
  </em>
  is the second game that paired Mario with Ubisoft’s rabbit-like Rabbids. The pair seemed odd at first, but it worked well enough to get a sequel, which is easily the better game with a vast amount of improvements. Players can take a small roster of characters into battle, each equipped with a certain weapon type.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mario sports two pistols, for example, and characters have more range on a mission between no more grids and traversal combos. Players can explore a small world in between missions and upgrade characters through various means. It’s a good time overall, even if it perhaps doesn’t reach the same heights as the more transitional turn-based
  <em>
   Mario RPG
  </em>
  games.

  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord
  </em>
  is the latest game from Vanillaware, and like all other games before it, this one is completely original. Players will move squads around the map instead of controlling individual characters. On missions, players will dictate where these squads should go, whether that’s to capture a base, talk to an NPC, or fight an enemy squad.
 </p>
 <p>
  If squads do run into enemies, the battles will play out automatically. Between the free movement system and the automatic battles,
  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord
  </em>
  has a lot of RTS elements. The one thing keeping it from a pure RTS, though, is the leveling-up system. Players can explore a semi-open-world environment to take on side quests and visit towns apart from continuing the main campaign, which gives them more to do compared to the typical tactical setup.

  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  took a good PC franchise and turned it into an overnight sensation for both PC and console platforms. It won award after award when it was released in 2023, and players are still enjoying it now. The character choices are one reason why players keep coming back for more, as they can see branching storylines.
 </p>
 <p>
  The combat choices are equally as attractive. When enemies are encountered, players can take their party and move around the map freely to attack with weapons or magic out in the open or from behind the shadows. With a deep skill tree, a solid list of party members, and side quests galore, this is easily one of the longest tactical RPGs around. It’s good to see that the West still has what it takes to rival the high standards of Japan’s many tactical RPG offerings.

  <em>
   Valkyria Chronicles
  </em>
  is a prime example of a non-grid-based tactical RPG. The series premiered in 2008 and includes four main games and one action-based spinoff. The main games all have the same gameplay style wherein players select units before a mission and then move them around freely on the battlefield on their turn. The only thing holding them back is a meter, and characters can't move once it depletes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Enemies can fire freely during this period, but once characters stop to manually aim their weapons, time freezes. The first game is as good a place as any to start, as it's a more fantastical alternate history take inspired by World War 2. It's a shame Sega hasn't revisited this franchise since the fourth entry in 2018, but those who have missed the series so far should hop aboard the
  <em>
   Valkyria Chronicles
  </em>
  train.

 <p>
  Firstly, dedicate a good portion of your time and Peg-E tokens to playing Sticker Drop in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  . You can get more Peg-E tokens in a number of ways, but the best one is by hitting milestones in the top and side events. You can use the early morning High Roller to boost your progress in these events by collecting more points with each roll. Don't forget to claim your free gifts and complete your Quick Wins daily for extra Peg-E tokens and dice rolls.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have a lot of cash on hand, use the Landmark Rush to upgrade as many landmarks as possible. This will bring you closer to the Bank of Monopoly, where you can win a bunch of rewards. When you’re done, replenish your cash reserves with the Cash Grab and Mega Heist flash events. Lastly, don’t forget to try your luck in the Lucky Chance for some extra rewards.

   <em>
    Tiny Pasture
   </em>
  </strong>
  puts a miniature farm right on your desktop where you can place new animals, watch them grow up, and collect coins from them from time to time. It's a cozy little idle game that doesn't take up a lot of your resources. So you can have it running in the background all the time, checking in occasionally to see how your little friends are doing.

  While the game starts with just a Rabbit, unlocking the rest of the 15 unique animals requires meeting specific conditions. Some may take time, while others require a bit of strategic planning. If you want to fill your pasture with Corgis, Red Pandas, Capybaras, and even Ghosties, this guide will walk you through how to unlock every Animal in

  Once you unlock an animal, you can buy it from the shop accessed in the right section of the main interface. After buying a new Animal, it will show up on your pasture at 50% fullness. Fullness refers to hunger and, at 50%, the Animal will be hungry and won't give you any coins or grow up unless you feed it.

  After feeding the animal, you'll see that its Time until Adulthood bar starts to go up. Once it fills completely, the Time until Adulthood bar is replaced with Stored Earnings, representing the total number of Coins it can store for you when you're away.

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  games aren't shy about showing a character being killed, usually in the most gruesome way imaginable, but a character's death doesn't always need to be this clear. In fact, several characters have simply disappeared after their games, leaving fans to wonder whether or not they have a chance of showing up in future installments, depending on whether they've been zombified or have continued to survive against all the odds.
 </p>
 <p>
  When a character's fate is left uncertain, it inevitably leads to a plethora of interesting theories and predictions among the fanbase. Therefore, it can be fun to ponder what exactly these individuals would be up to these days, especially since the majority of them were last seen many years ago in the timeline. Dead or alive, a few of these characters left a pretty big impact on the wider story of
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  , so it's time to take a closer look at who they were, why they disappeared, and whether it seems likely they could still be alive and kicking.

  <em>
   Resident Evil 0
  </em>
  is a prequel that takes place right before the events of the first game. As a result, players already know that Rebecca will survive and partake in the Spencer Mansion Incident, but as for Billy, nobody knows where he ends up after the game ends. While Rebecca seems to make her way towards the mansion, Billy simply wanders into Raccoon Forest, which is crawling with zombified dogs.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the S.T.A.R.S unit lands at the beginning of the first game, they barely manage to escape being brutally picked off by the Cerberus one by one, which has led many people to believe this is where Billy would have met his untimely death. However, this has never actually been confirmed by Capcom, and considering Billy's expertise with firearms, there's still a chance he could have made it out.

  In
  <em>
   Resident Evil 7
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Village
  </em>
  , Capcom hinted that the BSAA counter-terrorism organization, which Chris and Sheva were a part of in the fifth game, isn't quite as squeaky clean as many assumed it to be. While fans already got to see Chris' frustrations with the BSAA in the story of
  <em>
   Village
  </em>
  , Sheva hasn't been seen since
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  , begging the question of what exactly happened to her.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Sheva could still be a BSAA member who has accepted their sudden change in attitude, there's also the possibility she was kicked out for standing against the use of bioweapons. Hopefully, she shows up in future games, as a scene between her and Chris would be a nice callback to their adventure in Kijuju, but right now, it's not even known whether she's still alive.

  Jake Muller is a character who has only appeared in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  , despite being such an important figure in the wider lore of the series due to being Albert Wesker's son. After narrowly escaping death by evading the relentless pursuer known as the Ustanak, Jake and Sherry part ways, but if players stick around after the credits, a scene will play showing Jake fighting off hordes of B.O.Ws in a random village.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a scene that has left fans baffled ever since it first became known. On the one hand, it could imply that Jake is simply continuing his life as a mercenary, but considering the massive target that's on his back due to his lineage, there is still every chance he was captured or potentially even killed. Whether Jake will show up again in the future, only time will tell, but for now, it's not clear where this guy is and what he's up to.

  Simply put, Jill couldn't have made it out of Raccoon City without Carlos' help. As the one who barely ventured through the Raccoon City Hospital to find her a cure, Jill owes a lot to Carlos, so it's a real shame that, since the third game, he has never shown up to chat with Jill in a more casual setting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering Carlos technically disobeyed Umbrella's orders by escaping the city on his own and knowing how ruthless the company is behind the scenes, there is the possibility that they decided to 'deal' with Carlos after he returned. Then again, he may still be alive out there somewhere, though if he is, he's certainly not an easy guy to find.

  Though Natalia comes across as an innocent young girl on the surface, the truth is that she's actually a superhuman who is infected with the T-Phobos virus. This grants her quite a few unique abilities that will presumably only become stronger the older she gets, and though she does manage to escape with Barry and Moira at the end of
  <em>
   Revelations 2
  </em>
  , there's not been any sign of her since then, forcing fans to ponder how safe she truly is.
 </p>
 <p>
  As seen with the likes of Steve and Jake, any time someone is infected or possesses unique genetics, they are always being hunted down by Wesker, Umbrella, or entirely new factions altogether. At the same time, Alex Wesker's influence may have also taken her over. Therefore, it's uncertain whether Natalia has managed to survive in isolation or not after the events of her respective game.

  Despite being a well-known character from the series for over 20 years, barely anything about the Merchant is known. Sure, he's a hooded man who carries around an absurd amount of weaponry and is more than willing to assist Leon on his mission, but the rest of his identity has been left up for debate. Many fans believe he's actually Luis' grandfather, who was known for creating a tunnel system around the village, which would explain how he gets around so fast.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless of his true identity, though, the more pressing question is if this businessman is even still alive. The very end of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  saw the island being blown apart, and since the Merchant shows up there numerous times, who knows if he managed to escape in time or not, though hopefully, he did, as it would be a real treat to see him return one day.

  spin-off game. In the sequel, there is a very brief mention that the FBC, Lansdale's former organization, is still defunct and that Lansdale remains behind bars, but this was back in 2012.

 <p>
  Bioterror has only become more of an issue since then, as seen through the C-Virus outbreak in
  <em>
   6
  </em>
  and the Baker Family in
  <em>
   7
  </em>
  . As a result, whether Lansdale has managed to escape captivity to jump back on the trend, fans may never know, but one thing is for sure: if he were ever to get out, the world would be a much more dangerous place as a result.

  Despite showing up as a bonus character for many of the games, primarily in the Mercenaries Mode, HUNK hasn't actually been seen canonically since the Raccoon City outbreak back in 1998. There is at least a brief mention of him in
  <em>
   Umbrella Corps
  </em>
  , which is based in 2012, where it's suggested that he's left Umbrella and potentially gone rogue.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's literally all fans have been given to go off, though, as this mysterious agent has been living in the shadows ever since he intercepted Birkin and managed to barely escape Raccoon City in one piece. Considering he's known as the 'Grim Reaper' for his habit of embarking on suicide missions and always managing to survive, it's left unclear whether HUNK may have finally bit off more than he can chew on a mission or if he's still out there somewhere.

  On social media, Blizzard said the pre-expansion content update for
  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft: The War Within
   </strong>
  </em>
  will go live on Tuesday, July 23.
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  players can participate in an event called "Radiant Echoes" starting a week later, on July 30, and last until the expansion's official launch on August 26.

 <p>
  As the tenth expansion to Blizzard's long-running MMORPG,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft: The War Within
  </em>
  will be the first chapter of a trilogy called The Worldsoul Saga. The expansion will introduce new features, including the account-focused Warband system and Hero Talents for each class. The War Within will also introduce the game's 25th playable race, the Earthen. Blizzard allowed
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  players to sign up for
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  's closed beta test and give feedback. During testing, players uncovered via datamining that the pre-expansion patch could go live in late July. Suffice it to say, the dates were correct.

 <p>
  While the expansion will not be released until August, Blizzard will give players a taste of what to expect in just a few days. On Tuesday, July 23,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  's Patch 11.0 update will go live following server maintenance. While details about the maintenance were unknown at the time of writing, the update will bring class balance changes and new user interface elements for players to familiarize themselves with. The new Warband feature, one of the main facets of
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  , will go live on July 23. The system will give characters a new account-wide bank that can be used to transfer items and gold seamlessly and allow for shared reputation point gains to make gearing up much faster. To avoid potential issues with Warbands, the character restoration service will be temporarily suspended starting on July 23.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon TCG
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has been released, revealing that Eevee and its Eeveelutions will receive a new set. While Eeveelutions aren't exactly the strongest
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  cards, they do get a lot of love from fans. If confirmed, the release will give Eevelutions the spotlight in
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  a few years after the last time this happened.

 <p>
  It was in May 2021 that
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  released the Eevee Heroes subset with 101 cards that focused primarily on Eevee and the eight known evolutions up to Gen 7. In July of the same year, Evolving Skies, the ninth expansion of the
  <em>
   Pokemon Sword and Shield
  </em>
  era, hit the shelves. Evolving Skies introduced all the Eeveelutions as Pokemon V, a type of card with higher HP and more powerful attacks than its regular version. Several Eeveelution cards got VMAX and Special Full Art cards, including the highly sought-after Umbreon VMAX Secret Rare Alternate Art. Now, a new
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  leak brings exciting information for fans of Eevee and its evolutions.

 <p>
  According to a leak shared by PokeBeach, a new
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  set featuring Eevee and Eeveelutions will be released on December 6 in Japan. Named "Terastal Festival," the
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  set will feature Eevee and its evolutions as Tera Pokemon. The leak doesn't say when the Terastal Festival set will arrive in the West, but teases that the Pokemon will be "ex" cards, a new variant introduced in the
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  series. PokeBeach also reveals that alongside the new Terastal Festival set,
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG
  </em>
  will release other products. There will be card sleeves Eevee, a collection file Eevee, a rubber playmat Eevee, a card box Eevee collection, a damage counter case called "Eevee All-Stars," a carrying case Eevee collection, and a plush deck case Eevee.

  , which has yet to present the Tera versions of the Eeveelutions.
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet

  introduced Tera Pokemon, a type of critter affected by the Terastal phenomenon. This phenomenon affects Pokemon temporarily, giving them a gem-like appearance and changing their type. Tera Pokemon has been receiving recurring focus in Gen 9 with the release of new Tera Raids for

   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet

  players to capture these variants.

  Messmer The Impaler is the titular boss of the DLC, appearing in just about all the promo material for the DLC. The Shadow Keep is the biggest structure in the DLC, and Messmer being at the top seems fitting for what could be the final boss of the DLC, but there's actually still much more for players to do before reaching the true final boss.

  After beating Messmer, players will have the required item to burn the sealing tree, which continues the main path of
  <em>

  . To reach the Sealing Tree, players will need to go back to the first level of the Specimen Storehouse and instead

  In the westernmost section of this region of the map will be Romina, Saint Of The Bud. After defeating this boss, players can
  <strong>
   burn the sealing tree and unlock the final dungeon in the DLC
  </strong>
  . While this direct path is an option, there are a lot of optional areas and bosses players can go to instead to find more Scadutree Fragments and bosses.

  There are a few major hidden bosses throughout
  <em>
   Shadow Of The Erdtree
  </em>
  that players may want to take care of before heading to the final Legacy Dungeon. The first and easiest to reach from Messmer would be traveling to the Abyssal Woods to find Midra, Lord Of The Frenzied Flame. Bayle The Dread is another major boss players can face by heading to the

   Jagged Peak
  </strong>
  <strong>
   in the southeastern section of the map

  By heading to the back gate of the Shadow Keep, players will not only face Commander Gaius but also get access to Finger Ruins of Dheo. By also traveling to the Finger Ruins of Rhia in the southern section of the map and ringing the bells at both ruins, players will unlock the

 <p>
  GAME is no longer accepting in-person pre-orders. Although pre-orders have been happening since the 80s, pre-ordering games became especially popular throughout the early 2000s, as they have consistently provided retailers with an estimate for the actual sales they're going to make. Many gamers have started to debate the value of pre-ordering video games at all, though, as some want to see reviews first.

 <p>
  The nature of pre-ordering itself has changed as well. In some ways, stores have found even more value to give to gamers, especially those who care more about what they get in-game for releases like
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  Alternatively, there are some gamers out there who are nostalgic for the way store-exclusive physical items used to be handed out for games, like posters and figurines to celebrate a launch.

 <p>
  As TechRadar reports, GAME, a major video game retailer in the UK, will no longer be accepting in-store pre-orders for games. This change appears to be informed by overall changes to the structure of the company as it is absorbed by Frasers Group. Once August 1 arrives, GAME will no longer accept deposits for pre-orders in stores. The retailers will still accept pre-orders online, though.

 <p>
  In part, the literal function of the checkout counters shapes the activity that takes place there. Frasers Group has implemented new Enactor counters that facilitate self-checkout processes. Part of the reason this news is important is that it could also change the way stores in the US like GameStop work. Many who still do their grocery shopping in-person now complete it at self-checkout counters, and the same could eventually be true for games.

 <p>
  Part of this appears to fall in line with the way that gaming itself is shifting towards an all-digital future. In addition to publishers like Sony and Xbox having their own marketplaces in order to collect more profits from sales, these gaming giants have also been releasing versions of their consoles that lack disc-drives. PlayStation may drop disc drives entirely in the future, as analysts predict. On the surface, it may appear more convenient, especially to gamers who are always connected to the internet. However, this has also given these publishers more control over the prices of their games, and how long consumers have to wait until they see price drops. It will be interesting to see the ways these stores change the more that the tech to distribute and play games does.

      In stealth games, unclear mechanics can ruin gameplay, like sudden forced action segments or overly detailed intel, killing immersion.
     </li>
     <li>
      Tailing missions can be tedious, linear, and make a player feel out of control, as seen in the Assassin's Creed series.
     </li>
     <li>
      Stealth games can mislead players with off-screen detections and overreacting AI, making it frustrating to progress undetected.

 <p>
  There is a fine line between fun and frustration in video games, stealth games in particular. While the creaky floors that give away the player's position or the sudden 180 of an idle guard may cause great annoyance, they add to the challenge and make the experience tense, exciting, and memorable. The truly annoying features are those that give the impression of being undercooked or downright cheated. While their mechanics are almost ubiquitous in most open-world games or RPG titles, the stealth genre's prime seems to have passed, at least when it comes to AAA output.

 <p>
  But trends in video games come and go and often come back again, and in the indie space, stealth is alive and well. For infiltration-enthusiastic indie groups, some future AAA studio working on the next thrilling stealth series, or just fans of the genre, there is much to be learned about the mistakes of stealth games (besides learning not to throw a controller at the fish tank after being discovered, even while prone in tall grass, after the 8th attempt). Beware of sneaky, backstabbing spoilers ahead.

 <p>
  Besides being hard to make, pure stealth games tend to be hard to market. Trailers need to be bombastic and action-packed, but a good stealth game (besides any gory shadow takedowns, if the game happens to have any), works best when building slow-rising tension. To resolve this (and perhaps make players appreciate the main focus of the game once the encounter is done), some studios will throw in sections that throw out the player's careful planning and patience with a section that cannot be overcome with stealth.

  This was famously done in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deus Ex: Human Revolution
   </em>
  </strong>
  , especially the game's original cut, where each boss stood as a non-negotiable fight.
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction
  </em>
  also suffered from genre mixing the highly-refined stealth mechanics with forced action mechanics. Consider this feature the stealth-game equivalent of the forced stealth sections in open-world games. Even Metal Gear Solid falls prey to this but makes up for it during its forced action sections by (mostly) keeping them short, and additionally, many of the series' bosses can be defeated using sneaking.

  Escort segments in any game are notoriously hated, but in a game that emphasizes the fragility of the protagonist, for whom their only salvation is their nimble movements, there is nothing worse than having to drag around someone even more vulnerable while having absolutely no control over them whatsoever. One of the most infamous and high-profile examples is, of course, the Emma Emmerich rescue part in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

  Not only is Raiden tasked with rescuing a woman with aquaphobia (on an artificial island), but he also has to put up with her squeamishness about bugs and is then tasked with leading her through flooded hallways. The only redeeming part is that the section is short, unlike the jungle escape in
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
  </em>
  , in which Snake has to drag an injured Eva to safety while enemy forces close in. The only way to handle a stealth escort is by making it so that the escort in question is, to enemy AI, invisible, has stellar AI, or is likable, for example, Ellie in
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  .

  In stealth games, one wrong move or misjudgment can mean having a complete restart. For this reason, it is essential to give players enough information to make sound decisions. This includes their alertness level, player awareness, and next probable actions. Real-world infiltrators have far more acute senses than a camera with hands, and sometimes, the player isn't even working from a first-person view. The forced perspective of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  , in which enemies can hide out of the player's sight, even if Snake himself is looking at them dead on. This prompted Hideo Kojima to implement one of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid's
  </em>
  most useful gadgets, the Soliton Radar, a minimap of the area that shows the guards' position and even vision.

 <p>
  The original
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  used the same overhead camera, but as many fans found stealth much too difficult without the radar, Kojima implemented a dynamic camera system. Two decades later, if anything, stealth games can potentially overload players with intel. From being able to see through walls (
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  ) and having a dynamic tracker of enemy movement (
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Origins
  </em>
  ) to letting map markers, minimaps, and a "Focus Mode" UI do all the work (
  <strong>
   <em>
    Thief 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  ), players are never left in the dark about what to do, which not only kills immersion but erases but the thrill of the unknown and makes the mission a chore.

 <p>
  On its face, tailing missions, which were frequent features of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  in its pirate ship era, peaking with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Flag
   </em>
  </strong>
  , seem to suit stealth games perfectly. They offer a chance to deliver exposition, organically bring the player from one location to the next, and test the player's skill as they scramble to find cover from one street, corridor, or rooftop to the next. The problem with tailing missions is that they are essentially reverse escort missions, and they tend to be linear. A good stealth experience allows players to get a feel of their environment. They need to feel as though their pathfinding through patrol routes or dusty vents was their own achievement.

 <p>
  A one-off tailing isn't so bad, but regularly forcing players out of their spatial problem-solving flow and into a long, linear, performative watch-and-wait sequence can quickly burn out their enthusiasm, making them some of the most disliked missions in Assassin's Creed. Additionally, falling too far behind or getting too close results in an instant game over, and the inability to turn things around can become grating. If the target moves too slowly, it can feel punishingly dull. But if they move too fast, or there are multiple guards to avoid or pitfalls to leap, any exposition will go right over the player's head. The dialogue used to deliver the exposition becomes an annoyance after several retries as the player is forced to listen to the same conversations again and again.

 <p>
  In real-world games of hide and seek, deadly or not, it's possible to get spotted by somebody out of sight. This may seem obvious, but to many stealth fans, one of the most infuriating experiences is being seen by an off-screen sentry. For whatever reason, be it a quirk of human psychology or an expectation of fairness when playing a game with rules, virtual or otherwise, it just isn't something most players can accept and can lead to the feeling that the enemy force is using cheat codes to get ahead and win.

  Even if the player has total control over the direction of the camera, a legitimately placed enemy is going to appear at the player's back at some point.

  , being an open-world game, levels the playing field by giving Snake a "sixth sense tingle," which appears on the player's screen as a fuzzy thumbprint in the direction of the scout or sniper and is usually followed up with intel from Mother Base about the sharp-sighted enemies ahead.

  Going up against an overwhelming force with nothing but a lockpick, a combat knife, and sneaking britches is one thing, but getting discovered and then immediately rushed by every trooper on the base, who is now suddenly aware of the intruder's location, is quite another. Pure stealth games have generally been good about handling this aspect of detection by giving players a couple of seconds to react before the guard calls for help, either verbally or via radio.

 <p>
  However, games that make stealth a part of their regular gameplay loop, such as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Far Cry
   </em>
  </strong>
  and
  <em>
   Metro: 2033
  </em>
  , or pretty much every first-person roleplaying game, are all examples of games with hive-minded guards that are seemingly telepathically linked. It isn't a bad idea to remind players that trying to muscle their way through won't work, but giving sentries an "in shock" phase where it takes them a few seconds to fumble to a walkie-talkie before the whole base descends is just good gaming courtesy.

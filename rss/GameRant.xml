  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  will have a 60 FPS mode, according to a new rumor. A lot of gamers are looking forward to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , expecting a meaningful iteration on the existing structure the games have put forward. Although people are excited about this title, the quality of the experience can be heavily affected by how well-optimized the game turns out to be. People who play on consoles have gotten used to having a choice between a mode focused on delivering a high frame rate and a mode focused on picture quality.

 <p>
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  offers a long-awaited take from the series on feudal Japan. The aesthetic of a ninja has seemed like a perfect fit for a series so focused on assassins, and now that enough time has passed, other games like
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  have beaten
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  to the punch.
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  is widely regarded not just as an enjoyable experience in this setting, and gamers also consider it to be one of the most visually impressive recent releases.
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  may have some considerable competition on more than one end, and people are excited to see how
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  performs, both in substance and in its technical stability.

 <p>
  Twitter user @_L3vi3 translated a report from @arabhardware suggesting that
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  will be offering a 60 FPS mode across all platforms. For the best-looking picture quality, players will have to play the game on the newly announced PS5 Pro. In this console generation, the frame rate has become increasingly important to a user base so accustomed to playing games with more fluidity. Having a 60 FPS option is a big advantage to gamers.

 <p>
  In addition, this report states that weather will make meaningful differences in the game's world, with enemies being able to suffer heatstroke if they've stayed in the sun too long. This implies a potential added layer of strategy surrounding the experience of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  , as players may have several new ways to outsmart enemy patrols while they make their way through the game. The existence of heatstroke as a mechanic could suggest inflicting foes with various ailments to weaken defenses.

  Gamers mention being especially excited that this 60 FPS mode is seemingly confirmed for all platforms for
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  will be available for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Windows, macOS, and iPadOS. Its presence on iPad may be surprising to gamers, but
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  is not the first
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game to come to the system. Although some platforms will have a significantly better picture quality, this 60 FPS mode offers a stronger chance that the overall experience for this game will match up better for all players.

  Brewfest has been a part of
  <strong>
   <em>
    World of Warcraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  since
  <em>
   The Burning Crusade
  </em>
  . Since its initial debut in 2007, Brewfest has undergone many changes. More noticeable changes have been made with the inclusion of allied races setting up their own stalls at Brewfest. Brewfest began on September 20th and will end on October 6th.

  Despite all the changes, some things do remain the same with this event. Brewfest is still all about consuming virtual drinks while earning Brewfest Prize Tokens to earn rewards. There haven't been many changes made to the event for
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  , but here is what you can expect as you participate in Brewfest.

  The main area where Brewfest takes place is outside both Orgrimmar and Ironforge. When you arrive at the festival, you will see an NPC who will offer you a quest for a free beer. In this area, you can find vendors selling food and drinks along with some quests that you can complete for Brewfest Prize Tokens.

 <p>
  As far as activities go, there is the usual ram racing. Riding a ram during Brewfest differs from a normal mount because you have to use Ram Racing Reins to increase the speed of the Ram. You have to be mindful of your fatigue though, as if it reaches 100, your mount moves very slowly until it can recover. Make sure to complete all the non-daily quests related to ram racing, as this unlocks a quest that rewards you with a Brewfest stein.

  Every half hour, Brewfest will be invaded by mobs that want to steal all the alcohol. In earlier versions of Brewfest, you had to drink beer and then throw mugs at the invaders. Now, you just kill them instead. If you manage to drive off the invaders, you get an item that you can turn in for 10 Brewfest Prize Tokens.

  One of the more recent additions to Brewfest is the Brewfest Chowdown. In this activity, you have to eat 10 plates worth of Bratwurst before the other three players. This mini-game involves not overfilling the stuffed bar. If the bar fills up, you get stunned for three seconds. If you win, you get a Chowdown Champion Token. Five of these tokens can be used to purchase a Brewfest Chowdown Trophy.

  Once you've completed all the ram racing related quests, you can take a ram into Ironforge or Orgrimmar and promote one of the breweries. In addition to that, there are two daily quests in Valdrakken. There are no daily quests in Khaz Algar at this time.

  Just like with Hallow's End and Midsummer Fire Festival, there is a daily boss that you can use the dungeon finder to fight. In this case, it is Coren Direbrew. He's been updated for Level 80 players, but he isn't much of a threat even for a group of fresh Level 80 players that may still be in green gear.

  <em>
   World of Warcraft

  if there weren't some kind of rewards to obtain. For the most part, rewards are entirely cosmetic (excluding the trinkets that drop from Coren Direbrew) and are purchased from a Token Redeemer at Brewfest. Every year there is a new item or two added to the event, and for 2024 the new item is Homebrewer's Sampling Mantle.

  Microsoft has announced that it will be shutting down its
  <strong>
   Xbox Ambassadors
  </strong>
  program after a full 13 years of support. The Xbox Ambassadors program was a way for gamers to connect with one another and Microsoft over various topics. Xbox had previously used the Ambassador program to allow gamers to connect with one another by hosting various gaming sessions, and allowing gamers to provide feedback on Xbox games and hardware.

 <p>
  Participants of the Xbox Ambassadors program were meant to represent the Xbox brand and foster a community of positivity among fans. Gamers were not like regular employees of the company, but they were expected to make the community welcoming. Ambassadors also had a few requirements before they could join the program, such as having at least 1500 Gamerscore and being at least 17 years old or older. Certain standout members of the community were rewarded with various physical and digital Xbox goodies, along with opportunities to be entered in various sweepstakes. This longstanding community service is being shuttered, Microsoft says.

  A new blog post from the Xbox Ambassadors team celebrated the last 13 years of its service and revealed how it managed to foster connections with other Xbox gamers. However, the Xbox Ambassadors program will be entering its final season, shutting down on October 15. All ambassadors will have until the listed date to claim any codes or rewards on Xbox before its shutdown. The entire Xbox Ambassadors program is going to be retooled as it expands its Rewards with Xbox program, with updates coming at a later date.

  Services of the Xbox Ambassadors program are being phased out right now, such as the Seasonal Ambassador Quests. The Accessibility Explorer Path will remain open for the time being, with Xbox asking those who have not yet unlocked the Accessibility Ally badge to do so now, though no XP will be rewarded.

  The post addressed why it is making this change, citing the Xbox brand's evolution and wanting to meet the needs of its global community. The post notes that players are finding value in engaging with the team in a variety of ways that make sure all Xbox gamers feel included, with various programs like Fanfest, Xbox Insider Program, and Rewards with Xbox.

  Eventually, gamers will be able to have a new, more globally-friendly way to directly share their feedback through Xbox Research, which will also give gamers the chance to receive more early access to new games and features in order to help make Xbox better. The role of Xbox Ambassador Champions will also be renamed, with the role being known as Xbox Community Champions, though having the same goal of making its players feel included and helping the team in different ways.

  The Maskless One will stumble upon many characters with many different stories in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Enotria: The Last Song
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Some are still stuck in the past, imagining themselves with their loved ones, like Laudomia and Moretta, while others are trying to run away from the present, like the High Priestess.

  You will encounter the High Priestess almost mid-way through the third chapter in
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  . The side character is located in a hidden corner blocked by two annoying enemies, and one of them inflects Dizzy. There aren’t many steps to that quest as you simply need to speak with her while wearing the correct Mask.

  Upon defeating the Coastal Horror boss in the Mines of Gratia, go to the right and jump on the wooden platforms carefully. Once you reach the other side, proceed forward while defeating the enemies, as ignoring them might make you fall into the water, since there isn't much space to fight. Next, after the Maskless One is outside the Mines of Gratia, walk across the docks to see a Reality Knot to the right called the Road to the District.

  Rest if the previous enemies drained you and then head left towards the two enemies from the Knot. One of them is what appears to be a singer that will keep attacking you with Dizzy beams coming from her mouth when she sings. After defeating the enemies, climb the wooden bridge tucked to the right corner to find the High Priestess next to a fire brazier. Speaking with her is futile as she won't answer the Maskless One. So,
  <strong>
   you must obtain the Priestess’ Mask to start a conversation
  </strong>
  .

  Although the High Priestess is in chapter three, the Mask is located in chapter two, Falesia Magna. One way to get the Priestess’ Mask in
  <em>
   Enotria: The Last Song
  </em>
  is by farming the Priestess enemies located in the Desecrated Cathedral. There will be three of the enemies there that were part of the High Priestess of Veltha boss fight.

  Psycho fights act as boss fights that will usually reward you greatly by being able to take them down, along with offering a very different enemy type to take on aside from just waves of zombies. After beating Cliff, he will drop the Empty Store Key; here's what to do with it.

  The Empty Store Key is dropped by Cliff and is the reward for beating him, along with his Machete. Defeating him also leads to the store you fought in to fill with zombies, so grab a nearby chainsaw to help cut through the waves and get to the door leading out of the store and back into the main section of the mall.

  Outside the door,
  <strong>
   take an immediate right to see the under-construction section of the mall
  </strong>
  . In the middle of the boxes will be a door that is opened with the Empty Store Key, and inside will be three survivors. Go up and talk to the survivors a few times to tell them Cliff is dead, and they will agree to follow you, unlike the Japanese Tourists who needed another item first. The three survivors are:

  Along the

   right side of the empty store will be the book, "Heal +"
  </strong>
  . While this book is held, the healing done by any food item is doubled, making this one of the better books players can get early into the game and one that should be held onto as long as possible to maximize food.

  Opening the Empty Store lets players find three survivors at once, making this one of the few times in the game you get so many survivors all at once. Your immediate goal should be
  <strong>
   taking them back to the Security Room
  </strong>
  to save them and get a large sum of PP as a reward; unless you are trying to complete an achievement of having many survivors follow you at once.

  This northern section of the mall has the gun store and grocery store, which are both ideal places to prepare for a longer trip to the other side of the mall. The Underground Tunnels are an option though you'll need a car that can fit all four people at once.

  A developer who previously worked for
  <strong>
   Retro Studios
  </strong>
  on
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 3: Corruption
  </em>
  has accused Nintendo of "micromanaging" the project. The artist, Nate Purkeypile, didn't deny that the game turned out great in the end, but he did have a fair amount of criticism to share regarding Nintendo's working relationship with the studio and its employees. The claims are all the more poignant in light of the ongoing work on the long-delayed sequel from Retro Studios,
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.
  </em>

 <p>
  It's no secret that the
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  series has had to deal with many complex changes and hiccups throughout its development. It took seven years for fans to get their first look at
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4
  </em>
  after its initial reveal, largely due to the fact that Nintendo announced that it was restarting the project entirely in 2019. New insight from Purkeypile may offer a better glimpse into why it's taken these games so long to come out.

 <p>
  The ex-Retro dev spoke about his experience on
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 3
  </em>
  in an interview with YouTube podcaster KIWI TALKZ. Purkeypile called his interactions with Nintendo "a whole other level of micromanagement," stating that employees with little to do with the game's actual development would frequently fly to the U.S. to request minor changes. These requests supposedly included adjustments as minuscule as moving a shoulder pad slightly. While it's not clear if that particular comment was hyperbole, the management style was enough to drive Purkeypile to leave the studio after his work on
  <em>
   Metroid.
  </em>
  Considering how
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4
  </em>
  is now aiming for a 2025 launch despite being announced in 2017, it would make sense if the studio had to deal with even more unexpected changes.

 <p>
  While requests for minor changes are certainly not the only factor that may have contributed to delays in the
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  series, Purkeypile did emphasize how long it would take to make the adjustments Nintendo asked for. The artist claimed it would take as long as a month to get a single room just right, as one minor tweak would require working on all the other elements that might interact with the asset in question. Purkeypile admits that the finished project looks and feels great — many fans believe that Retro's
  <em>
   Prime
  </em>
  titles are some of the best
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  games ever made — but questions if the time and effort were worth it.

 <p>
  Purkeypile called Nintendo's relationship with Retro "unhealthy," but it looks like this strained relationship wasn't enough for the two companies to part ways forever. Nintendo originally had Bandai Namco working on
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4
  </em>
  before handing the reins over to Retro after being dissatisfied with the way the project was progressing. Micromanagement or not, that shift is said to be the biggest reason why the sequel is taking so long. Whether Nintendo is still requesting many small changes is unclear, as is whether other employees feel the same. This latest criticism may cast a dark shadow over an otherwise beloved series and game company.

  <strong>
   The Game Awards 2024
  </strong>
  is now only a few days away, and Xbox insider Jez Corden is excited to see what gets revealed at the upcoming gaming showcase. On Thursday, December 12, The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley and a collection of other gaming talents will take the stage at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles to honor the best games of 2024, with plenty of awards, special guests, and looks at the future of gaming to come in the new year and beyond.

 <p>
  As players count the days until The Game Awards 2024 and vote for their favorite games to take home the honors, there is a lot of speculation about what new titles will be shown off during the livestream event. A few weeks ago, a supposed list of Game Awards 2024 announcements leaked online, claiming that Santa Monica Studios will reveal something related to
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Rise of the Ronin
  </em>
  DLC will be announced, and promising titles like
  <em>
   Dune Awakening
  </em>
  will get updates and release dates.

 <p>
  However, it should be noted that none of this is official, and viewers won’t know for sure what will be shown at The Game Awards 2024 until the cameras start rolling this Thursday. In the meantime, Windows Central executive editor, podcaster, and Xbox news insider Jez Corden expressed his own excitement for this year’s Game Awards on Twitter, saying that Geoff Keighly “cooked.” Without getting into any specific spoilers, Corden says that he isn’t expecting a lot from Xbox’s slate of first-party studios, but he thinks there will be plenty of exciting multiplatform announcements and other “fun stuff.”

  When asked about any potential Nintendo announcements at The Game Awards 2024, Jez Corden said he wasn’t sure, as he doesn’t usually track the company’s news in comparison to Microsoft’s Xbox brand. Other Twitter users have since started speculating about the particulars of the upcoming show, with some of the possibilities thrown around including a rumored re-release of Activision’s
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  games, a
  <em>
   Resident Evil 9
  </em>
  , or even another trailer for next year’s
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  .

  As it stands now, The Game Awards 2024 is looking to be a packed event, with legendary developer Hideo Kojima set to present one of the planned TGA awards alongside voice actor Laura Bailey, Remedy Entertainment creative director Sam Lake,

  </em>
  star Aaron Paul, and Statler and Waldorf of
  <em>

  <strong>
   itch.io
  </strong>
  has recently accused Funko of causing its website to go offline for several hours. itch.io is a popular indie gaming platform that currently hosts over 200,000 games, and one mistake involving Funko allegedly caused the website to become unavailable for all users, preventing them from downloading games or browsing the site's collection.

 <p>
  Launched in 2013, itch.io is one of the leading indie PC gaming platforms on the market today. itch.io hosts and sells indie games from essentially every genre, as well as other products such as game assets, comics, music, and non-gaming software. As player appreciation for smaller indie titles has continued to grow, the site is accessed by millions of gamers every month.

 <p>
  itch.io has accused Funko, the makers of the popular Funko Pop figures and the recent
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  game, of using “some trash AI-powered brand protection software” called Brand Shield to create a fake phishing report using the website’s registrar. Unfortunately, this took the website offline for several hours. According to itch.io, the company’s registrar automatically enforced a block of the website’s domain and ignored the platform’s appeal, despite developers taking down the disputed page almost immediately. At the time, the platform considered setting up a new domain, but eventually decided to wait until the problem solved itself. While itch.io remained offline for several hours, it is now completely operational at the time of writing.

  While itch.io is already online again, it’s hard to measure the damage done by the platform being unavailable for several hours, as it’s the only website used by many indie developers to sell their games. itch.io also offers many free games, and gamers were rendered unable to access these projects, even if they were the original creators.

  At the time of this report, Funko has not officially addressed the accusations. Funko has become more prominent in the gaming space recently, as it released
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  , an action game that allows players to utilize characters from the famous brand, on September 13. Despite how well-known the brand is,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  was deemed a disappointment by most critics, earning largely negative reviews due to severe technical issues.
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  currently holds an average of 53 on OpenCritic with 52 reviews, and only 12% of critics have recommended the title.

 <p>
  Despite its largely negative reception,
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  is still receiving DLC packs. The most recent update included two
  <em>
   Wicked
  </em>
  DLC packs, which cost $7.99 each. One of them added Elphaba and Glinda to the game, while the other included The Wizard and Madame Morrible.

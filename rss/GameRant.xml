  player Tiny-Sheepherder3279 shared a photo of the incredible weapon replica that they gifted to their boss. According to the player, both they, their boss, and some of their other co-workers all play the game. The specific weapon is the Antiquated Murgleis, which can be acquired in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  's Eureka. Tiny-Sheepherder3279 purchased the 3D print files and printed it out themselves. From there, they used Bondo to smooth out the print, sanded, primed, and painted it with acrylic paint used for the red, with giilding wax used to create the gold and silver ornamentation. Overall, it's an impressive replica of the in-game weapon, and one that any Red Mage player would likely be happy to be given.

 <p>
  Many players have commented on the piece, not only sharing praise for the finished product, but expressing envy for the relationship the boss and employee have. Several joked that the employee was now owed a raise, while others teased Tiny-Sheepherder3279, saying that they were the boss and needed the weapon sent to them. One pointed out that the fan must really love their boss, to which Tiny-Sheepherder3279 explained that that their boss is a "bad ass" who both protects and pushes the team to do their best. Others were curious about 3D printing the weapon for themselves, to which Tiny-Sheepherder3279 noted that they had procured the print STL files from Fused Creations.

  As 3D printing becomes more common, remarkable gifts like these may see an uptick as well. Gamers have used 3D printers to recreate everything from Pokemon to buff Cactuar. Some fans make the 3D design themselves, but others acquire the files online, like Tiny-Sheepherder3279. Printing the item out is just part of the work, though, as a lot of post-processing is needed the majority of the time to get the product to look good. As 3D printers become more affordable and thereby accessible, chances are gaming fans will see even more impressive creations like these, whether the fans choose to keep them for themselves or gift them to a valued friend or co-worker like Tiny-Sheepherder3279 did.

 <p>
  Stealth has been and continues to be a major part of games such as
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  , which takes inspiration from multiple games of the past. Today, stealth is as commonplace as action-oriented games, from horror to science fiction, taking from many games that remain significant many years later.

 <p>
  Certain games have invented or utilized stealth in impactful ways that games still use as inspiration. Whether it is through how the character traverses, environmental mechanics to hide the player, or the programming of NPC enemies, they would pave the way for how future games would play or execute certain concepts.

  There certainly are sections in
  <em>
   Return To Castle Wolfenstein

  where gamers can have fun with all kinds of action in the World War II setting, but stealth is mandatory in many others. B.J. Blaskowicz is not a super soldier, so much of the game is spent crouching and crawling through enemy territory to accomplish the mission and, for a 2001 title, it is still known for being a difficult yet fun experience.

  Though
  <strong>
   <em>
    Alien: Isolation
   </em>
  </strong>
  is far from the first stealth horror game, it was revolutionary due to its titular antagonist. The Xenomorph has never been more scary, because Creative Assembly invented advanced artificial intelligence for the creature that allowed it to learn as the player progresses, getting smarter and adept at figuring out players' tactics.

 <p>
  As a result,
  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  is never an easy game to play, even when replayed for a fifth or sixth time. Stealthily moving through Sevastopol Station remains as intense over ten years later as it was in 2014. Combined with it being a well-made sequel to Ridley Scott's
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  , any fan of horror should give Alien: Isolation a try.

  </strong>
  was anything but an action first-person shooter like
  <em>

  <em>
   Rainbow Six

  The slower pace of the original
  <em>
   Rainbow Six
  </em>
  is a drastic difference from what gamers are used to today with games such as
  <em>
   Rainbow Six: Vegas
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Rainbow Six: Siege
  </em>
  , which mixes tactics into a more action-oriented game. However, it is important to see where those games originated and how far the series has come since.

  On top of being a pivotal superhero game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Batman: Arkham Asylum
   </em>
  </strong>
  made quite an impact when it came to stealth gameplay. Throughout the journey on Arkham Island, Batman is not an indestructible war machine, but a skilled man relying on his tactics and gadgets to survive, forcing the use of covers, vantage points, and moving through vents to take out Joker's thugs one by one.

  <em>

  did feature the Freeflow Combat that fans became familiar with, but future games in the series would focus less and less on stealth. Meanwhile, Arkham Asylum would make the Predator segments a major part of the story, with the player having to get creative with Batman's movies, especially when thugs would change tactics and mentalities throughout encounters.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed 2

  Even when Assassin's Creed games went in wildly different directions, the DNA of Assassin's Creed 2 was always present. That includes stealth, with Ezio being rather easy to kill, so the player is forced to stay out of combat as much as possible, using distractions, crowds, and hiding spots to evade enemies.

  Where a lot of stealth games are larger than life and don't rely on realism, the

  franchise makes the player have to think like an actual modern-day assassin. Whether it's the original
  <strong>

  or the reboot,
  <em>
   Hitman

  featured a heavy focus on rewarding players for taking the optional stealth approach.

  With Michael Ironside voicing Sam Fisher,

      <title>Mortal Kombat 1’s Khaos Reigns Expansion Should Prove Lightning Can Strike Twice With One Feature</title>

 <p>
  In late September,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </em>
  </strong>
  will receive its first story expansion DLC in the form of Khaos Reigns. Here, players will have to defend Liu Kang’s new timeline from Titan Havik and his army as they attempt to sow chaos throughout the universe. Like the
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  Aftermath expansion before it, Khaos Reigns will introduce new playable fighters into
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  ’s roster, from gender-swapped Sektor and Cyrax to
  <em>
   Scream
  </em>
  ’s very own Ghostface slasher. However, there’s one other feature from Aftermath that could prove successful in Khaos Reigns in terms of granting players more choice and allowing for more story potential in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2
  </em>
  : multiple endings.

  In
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  ’s base game, the campaign ends with Thunder God Raiden bestowing his godly powers on Liu Kang in order for him to be able to defeat the time Titan Kronika. Meanwhile, Kitana was able to defeat Shao Khan and gain control of Outworld and its army, ushering in a new era of relative peace between the realms. However, this was not the true ending of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  , as the Aftermath expansion showcased another, unseen side of the story. Nightwolf, Fujin, and Shang Tsung were sent back in time by Liu Kang to steal Kronika’s crown to prevent her from gaining power in the first place.

  Shang Tsung used this opportunity to manipulate
  <em>

  ’s previous events and sabotage Raiden and Liu Kang's efforts. Kitana’s mother Sindel was resurrected but chose to aid Shao Khan instead of her own daughter, ensuring she never became leader of Outworld. Tsung stole Kronika's crown to gain control of the Hourglass and seeped the lifeforce from Fujin, Nightwolf, Raiden, Shao Khan, and Sindel. Here, players had a choice to fight as either Titan Liu Kang or Titan Shang Tsung, with the former creating the main timeline in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  and the latter becoming the villain of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1

  While not much of Khaos Reigns’ endgame story is known, there is still a lot of potential for it to have alternate endings. Khaos Reigns will likely feature a climactic battle between Titan Liu Kang and Titan Havik or have Liu Kang select a champion to fight Havik, similar to the final battle of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  ’s base campaign. If the final battle is between Liu Kang and Havik, one potential ending with Liu Kang could be defeating Havik and Liu Kang attempting to heal the multiverse from Havik’s destruction. If Havik wins, one potential ending could have him destroy Liu Kang and usher in a new age of chaos across the multiverse.

 <p>
  Khaos Reigns could innovate on alternate endings’ potential by having branching narratives leading to multiple different endings instead of just two. For example, if players decide to play as Cyrax primarily instead of Sektor in fight sequences, this could cause Cyrax to have a better ending than Sektor. The same could happen to Sektor or other characters when chosen more often where multiple fighters are available. Branching narratives and multiple endings could help increase
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  ’s replayability and grant NetherRealm Studios more options to bounce off of for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2
  </em>
  .

  Khaos Reigns’ Potential Effects on Mortal Kombat 2

 <p>
  If multiple endings do appear in Khaos Reigns similar to Aftermath, NetherRealm Studios could take multiple avenues on how they address them in future DLCs or
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2
  </em>
  . NetherRealm could try to weave every ending option into
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2

  ’s story, similar to how they canonized both Liu Kang and Shang Tsung’s Aftermath endings in

 <p>
  It may also select only one ending to be the canonical ending for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2
  </em>
  , leaving the other ending as a mere multiversal concept or the subject of future multiplayer events. NetherRealm could also go the way of Telltale Games and record which choices most players made to determine what should be the best ending to lead into
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 2
  </em>
  , but only time will tell if the studio plans to branch out in its storytelling avenues.

  The Hidden Cove Tournament can be found at Fune's Refuge, but is only available after players have completed the mission Jin From Yarikawa. The Tournament itself is divided into four different fights. Once players have defeated the first three challengers, they'll get a chance to fight the toughest opponent, Sao the Crimson Fisherman.

  <em>
   The Hidden Cove Tournament might seem innocuous at first, offering players a mini-game to pass the time while they're getting ready to take on the big fights like Khotun Khan or the Eagle. However, that is only the surface. After defeating Kai the Raider, who serves as a tutorial for this event, all the rest of the combatants are incredibly difficult in their own ways, but none more than the Crimson Fisherman, Sao, the final opponent in the Hidden Cove Tournament. Defeating him normally requires near-perfect reaction time, skill, and familiarity with all the tools at Jin's disposal. Here is how to make this duel just a little bit easier.

 <p>
  As the fourth and final opponent in
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's Hidden Cove Tournament, Sao is a little more tricky to defeat than his colleagues. This is mostly due to his wide-ranging moveset, which incorporates several altered versions of attacks that players will already have faced in the Tournament. Despite this, Sao can still be a fairly predictable fighter if players pay attention to his movements, and is most easily defeated by parries and counterattacks.

 <p>
  Sao likes to open each engagement with a classic
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  Heavy Attack that sweeps low to the ground before flicking up dirt into the player's face. This move is heavily telegraphed, and can be avoided with a quick tap of the dodge button. After his opener, Sao might go for a quick follow-up, which can be blocked or parried for a return hit. Alternatively, the Crimson Fisherman will attempt to stun Jin by throwing a bottle of sake, which can be avoided with a rolling dodge. Sao will once again attempt to follow-up with a quick attack that can be blocked or parried.

  The strategy here is simple.
  <strong>
   Equip the Wind Stance (3rd one), walk up to Sao, and spam Jump attack

  Equip the

  (2nd one), and make sure you have the

 <p>
  When the fight starts, wait for Sao to charge up his unblockable sweeping attack and dodge away. Keep dodging for all of his follow-up attacks (he usually has three or four), and he'll stop to take a breather.
  <strong>
   Use Surging Strike on Sao
  </strong>
  as soon as he stands still for more than a moment; the earlier, the better. If Sao starts an attack and you see a red glint but you haven't started charging up Surging Strike yet, dodge and reset. However, if you have Surging Strike ready when a red glint appears, follow through. In this case, there is a higher chance of you landing a hit than Sao.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has made a
  <em>
   Breaking Bad
  </em>
  -style RV in the idyllic farming sim. The unusual mash-up has amused fellow players of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  and fans of the
  <em>

  series.

 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Breaking Bad
  </em>
  went off the air years ago, it's remained a major facet of pop culture and still has numerous fans. The series gained enough popularity that it spawned the spin-off
  <em>
   Better Call Saul
  </em>
  and has had enough of a continuing presence in pop culture that
  <em>
   Breaking Bad
  </em>
  was even used to advertise chips in a Super Bowl commercial in 2023.

 <p>
  Now, one player has brought a touch of
  <em>
   Breaking Bad

  into
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . Reddit user memulias showed the inside and outside of their RV, which looks fairly nondescript from the outside, but the interior is a bit more obvious with its references. The inside of the RV is full of potions bottles, cauldrons, and most notably, a number of

  , which appear to be producing nothing but diamonds. In other words, the RV could be seen as a "crystal" lab, with diamonds taking the place of the crystal meth notoriously produced in the
  <em>
   Breaking Bad
  </em>
  RV.

  Breaking Bad RV Build Inspires Jokes and Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Fans of the game and
  <em>
   Breaking Bad
  </em>
  have flooded the comments, with questions about the RV and making jokes about the series. Several fans were puzzled about how the player got the RV and decorated it in such a manner. Memulias explained that the RV is a part of the 1.6
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  update, which lets players choose the exterior of their multiplayer cabin, and the RV is one possible option. For the interior, they created a second player account to remove the default furniture in the RV, and decorated portions of it with items from the trash catalog which also launched with that update.

  Numerous players shared their compliments on the build, especially for the literal interpretation for the "crystal" made in the show. The game has seen a lot of crossover builds from fans, but putting elements of a crime drama into the game isn't something many seem to have done. However, that's just part of the fun of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . Players are able to decorate and design their farm as they see fit, and developer ConcernedApe has continuously added more items to use and decorative possibilities for the exterior of buildings. Big sheds often make for good spaces to make creative builds, but in this particular case, the RV design was just perfect for referencing

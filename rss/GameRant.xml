  Whenever
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  players start a new chapter, they will notice the difficulty spiking considerably. Using the same old weapons and armor means that it will take longer to defeat enemies, making the overall progression more time-consuming.

 <p>
  To deal with this problem, it is recommended to upgrade all the equipment that players constantly use. This includes weapons, armor, spells, and even spirits. Naturally,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  players will have to obtain certain materials before they can enhance their most used items. Finding materials like the Knot of Voidness can be challenging, especially if players do not know where to look for it.

   Knot of Voidness
  </span>
  is used to upgrade Spirits. For the uninitiated, Spirits are special powers that can be obtained after defeating certain enemies in the game. Whenever the fight ends, there will be a glowing spirit suspended in the air, and players need to approach it in order to claim it.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":935} -->

 <p>
  Initially, players will not be able to claim these spirits as they lack guidance. To solve this problem, they need to meet an NPC. After gaining the ability to absorb spirits, players can finally equip them from the inventory.

 <p>
  The Knot of Voidness will help players enhance these spirits, making them more viable in combat. Unfortunately, Knot of Voidness is a rare material that can only be obtained in the later chapters of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  . There are three possible ways to get the Knot of Voidness:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Buying it from the Keeper's Shrine
  </li>
  <li>
   Getting it as a reward for beating strong enemies
  </li>

   Obtained by opening certain chests

 <p>
  Sadly, there is no easy method to obtain the Knot of Voidness in
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  . Although one could argue that buying it from the store at any Keeper's Shrine is convenient. However, it is important to remember that the item is available in limited quantities.

  For the other two methods, players will have to make sure that they explore the different regions of the map. While some of the bosses do drop this item, you don't have nearly enough to upgrade Spirits.

  In order to use the Knot of Voidness, players will first need to upgrade spirits using Blood of the Iron Bull. After enhancing a spirit to a certain level, players will notice that it will require the Knot of Voidness. However, make sure that the spirit is actually useful before enhancing it with the Knot of Voidness and

  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  has an assortment of memorable protagonists across their first-party titles that are often known for saving the worlds they are a part of. While many of these protagonists in PlayStation games, like Kratos, tend to be a little cold or a hero of few words, some are incredibly charismatic.

 <p>
  These protagonists are rather witty when interacting with allies and enemies in their various franchises, allowing players to fall in love with their extroverted personalities. Overall, these are some of the best and most loved charismatic main characters on Sony's flagship console.

  At first glance, Aloy may not be seen as the most charismatic character created by PlayStation, especially if players only focus on how she interacted with people in
  <em>
   Horizon: Zero Dawn
  </em>
  . However,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon: Forbidden West
   </em>
  </strong>
  saw Aloy grow as a hero and learn how to interact with the different clans of the adventure title, in the hopes of saving their entire world.

 <p>
  Aloy begins to realize the importance of relying on others, who make up the small team of characters that are helping her achieve her goal, as well as finally gaining the confidence to speak out about the issues that are at the heart of the narrative. Aloy gradually reveals herself to be a brilliant persuader and an empathetic person, which shows that some characters may not be naturally charismatic, but they can eventually learn how to approach individuals in such a way.

  Players may be surprised to see a protagonist like Sackboy being mentioned as one of the most charismatic characters on PlayStation. However, this cloth character manages to present himself in such an appealing way that, even without speaking any words, Sackboy has managed to attract a devoted audience.

  As a character that has no voice, Sackboy is able to communicate with the various characters through his incredibly expressive face. This allows for some incredible moments between talking villains and the angry face of a Sackboy who is about to beat them. Sackboy has progressed throughout his franchise into being a part of standalone titles, such as
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sackboy: A Big Adventure
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  where the originally blank slate of a character is shown to be the hero once more.

  Like Sackboy, Astro Bot doesn't actually talk, though this tiny robot still had a lot of charisma and charm when encountered on the various PlayStation consoles. Astro Bot was originally a tool used by PlayStation to show the capabilities of the various consoles, starting with the PlayStation 4 when players met many of these tiny bots during
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Playroom
   </strong>
   .
  </em>

 <p>
  Since then, Astro Bot has only grown in character, being dressed in the various outfits of characters from PlayStation-exclusive titles as well as giving players various worlds to interact with. Watching these Astro Bots chat or play has shown a lively group of machines and has even encouraged PlayStation to take them a step further with its upcoming paid title,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , which hopes to grow the tiny robot even further.

  Adorable mascot protagonists continue to be some of the most charismatic on PlayStation consoles. While few mentioned on this list don't actually speak, Ratchet is a fan-favorite who has been sure to make his thoughts known across every game of the franchise. Many players even believe that, over the years, Ratchet's charisma and comedy have only improved to make the Ratchet of recent titles like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Rift Apart
   </em>
  </strong>
  one of the most charismatic protagonists on the PlayStation.

 <p>
  Besides his comedic charm, Ratchet is a classic hero in all the games, though he does have his moments of being able to go off the board depending on the situation. Having this sort of character that has grown across the games and seeing how he interacts with others makes Ratchet not only an interesting protagonist but also one who knows how to talk himself out of a bad situation.

  Not long after their arrival on Toshara,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Outlaws
   </em>
  </strong>
  players will be introduced to the Kessel Sabacc mini-game as part of the High-Stakes Showdown side quest. First, they'll learn the rules in a warmup game, after which, Danka will send them off to a high-stakes game at Kaslo's parlor.

  Following the quest marker will eventually lead players to the front door of Kaslo's parlor, but the gatekeeper droid has no intention of letting Kay and Nix inside. As a result of this,
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws

  players will need to find a way into Kaslo's parlor, which will involve a little bit of platforming.

  After being turned away by the gatekeeper droid, players should head back up the steps that they just came down and then swing a left. This will lead them down another set of steps, at the bottom of which, they'll see a bar to their left. Just to the side of the bar is a passageway, which takes players to an outdoor area. Here, they'll need to press the right analog stick to use Kay's grappling hook, then head through the door on the other side of the gap.

  Once they've found a way into Kaslo's parlor, players will need to defeat Bosnok at Kessel Sabacc. Unfortunately, unlike the tutorial game they played a little earlier, this one is fairly challenging, and the buy-in is a lot higher as well. With this in mind, players may want to consider creating a manual save before they sit down at the table to ensure that they have a good hand in Round 1. Granted, this is a fairly cheap tactic, but it's one that could save players an awful lot of Credits.

 <p>
  Once one or two of the other players have dropped out,
  <strong>
   it can sometimes be better to just stand on all three turns
  </strong>
  rather than drawing blindly in the hopes of making a pair. If a card that would give them Sabacc appears in one of the face-up piles then they should obviously grab it, but otherwise, it's better to minimize one's losses and wait for a good hand. Players should also make sure to
  <strong>
   use all three Shift Tokens
  </strong>
  , as doing so will allow them to save three of their chips and cost the other players one.

     The NPC to the player's left, Deonis, has a Shift Token called Major Fraud which sets the Imposter value to six until the next reveal. Cheap Sabacc may not be great while all four players are still active, but in a heads-up situation, any kind of Sabacc will usually lead to a victory.

  Protagonists are the driving force of whatever piece of media they are starring in. They give audiences someone to explore the world and story through, to root for, and even to control in the world of video games. As such, it is rare to see developers kill the hero of the game. If they do, however, these deaths normally only take place at the end of a game's story.

 <p>
  Watching the protagonist of a video game die shortly into the title's opening scenes is certainly one way to grab the player's attention. A way to keep it is then to continue the story past said character's death. Whether it is a flash-forward, an introduction to the afterlife, or another matter entirely, it is still a brave way to open a game, and it tend to pay off.

  is truly a unique and innovative video game, not just because of its premise but also its gameplay. The game uses eye-tracking mechanics to reconstruct the protagonist's memories to see if the Gatekeeper deems him worthy of admission into paradise. The character communicates to the ferryman by blinking, which is how the player will interact with everything throughout the world.

  But the story of death and moving on are just as equally worthy of attention. So many games focus on life and staying alive that playing a game exploring what comes after is truly special and unique. The game will recount Benny's memories from childhood to his death, showing an ordinary life that most people could likely relate to, making it all the more impactful.

   <strong>
    Bloodlines

  <strong>
   <em>
    Vampire: The Masquerade
   </em>
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>

  Players navigate the world as a vampire, doing their best to hide their undead nature from others as they complete the tasks given to them, having occasional run-ins with hostile vampires, hunters, and more. Seeing LA through the eyes of a blood-drinker is certainly a novel, fun, yet flawed experience that many gamers are certain to appreciate.

  Detectives are adept at solving murders, and after a few years on the job, there is probably very little that they have not seen before. But detective Ronan O'Connor can definitely boast a career first when he has one final job to do posthumously--finding the one responsible for murdering him.

 <p>
  The serial killer known as Bell Killer makes detective O'Connor one of his victims when he manages to track the killer down and now remains stuck as a ghost on earth until he finishes this one last job. Playing as a ghost is certainly an interesting and fresh idea that opens the doors for new styles of gameplay, such as teleportation and possession. In most games that involve ghosts, the norm is to control a living being that must flee from or confront the undead entities. Thus, it is refreshing to see the inverse being experimented with.

  The PS1 classic
  <strong>
   <em>
    MediEvil
   </em>
  </strong>
  is known for having a skeletal player character by the name of Dan, but of course, he wasn't always a skeleton. Daniel faced against an army of undead, and false rumors spread of his chivalry in battle and how he was responsible for the victory, even killing the undead leader. Unfortunately, poor Dan barely even got to fight, as he died from the first arrow that was loosed.

 <p>
  It is a rather amusing and shameful death, but Dan is given a chance at redemption, as he is resurrected after Zarok casts a spell to create an eternal night and raise more restless dead for his armies. Dan is returned as a skeleton and becomes Gallowmere's only hope to defeat the evil Zarok, save the land, and, if possible, ascend to the hall of heroes after his dishonorable death denied him entry.

  Dontnod was previously known for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Life is Strange
   </em>
  </strong>
  but broke away from time travel gimmicks and teen drama in favor of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Vampyr
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a melancholic and gothic tale of vampires in early 20th century London. Though the vampire mythos changes in each iteration, there is one constant: Every person dies during the transition, returning as an undead creature with a thirst for blood.

 <p>
  And this is also the case in
  <em>
   Vampyr
  </em>
  , with the opening scene showing Jonathan returning home after surviving the war only to die in his homeland at the hands of a supernatural creature. Thus begins the afterlife of Jonathan Reid, which sees him battling between his hunger for blood and the hippocratic oath he took when he became a doctor. The idea of a vampire doctor seems almost contradictory, but this inner conflict is part of what makes the game so interesting.

  The second installment in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect
   </em>
  </strong>
  series ups the ante from the first, introducing players to Cerberus and the Collectors. The game opens in a way players are sure to never forget, as the Normandy comes under attack from a mysterious vessel that forces the crew to evacuate. Ever the hero, Shepard makes sure everyone else escapes first, and as a result, they never make it into an escape pod, suffocating in space instead.

  Rather than introducing a new character, Cerberus painstakingly reconstructs Shepard's body and brings them back to life to fight against the Collectors. Shepard's death and subsequent resurrection has an impact on previous friends, love interests, and even further consequences in
  <em>
   Mass Effect 3

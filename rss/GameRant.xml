	<em>
	 <strong>
		Post Trauma
	 </strong>
	</em>
	is an upcoming survival horror game that was given a spotlight during the Guerrilla Collective 2024 showcase. Horror game aficionados will recognize clear points of inspiration within the indie game, notably from
	<em>
	 The Evil Within
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Resident Evil
	</em>
	.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Post Trauma
	</em>
	was originally announced during The Game Awards Show 2022, painting the game as a cinematic horror title in a short reveal trailer that teased brief flashes of the game's content. Now, during the Guerrilla Collective, gamers have been given a deeper look into the title. Gamers take the role of Roman, a middle-aged train conductor who gets dragged into a surreal nightmare world. In a strange land that bends the laws of reality, players will have to guide Roman through uncanny environments and past disturbing creatures. Players will have to navigate various puzzles as they travel between unusual and bizarre locations, all while having to deal with nightmarish creatures that are intent on stopping Roman from ever escaping.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Post Trauma
	</em>
	is set to launch in Fall 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, following the new trailer seen during the Guerrilla Collective. Studios Red Soul Games and Raw Fury have been working hard with
	<em>
	 Post Trauma
	</em>
	over the past several years, and fans will be able to see the game for themselves later this year. The trailer showcases more gameplay for the upcoming survival horror game, as well as giving fans a release window and the consoles the game will be on. Gamers are also given a first look at the voice talent for the game, as the trailer features the vocal works of Autumn Ivy, Hyoie O’Grady, and Togo Igawa.

	The fixed camera angles offer a feeling reminiscent of the older
	<em>
	 Resident Evil
	</em>
	games, which follow players through locales that ooze with the uncanny architecture of
	<em>

	, all while being hounded by monsters with a design that would sit right at home in

	<em>

	is a game that isn't hiding its roots; explicitly being inspired by genre-defining classics of the past decades, and it's already clear to see where these inspirations lie and how they are being used.

 <p>
	A
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Pokemon GO
	 </em>
	</strong>
	player has found some Gyms with a scary line-up that includes monsters like Blissey and Chansey. Gyms are a key component of the
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	experience, like in other
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	games. In the comments, other
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	players offered possible explanations to the player about their discovery.

 <p>
	Gyms are points of interest on the
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	map where players face trainers from rival teams. When battling a rival, if the
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	player succeeds, they will reduce the critter's motivation. A Pokemon with zero motivation leaves the Gym's defense, and when this happens to all Pokemon assigned to defend the Gym, the winning trainer can claim it.
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	's Gym battles, as in other games in the franchise, involve planning and preparation to take down the defending teams. But one
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	player recently found a line-up that is a nightmare for its opponents.

 <p>
	Reddit user jperk121 found multiple Gyms in the area where they live, defended by Drifblim, Snorlax, Blissey, Wobbuffet, Togekiss, and Chansey. The player shared four screenshots of different Gyms showing the same scary Pokemon line-up. According to them, almost all the Gyms in the area have this same composition in Team Mystic, one of the
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	factions that players can choose from. The player said that all the accounts have the same level (31), and asked if it was spoofing. This illegal technique tricks the device's GPS and makes
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	believe that the player is in a different place from the current one.

 <p>
	The composition found by OP stands out for being made up of some of
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	's best Gym defenders. The highlight of the group is Blissey, considered an absolute powerhouse for defending
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	Gyms due to its whopping 496 Stamina. In response to the post, some trainers believe it's spoofing, but others have offered multi-accounting as a possible explanation for the Gym's line-up pattern. Trainers with multiple
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	accounts are a relatively common practice, mainly used for trading.

 <p>
	While it's not uncommon for a
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	trainer to have more than one account, the practice has already been criticized by other trainers who have had their experience with Gyms ruined. Their reasoning is that by creating multiple accounts and filling up the Gyms in the area, the
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	player makes it impossible to defeat them by fair standards. The situation becomes even trickier when the Gyms have a powerful composition like the one found by the OP. With that, it gets harder to get
	<em>
	 Pokemon GO
	</em>
	's PokeCoins, the currency that players earn when defending Gyms.

	Memory of Grace is the first tool you get in
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	. This is given out for free to all starter classes. On using the Memory of Grace, the character will lose all of their runes and spawn back at their last Site of Grace. This is a great tool to use when you are stuck somewhere and don’t have many runes to lose.

	Spectral Steed Whistle is a legendary tool that lets you summon your trusted spectral steed, Torrent. It is rewarded to you after talking to Melina and accepting her request. She will appear to you at any Site of Grace located far from the tutorial area. Most players can encounter her at the Gatefront Site of Grace located north of the Church of Elleh.

	The Crafting Kit and Telescope are two useful tools sold by Merchant Kalé in the Church of Elleh. After purchasing the Crafting Kit, you will unlock the crafting feature in
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	. On the other hand, the Telescope comes in handy for players new to the Lands Between. With dangers sprawling everywhere, beginners can use the Telescope to scout areas from a safe distance.

	In
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	, most players first head to Stormveil Castle but will have to face Margit, the Fell Omen in their path. This is a big challenge for players new to the Soulsborne genre. If you are having trouble beating Margit, then getting Margit’s Shackle should be on your priority list. This item will bind Margit to the ground for a few seconds.

	Mimic’s Veil is found in a chest in Stormveil Castle. To find the chest, you will first need to head to the room with the Grafted Scion. There is only one Grafted Scion boss in Stormveil Castle. You can find this enemy in a room with a large painting of Godfrey. From this room, head south to find a room with a Banished Knight circling around a dining table. This room has the chest containing Mimic's Veil.

	Wraith Callers are some of the most horrifying enemies in
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	, usually found near even scarier Revenants. These enemies carry a bell-like weapon and ring it to call vengeful homing spirits. Players can also claim this tool for themselves and use it to fight enemies.

 <p>
	The Wraith Calling Bell is located inside a chest in the underground cellar of Laskyar Ruins. These ruins are guarded by hordes of Wraith Callers. If you make it to the cellar in the northwestern side of the ruins, you can find the Wraith Calling Bell. While the damage from the spirits might not be anything impressive, it might fit the theme for some builds in
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	, especially magic builds.

	There are many civilizations hidden in the Lands Between. Players who have made it to the underground cities of Nokstella and Nokron might have come across followers of ancestral spirits. These enemies use vapor-infused attacks which can only be used by the Tarnished in the form of Winged Greathorn’s weapon skill Soul Stifler or the Ancestral Infant’s Head.

	The Ancestral Infant’s Head is a tool locked inside the chest in a submerged ruin northwest of the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace in Nokron. You will have to use Torrent’s double jump ability to make it to the ruins. However, be careful of the water, as falling in will instantly kill you. This tool sprays spirit vapor on the ground to deal magic damage to any enemy who comes in contact.

	Omen Bairn and its stronger variant, Regal Omen Bairn, are two tools that call forth swarms of omen spirits chasing the target. Omen Bairn is dropped by an Omen Ogre enemy located deep inside the Subterranean Shunning Grounds. As for the Regal Omen Bairn, you will have to defeat Morgott, The Omen King, and trade his remembrance for the Regal Omen Bairn at Roundtable Hold.

	Just like his brother Morgott, Mohg also had a shackle tying him in the Subterranean Shunning Grounds when they were born. While in the
	<strong>
	 Subterranean Shunning Grounds
	</strong>
	, you can also collect Mohg’s Shackle. This item will come in handy right away if you choose to explore the Leyndell sewers deeper. At the bottom of the sewers, you will face Mohg, the Omen boss. Using Mohg’s Shackle will bind him to the ground for a few seconds. You can also use this tool against the remembrance variant of the same boss—Mohg, Lord of Blood.

	While most tools in

	can be used by every player, the Blasphemous Claw is a tool only useful to players with excellent parry skills. This slab of rock holds the power to deflect Maliketh’s Destined Death.

 <p>
	Ahead of the game's probable appearance at Summer Game Fest, the release date and tons of content for Sega's upcoming
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Sonic X Shadow Generations
	 </strong>
	</em>
	have been leaked online.
	<em>
	 Sonic X Shadow Generations
	</em>
	is the updated re-release of the 2011
	<em>
	 Sonic Generations
	</em>
	, remastering the original game with improved graphics and framerate, along with adding a brand-new story campaign focused on Shadow the Hedgehog, who has been added as an additional playable character.

 <p>
	Besides being a remaster of a fan-favorite
	<em>
	 Sonic
	</em>
	game, fans are highly anticipating Shadow's story in
	<em>
	 Sonic X Shadow Generations
	</em>
	. The initial reveal trailer showed off Shadow tackling one of his most personal foes, Black Doom, along with fighting past bosses like the Biolizard. Fans are incredibly excited about the game's new content, especially with regard to Shadow's role and how he ties into the story of
	<em>
	 Generations
	</em>
	. While the game has been announced for this Autumn, some leakers have already shared the game's probable release date.

	This first leak was shared by billbil-kun on Dealabs, who has apparently narrowed down
	<em>
	 Sonic X Shadow Generations
	</em>
	' likely release date: October 25, 2024. This matches up with a related leak about
	<em>
	 Sonic X Shadow Generations
	</em>
	' Switch version, where notable Sega leaker Midori claimed that Sega and Sonic Team had submitted that version of the game for review and were preparing for digital purchase options to go live soon. Midori and some insiders had also leaked another part of the game that fans should likely be excited about: the return of the franchise's Chao Garden mechanic.

	Midori posted on Twitter that fans should "look forward to the future of the Chao." Following this tweet, a new thread by MysteryLupin was posted on Twitter, leaking a number of pre-release material for
	<em>
	 Sonic X Shadow Generations
	</em>
	. This leak includes new screenshots of the game, showcasing the remastered graphics, box art, some of Shadow's new abilities in
	<em>
	 Shadow Generations
	</em>
	, and some of the levels.

 <p>
	One of the most noteworthy things shown in these leaks was a different version of the opening cutscene, which showed off a number of Chao in attendance at Sonic's birthday party. Based on Midori's most recent leak, along with a past leak that Sega was working on a Chao-raising game, it appears that the Chao Garden might be making a return in
	<em>

	</em>
	, too.

	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	is a pixel-art indie game that leaves a lot about NPCs' appearances to players' imaginations. Most of the time,
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	villagers appear as little pixel sprites, with more detailed portraits when players engage them in conversations. However, there are no realistic or full-body renditions of the NPCs to be found in the game itself, which often leads fans to reimagine them in different art styles or in a realistic way. In this particular case, a fan used the character creator options in
	<em>
	 The Sims 4
	</em>
	to do that.

	The Sims and Stardew Valley Often Go Together
 </h2>
 <p>
	This isn't the first time that
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	fans have tried to remake their favorite characters in
	<em>
	 The Sims 4
	</em>
	.
	<em>
	 The Sims 4
	</em>
	has a very robust character creator, especially for its age, which lets players make all kinds of creations before mods even come into the picture. Some of the characters seen in artofkai's recreations, like Haley and her sister Emily, have been the subject of
	<em>
	 Sims 4
	</em>
	conversions before. However, since the
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	characters are normally quite stylized, these recreations vary considerably from one another, making each new creation interesting for fans of the games to look at.

 <p>
	While
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	is unlikely to get any kind of reboot that changes its charming retro graphics into more robust, realistic ones like those seen in
	<em>
	 The Sims 4
	</em>
	, fans will keep making art and character creations like these. Developer Eric Barone has previously said that he wouldn't object to the idea of a
	<em>
	 Stardew Valley
	</em>
	movie, so perhaps someday players will get to see another realistic take on their favorite characters.

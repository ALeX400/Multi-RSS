  Catching common fish in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Palia
   </strong>
  </em>
  is not as easy as it sounds. While these fish will be much more likely to appear on your line than a legendary fish, like a Long-Nosed Unicorn Fish, you still need to be aware of their frequent locations, and what time they will appear in the area.

  that can only be found on one specific map:
  <strong>
   Kilima Valley
  </strong>
  . This is the main map where you'll find most of the stores, including the General Store, Tailor, Blacksmith, and more. On this map, you'll notice that there are fishing spots in both rivers and in the ocean.

  Now, once you've found the optimal spot to go searching for a Silver Salmon in Kilima Valley's rivers, you will need to make sure you meet the right qualifications to be able to get one on your line. Luckily, it is pretty easy to catch one. Here's what you'll need to do:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Start by visiting the rivers, and casting your line into the water. Having a
   <strong>
    basic fishing rod
   </strong>
   will be good enough.
  </li>
  <li>
   You won't need to worry about bringing any
   <strong>
    bait
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The fish can only be found during the
   <strong>
    night

  These are all the requirements you will need to meet. When you fish from these hours, you are bound to come up with a Silver Salmon pretty quickly. Then, when you have one in your possession, you can use it for

  The main thing you will need to do to get a Cutthroat Trout is to ensure you have some
  <strong>
   worms as bait
  </strong>
  on your fishing rod. Otherwise, you will just get common fish on your line rather than the Cutthroat Trout. You can start making worms by getting the Worm Farm at
  <strong>
   fishing level 4
  </strong>
  . The recipe for this can be purchased from the Fishing Guild for
  <strong>
   500 Gold
  </strong>
  . To make worms, you can place just about any item inside the farm, such as an apple or a carrot. Once you've stocked up on bait and have picked up a Cutthroat Trout, you can either use it for cooking, gifting, display it in your house or sell it to make a profit.

 <p>
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  creator Hideo Kojima has shared the story of how
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  actor Norman Reedus was convinced to join
  <strong>
   <em>
    Death Stranding
   </em>
  </strong>
  . According to Kojima, Reedus didn't take much convincing, even though
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  itself was, at the time, extremely early into its development.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":289} -->
 <p>
  Though it came from one of the most trusted creators in the game industry,
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  nevertheless turned out to be something of a surprise hit for many. Anchoring its unique post-apocalyptic game world was Norman Reedus in the role of protagonist Sam Porter Bridges, a character relied upon by survivors to deliver packages from place to place, traversing through dangerous territory menaced by hostile BT monsters and marauding MULES. Reedus' performance alongside other Hollywood personalities in the game's unusual high-concept narrative also cemented the game in many fans' minds, turning it into a slow-burn hit that dominated conversation in the months after it launched.

 <p>
  Now, as
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  is in development with Reedus reprising his role, Hideo Kojima shared more about how the original game got off the ground. On his official Twitter account, Kojima said that getting Reedus onboard with the project took almost no time at all.

 <p>
  In his post, Kojima mentioned that he pitched
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  to Norman Reedus at a sushi restaurant, and that Reedus said yes "instantly," despite the game not even having a script to work with. Within a month, Reedus was in the studio for performance capture for a trailer. Though Kojima didn't specify which trailer or when it happend in his post, it's likely that some of that footage ended up in the famous
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  E3 2016 teaser trailer, which unveiled the game as Kojima Productions' first title as an independent studio.

 <p>
  The post also revealed more about the state of both Kojima Productions and Hideo Kojima himself at the time. He said that when he pitched
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  to Reedus, he "had nothing," having recently taken the studio independent after his separation from Konami, where he spent years working on the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  series. It was Kojima's work on the canceled
  <em>
   Silent Hills
  </em>
  game alongside filmmaker Guillermo del Toro that led to him connecting with Norman Reedus originally. Though
  <em>
   Silent Hills
  </em>
  never manifested as anything other than the legendary
  <em>
   P.T.
  </em>
  teaser, it was that connection that eventually led to Reedus and Kojima's partnership for
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  years later.

  <em>

  DLC players are using a quest item, Boiled Crab, as an alternative for Scadutree Fragments to make the game easier. While Scadutree Fragments immensely help in making
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree

  DLC easier by giving players both offensive and defensive buffs, they are only limited in number, unlike Boiled Crab.

  The difference in the difficulty level between
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's base game and
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC is quite significant, and fans have been having a hard time navigating through the Land of Shadows. In fact, some players even started using Runes Arcs in
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC, an item a lot of players used to ignore in the base game. However, that is not the only item they should keep an eye out for.

 <p>
  In a post on the
  <em>
   Elden Ring

  subreddit, user timtimluuluu highlights an important item that can be used to significantly make the game easier. Suggesting that it could work as a Scadutree Fragment alternative in
  <em>
   Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC, the user posts a picture of Boiled Crab. Boiled Crab can be obtained in the base game and they increase physical damage negation by 20% for a duration of 60 seconds. However, considering that there is no limit to the amount of

   Boiled Crab
  </span>
  players can obtain in

  , the limited-time effect of the item isn't that big of a drawback.

  However, there is a catch. As many players noted on the Reddit post, it is extremely easy to miss the quest that unlocks this item. The worst part is that if players miss doing the quest and progress far enough in the story, there is absolutely no other way to get the item. Players need to interact with or defeat

 <p>
  Thankfully, there are other items too which players can use to get similar effects. For instance,
  <em>
   Elden Ring's
  </em>
  Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman also has a similar effect, as it reduces physical damage by 20% and that can be readily obtained at any time. The only catch is that it will occupy a Talisman slot which can otherwise be used for different buffs. Another important item highlighted by the player is the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="660221" style="color: #9242ff; ;">
   <img loading="lazy" src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/05/opaline-hardtear-4.png"/>
   Opaline Hardtear
  </span>
  which increases damage negation for all types for a whopping 3 minutes. Considering that damage inflicted by bosses has been one of the complaints players have against
  <em>
   Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC, these items can surely alleviate the issues to some extent.

  gives the players a multiplayer environment. Playing this beloved single-player game with friends and other players can be quite fun. However, griefers have been a big problem
  <em>
   in GTA Online

  . These are the players who take the game as a multiplayer battleground game. Their only motive is to destroy every other player they see on the map. It makes it harder to casually enjoy the game without indulging in violence.

  On top of that, these griefers also cause a lot of trouble when players are doing the delivery missions. They destroy the product, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars that players worked very hard for. So, players' vehicles must be capable of countering and withstanding the onslaught of griefers. Here are the best vehicles to perfectly counter these pesky griefers and enjoy playing
  <em>

  in relative peace.

  Nightshark is one of the cheapest options to sort of passively counter griefers in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . This vehicle can withstand 26 homing missiles and 10 RPGs, which gives players great protection against vehicles such as the Oppressor MK II, Sparrow, Vigilante, etc.

 <p>
  Owing to the armor plating on the side windows and windshields, griefers will have a hard time shooting players down. In addition, Nightshark also has front-mounted machine guns that do decent damage and are certainly better than driving a random car you steal from the street.

  The Insurgent Pick-up Custom has the same armor as the Nightshark, but it packs a better overall punch. It has much better ramming power and disfigures other vehicles after hitting them. To get the Insurgent Pick-Up Custom, players first have to buy the Insurgent Pick-Up and upgrade it to a custom variant in their Mobile Operations Center or Avenger.

  Customizing this vehicle will let players add a top mounted machine gun that the player's friend or associate can use while they drive. It deals tonnes of damage and absolutely shreds opponents.

  There are only a few vehicles that players can slap on the Imani Tech upgrade in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . These vehicles can be equipped with missile lock-on jammer, slick proximity mines, or remote controls. However, within these vehicles, certain vehicles can further be equipped with armor plating, which gives them substantial protection against explosives.

 <p>
  In addition, vehicles like Dewbauchee Champion, Bravado Buffalo STX, and Annis Jubilee can also be equipped with a front-mounted machine gun that deals great damage. For the best passive protection, it is advised to use the Ocelot Virtue, as it has lightning-fast acceleration. Plus, since it's an EV, it can withstand a much greater number of RPGs and homing missiles with an armor upgrade.

  Brickade 6x6 is the better version of the normal Brickade in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  that players drove during the CEO Office's cargo delivery mission. This vehicle has one of the heaviest armors in the game and can take a whooping 48 RPGs or 48 homing missiles! Players can also install a scoop in front of Brickade 6x6 to move vehicles in their way out of their way.

 <p>
  In addition, it can also be equipped with a variety of mines ranging from slick proximity to kinetic mines. The best thing about this vehicle is that players can get this for a reduced price with Acid Lab set up in the back after completing the first 6 missions of
  <em>
   Los Santos Drug Wars
  </em>
  <em>
   First Dose

  Akula is one of the best tactical helicopters available in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . It is very quick and handles pretty well. Like all weaponized aircraft, it also has homing missiles and machine guns. On top of that, the passenger has access to a minigun, which they can use to gun down the griefers either on the ground or in the air.

 <p>
  Akula also has a stealth mode that will let players drop completely off the map radar, greatly helping in avoiding unwanted attention — though other players will likely still spot this tactical helicopter when it buzzes by.

  The Deluxo is one of the most unique vehicles in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . It is based on the Delorean from the
  <em>
   Back To The Future
  </em>
  movie. It has all the prerequisites required to be an anti-griefer vehicle. It has great maneuverability, armor, and firepower. It has both glide and flight mode, which come in very handy for evading griefers on land.

 <p>
  However, this vehicle has limited missiles and the price is very steep. It's hard to deny the style points, though. Being able to leave the road and take to the skies in a pinch can be invaluable when players are being pursued.

  Mammoth F-160 Raiju is the main vehicle to take the fight to the griefers. It is practically the poster vehicles of "the best defense is a good offense." Since it is literally a fighter jet, it has unparalleled offensive abilities, including a machine gun with explosive rounds and homing missiles.

 <p>
  In addition, it is the fastest aircraft in the game, and its handling can even be enhanced from the hangar. Like Akula, Raiju also has a stealth mode, which helps it remain off the grid from the griefers.

  Toreador is overall the best vehicle to counter and handle griefers in
  <em>
   GTA Online
  </em>
  . This vehicle can take numerous homing missiles and RPGs, and it is completely bulletproof from the rear. In addition, it is a submersible vehicle.

 <p>
  Players can activate the submarine mode to evade enemy vehicles in the water. It also has an infinite number of homing missiles with very aggressive tracking. These missiles change to torpedoes when the vehicle is in submarine mode and is underwater.

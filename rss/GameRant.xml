      <title>It’s Now or Never For Insomniac’s Spider-Man Franchise To Feature One Villain</title>

  Insomniac’s
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel's: Spider-Man 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  left players with a lot of hanging plot threads for future titles to wrap up: the return of Otto, the surprise appearance of Cindy Moon (AKA the superhero Silk), the cliffhanger with Carnage, Peter’s soft retirement from superheroics, and of course, Norman Osborn’s looming transformation into the Green Goblin. With such a full plate for the third installment, there’s only one chance left for the studio to make good on one of its biggest villain teases from
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  .

  Amid the chaos of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  's symbiote invasion, eagle-eyed fans may have noticed the distinctive spiral symbol that appeared on the meteor that brought the invasion to Earth. While this might have slipped past some players, comic readers will have recognized this as the insignia of Knull, a recently created character and the driving force behind the 2020-2021 major crossover event
  <em>
   The King in Black
  </em>
  .

  Knull is the creator of the symbiote race. As such, his arrival on Earth would be a major deal; he is not a character that can be relegated to side quests like Tombstone or Chameleon. If Insomniac wants to tackle the King in Black, he needs to be one of the major story threats, if not the main antagonist outright. The problem is, the third and final game in Insomniac's trilogy is already looking a bit overstuffed with characters.

  The story of all three games to date has been slowly building toward Norman Osborn’s descent into madness and eventual turn to supervillainy. It seems highly likely that the Green Goblin is the main villain of
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  ; his story has far too much momentum to fumble in the third act.

 <p>
  There's also the surprise reveal of Silk/Cindy Moon and the return of Otto Octavius, the main villain from
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man
  </em>
  . His deeply personal relationships with Peter and Norman are going to factor heavily into the inevitable drama in Insomniac’s finale. On top of it all,
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  will need to touch on Peter’s retirement from the superhero biz and his inevitable return to web-slinging.

 <p>
  Juggling all these story beats and plot threads means it’s increasingly likely that Insomniac won’t be able to give the eldritch symbiote god the gravitas he demands in a third game in the mainline series. But there is one last place Knull could fit into Insomniac's Spider-Man mythos: the leaked Venom spinoff game.

  Knull Could Work as the Main Villain in Insomniac’s Venom Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  Late last year, Insomniac was targeted by hackers who released the studio's upcoming slate of currently unannounced releases. Among them was a Venom standalone game tentatively titled
  <em>
   Venom: Lethal Protector
  </em>
  . Knull would be much more at home in a game about Venom, as the character was conceived for Venom's own comics. Knull would have to be the main villain, coming to Earth to set his agenda back on course after his previous symbiote invasion was foiled in
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Fans who played the last game may balk at the idea and say that Carnage is the obvious contender for a Venom game after The Flame cult questline in
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  . But Carnage was an acolyte of Knull during
  <em>
   The King in Black
  </em>
  in the comics and the years-long build up to it. With Cletus already a cult figure in the Flame missions, Carnage acting as a general in Knull’s invasion force would work wonders narratively, allowing for two of Venom’s greatest foes to feature in the character’s anticipated standalone game.

 <p>
  If Insomniac elects to forgo Knull in the Venom game, however, it’s probably best to let sleeping gods lie. The character commands too much narrative attention and too much build-up to waste any precious screen time in
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  on him when the game already has such a long to-do list. Fans have been waiting to see the end of some of these stories since the first game back in 2018. It would be downright criminal to neglect any of them in order to hype up a newly-introduced threat like Knull.

 <p>
  The core idea of a live-service game is to keep players engaged by throwing new content their way over time.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Helldivers 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , while enjoying a massive launch a few months back, is now seeing its player count dwindle because of a lack of new content. Those who have been playing since launch are now burned out because of grinding the same missions.

 <p>
  Hence, developer Arrowhead Game Studios has decided to spend more time on the monthly warbonds to make their content meaningful. This starts with the Viper Commandos Warbond, which clearly takes a lot of ideas from the 1987
  <em>
   Predator
  </em>
  film with its macho-masculine jungle camo outfits. The new thematic approach is interesting because it opens up new doors for crossovers with other games. There are several critically acclaimed science-fiction hits out there, and it would be a wonder if
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  manages to bring in its weapons, armor, etc.

 <p>
  With the
  <em>
   Killzone
  </em>
  franchise shelved for the past decade, the best Sony Interactive Entertainment can do is consider green-lighting a crossover with
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . The Helghast, in particular, would fit right into the setting. Forcefully relocated for refusing to live under the ISA rule, the
  <em>
   Killzone
  </em>
  games taught a crucial lesson: not every person fighting for freedom is a terrorist. On that note, it would only be natural for some people on Super Earth to stop listening to the Ministry of Truth. It is all propaganda anyway.

  The Helghast have some of the most iconic armor designs in history: ranging from the trench coat and gas mask in the early installments to the technologically advanced gear in the latter games.

  The Automatons were originally created by the Cyborgs from the first
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  game as the next step in their evolution. They are entirely mechanical beings that no longer require human volunteers to manipulate their bodies with machines and technology. They are still based on humans, which begs the question of why the bot fabricators in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  cannot terraform other living beings such as the Terminids to create beast-like robots. If the Automatons were to do that, it would be a great opportunity for the Sony-owned
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  franchise to do a major crossover in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Some Terminid enemies are already featured as machines in the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  games, and that too, with the same names. The Stalker, for example, can turn completely invisible before attacking. There is also the Charger which can ram its targets at high speeds. There are several more machines from the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  bestiary that can cross over. The Ravager, for one, would be an excellent addition. Equipped for ranged and melee combat thanks to its mounted guns and sharp claws, imagine an Automaton robot beast charging you on all fours.

  It is hard to talk about potential science-fiction crossovers without mentioning the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  franchise. Featuring a range of iconic weapons and armor with unique passives, there is a lot of potential here to make fans happy in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . With an all-new
  <em>
   Mass Effect 4
  </em>
  in the works, it would perhaps be an opportunity to bring back Commander Shephard to take command in the ongoing galactic war for survival.

 <p>
  It would also be worth pointing out that the Reapers from the
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  trilogy bear some similarities to the rumored Illuminate faction in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . Both are highly advanced aliens stranded in another dimension, looking for a way back. The Ministry of Science could even utilize Illuminate technology to give players a form of biotic implants to create shield barriers and such.

  What happened to the USG Ishimura will unlikely happen to players' Super Destroyers. The unique killing mechanics of
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  , though, do make for a comfortable crossover in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . Targeting limbs is one of the many ways to beat most enemies like the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="658892" style="color: #9242ff; display: inline-block;">
   <img loading="lazy" src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/05/helldivers-2-brood-commander-2-3.png"/>

  and the

   Devastator
  </span>
  . Including new enemies inspired by
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  that encourage players to target specific limbs, not just rain bullets, would certainly freshen up the
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  bestiary.

  In addition, the iconic Plasma Cutter from
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  needs to make an appearance in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . The energy-based mining tool fires precision shots that slice through light enemies. Considering the existence of mining colonies in the
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  lore, it reasons that they are using something similar to extract minerals. Furthermore, any of the various RIGs worn by Isaac Clarke would be a welcome addition to the armory. That as well as the latter weapons such as the pulse and plasma rifles.

  With the ongoing galactic war that has taken the lives of thousands of fellow divers, no one but the Doom Slayer would qualify as the perfect one-man army to defend Super Earth. The main protagonist of the
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  franchise has traveled through hellish dimensions and back multiple times to lay waste to their nightmarish armies. His disdain for demonic invasions would greatly help fend off both the Automaton and Terminid factions.

  What also makes the Doom Slayer a perfect crossover for

  games, and where the training facilities are located to train new divers in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . Not to mention that his iconic shotgun and Praetor Suit would be a breath of fresh air in the armory. The

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077: Why Project Orion Needs to Take the Corpo Lifepath Even Further</title>

  , despite its infamously messy launch, has shaped up to become a rather impressive and enjoyable action-RPG. The game certainly leans more into the "action" side of its identity, with its RPG elements, at least narratively, being somewhat restrictive. This balance between role-playing and open-world adventure game works well for
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  , but its sequel,
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  , should aim to improve across both vectors.

  When it comes to
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's RPG shortcomings, few features are more discussed than character backgrounds, called "lifepaths" in-game. Players can choose from three different backgrounds, Corpo, Street Kid, and Nomad, and this decision will determine the prologue of the game, along with some occasional bits of background-exclusive dialog and short side quests. Many players feel that this feature, which was heavily touted by CD Projekt Red during
  <em>
   Cyberpunk
  </em>
  's marketing, doesn't live up to its full potential, as V's story ultimately plays out the same way regardless of which lifepath is chosen. Likewise, lifepath decision offers little in the way of unique gameplay content or strong replay value.

  The Corpo Lifepath May Be Cyberpunk's Most Interesting
 </h3>
 <p>
  While lifepaths don't impact
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's ending or the main story in any meaningful way, they are great for developing headcanons, as they foster unique perspectives on the game's narrative. For instance, the Nomad lifepath adds additional context to narrative beats concerning the Aldecaldos and Panam's romance subplot, even when it's not being explicitly referenced. Another example: V's transformation into a Night City Legend may feel more gratifying under the Street Kid lifepath, as the transformation from scrappy, street-wise youth is a bit more natural.

 <p>
  But the Corpo lifepath offers the most dramatic narrative contrasts. It can be satisfying to watch V's transformation from Corpo lackey to rung-climbing gangster, but this dichotomy can also feel a bit forced. V's immediate rejection of their white-collar, cutthroat corporate background in favor of a life as a low-level criminal makes for interesting storytelling, but the fact that this transformation is forced in the early moments of the game, rather than being just one possible plot direction, negatively impacts player agency. This is something
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  can address.

     It's considerably easier to believe that Street Kid V or Nomad V would strive to be a tough-as-nails Night City merc, so the fact that players are railroaded across this narrative arc is less of an issue under these lifepaths.

There are no 'good Corpos' and 'bad Corpos'—every corporation is ethically compromised, and those who serve them are complicit in their evil deeds, no matter how decent they may be in their daily life. All this is to say that, in the

  Perhaps a character who kicks off their game as a Corpo can continue serving corporate interests in exchange for certain rewards, monetary or otherwise.

  Friday, October 11 is an especially busy day for anime fans thanks to new video games, new series, and a movie premiere. Anime and video games have gone hand-in-hand for decades, with all kinds of video games based on anime released over the years, as well as games that take direct inspiration from anime and vice versa.

 <p>
  Typically, big new anime-adjacent releases are spread throughout the year, but there are rare occasions when the stars align and they all release on the same day. October 11 is one such day that anime fans are going to need to keep an eye on, as it is absolutely stuffed with major new releases.

 <p>
  October 11 will see the official launch of fighting game
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  , as well as the debut of the new anime
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  . That same day,
  <em>
   My Hero Academia: You're Next
  </em>
  makes its debut in US theaters. On top of all that,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  , the critically-acclaimed new RPG, is also releasing that day. Clearly, October 11 is going to be an incredibly busy day for anime fans, and they should have absolutely no shortage of things to do this weekend.

  <em>
   Dragon Ball

  fans especially have a lot to look forward to on October 11.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  premieres that day, giving fans the chance to see one last
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  story that was made with the involvement of legendary creator Akira Toriyama, who tragically passed away earlier this year. For those unfamiliar with the new series,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Daima
  </em>
  will see Goku and friends transformed into kid versions of themselves. They then set out on a brand-new adventure that will serve as a throwback of sorts to the original
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  series as opposed to
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z
  </em>
  . It will be great to see
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  get back to its roots, so fans should be sure to mark their calendars for October 11.

  When

  fans are done watching

  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero

  features a stacked roster, online multiplayer, an extensive story mode, and more. Early access players have praised just about everything that the game has to offer, and it's likely that its full release will be met with similar fanfare.
  <em>
   Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero
  </em>
  is already a big hit, and it should only become more popular come October 11.

  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is not based on an existing anime property, but it will still greatly appeal to fans of the medium. The latest RPG from Studios Zero at Atlus,
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  is a medieval fantasy game that features a blend of mechanics from past Atlus games. The game has earned widespread critical acclaim, with
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  standing tall as one of 2024's highest-rated games to date. There's been a great deal of praise for
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  's story, art style, combat system, and the sheer amount of content it has on offer.
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  has been called one of the best RPGs in years. Clearly, it will appeal to gamers, but it will also be something that anime fans will want to check out.

 <p>
  Like other games from Atlus,
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  's art style mimics anime. It's basically an anime come to life, giving players the chance to have control over an anime series. The game boasts a cel-shaded art style that allows the developers to keep the anime aesthetic during gameplay, along with anime cutscenes. So, while
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  may not be a literal anime, it's still something that anime fans are going to want to set aside time to check out come its release date on October 11.

  And this doesn't even take into account the full scope of all the new things anime fans have to look forward to on October 11. For example, the second episode of the
  <em>
   Dandadan
  </em>
  anime series is airing on October 11, and based on the franchise's reception so far, it certainly has what it takes to be one of the next big things in the space.

      <title>Why a Starfield-Like Fallout Game Isn’t Out of the Realm of Possibility</title>

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout
   </em>
  </strong>
  games have explored different areas of a post-nuclear America, but each entry has at least revolved around a wasteland one way or another. With each new
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  game, getting to see what wasteland awaits is a big part of the fun. However, the franchise may be running out of options to continue this franchise trend.

  The most recent game in the series,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , focuses on the Appalachian region of the country, which is one of the most unique settings yet. From the New California Republic to the Commonwealth, each setting in
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  has helped build upon the lore even further. There's no telling when
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  will come out at this point, but Bethesda will have to present a fresh wasteland that stands out from the others, which is easier said than done. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Starfield'
  </em>
  s procedural generation could not only help this problem, but it could expand the map beyond what has been attempted before.

  <em>

  's procedural generation may not be a perfect way to bring over 1,000 planets to life, but it has a lot of potential if its parameters are made more specific. Although each wasteland in
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  has had its own unique qualities, there are only so many versions of a wasteland Bethesda can explore before having to recycle them. The franchise has covered nearly every type of landscape found in America. Returning to a similar region is possible, but going even bigger and featuring a procedurally generated version of America that is completely open to explore could be exciting.

 <p>
  Instead of focusing on one central location, the next
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  could make exploration and aimless wandering a key component in its next game. The only issue is that Bethesda will need to learn from its mistakes with
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  . At launch, one of the main criticisms of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  was that the game's planets felt lifeless and lacked content. Although these planets are likely more lifelike representations of what uninhabited planets could be, getting to travel to earth and see old landmarks would have been thrilling. If Bethesda wants to make the procedural generation truly work, retrying with
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  and making a point to focus on landmarks and more unique terrain and visuals would be needed.

 <p>
  The vastness of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  is compelling, and taking this approach with the wastelands of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  could be an intriguing step in a new direction. Of course, there would need to be more hand-crafted colonies sprinkled throughout America, but getting to travel between each one could bring the franchise to the next level. The next
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  is a mystery, but it would be surprising if Bethesda didn't use some of the same tricks as
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  for its development.

 <p>
  The wastelands of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  are just as much of a main character as the Vault Dwellers or the Courier. However, one expansive map that allowed for ultimate exploration could bring an even more epic story to the forefront. If the next
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  wants to stand out, then there will need to be some big moves made.
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  did this well with its region and dive into multiplayer, so it will be intriguing to see if Bethesda tries to pivot in a drastic new direction once again.

 <p>
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  may not use procedural generation, but it could need to be at least considered down the road. As of now,
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  could still explore a wasteland version of the Everglades or deep in the Midwest. There are still options available, but Bethesda may need to go bigger in order to impress audiences.

 <p>
  From beds to tables to trampolines to Moblins to Keese to Lynel, there's a boatload of
  <strong>
   Echoes
  </strong>
  for Zelda to learn throughout her journey to save Link (and Hyrule) from the treacherous Rifts in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  . These Echoes can support Zelda, helping her traverse and also assisting in taking care of the bad guys. If you want to collect all 127 Echoes, this guide will surely help you out.

  Down below, we have a table that lists all
  <strong>
   Echo locations in
   <em>
    Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  . We'll give a brief description of where to find the specific Echo.

  Activision recently gave fans a deep dive into the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  single-player campaign. The first part of this blog was revealed on October 8, when Activision provided an overview of the story leading up to
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  . One of the most interesting details found in the blog post is that players will receive a variety of multiplayer and Zombies rewards for completing the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  campaign, including blueprints, skins, and more.

  The blueprints include the "Case Cracker" for the Knife, “Truth Serum” for the Ames 85, “Pocket Aces” for the Jackal PDW, “Onyx Echo” for the LR 7.62, and “The Bastion” for the Marine SP. Of these
  <em>

  </em>
  weapon blueprints, fans seem particularly fond of the LR 7.62 sniper rifle blueprint, along with the Ames 85. Players can also unlock the Heist Operator and “A Good Look at the Devil” loading screen wallpaper. The “Hook, Line, and Sinker” finishing move and “Slip Sauce” spray also appear quite appealing to many fans of the franchise.

  For players looking to add some bling to their weapons, the “Tank” and "The Cradle" charms will prove to be an excellent addition. Fans can further customize their weapons with the “Allied Effort” and “Forging Fate” vinyls. There are also additional challenges that players can complete to earn Calling Cards, although the specific details about unlocking them have been kept under wraps. Overall, the rewards are proving to be quite enticing to many fans and make a compelling case for why players will want to dive into
  <em>

  's single-player campaign mode.

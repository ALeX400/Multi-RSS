  The Crystal Treasures event is in full swing in Scopely’s
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monopoly GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  and is offering many awesome rewards. It gives players a chance to win up to 2,500 dice rolls, cash prizes, and a Five-Star Sticker Pack. Along the way, players can also unlock a brand new Crystal Crest Shield and a Twinkle Tail Token as they reach different milestones.

  Just like other Treasures Events, you’ll need Pickaxe Tokens to take part in the minigame. With these tokens, you dig for crystal-themed items from the grid and unlock milestone rewards. For those wondering what happens to any leftover Pickaxe Tokens after the Crystal Treasures event ends, this guide will explain it all.

  The Crystal Treasures event runs from October 2 to October 6 in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  .
  <strong>
   When this Dig event ends, any leftover Pickaxe Tokens you have will be converted into dice rolls at the ratio of 3:1. This means that for every single Hammer token, tycoons will get three dice rolls.

 <p>
  For example, if you have 30 unused Pickaxe Tokens at the end of the Crystal Treasures event, you’ll get 90 dice rolls. This token conversation system is a nice way to make use of your extra tokens.

 <p>
  After your tokens are turned into dice rolls, you can use them to move around the board and take part in ongoing events and tournaments. Furthermore, the cash you earn from Shutdowns or Bank Heists can also help you upgrade landmarks and level up. So getting dice rolls for leftover tokens is a really good deal.

  The Crystal Treasures event is packed with many goodies, but to claim all of them, you’ll need a good amount of Pickaxe Tokens. Players can get these tokens by completing the Quick Wins. These are pretty simple tasks and you get three of them daily.

 <p>
  Another great way to collect Pickaxe (or Hammer) Tokens is by participating in solo events and tournaments. Right now, the Follow the Fortunes solo event is live, which will give you
  <strong>
   186 Hammers
  </strong>
  . Lastly, tycoons can get more Pickaxes from the Free Gift section in the game shop.

 <p>
  The Crystal Treasures event has 20 levels, and fans will need a lot of tokens to complete each one. If you manage to finish all the levels, you’ll get around 5,000 dice rolls, premium sticker packs, and a cool board token and shield.

      <title>If Any Franchise Can Shake Sony’s Live-Service Slump, It's Horizon</title>

  The next game in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise will be a live-service multiplayer entry, further emphasizing Sony's ambitions of pushing this game model. This year has been a tough one for Sony, but the upcoming
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  multiplayer title may be the key needed to help Sony achieve its goals. Sony has been hoping for live service to be the next step in the company's evolution. However, the company has struggled to get this new era off the ground. A multiplayer version of
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  was shockingly canceled at the end of last year, but 2024 in particular has been especially hard.

  The failure of
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  has potentially thrown a huge wrench into Sony's live-service plans, as it has been reported that it was viewed as the future of the company.
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  's peak player count was an abysmal 697, leading developer Firewalk Studios to take the game offline after only two weeks. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has claimed that Guerrilla Games' next project scheduled is
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  's multiplayer spin-off. It's possible that Sony is now wary of the project, but
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  may have the right ingredients to become Sony's biggest live-service hit.

  A Unique World That Has Something Special to Offer

 <p>
  When it comes to multiplayer games, there is a lot of saturation that keeps many titles from standing out in the crowd. For
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  , the hero shooter genre has been long-established and has been free-to-play, so it already arguably had multiple factors working against it. There wasn't really any particularly unique detail that inspired a lot of gamers to play it, but the multiplayer
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  game may be a completely different story thanks to its unique, established world.

 <p>
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  has the major benefit of bringing one of the most unique gaming worlds to life in recent years. With the recent announcement of
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  getting a PS5 remaster, Guerrilla Games' fascinating post-apocalyptic setting will be shown in a fresh light. The prospect of getting to see an AI-ravaged America in a multiplayer experience is going to be the game's biggest selling point. Seeing this world in a single-player narrative is compelling enough, but getting to enjoy it with friends seems to be a recipe for success.

  As the wait continues for
  <em>

  's mysterious multiplayer game, it will be exciting to see more information come to light.
  <em>
   Horizon

  's upcoming spin-offs are further proof that the series has a lot to offer, and Sony may have been hoping for
  <em>

  to be the company's future. Now, it looks like this future may have been
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  all along.

  PlayStation fans can now pre-order the Chroma Collection of
  <strong>
   PS5
  </strong>
  accessories. Announced fairly recently at the September 2024 State of Play, the Chroma Collection introduces three new colorways for PS5 console covers and DualSense controllers.

 <p>
  Sony has continually introduced new color variants for the PS5 and its accessories since the console launched in late 2020. Excluding limited editions, the DualSense controller and PS5 console covers have received 12 colorways so far, ensuring that there's something appealing for nearly every player. September 2024 in particular was big for new PS5 accessory color schemes, as Sony announced both the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection and the Chroma Collection last month.

 <p>
  The nostalgic PS1-inspired 30th Anniversary Collection received quite a lot of attention, somewhat overshadowing the rather fetching Chroma Collection for PS5 console covers and controllers. The Chroma Collection brings with it three iridescent colors, namely Chroma Teal, Chroma Indigo, and Chroma Pearl, and interested buyers can now pre-order them. The Chroma PS5 console covers are exclusive to PlayStation Direct, whereas the Chroma DualSense controllers can also be pre-ordered at certain third-party retailers.

 <p>
  As far as prices go, the Chroma Collection falls in line with the PS5's Deep Earth Collection that was launched late last year. Chroma DualSense controllers cost $79.99 apiece, a $5 bump over the standard DualSense and its matte color variations. Meanwhile, the Chroma PS5 console covers are listed for $64.99, which is $10 more expensive than the matte console cover colors. Prospective buyers should also note that the Chroma Collection's release is staggered; the Chroma Pearl and Chroma Indigo accessories will launch on
  <strong>
   November 7
  </strong>
  , whereas the Chroma Teal lineup releases
  <strong>
   January 23, 2025
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  This staggered release pattern was also employed for the Deep Earth Collection last year, where the Sterling Silver colorway launched two months after the other variations. It might be a case of gauging consumer reactions whenever new PS5 accessory colors are unveiled, and then delaying the more favorable choice to allow the others more breathing room at launch. Regardless of the potential internal reasoning, Sony is definitely charging a slight premium for the iridescent sheen of the Chroma Collection colors, but some prospective buyers will likely find them eye-catching enough for the investment.

  Fans have been overlaying
  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </strong>
  </em>
  's map with
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  's own map, making some surprising discoveries about how the two games manage to "link up" for meaningful lore connections.
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is the latest installment in Nintendo's long-running franchise, bucking the trend by making Princess Zelda the main playable character as opposed to Link.

  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  plays like many previous top-down
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games, such as
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Minish Cap
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  in particular was the first game to establish this gameplay style for the franchise, which would be carried over into future games, including
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  . As fans have been playing the game, many have discovered that not only do the two games share the same gameplay style, but they also have essentially the same map, with
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  building upon what was shown in
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  .

  Some posts on Twitter from fans and IGN have been comparing the two maps. Observations were made that noted a number of major landmarks from
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  's map can be found in
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , though they have been ravaged by the passage of time or have been changed to something else. On top of that,
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  has a number of areas that exist outside
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  's playable area, giving some implications about how civilizations like the Gerudo and Goron were just outside the boundary but have always existed within the world.

  IGN's Tom Marks agreed with the fans' assessment of the parallel maps, noting that the landmarks around
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's Hyrule Castle should be familiar to longtime
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans. Some spots include the graveyard, church, and even Link's house from
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  , even if
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  's Link lives in Suthorn Village. Another familiar area that has been changed from
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is Kakariko Village, where there are now ruins, implying the village was moved at some point in between games.

  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  isn't the only game to use a variant of
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  's overworld map, considering how
  <em>
   A Link Between Worlds

  on the 3DS did the same, albeit that was due to it being a sequel to
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  . While some lore-minded
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans are theorizing where
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  fits in the timeline, others were excited to discover all the Easter Eggs and references that Grezzo included.

	<em>
	 <strong>
		Animal Well
	 </strong>
	</em>
	, the recently released Metroidvania that has managed to capture the hearts of critics and gamers alike, has reportedly become one of the most successful games on PlayStation Plus Extra in 2024. The game was published by Bigmode, the independent company started by YouTuber Jason Gastrow, more popularly known as videogamedunkey.

	Developed by Shared Memory, a one-man studio based in Chicago,
	<em>
	 Animal Well
	</em>
	is a nonlinear 2D puzzle platformer that lets players take control of a blob who explores a labyrinth filled with dangerous creatures. The game launched on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5 on May 9, and it has since received universal acclaim for its captivating visuals, as well as its large amount of content.
	<em>
	 Animal Well
	</em>
	also received a day one release on PS Plus Extra, the paid subscription plan that gives members access to a large catalog of PS4 and PS5 games.

	This decision to offer the debut title of Shared Memory on PlayStation's game subscription service seems to have paid off, as
	<em>
	 Animal Well
	</em>
	has become the fifth-biggest game on PS Plus Extra in 2024, TrueTrophies reported, citing data gathered with the help of GameInsights. It was only beaten by
	<em>
	 Dave the Diver
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Need for Speed Unbound
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Marvel's Midnight Suns
	</em>
	, and
	<em>
	 Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
	</em>
	, which took the first, second, third, and fourth spots, respectively. A critically acclaimed title just like
	<em>
	 Animal Well
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 Dave the Diver
	</em>
	was released on the PS5 in April, and it was also available to PS Plus Extra subscribers at launch.

			<title>Wuthering Waves: How to Get More Shell Credits</title>

	Shell Credits are the universal currency in

	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves

	, used for all upgrades and shopping needs. While they may seem abundant initially, players soon realize that each upgrade, level-up, and ascension demands substantial sums of money. As a result, players often feel the need to start farming Shell Credits. To assist with this, the following guide lists multiple money-farming methods and teaches players how to exchange their unwanted resources for Shell Credits.

	The ideal method for farming Shell Credits is to complete the challenges in the Simulation Training. Starting with Skill Training is an excellent approach, as it offers 55,000 Shell Credits for basic objectives.

	Forgery Challenges are time-restricted battles with Echoes that reward participants with Shell Credits. Although repeating these objectives is unprofitable as the money prize is exclusive to the first clearance, Forgery Challenges remain a quick way of collecting hundreds of thousands of Shell Credits in a few minutes, especially if the player has already assembled a META team.

 <p>
	Insomniac set a new bar for Marvel video games back in 2018 with the release of
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Marvel's Spider-Man
	 </strong>
	</em>
	. Just like
	<em>
	 Batman: Arkham
	</em>
	before it,
	<em>
	 Marvel's Spider-Man
	</em>
	managed to capture the essence of a much larger universe while technically remaining quite small in scope. Through the use of Easter eggs, collectibles, and in-game dialogue, Insomniac not only hinted at this Spider-Man's extensive backstory, but paved the way for future connections to its wider Marvel universe.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":484} -->
 <p>
	With three games now under its belt, many fans expected Insomniac's
	<em>
	 Spider-Man
	</em>
	series to include a few more connections to the rest of the Marvel universe by now. But any connections between Spider-Man and the Defenders, the Avengers, and any other Marvel supergroup have remained pretty surface-level. And while a Spider-Man game should focus first and foremost on its titular hero/heroes, Insomniac's reluctance to connect its Marvel universe is something that EA Motive's Iron Man game can't repeat.

	Insomniac's Spider-Man Has Managed to Avoid The Avengers
 </h3>
 <p>
	The first
	<em>
	 Marvel's Spider-Man
	</em>
	does a great job of telling a larger-scale Spider-Man story, while at the same time hinting that there are more Marvel heroes and villains out there. But a key element of this first
	<em>
	 Spider-Man
	</em>
	game was that its threats felt like something Spidey could handle mostly on his own. When the Sinister Six break out of the Raft, it isn't too unbelievable that Spider-Man would be left to round them all up by himself, even if it's confirmed that the Avengers, the Defenders, and Doctor Strange exist in this universe, and potentially live just down the block.

 <p>
	The same can be said for
	<em>
	 Spider-Man: Miles Morales
	</em>
	. Though Roxxon and the Tinkerer's army of Underground soldiers pose a solid threat, it's not one that warrants an immediate response from the rest of Earth-1048's heroes. However, the same can't be said for
	<em>
	 Marvel's Spider-Man 2
	</em>
	. Though Kraven the Hunter wreaks havoc on the streets of New York, it isn't anything two Spider-Men can't handle. But when Venom shows up and starts infecting the entirety of Manhattan and its surrounding boroughs, it feels a little odd that no other heroes come to the Spider-Men's aid.

	EA Motive's Iron Man Can't Easily Avoid The Rest of the Marvel Universe
 </h3>
 <p>
	For better or for worse, EA Motive's Iron Man game can't really follow in
	<em>
	 Spider-Man
	</em>
	's footsteps when it comes to avoiding the rest of its own Marvel universe. Though Iron Man will often head out on solo missions around the world, his character is inherently more connected to a good portion of the Marvel roster, depending on when this game takes place.

 <p>
	For instance, if EA's Iron Man game is primarily an origin story or set in the early days of Tony Stark's superhero career, then it would be safe to assume that he hasn't made many connections with other Marvel heroes, and thus probably wouldn't turn to them immediately when posed with a new threat. However, if EA's Iron Man game begins with the hero at the height of his career, then many fans would expect him to have the Avengers on speed dial. Both of these approaches have their pros and cons. If EA Motive chooses the former approach, then it could end up feeling a bit too similar to the MCU's version of Iron Man, but the latter approach could lead to cameos that end up overshadowing the lead.

	The Sims 4 Riviera Retreat Kit Promises 'Natural Serenity'
 </h2>
 <p>
	That pair of add-ons has now been officially announced in the form of the Cozy Bistro and Riviera Retreat Kits. The latter promises to provide players with the tools they need to "achieve natural serenity" by building everything from classy fountains to luxurious pools. New stucco wall textures and waterfalls will also be part of the package, together with archways meant to help players put the finishing touches on their countryside oasis. Aside from introducing more options for building pools in
	<em>
	 The Sims 4
	</em>
	, including at least one new style of copings, the Riviera Retreat Kit will also feature new types of lounge chairs, linen furniture, and even pergolas, among other novelties.

	The Sims 4 Cozy Bistro Kit Is Just What It Sounds Like
 </h2>
 <p>
	Meanwhile,
	<em>
	 The Sims 4
	</em>
	players wanting to up their restaurant game will be able to do just that with the Cozy Bistro Kit. Like its name suggests, this DLC pack will focus on helping players build and explore charming eateries, complete with all the amenities one would expect to find in such places. Based on the promotional screenshots that Maxis and EA have shared so far, it would appear that a lot of the included furniture, architecture, and decorations will be inspired by the so-called old world style based on design conventions originating from the 16th- and 17th-century Europe, i.e., its late Renaissance and early modernity periods.

	The newly unveiled DLC duo will raise the number of
	<em>
	 The Sims 4
	</em>
	kits up to 31. While no official pricing information has yet been revealed, EA's track record with the game's building kits indicates that the upcoming add-ons will likely be priced at $4.99 a piece. In order to help fans brainstorm building and furnishing ideas, Maxis will also be releasing two example destinations illustrating some of the potential applications of the upcoming kits. Called The Cozy Bistro and Riviera Retreat Poolhouse, both destinations will be available for download from The Gallery as soon as their accompanying kits drop on May 30.

	Today's announcement arrives shortly after EA and Maxis committed to doing a better job at polishing the game moving forward. To that end, Maxis formed an internal team dedicated to
	<em>

	bug fixes and performance improvements. The task force is estimated to begin addressing the current batch of known issues with the game in the second half of 2024.

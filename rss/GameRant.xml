  </strong>
  has finally arrived, bringing with it the bones of Atlus'
  <em>

  <em>

  from

  Atlus'
  <em>

  , functioning similarly to how they always have. Fans of the

  Metaphor: ReFantazio's Ambush Mechanics Can Be Highly Rewarding
 </h3>
 <p>
  The best thing about
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  's ambush mechanics is how undeniably rewarding they can be. If players fill an enemy's stun meter by attacking them in the wild first, the enemies that spawn will be stunned for at least an entire round of turns. Ultimately, this means players can potentially exhaust two rounds of turn icons before their enemies even have a chance to attack. With how difficult
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  's combat can be at times, this means it's often imperative that players get that ambush advantage and benefit from those free attacks.

  What truly makes ambushing enemies in
  <em>

  such a desirable and strategic choice is the "Unscathed Triumph" feature, which awards players bonus Exp, Archetype Exp, MAG, and Reeve, the game's currency. If players are able to defeat enemies without ever taking damage in combat, they will obtain the "Unscathed Triumph" bonus at the end of the battle. As such, it can be a vastly rewarding pattern to establish, especially early on in
  <em>

 <p>
  Unfortunately, while the benefits of
  <em>

  's ambush mechanics often provide players with an opportunity to execute a fairly easy win, they are arguably outweighed by some severe disadvantages — and this is especially noticeable in

  's early game and when playing on higher difficulties.
  <em>

 <p>
  Should players get hit by an enemy, they will automatically enter combat in an ambushed state, with the added drawback of a chance to be afflicted by
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  's Anxiety mechanic. In other words, whereas players need to attack enemies enough times to fill up their stun meter before triggering an ambush against their foes, taking just one hit from an enemy results in an ambush against the party. Generally, this would be understandable, considering
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  's combat needs to be balanced and yet challenging. However, getting ambushed by enemies in
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  can quickly lead to either a game-over screen or to a party so wounded that costly MP and consumables must be used to heal them.

 <p>
  A certain point of view might propose that there are moments in
  <em>
   Metaphor: ReFantazio
  </em>
  where it feels as though the game relies too heavily on its ambush mechanics. It does make sense to balance things well when it comes to combat, and that is obviously what
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  is trying to do. It seems to give the enemies the same advantage that the players have over them when triggering an ambush, but
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  's high difficulty might suggest otherwise. Nevertheless, at the very least,
  <em>
   Metaphor
  </em>
  's ambush mechanics have a side to them that is astoundingly rewarding, so perhaps they are more a blessing in disguise.

  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  's successor will soon be upon fans, and breadcrumbs about its true nature continue to leak. Recently, a codename has surfaced for the sequel to the Switch, which might just be the key to finding out what it'll bring to the table.

  With the Switch 2 confirmed to be in development earlier this year, many have been expecting an official reveal to occur sooner rather than later. However, with the Switch nearing its 8th birthday, fans are getting antsy about said reveal. Rumors have been flying over whether the Switch 2's unveiling was postponed, while others are digging up whatever hardware leaks they can muster. Given that the Switch was brought in to rescue Nintendo from the Wii U's failing sales numbers, the company has been stuck in the previous generation for almost 12 years—leaving both fans and analysts curious as to when Nintendo will bite the bullet and move on.

  Despite a seemingly endless development cycle, the Switch 2 is very real and will eventually make its way to the market. Before it does, though, a smorgasbord of leaks have flooded the internet regarding what the console could look like—with everything from a DS-style dual screen to magnetic Joy-Cons being suggested. However, one of the biggest leaks to spill forth about the Switch 2 is its purported codename, 'Ounce'. While Nintendo hasn't spoken out on this codename, its potential for speculation is worth inspecting.

 <h3 id="past-nintendo-codenames-have-had-meaning-but-only-vaguely">
  Past Nintendo Codenames Have Had Meaning, But Only Vaguely
 </h3>
 <p>
  Codenames are typical for Nintendo, and they can give fans a basis for what to expect. A good example of this is the N64, which went under the codename 'Project Reality'. Though some may find this codename to be more fitting for something like the Virtual Boy, as the alias is certainly evocative of virtual reality, it's a good demarcation for the transition into 3D. Though the low-poly graphics of the N64 could hardly be called 'realistic', the breach into a new dimension is certainly a move worth the title.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1029} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  On the other hand, some Nintendo codenames seem totally out of left field. The cult-classic Gamecube system was codenamed 'Dolphin', which sounds rather ill-fitting for a machine that lacks aquatic capabilities. It's possible that 'Dolphin' could refer to
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  ; though not a launch title, its water-related gameplay (as well as the dolphin-nosed inhabitants of Isle Delfino) make this plausible. Nonetheless, this association requires far more mental gymnastics than the N64 to Project Reality.

  'Ounce' Is More Clear Than Other Nintendo Codenames, But Could Be A Red Herring
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Switch 2's 'Ounce' moniker is probably the least vague of any Nintendo codename, as weight is very much an important factor for a likely portable Switch successor. On the other hand, this could still be a misnomer. Just as 'Ounce' implies a special connection to weight, the DS codename 'Nitro' implied power, but the DS has scarcely had the reputation of being an especially powerful console.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":907} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Regardless, weight is certainly relevant to a portable console. Many have expressed the idea of the Switch 2 possibly being a lightweight machine, though the opposite could also be true. 'Ounce' could suggest added weight, which would line up with the demand for a more powerful Nintendo console.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Nintendo has always lagged behind in terms of graphical and processing power, something that's become all the more evident with the Switch's extended lifespan. Many have equated the Switch's hardware to being on par with the Xbox 360, meaning the Switch 2 has its work cut out if it wants to catch up. Therefore, it's more than a tad plausible that 'Ounce' could be referencing a helping of hardware bulk.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Silent Hill 2 Remake
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan has shared their impressive artwork with the IP’s community, showcasing an incredible, fan-art poster made using in-game screenshots. Due to
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  ’s psychological nature, the remake utilizes close-up shots and obscure angles to create a sense of unease and reflection, and the fan-made poster is a perfect representation of the protagonist’s inner turmoil.

 <p>
  Released in October 2024 by Bloober Team and Konami, the remake reimagines the iconic 2001 original game for current-gen consoles, putting protagonist James Sunderland in the spotlight once again while he navigates the misty, titular town in search of his deceased wife. Despite the launch being a huge success, immersing fans in the modernized visuals and gameplay, a game-breaking bug was recently discovered in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  ’s Labyrinth level. Luckily, the development team confirmed they were working on a fix to be released as soon as possible.

  Posted on Reddit by Curious_Robot83, a high-definition, fan-made poster was shared with the
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  community. The poster features a close-up of James’ face, and one of the game’s iconic quotes, "There was a hole here. It's gone now," is layered on the character’s cheek with newspaper clippings faded into the protagonist’s skin. The poster’s invasive zoom is reminiscent of another
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  player’s detailed discovery of Angela’s fingernails, and the creator of the poster explained they were bored at work and decided to create the image using in-game screenshots.

  Fans jumped to show praise for the fan art, and several Redditors thought it looked like an official poster for the game. The community also discussed the real meaning behind the quote used on the poster, since the fandom loves breaking down the game's lore, including the theory behind
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2 Remake
  </em>
  ’s red save squares. Luckily, the creator applied accurate movie poster dimensions to the artwork, allowing it to be printed and framed on the wall. Furthermore, other users thought the poster would make a decent soundtrack cover, and another fan noted the artwork had the vibe of a 2000s gaming magazine.

  A casual city-building sim,

  <strong>
   Microsoft Store

  An interesting
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  survey has revealed which characters on the roster players have pulled for the most.
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

 <p>
  <em>

  ’s five-star characters have a 90-wish pity, meaning a five-star drop is guaranteed within 90 wishes. However, this drop has a 50% chance of featuring a playable unit from the less popular Standard Character Banner. The ongoing double banner features two Geo users, the new Natlan sword user Xilonen and the famous fashion designer Chiori.

  A Reddit user named DistressedButter has shared a chart showing poll results from thousands of
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  fans, revealing who the most pulled character on the roster is. The top spot was taken by the Hydro user Furina, also known as Fontaine’s Archon. This comes as no surprise, considering Furina has been a fan-favorite character since her release in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 4.2. Furina had one of the best story arcs in the game, and she’s also widely considered the best Hydro support in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . The only surprising thing about Furina’s ranking is that she has only had one re-run banner so far.

  Another Archon, Raiden Shogun, took the third spot on the list, which is also somewhat expected since she is an extremely popular character in the
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  community. Like most Archons, Inazuma’s leader can be used in almost any team composition and can fit multiple roles. Players looking to unlock Raiden Shogun’s maximum damage potential should consider acquiring her second constellation.

 <p>
  The fourth and fifth most-pulled characters are also Archons: Nahida and Zhongli. Despite being part of the roster since 2020, Zhongli has remained the best Geo character in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  . His robust kit allows players to create the strongest shield in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  while also dealing significant AoE damage with his Elemental Burst, Planet Befall. Recent rumors have suggested that Zhongli will be featured on a Limited Banner in the upcoming updates.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Yakuza Kiwami
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the best brawlers players can get their hands on, letting them experience Kiryu's journey from a feared Yakuza as he becomes the Chairman of the Dojima Clan himself. It's an impressive journey and one can't help but feel that Kiryu deserves this honor after exhibiting an immense level of strength that makes him one of the most impressive characters in gaming history.

  His repertoire of moves along with bombastic Heat Actions ensure that players can wallop most enemies with ease, but underestimating any encounter can have dire consequences for the Dragon of Dojima if he isn't prepared. Thankfully,
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  is generous with its restoratives, ensuring that Kiryu will always be stocked up no matter what situation comes his way.

  Toughness Z is a handy resource to gain a bit of health when the going gets tough. In the early parts of the game when Kiryu doesn't have a lot of health to spare, this medicine can be crucial in a pinch.

 <p>
  Sure, the usefulness of Toughness Z deteriorates as players progress through the story and unlock Kiryu's abilities, but most players can still load up on this resource and imbibe multiple units of this medicine to bring themselves back to fighting shape in no time.

  The Staminan medicines do a great job of restoring both Health and Heat, making them some of the best restoratives fans can get their hands on in
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  . Even the relatively low-tier versions of this medicine is worth housing for their restorative powers.

 <p>
  Not only can Kiryu restore his health with Staminan X, but he also enjoys a much-needed boost to his Heat, too. This allows players to wallop most enemies to kingdom come and heal up in a single move, which is useful for obvious reasons.

  As players progress in

 <p>
  A single dose of this medicine can bring Kiryu back to fighting shape in no time. If players are struggling against a certain boss, it's recommended to carry a bunch of this medicine to ensure that they aren't pushed against the ropes for too long.

  Restoring Health is fine, but a Heat boost along with this vitality replenishment is something that can help players enjoy a power fantasy for the ages. Such is the case with Staminan XX, an expensive yet welcome restorative item that's a joy to use in battle.

 <p>
  Watching Kiryu come back from a vicious blow with enough Heat to punish anyone who was giving the player a tough time is a treat. It's a decent boost for both Health and Heat, making it a must-have restorative during some of the game's tougher fighting sections.

  When players get their hands on a Toughness Emperor, they are encouraged to stash it for a rainy day. After all, it provides such a massive health boost that using it during a time when Kiryu's health is too low is nothing short of a waste.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, by the time players reach the final third of the game and complete a decent chunk of substories, they should be able to make the most of this restorative. The Toughness Emperor is a trump card that players should ideally save for a rainy day, given how easily it can turn the tide of battle in a flash.

  One of the most beloved restorative items in the entire series, the Staminan Royale is a guaranteed way to reach the Climax Heat Gauge and heal Kiryu up in no time. No matter how hard a battle may seem, players don't have to worry if they have this useful resource handy.

 <p>
  A single use of this restorative is all it takes for players to secure victory in a battle. Not only is their health almost maxed out from critical levels, but they can also unleash powerful Heat Moves against a boss that is getting too overzealous with their attacks.

  One of the rarest restoratives in the game, it's possible to go through the entire game without getting one's hands on a single dose of Toughness Infinity. This is an intentional design choice, given how overpowered this item is.

 <p>
  In a game where Kiryu can access his healing items without breaking a sweat, it's easy to see why the game makes players think twice before using a dose of Toughness Infinity. If players get their hands on this restorative, it's recommended to stash it in the Item Box and never take it out unless they're planning to take on the final fight or the superboss.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s Version 1.3 introduced several new Deviants that you can capture and bring along on your adventures in the The Way of Winter PvE scenario. These Deviants have been carefully categorized into different types, depending on their functions. Among all the Deviants you can catch,
  <strong>
   Ice Pot
  </strong>
  is the only Crafting-type Deviant. It can produce special materials that can be used to craft other Tactical items. If you’re having a hard time finding it, here’s how you can get the Ice Pot Deviant in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  and use its unique abilities.

  You can get the Ice Pot Deviant by
  <strong>
   clearing the Securement Silo - PSI.
  </strong>
  Securement Silo - PSI is a Level 30 area in the Vena Fjord region. You’ll need to fight through hordes of elite Rosetta troops in the collapsed Floeside Salt Mine site.

 <p>
  Interestingly, the Securement Silo - PSI in The Way of Winter is pretty similar to the Silo in the original Manibus PvE event. Once you defeat enemies and reach the deepest part of the securement silo, you’ll be prompted to locate the source of the cold. Soon after, you’ll run into an out-of-control Deviation, the Level 30 Empty House. Defeating this boss in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  will drop the Ice Pot Deviant, which you can then capture easily by going near it.

 <p>
  As a Crafting Deviant, Ice Pot typically stays inside its Securement Unit in your territory. Like all Deviants, Ice Pot’s productivity depends on its mood and Deviant Power. When its Deviant Power is greater than 30, it starts producing
  <strong>
   Sticky Ice Crystals
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  These crystals can be used to craft tactical items and large ice cubes. The ice cubes can then attach to each other to make defenses for your Territory. Be careful though, as approaching these large ice cubes will make you feel Cold.

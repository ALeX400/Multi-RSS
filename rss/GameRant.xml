  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  may be a bit more linear of a game than
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ; but there is still a lot of optional content for players to find, such as the Blood-Starved Beast. Some optional bosses are straightforward sources of Blood Echos, while others give very useful upgrades, such as equipping runes.

  The Blood-Starved Beast is one of the first bosses in the game, and the path to the next major boss may not be very clear. Luckily, there is more than one way forward, along with more optional areas and bosses players can challenge before moving on.

  To progress along the required boss list of Bloodborne, your next target is Vicar Amelia. Head back to the Cathedral Ward lantern, head down the stairs, and take a right. In the next room will be an elevator that takes you to the Healing Church Workshop tower. When approaching the tower, two gunners will shoot from above while one enemy charges at you from the bridge. Instead of entering the tower,
  <strong>
   take the path along the outside to the right until you see the destroyed section

  Drop down to the ledge below and continue forward, looking to the left to enter the lower section of the tower. The next room will be
  <strong>

  After defeating the beast on the bottom floor, head out the back door and follow the street. You'll see a pack of enemies coming from the right side, with the path forward being the elevator they came from. At the top of the elevator will be a ledge overlooking a large gate below.

  From the lever, follow the path to the left to find a large set of stairs. Continue climbing the various sets of stairs forward to find a

 <p>
  While Vicar Amelia is your main goal, there are two other places you can go after the Blood-Starved Beast. From the Cathedra Ward lantern, head out the front gate and immediately turn right and round the side of the building to find a tall enemy with a sack slung over their back. Dying to this enemy in combat will
  <strong>
   trigger a cutscene where you are taken to Yahar'Gul, Unseen Village
  </strong>
  . This area may be a little difficult at your current level, but the rewards will help you be over-prepared for when you return to Vicar Amelia.

 <p>
  Another location you can head to is Hemwick Charnel Lane, which will be much easier to deal with at a lower level. When climbing the stairs to reach Vicar Amelia
  <strong>
   look to the left at the platform before the last set of stairs with the large enemies holding poles
  </strong>
  . Along the path to the left will lead to the back end of the Cathedral and a forested area that leads to Hemwick Charnel Lane, which is where players will need to go to be able to equip runes and get passive bonuses.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a series that continues to remain relevant to this day, with a string of mainline games, spin-offs, and remakes doing a great job of keeping long-time fans satisfied while newcomers can enjoy the series and learn about its legacy. Square Enix may have had its fair share of issues, but there's no denying that the way they've handled the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  IP makes it clear that the series responsible for turning them into a major force in the industry is held in high regard.

 <p>
  Fans of the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series love the dungeons and how imaginative they can be. While there are some by-the-numbers dungeon crawls in these lengthy games, fans love the moments when Square shows off what it's capable of with amazing art design, engaging encounters, interesting puzzles, and unique mechanics that serve as a breath of fresh air in games that can be rather formulaic at times.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 15
   </em>
  </strong>
  may have faced a rough time in development, but fans were glad to see that this game featured a ton of heart despite some aspects of the title being unfinished. Thankfully, the Royal Edition covered up a lot of the game's faults, with players getting further invested in the series after watching the
  <em>
   Kingsglaive
  </em>
  movie and the
  <em>
   Brotherhood
  </em>
  anime. The dungeons in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 15
  </em>
  vary in quality, and one particular hidden dungeon players can access holds the honor of being the most creative and off-beat location players can find in the series.

  Many aspects of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 10
   </strong>
  </em>
  are worthy of praise, with most people arguing that this is where the series peaked. However, the formulaic dungeons in this game were one aspect that some people singled out. Thankfully, fans who love the optional content in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games were treated to one of the best end-game dungeons in the entire series that houses some of the most iconic enemies and allows players to develop their Sphere Grid in no time.

  The Omega Ruins features a wealth of unique side mechanics, some amazing lore that enhances the allure of Spira's world, and two tough encounters that are perfect for players who want to take on some tough foes. Players must be wary of every encounter in the Omega Ruins, with the Great Malboro being particularly fearsome and using its Bad Breath characters to punish players who don't take this dungeon seriously.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 9
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the best games in the series that fans can't get enough of. After the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  games preceding this entry shifted their focus to a futuristic perspective, fans were glad to see
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 9
  </em>
  go back to its charming fantasy routes with some medieval influences scattered along the way. Numerous dungeons in this game deserve their time in the spotlight, but one particular area that stands out is the Iifa Tree, with the events of this dungeon having major ramifications on the plot.

 <p>
  Traversing the roots, trunks, and branches of a massive tree makes for a great time, with the visuals of this dungeon being highly unique. Memoria may be a memorable final dungeon as well, but there's something about traversing the Iifa Tree and taking on Soulcage that makes for one of the best moments in a video game known for its many mesmerizing highlights.

  features one of the most effective tonal shifts in a video game, with the heroes failing to stop Kefka from disturbing the Warring Triad on the Floating Continent. This leads to the entire world being decimated as a beautiful, tranquil world is thrust into a state of ruin. This leads to players gaining control of Celes and gathering all the heroes back together once again, with the Phoenix Cave being one such area that players should ideally explore after accumulating a sizeable party.

  This is because Phoenix Cave is one of the few dungeons in the game where players must split up their party and complete certain puzzles to ensure that both teams can move through the dungeon. Aside from the powerful Red Dragon, this cave houses the Phoenix Magicite and serves as the final stop in Locke's quest to revive Rachel, with the party acquiring the services of this beloved thief not long after.

  Out of all the final dungeons players must traverse in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy

  series, many people consider the eighth mainline entry to have the most fantastical ones of the lot. Ultimecia's Castle is a time-compressed mess that's as unique as can be, with the main group being split into two parties to lend to the epic feel of exploring this area.

  The trek to the final fight against Ultimecia is memorable, with a wealth of challenging bosses standing in the player's way. Not only can players fight against the toughest superboss in the entire game here, but they are rewarded for their grit and determination with one of the most cinematic final clashes in
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  history.

  A talented
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has created a Dr. Eggman skin concept for Wrecking Ball. One of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's tanks, Wrecking Ball, whose real name is Hammond, is a genetically modified hamster with an incredible intellect. Using his cleverness, the character escapes from the Horizon Lunar Colony and travels to Earth with his friend Winston.

 <p>
  Dr. Eggman is a recurring presence in the
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  franchise, with numerous appearances in games and other media such as comics and films, in which Jim Carrey brings the character to life. The main antagonist of Sonic and his friends, Dr. Eggman plans to establish a global empire. To do so, the villain uses means such as transforming animals into robots known as Badniks and building war machines and devices that threaten Earth's security. With a touch of creativity, an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>

  Reddit user Onframer shared a skin concept that imagines Wrecking Ball as Dr. Eggman. Wrecking Ball takes the form of Dr. Eggman with his distinctive red, yellow, and black outfit, round sunglasses, and comical orange mustache. The Wrecking Ball mecha, which he created from an escape pod, has been transformed into a version of Dr. Eggman's spaceship. The spaceship has the same tones as the villain's outfit, with the artist not forgetting to stylize the mecha's hook and cannons. Dr. Eggman's characteristic smile is also emblazoned across the top of the machine.

  This isn't the first time Onframer has attracted attention with their work, having previously turned Juno into Shadow the Hedgehog in a previously shared skin concept. In that fan art, they used clever references such as the Air Shoes and classic golden rings from the Sonic franchise, making for an impressive idea. Another fan art that caught the attention of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players turned Tracer into Sonic the Hedgehog.

  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  has done nothing to hint that it may one day collaborate with the Sonic franchise, but Onframer's fan art has players dreaming of a day where that changes. After all, Blizzard has been increasing its list of collaborations with the shooter since the release of the
  <em>
   One Punch-Man
  </em>
  skins, having more recently held an
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  crossover. With the popularity of the
  <em>

  <em>

  players will likely hold onto hope that one day the two franchises will finally team up.

 <p>
  Many games on the market allow players to build incredible
  <strong>
   bases
  </strong>
  . In some of these, players must optimize the space for everything to run smoothly, while in others, players may opt for massive structures. The essence of base-building games lies in this mechanic, providing players with great freedom of choice. Survival games and management sims are the most common places to find base-building mechanics, but they can appear in any genre.

 <p>
  Some base-building games stand out for their realism among the vast array of options available. This is not only due to immersive graphics, but also their settings and mechanics. These features immerse players into the game's universe, making the experience more engaging and authentic. Thus, it is possible to experience realistic mechanics even in fantastical settings.

  Inspired by the classic 1980s film
  <em>
   Honey, I Shrunk the Kids
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  is a game full of interesting ideas. The realism lies in the setting, where characters are shrunk to the size of insects and must survive in their own backyard, adapting to this new reality.

 <p>
  The developers made creative use of the environment to create resources for players to use in their constructions. For example, instead of wood collected from trees, players must use resources made of grass or weeds, fitting perfectly with the game's premise. This not only makes
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  one of the most realistic base-building games on the market, but also one of the most fun.

  Inspired by Norse mythology,
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  transports players to the tenth Norse realm, where they must prove their worth to the gods by facing monsters that threaten the land. The base-building mechanic is essential for game progression, allowing for the construction of complex 3D structures.

 <p>
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  stands out for its realism in construction, incorporating a physics system that directly influences buildings. Players can erect multi-story buildings, but must be cautious of the structure, as without proper support, the weight can cause collapses. This element requires careful planning, making each completed construction a significant achievement.

  Inspired by games like
  <em>
   Rimworld
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Going Medieval
  </em>
  is about helping a small group of people survive the adversities of the medieval period by building a home where they can protect themselves from the weather and bandit attacks. The title tries to bring more realistic mechanics to players, and succeeds in many aspects.

  Set in a post-calamity world, players must guide survivors and build a secure settlement. With simple 3D tools, it's possible to design everything from wooden huts to stone castles. The multi-level system allows players to create cold chambers in the lower levels to protect food, and it's crucial to build traps and defenses to protect settlers from bandits and barbarians. These little touches do a lot for the game's sense of realism.

  There are various conceptions of base-buildings, and most of the time, players opt to create a single mega-building. However, it is also possible to build separate structures. One example can be seen in
  <em>
   Medieval Dynasty
  </em>
  , where the game's goal is to construct a village that survives through time.

  The game features constructions and settings faithful to the medieval era, although some artistic liberties were taken for player enjoyment. For those who enjoy the mechanics, there are other games in the franchise that take players to different settings, such as feudal Japan.

  <em>
   Bellwright
  </em>
  puts players in the role of a hero unjustly accused, challenging the tyrannical Sovereign and leading a rebellion. In the game, base-building is essential to support the fight for freedom. Characters can construct settlements of varying sizes. It's also possible to create various complex and realistic structures, such as caves or even huge castles.

 <p>
  However, this requires good resource management, as well as base defense, which is crucial in
  <em>
   Bellwright
  </em>
  . Players must organize workers to gather resources, train soldiers to protect the settlements, and develop technologies to improve construction. Here, players have the freedom to create a formidable army or focus on optimizing the base, making the game engaging for genre fans.

  <em>
   Sons of the Forest

  offers an immersive survival experience on a remote island full of cannibals. The game's realism is evident in both its detailed graphics and base-building mechanics. Every element, from lighting fires to constructing complexes, is done with precision.

  The changing seasons add an extra challenge, requiring players to adapt their strategies as the environment changes. The construction mechanics, though detailed and realistic, can be laborious, as many logs are needed to build anything. This makes players work harder on each structure, making multiplayer more satisfying.

  A standard mechanic in many zombie apocalypse games is building bases to rest and store resources.
  <em>
   7 Days to Die
  </em>
  is one such title that aims to provide an authentic experience. The game's physics require extreme care in fortress construction. Something as small as a poorly placed block can compromise the entire structure, leading to collapses that complicate players' plans.

  Additionally, the durability of construction is constantly tested by zombie hordes, requiring strategic planning and appropriate materials. The attention to detail and understanding of the game's physics make

 <p>
  Despite being in early access for years,
  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  has proven to be one of the most incredible zombie apocalypse games on the market. The game may not have stunning graphics, but its mechanics make it one of the most realistic in the genre, forcing players to consider various factors when planning their next moves.

 <p>
  This also includes the game's base-building mechanics. Although not the game's main focus, players will eventually need a place to rest. Therefore, players have access to various tools to reinforce the defenses of one of the game's houses or even build their own base from scratch while keeping the zombies at bay.

  The simplicity of
  <em>
   Dwarf Fortress
  </em>
  ' graphics can hide the complexity of the game's mechanics. Players who want to experience a colony sim with the freedom to build bases should check out this title. Base-building in the game requires detailed attention and planning. For instance, if characters encounter a mountain lake, significant effort will be needed to drain the water without flooding the entire base.

  Realism in

  There are over a hundred weapons to choose from when equipping Wilson’s mecha suit, but only eight can be selected. Each mission in this third-person shooter is filled with numerous enemies with tanks, choppers, and an interactive environment that can take damage.

  Following the commercial success of
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2,
  </em>
  a remastered version was released with support for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which was not considered during the original’s release. It contained all three DLCs which expanded on the already strong story campaign of the game, running at 1080p and 60 fps, which was a huge deal at the time.

 <p>
  The gameplay is as brutal as ever, featuring boss fights with incredibly complex move sequences and the ability to drain a player’s health points in just a few hits. Like the vanilla version,
  <em>
   Scholar of the First Sin
  </em>
  has a somewhat mixed reputation, with its world consistency and repetitive bosses garnering a fair amount of criticism. That said, this is still largely an impressive Soulslike.

  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  was released in 2014 and instantly became a hit, although it garnered some blowback due to incorporating several changes that were not particularly well received. Nowadays, this entry is considered to be FromSoftware's black sheep, at least when it comes to Soulslikes. Still, that does not mean
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  has nothing to offer as the campaign is still packed with intense boss fights, good build variety, and impressive environments.

 <p>
  The health reduction mechanism after each death –which is reversible– punishes sloppy play, making players give it their all to clear the game. Despite being the least-rated entry in the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  trilogy, it is still a really good game.

  Although preceded by
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  was the breakthrough release that properly put FromSoftware on the map and established Soulslikes as a prominent subgenre of action RPGs. The 2011 game has led a not-so-great life on PC, with the
  <em>
   Prepare to Die
  </em>
  edition notoriously requiring a fan-made patch to work properly. When
  <em>
   Dark Souls Remastered
  </em>
  hit the scene in 2018, the previous iteration was removed from Steam, a move that was not particularly received well by the public.

 <p>
  Putting all that stuff to the side,
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  is a landmark title dripping in atmosphere and featuring some of FromSoftware's best level design, particularly during the first half of the campaign. The remaster also comes with the DLC, which adds a couple of great boss fights to a project already overflowing with them.

  FromSoftware’s latest game is mecha-based, and it is the most accessible entry in the
  <em>
   Armored Core
  </em>
  IP, a series that long predates the likes of
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  . It mainly features vehicular combat as players pilot massive mecha suits called Armored Cores. Customization is a huge part of the game, letting players design their mechas to suit different needs, enhancing their abilities and playstyle.

 <p>
  The story campaign is as intriguing as ever, but the online arena mode that pits players against each other is the cream of the crop. Getting rid of the debt system which made players lose money for failed missions was a major improvement over the previous installments in the
  <em>
   Armored Core
  </em>
  franchise.

  FromSoftware's first attempt at an open-world game was a huge success, creating a world with immaculate lore and detail. While the company was a known property by 2022,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  blew all expectations away, becoming a mainstream hit in the process.

 <p>
  The combat system, intriguing bosses, fight difficulty, and customization system are some of the best seen in gaming. However, the bugs in the PC release negatively affected its Steam User Rating, even if it was for a little while, resulting in it being ranked third despite being FromSoftware’s best game.

  Now, there are a couple of reasons behind

  's lower average on Steam; however, the main one is likely its somewhat rough launch on PC. While it will likely vary depending on somebody's setup, the expansion has reportedly shown performance issues on PC. Beyond that, some of the boss fights are more frustrating than fun.

  The lowest-rated FromSoftware release on Steam,
  <em>
   Ashes of Ariandel
  </em>
  is the developer's only game or expansion to have a mixed average, and a fairly low one at that. Although not without its positives, the DLC can be frustrating to play through, especially for newcomers. It is also pretty short, which might be a positive considering its reception. That said, for all its flaws,
  <em>
   Ashes of Ariandel
  </em>
  has a fantastic boss fight against Sister Friede and Father Ariandel, which compares favorably to anything in the base game.

  <em>
   The

  <em>

  plays to
  <em>

  <em>
   The Ringed City

  has four pretty great (and challenging) boss fights, including the epic Slave Knight Gael encounter.

  FromSoftware Inc. decided to make a new Soulslike game without the RPG elements, and
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  was born. It also does away with the character creation and customization part but employs the use of a skill tree, ability, and gear customization to let players determine what complimentary playstyle they would like to incorporate.

  The health points are also not as important in
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  , as the aim of combat is to break your opponent's posture to go in for the killing strike. Stealthy assassinations are also a part of the game, with the aid of the grappling hook and bushes that allow players to move around undetected.

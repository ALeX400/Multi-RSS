  leaks have revealed two new Light Cones that will be obtainable in version 2.5. Over the past few days, many leaks about
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's version 2.5 have surfaced online, with one showing in-game models of Moze and Lingsha. It's rumored that the next update will feature various content, from planar ornaments and characters to bosses.

  Much like previous versions,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's 2.5 will feature various items, including Light Cones and planar ornaments, which players can utilize to empower their characters. These items will likely be added to the game's Simulated Universe mode and limited-time banners. However, there is a small chance that some of them will be event rewards.

  leaks from Dim have revealed two new Light Cones, Scent Alone Stays True and Shadowed By Night, that will reportedly be available in version 2.5. Scent Alone Stays True is a five-star Abundance weapon, which increases the wearer's Break Effect by 60%. It allows the user to enter the Woefree state and gain at least a 10% damage bonus after attacking an enemy with an ultimate. The Light Cone has stunning artwork featuring

  In version 2.5,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  will introduce three new playable banners: Lingsha, Moze, and Feixiao, who have their own unique skills. Lingsha will be a five-star Abundance character that dishes out Fire damage, while Feixiao will tread on the path of Hunt and have the same rarity. Moze, on the other hand, will be a four-star Hunt unit specializing in the Lightning element. His skill set will allegedly offer stealth, temporary boosts, and single-target damage. The update featuring these characters will be released in early September.

  <strong>
   To complete the quest that requires players to defeat a duel character in
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
   , they only need to use the melee weapon or pistol to strike the final blow or shot
  </strong>
  . This means, gamers can use any weapon of their choice and then switch to a melee or pistol once their opponent's health bar is nearly gone.

 <p>
  Both Cerberus and Oscar carry shotguns so keeping a long to medium range is the best way to avoid their attacks. Players can keep their distance while shooting from afar with an Assault Rifle or a Sniper and then come in closer with the Ranger Pistol, the Flint-Knock Pistol, the pickaxe, or the Nitro Fists once they're nearly defeated. Alternatively, fans can still maintain distance and switch to the Hand Cannon, which does impressive damage from afar.

  Enchantments are important modifications players can apply to Heirloom items in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dungeonborne
   </strong>
  </em>
  , and even though they require a lot of grinding to be unlocked, some of them are essential to overcome the higher tier challenges, like the deadly Cyclops or the other monsters of the Corrupted Dungeons.

 <p>
  If players are willing to invest their time salvaging items of various qualities at the Blacksmith, they will be able to unlock these powerful affixes that can power up their Heirloom items consistently, allowing them to grind resources and kill enemies (and players) more effectively. Here are the
  <strong>

    Dungeonborne

 <p>
  The Life Steal Out Of Combat enchantment can be applied to every Heirloom weapon and provides a great way to gain extra sustain as players kill lesser enemies like goblins, scarabs, and bats. Truth be told, since healing sources in
  <em>
   Dungeonborne
  </em>
  are quite scarce, having an extra heal each time the player strikes enemy AI or other players before starting combat can help them gain the upper hand if they are injured or just about to hit max health.
 </p>

 <p>
  Each HP in Dungeonborne is precious, and having less than full health when starting a combat can end up badly for players. Ideally, this enchantment goes well with classes like the Druid, Rogue, Cryomancer, or Pyromancer, with skills that benefit from first strikes out of combat and critical ranged attacks, like in the case of the Rogue's Crossbow.

  When in the middle of combat against higher tier enemy NPCs or against hostile players, Life Steal can make the difference between victory and defeat. Each hit struck will return a percentage of the damage dealt as health instantly. Since most healing methods in
  <em>
   Dungeonborne
  </em>
  take time to become effective (Healing Draughts recover slowly, Bandages have a casting time, and so do Priest spells), Life Steal is one of the most effective methods to recover health as players fight.

 <p>
  But since the most effective classes to deal damage constantly are those suited for close quarters combat, it is preferable that players pick this Enchantment if they are using one of said classes, especially if they're teaming up with range dealers and Priests since they will be required to act as the vanguard. So, Fighters, Rogues, Swordmasters, and Death Knights can greatly benefit from it.

 <p>
  The attack level of a weapon determines how much damage a weapon deals against the defense of the objective. For regular, strong, and boss enemies, this is fixated in tiers, but against players, it gets a little bit more complex. For each attack level above the defense level of a target, players deal 2.5% more damage. For each defense level above the attack level, one's weapon will deal 2.5% less damage.
 </p>

 <p>
  Each enchantment that ignores 1 defense level is equal to 2.5% more damage, but enchantments that add 1 Weapon level are even more useful since they can overcome the weapon level cap, guaranteeing that players will cause more damage even when their rival has top-tiered armor.

  Sometimes, Defense is the best Offense, and in
  <em>
   Dungeonborne
  </em>
  , this becomes annoyingly true, especially for enemies that use shields. Shields can be held in a defensive position almost indefinitely unless a heavy strike breaks the defense, in which case, the higher the value of the attack against the defense of the objective, the more chances it will have to break it.
 </p>

  But thanks to this enchantment, players can cause constant damage to shielding enemies even when they're on full block. Players can combine this with the Tiny Torment Equipment Trait to cause a steady flow of True Damage, which overcomes all resistances and block. It's the best way to counter all those pesky tanks blocking doors and protecting Pyromancers in turret mode.

  Here's another good affix to add to every Heirloom weapons. In this case, it automatically refills a portion of lost HP every time players kill an enemy player or monster. It is a great way to save on precious health potions while one explores the dungeon, and it's an even better healing source than the Heal On Open Chest enchantment. When using classes like the Death Knight or Cryomancer, which can consistently kill enemies in bulk, players don't have to worry about being surrounded by mobs, so its effectiveness in PvE is almost guaranteed.

 <p>
  Contrary to this, it becomes less effective in PvP since it is harder to gain sustain killing players, but, in cases where two or more teams gather in the same place and the player with Life On Kill manages the upper hand, it can quickly turn into a snowball effect that will allow them to keep the fighting even after getting badly hurt in a skirmish. As long as they can keep killing, that is.

 <p>
  The main problem with the squishier classes is that they lack damage mitigation, and every time a Rogue corners them, its game over. With this enchantment, players who enjoy spellcasting classes do not have to worry too much about receiving critical damage since it will mitigate part of the damage directed at them.

 <p>
  As with Attack Levels, Defense levels increase each time a 2.5 % margin stacks on the total armor, and this means that, for each 5% Physical Resistance, players can block one attack level of a physical damage weapon. This, of course, becomes less effective if the enemy player has physical penetration, but it is considerably more effective in PvE, especially against strong monsters like Werewolves, Treants, and Grimm Reapers.

  Ever ran short of attributes to reach the activation conditions of a Perk? Then the solution is the Additional Attribute Enchantment. Players can apply this to most Heirloom Rings, Pendants, and Armor, and they can always be activated in the first slot and combined with other useful Enchantments.

 <p>
  Most of the attributes are useful for each class, but their main attribute perks will be the ones that require the most attribute points to be active, so players should focus on boosting their total score in one of their main attributes to unlock their Tier 2 Perks. In case they already have enough equipment to meet the requirements for their main attributes, then this Enchantment is a great way to fill up their secondary attribute Perk requirements without diverting too much from their original build.

 <p>
  Exploring takes time, and the longer players spend delving into a dungeon, the more likely it is to encounter death, either by the hands of another player, monsters, or getting stuck in the dungeon without an available portal to flee when the Blood Moon rises. So, moving fast is a must for every
  <em>
   Dungeonborne
  </em>
  player, even more so for naturally slow classes like Fighters, Death Knights, and Spellcasters.

 <p>
  The Movement Speed enchantment is a good way to boost exploring speed, even when in combat, which also means players will be able to dodge monster skills and hits with ease. The only downside about this enchantment, is that it is considerably expensive and requires players to level up their Heirlooms to Tier 4 (Purple) to be able to unlock it.

 <p>
  In many RPG-like games where classes have skills, cooldown is one of the things that players need to be constantly aware of. So, having an Enchantment with Cooldown Reduction is a great asset, especially during the end game stages where monsters become more powerful and enemy players are out for blood almost all the time.

 <p>
  When players unlock this enchantment, they'll be able to equip it in Heirloom Armor or Accessories, but it will not be possible to have 3 accessories with this affix applied at the same time. Players can guarantee a 12% cooldown reduction total, which is not so bad considering that most spells and skills have an average of 35 seconds of cooldown. That means that players will be able to cast their spells and skills 4.2 seconds earlier than most other players, and this can really change the tide of a battle.

  Jackbox Games is the developer behind some of the best competitive party games on the market, as its famous
  <em>
   Jackbox Party Packs

  give players access to popular games like Quiplash, Fibbage, and Murder Trivia Party. After many years of providing groups and parties with a fun evening of friendly competition, and after countless fan requests, the developer has finally released its one-stop shop for
  <em>
   Jackbox Party Packs
  </em>
  , the

  The
  <em>
   Jackbox Megapicker
  </em>
  is a free product exclusive to Steam that aims to make the entire
  <em>
   Jackbox Party Pack
  </em>
  experience more simple and seamless than ever before by allowing players to view, sort, filter, and quickly launch their
  <em>
   Jackbox Party Pack
  </em>
  mini-games all from one place. It is a response from Jackbox Games to persistent requests from fans who have longed for an easier way to switch between
  <em>
   Party Packs
  </em>
  and locate all the different games they want to play. Game Rant had the chance to discuss the ins and outs of the
  <em>
   Jackbox Megapicker
  </em>
  with Jackbox Games, joined by engineering director Brad Vah and the vice president of international and business development Andy Kniaz.

  Currently, the
  <em>
   Jackbox Megapicker
  </em>
  has two primary screens — the home screen and the library screen. The home screen provides an overview of information about favorited games and any sales that we may be running, along with a view of past games, recently played, etc. In the near future, we'll be expanding the home screen to show things like recommended games and past game galleries (your previous drawings in Tee K.O. for example).

  utilizes the Steam overlay to directly add it to their Steam shopping cart and use the Steam checkout process. Any title that you do not own in the

  The functionality of the
  <em>
   Megapicker
  </em>
  has been requested by Jackbox players for years, so the first thing we did was listen to our audience. Players wanted an easy way to filter, find, and run games. They didn't want to have to load the
  <em>
   Party Packs
  </em>
  individually to find the game they wanted to play. Players wanted to be able to see their entire game library at a glance and then sort through those games using a variety of filters. This is the core of the
  <em>
   Megapicker
  </em>
  , but it is a live product in its early days, so we've integrated a "Send Feedback" button so people can tell us what they'd like to see more of and what they'd like improved.

      <title>Project Orion Should Take a More Measured Approach than Cyberpunk 2077 with its Cyberware</title>

  After a long period of strife and controversy, CD Projekt Red managed to pull
  <em>
   <strong>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </strong>
  </em>
  out of the muck and polish it to a brilliant shine, fixing most of its most severe bugs, adding major features, and expanding its world with the Phantom Liberty
  <em>
  </em>
  expansion. All of that is to say that
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  has teed up
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  , its currently code-named sequel, for success.

  Where exactly
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  will take the
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  franchise has been the subject of great debate since its announcement. CD Projekt Red's other major RPG series,
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  , can be characterized by enormous evolutions between entries, with each game feeling notably distinct in terms of gameplay, presentation, structure, and core features, so something similar may occur with
  <em>
   Cyberpunk
  </em>
  . Indeed,
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  has every chance to dramatically change several aspects of its predecessor, adding, mutating, or outright removing various key components in the service of making a better overall experience. Cyberware ought to be one of the areas that
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  seeks to change.

  Cyberpunk 2077 Offers a Wide Selection of Cyberware—Maybe too Wide
 </h3>
 <p>
  Many fans are expecting
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  to bolster
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's cyberware system, as it's an important gameplay and role-playing device that can sometimes feel a bit underbaked
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  though not for a lack of options. Despite a sprawling selection of gear across multiple ripperdoc clinics, cyberware in
  <em>
   Cyberpunk
  </em>
  often boils down to basic, incremental stat buffs or other minor perks. For instance, a frontal cortex cyberware component may increase quickhack upload speed by a few percentage points, while an optics replacement can slightly increase critical hit chance.

 <p>
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's best cyberware pieces are the ones that actually impact gameplay from a mechanical, rather than stat-based, perspective. Upgrades like the Mantis Blades, Gorilla Arms, and Reinforced Tendons directly impact how a player interfaces with combat and traversal, making them appropriately significant alterations. Unfortunately, these sorts of upgrades are few and far between, as most of the other cyberware components offer the aforementioned stat buffs which, while often helpful, are not exactly interesting or exciting.

  Project Orion's Cyberware Should Strive for Quality Over Quantity
 </h3>
 <p>
  From a worldbuilding perspective, cybernetic augmentations ought to be significant and all-encompassing; it's a rather invasive process, after all, involving the direct replacement or transformation of body parts. It's a bit odd, then, that
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's cyberware is generally easy to forget about, serving the same purpose as armor in other RPGs, more often than not. When
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  presents players with ripperdocs, it should take care not to lose sight of cyberware's lore context.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":510} -->
 <p>
  A more involved cyberpsychosis feature would be one obvious way to make cyberware more impactful, but reeling in the selection of cyberware parts could help as well. Crucially, whatever pieces of cyberware
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  does include should be more along the lines of Mantis Blades or the Monowire, offering major changes to gameplay that are reflective of the changes made to the protagonist's body. Fewer choices could make this more feasible while having the added benefit of making cyberware more memorable through scarcity. Visits to the ripperdoc could feel less like a routine and more like a significant increase in power or alteration of gameplay.

     Fewer, more impactful cyberware upgrades could bolster

      Project Orion
     </em>
     's character customization as well, letting players fulfill the fantasy of being a totally inhuman, chromed-out Night City denizen.

 <p>
  Of course, the best of both worlds—a bevy of cyberware options that are all equally game-changing—would be ideal, but if
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  has taught audiences anything, it's to not expect too much.
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  may be a great sci-fi game, but it has room for improvement and cyberware has a lot of potential. Hopefully,
  <em>
   Project Orion
  </em>
  will realize it with more meaningful options.

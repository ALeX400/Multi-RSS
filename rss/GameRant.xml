  Following the recent multiplayer reveal event, it seems fair to say that hype for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Battlefield 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  has hit a fever pitch. That's only likely to increase when players get it in their hands, which thanks to its open beta weekends, will happen before
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  's release date.

   Game Rant
  </strong>
  : David, I know you've worked on multiple Battlefield projects, so I just wanted to kickstart things by asking what's been different, what's been special, for Battlefield 6?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sirland: What's been special and different about Battlefield 6 is the different focus areas that we really got to spend time on. We paid attention to core combat, which ended up becoming the kinesthetic combat system, very early. Then, we did Labs pre-launch. Those two together are why you can get the quality levels, stability, and performance that we have in this build. We also had the trust from leadership that this is the right choice, to really start from the crosshairs out, and raise this core quality level.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Game Rant
  </strong>
  : So, starting Battlefield Labs pre-release for the first time. Can you tell me what inspired that decision and how it benefited everything you just mentioned?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sirland: Obviously in the past, with BF4 for example, we had a similar setup but ran on a shoestring budget with a monthly group of random people we could get access to and utilize. Now, Battlefield Studios is like an umbrella organization, and we have enough buffer of people to be able to properly do this over time and really utilize it.
  </p>
  <p>
   When it was after the fact, that really pushed new stuff in terms of quality, fixing issues, and finding the hard ones. That made me really want to do before we shipped the game. Sure, there are downsides. Things are leaking, and if you put something out there, someone will find it. It's basically a matter of time, but the upside of just being able to validate with our players that we're hitting the notes, that this feels like Battlefield, that this is a good game, that it works on these multitudes of computers and internet connections, is worth it. From a team perspective, it teaches us to release things. We basically failed at releasing a couple of times, and we've succeeded at releasing them hundreds of times now already, which helps us when we launch our game. Battlefield has a history of maybe not having the smoothest launch, and I think this is the best way to ensure that we get as far away from that as possible.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Christofi: There's also a validation perspective for us. We feel confident in what we're building, we love what we're building, and just being able to get it in players' hands is a big help. We can be like, "Okay, so the decisions we're making for this thing are right?" People reacting to it the way that we want them to is super important to us, so validation is key.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sirland: There's also the whole feedback loop, right? It's not just what people play and what they say, but it's also what they do. The data they leave behind in a test environment, as well as what they want to talk about after they've played something, whether they like it, hate it, or love it, those things combined help us make choices and validate our designs. It helps us make decisions and accelerate things we were planning, like the closed weapons. We put that in the beta because we got that feedback very strongly: "Hey, where are my closed weapons?" We've always been planning that, but we didn't want to do it before we really focused on the open ones because we also think having closed weapons, to reach the lofty goals of the classes, they need to stand on their own. Closed weapons were always a planned thing, much like hardcore or any other variant, which are fully valid and you get full experience, but we wanted to do that first, right? But feedback made us reprioritize to get it into the open beta. Since we've had such a strong development and have built things the right way, we could do that really quickly.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Game Rant
  </strong>
  : You also mentioned Battlefield Studios and bringing in all these other studios? Can you tell me a little bit about that process and what it means for your day-to-day? How was that worked into production?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Christofi: I may be a good example of this. I work at DICE, but I live in the UK. I live 20 minutes away from Criterion, so I actually work day to day out of that studio. My team is made up of people from Ripple Effect, from DICE, from Criterion, and from Motive. My team is a powerhouse of all those studios, and those studios, in their own rights, are powerhouses. What it meant for us is that we've been able to have almost 24-hour development. We'll do something in the UK time zone, have a meeting with LA, hand off, and continue working on it. It's been great for us to get different perspectives, different ways of working, and having people onboard from the offset. As David said before, we've had support from Criterion in the past, at the end, for example. This time around, we built it from the ground up into this suite of studios that know and love Battlefield, all of whom have different experiences and things that they're good and great at, so it's been great for us to be all able to work together.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sirland: The focus is so much on that core gameplay loop and making sure the classes, the destruction, and the vehicles are all in there and working the way they should. That is something we are not willing to budge on in any shape or form; it also needs to be consistent across any experience, not just multiplayer. That means, given it's basically more depth, being able to do more things with more ways to look at those things is helpful. Our feedback channels from playtests that go on in the EU and North America and all that sort of rotates. It's different and that's good because it also represents the world better. I mean, this is a global game. We're trying to make this a very big Battlefield with lots of players everywhere, and it's clear not everyone likes the same thing.

  <strong>
   Game Rant
  </strong>
  : On that point, can you tell me about the decision to put out Battlefield 6's open beta, no pre-order required, and all of that? Are there any specific areas you're focused on to see how players react?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sirland: This game and the focus on combat are pretty hard to put into a trailer, right? You have to play it. Everyone should play this because, when you play it, you feel it. That's the underlying rationale, I think, to just make it as broad as possible because we know this game is good and you need to play it to get the full picture. Or to feel the full picture, I guess.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Christofi: I would also say we're really proud of this software, and our confidence level in making sure as many people can play it and get a feel for it before we launch is super important to us. We want to put our money where our mouth is, right? We want you guys to see and play and be like, 'Yeah, this is something I want to keep playing.'
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sirland: It's also our largest open beta, demo, or anything we've ever had in terms of content. It's four maps, a bunch of modes, and it's a lot of weapons. It's representative. We're also really stress testing and validating all of these things in a very broad audience. I mean, Labs is still invite-only. There's not a massive number of players, while Open Beta is truly open and very available to everyone. Hopefully, that gives us even more insights that we've missed or only show up at that kind of scale.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Game Rant
  </strong>
  : Alexia, I know your team is also responsible for progression, so I wanted to ask how you've been approaching progression for this specific Battlefield experience?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Christofi: Progression is something that's super important to us, and it covers a few different parts. One thing we wanted to do with our progression is make sure that our scoring systems feel really good, so we want players to play with their squads. That means rewarding them for squad play and certain other things. We're bringing back things we know our players love, like dog tags, and we've got things like accolades. As you're playing, we're telling you that you're doing a f*cking great job at this thing, like awesome! Keep it up! For someone who's maybe new to Battlefield, as they're ranking up, they're unlocking more stuff. We're not bombarding you with stuff straight away; we're making sure you've got the core set of stuff locked down as you're unlocking more. When it comes to weapons, we want you to have a real sense of mastery of what you're doing. Our progression is built in a way that it's really rewarding you for doing cool sh*t, basically. We've got things that unlock for weapons, attachments, anything that happens as you're playing, so it's about mastering your journey.

   Game Rant
  </strong>
  : There's a sizeable part of the Battlefield community who ranks immersion as one of the most important features, sort of like the frantic dialogue from Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 5, where soldiers react to the environments and animations. What can you tell me about how Battlefield 6 approaches creating that sense of immersion on the battlefield?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sirland: I would say there are a lot of players, especially from Battlefield 1, who say that because that game is a master class in immersion. I mean, the setting and era make it a little bit easier, but I think we need to look at it from a modern era for that same reason, that immersion. Obviously, more things are happening. It's more frantic. It is faster paced for the very reason that there's more stuff, faster reloading, and things like that. We also want it to feel cohesive, which means it needs to not be annoying. We've talked about stuff like you want to hear someone needs a medic and you need to hear that, but there also almost needs to be a spam filter so that's not annoying. We have dials we can fine-tune so that aspect can be seen or heard, especially when it matters. We have to give you enough info to make the right choices of gameplay versus feeling like it's taking you out of the immersion of the game.

  : One of the best things, in my opinion, throughout Battlefield's history is the multiplayer Easter eggs. The Battlefield 5 staircase, the Battlefield 4 Megalodon. Can you tell me if Battlefield 6 is going to have a similar approach to Easter Eggs?
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sirland: The point of an Easter egg is that you don't know there are Easter eggs. I can say one thing. That staircase and the Phantom Program of Battlefield 4, I was part of the team.

  Some open-world games make laptops cry. Others? They’re practically best friends with low-spec hardware. Whether it’s because they’re charmingly retro, smartly optimized, or simply not trying to render every single blade of grass in 4K, these games deliver a complete open-world experience without demanding a dedicated GPU.
 </p>
 <p>
  For players stuck with integrated graphics, that doesn’t have to mean giving up on great exploration, memorable moments, or even the occasional chaos-fueled explosion. These are the best open-world games that actually run well on integrated graphics laptops, and better yet, still feel worth playing in 2025.

  It’s hard to believe
  <em>
   Just Cause 2
  </em>
  is over a decade old, especially when the chaos it offers still outpaces games twice its size. The reason it runs so well on integrated graphics? It’s from 2010, when system requirements were still merciful. Players can scale it down and still cause massive destruction across Panau’s snowy peaks, humid jungles, and desert strongholds. The engine is surprisingly forgiving, even when Rico’s parachuting off helicopters and yanking enemies off motorcycles midair.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes it special isn’t just the spectacle but the freedom. There’s no right way to approach anything, and that includes how players can mess with the world. Every military base becomes a playground, every fuel tank is a suggestion, and grappling hook physics might as well be a science experiment gone rogue. It’s pure sandbox mayhem that still plays surprisingly smoothly on machines that weren’t built to game.

 <p>
  Before
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  became obsessed with villains giving TED Talks, there was
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  , which struck a perfect balance between stealth, chaos, and absurd animal encounters. Its lush Rook Islands can still look great on low settings, thanks to its age and CryEngine optimizations. Even integrated graphics can pull off stable framerates if players are willing to sacrifice some shadows and anti-aliasing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world here is open and reactive. Players can liberate outposts in dozens of different ways or get sidetracked hunting Komodo dragons and crashing jet skis into pirate camps. And the side content is more than just filler. Some of it gets weirdly introspective, and others turn into mini horror stories, often buried in the margins of a tropical paradise gone feral.

  On paper,
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  sounds like a bad match for weak hardware. It’s a first-person survival game in an alien ocean full of massive draw distances, dynamic lighting, and terrifying sea beasts. But with enough graphical tweaking, it holds up surprisingly well on integrated graphics. Especially in Safe Mode or with shadows toned down, it becomes one of the most immersive open worlds a low-spec machine can handle.
 </p>
 <p>
  And it’s not just the atmosphere. Every dive can lead to something crucial. A wrecked escape pod, an abandoned alien structure, or just a new kind of fish that’s about to poison everything. There’s a real sense of discovery here, where exploration isn’t optional—it’s survival. The deeper players go, the more unnerving it gets, but the world never stops rewarding curiosity with tangible progression and story.

  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  isn’t just a farming sim. It’s an entire life in pixelated form, and it runs on integrated graphics like it was born for it. Created by a single developer, the game’s 2D art style keeps it featherlight on resources, while the sprawling valley slowly opens up into a world packed with secrets, seasonal events, and enough side content to make any completionist cry happy tears.
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s an entire desert area locked behind a community upgrade, a hidden casino run by smug NPCs, and mysterious forest events that only trigger under specific moonlight hours. And while none of it involves flashy combat or massive draw distances, the sheer variety and depth in its activities - mining, fishing, befriending villagers, and discovering lost lore - make every hour spent wandering feel worthwhile.

  <em>
   Terraria
  </em>
  might look like a side-scrolling action game, but it’s hiding one of the most densely packed open worlds ever designed. Every new world is procedurally generated, loaded with biomes, dungeons, floating islands, and underground horrors. And because it’s all done in pixel art, even ancient integrated GPUs handle it without breaking a sweat.
 </p>
 <p>
  The best part? It keeps getting updates. Even over a decade later, the developers are still sneaking in new bosses, secrets, and quality-of-life fixes that make digging through its layers feel endlessly fresh. Whether it’s stumbling onto a sword shrine buried miles underground or accidentally unleashing an event that paints the sky red, there’s no such thing as a boring exploration session. It’s chaos in 2D, and somehow, it all fits in a backpack-sized laptop.

  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  might have aged like milk in some places, but its sprawling Cyrodiil still holds up remarkably well, especially when it doesn’t melt laptops. Released in 2006, it was built for machines that barely knew what 1080p was, and it shows. On modern integrated graphics, the game runs comfortably, even with a few mods sprinkled in.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what players remember most isn’t the visuals; it’s getting pulled into side quests that start simple and spiral into something completely unexpected. Like stumbling onto a haunted painting or helping a paranoid elf prove he’s being watched, only to realize he kind of is. The writing leans into absurdity at times, but every quest leaves behind a story worth retelling, even if it’s about breaking into someone’s house just to leave lettuce in every drawer.

  Not many games have an official edition that literally says “runs on toasters,” but
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  might as well. Its default visuals are famously low-impact, especially if players disable shaders and switch to performance-friendly resource packs. On integrated graphics, Java Edition can still handle massive builds, sprawling biomes, and long-distance exploration, especially when paired with optimization mods like OptiFine.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what makes
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  special isn’t its simplicity, it’s the blank canvas it offers. Players can stumble across woodland mansions deep in unexplored forests, raid bastions in the Nether, or simply get lost spelunking through underground cave networks with nothing but a torch and a questionable sense of direction. Every session feels like its own story, and no other game makes an integrated graphics chip feel this powerful.

      <title>The Unlikely Evolution of Wartorn: From Free-to-Play Multiplayer to Tactical Roguelite</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/wartorn-free-play-multiplayer-roguelite-tactics/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  <strong>
   <em>
    Wartorn
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a turn-based tactical roguelite by Stray Kite Studios, a team headed up by industry veteran Paul Hellquist. Hellquist has had an impressive career run: he served as the creative director of
  <em>
   Borderlands 2,
  </em>
  a lead designer for
  <em>
   BioShock
  </em>
  , and a lead designer for
  <em>
   SWAT 4
  </em>
  , among other projects. Though he cut his teeth working on first-person shooters,
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  couldn't be farther outside the usual. In fact,
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  couldn't be farther from the idea it evolved from—a free-to-play multiplayer title, as Hellquist revealed.

  In a conversation with Game Rant, Hellquist spoke about
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  's earliest iterations, before it took shape as the tactical roguelite currently in Early Access. He also weighed in on the team's inspired approach to roguelite game design and how each run is made to feel distinct.

  Initially, the team was developing the game with an understandable aim of attracting a publisher, so the project took shape as a multiplayer free-to-play title. However, it's often better to create something authentic and passionate, as games developed this way can attract an audience of players looking for exactly what it offers. Understanding this, Hellquist says the team pivoted toward what they were truly interested in: roguelite tactics. Hellquist says:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "It evolved from a bunch of different angles. We had worked on a different version of the game for a while. It was multiplayer and free to play, and when we decided to dust it off, we realized we were doing some features because it was what we thought a publisher wanted instead of what we actually wanted to make. So we pivoted the whole design toward the rogue-lite tactics game. Our team loves rogue-lite games because of the consequences that every decision can have on the outcome, as well as the growth they provide – not only in gear and stats, but also in player skill.
  </p>
  <p>
   We then went from there and started adding elements like a world ravaged by war to help contextualize all of the fighting, but we wanted to do something that wasn’t about the war itself, but about people surviving the war around them and trying to reunite their family. That eventually led us to the Oregon Trail-inspired road-trip elements of the game, and suddenly, we realized we had something really different on our hands."
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  's additional elements then came online one after another. A warlike setting to justify its tactical turn-based combat, but an intimate story about survival to bring a more personal perspective and a stronger attachment to units within the game.

  There are plenty of turn-based tactics games floating around the genre, but few of them delve into roguelite progression, and this is where
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  finds its niche. Players embark on a unique path through the overworld map, similar to progression through
  <em>
   Slay the Spire
  </em>
  's branching paths, acquiring a variety of resources and upgrades to improve the chances of a successful run. As Hellquist describes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "Taking nods from other titles, we have a lot of different resources to collect on a run and spend in different ways to level up your capabilities, whether it be the heroes’ weapons, spells, their family members, or improvements for your entire fighting force.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next, there are the events and encounters that happen on the road. These happen in different orders, and you can get many different results from each of them. This encourages players to explore the events to learn all of the possible outcomes. The more knowledge you have, the better decisions you can make in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
   Combat on maps plays out differently every time because the make-up of the enemy forces and the player’s caravan is different on each run."
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In classic roguelite game fashion, every run of
  <em>
   Wartorn
  </em>
  is made unique thanks to the potential makeups of the player's forces and the ever-changing encounters they'll be pitted against. It's an engaging loop for turn-based tactics fans seeking a challenge that asks them to master its systems, rather than merely mastering its levels.

      <title>5 Xbox Game Pass Games to Play This Week (August 3 - August 9)</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-play-now-august-celeste-alters/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  This week’s
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  lineup seems carefully selected for players seeking a mix of intense challenges and relaxing moments throughout the week. There's something for players who want to escape into a sprawling, historical epic, and just as much for those who prefer intimate puzzles, branching dialogue, or quiet, unsettling mysteries. But the unifying factor this week is that this lineup encourages exploration, both literal and personal.

  Some of this week’s Xbox Game Pass titles are slow burns with a creeping sense of discovery, while others are bold, bright, and immediate. But none of them are disposable. Each one brings a sense of purpose, whether that’s pushing against gravity or questioning identity. It’s a rare week when every title offers something utterly meaningful. And whether that’s challenge, comfort, or quiet revelation, each entry has earned its spot in this week’s queue.

  This recently added title may include animals, but anyone with a Game Pass should consider trying this captivating prison escape game.
  <em>
   Back to the Dawn
  </em>
  is a compelling RPG set in a prison filled with memorable NPCs and engaging dialogue. Like traditional RPGs, it offers a variety of playstyles and choices that make players carefully consider the consequences of their actions. The premise itself is intense: can the player think on their feet and outside the box to escape Boulderton Prison? Because from the infirmary to the ceiling, the chance at freedom lies in every corner.

  <em>
   Back to the Dawn
  </em>
  allows players to choose between two protagonists: Bob the Panther, an undercover agent who is growing tired of his job, or Thomas the Fox, a journalist unwittingly caught up in a conspiracy. This RPG tasks players with achieving a prison break, but in the meantime, they will need to deal with three gangs and dangerous NPCs within the prison. Whether a player becomes someone whose fists do the talking or an inmate with a silver tongue,
  <em>
   Back to the Dawn
  </em>
  offers endless replayability.

  <em>
   The Alters
  </em>
  caused quite a stir earlier this summer, both for controversial and positive reasons. But no matter what, it remains one of this year's top titles and has also hit Game Pass. This ambitious sci-fi survival game combines the best elements of survival, base building, and that unique kind of narrative gameplay that hooks players the moment they understand the stakes involved. Whether a player is catching up on one of this year's most notable games or just learning about it, now is the perfect time to pickup this title.

   Celeste

   Celeste
  </em>
  challenges players to climb an unforgiving mountain—both literally and emotionally. The journey is challenging, but never punishing, as it encourages players to keep trying, push forward, and believe in their ability to succeed. The story, the soundtrack, and the sense of victory all land with a genuine heart. It’s perfect for a week that may call for something heartfelt and hard-earned.

  The game stars Madeline, a young woman determined to scale Celeste Mountain. But her journey is more than physical. She’s battling anxiety, self-doubt, and a shadowy version of herself called “Badeline” that seems determined to hold her back. Each chapter of the game reveals new platforming mechanics and narrative layers, creating a story that mirrors the gameplay’s constant challenge and reward loop. This game doesn’t just test reflexes.
  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  tells a powerful story about resilience, acceptance, and what it means to keep moving forward.

  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
  </em>
  lets players embody a Spartan mercenary caught between the two sides of the Peloponnesian War. The player can influence the outcome of the war by aiding either side, but the conflict is not the entire heart of the story. The soul of this tale lies in the protagonists’ search for their family.

  Game Pass subscribers shouldn’t overlook
  <em>
   Blue Prince
  </em>
  , one of this year’s top-rated games. Sometimes, a game doesn’t require flashy mechanics or intense action to make a lasting impact; it just needs a bizarre, stylish idea that becomes unforgettable.
  <em>
   Blue Prince
  </em>
  is a surreal, strategic roguelike where players build a mysterious, constantly changing mansion, room by room. Its unique mix of creepy visuals, time constraints, and puzzle-like exploration makes it perfect for a week of clever experimentation. It’s intelligent, strange, and incredibly addictive once the mystery unveils itself.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Sims 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  has released 19 expansion packs since it released over a decade ago, and more might be on the way still. Going by this count,
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  already has the most DLCs out of all the mainline games in the franchise, and each of them has helped fans with letting their creative juices flow in order to make their Sims' lives much more interesting.
 </p>

 <p>
  It's also not a secret that EA and Maxis have been working on
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  , the rumored fifth
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  game with advanced graphics and customization features that could redefine the life simulation genre in the future. While it's still unknown when
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  will be released, its development would mean that
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  should consider its next steps once it's out. But considering that many fans have already invested so much in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  over the years, perhaps the "right" move could be to stay put.

  What We Know About Project Rene So Far
 </h3>
 <p>
  EA and Maxis have opened playtesting opportunities for
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  , wherein players tried out the very detailed furniture and apartment customization, as well as the multiplayer function. Just like
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , developers have revealed that
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  will be free to download from the start. Furthermore, it will be accessible on mobile, so players can access their virtual homes even while on the go. Other playtester leaks include Sims getting jobs and earning Simoleons at a cafe and clothing store.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next round of
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  playtests is still under wraps, but it's expected that they should feature the new Create-A-Sim function. The furniture customization has already impressed those who managed to test it out, so expectations are high for
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  to deliver diverse character creation options.
 </p>
 <h3 id="why-project-rene-should-become-a-sims-4-spin-off">
  Why Project Rene Should Become a Sims 4 Spin-Off
 </h3>
 <p>
  As mentioned,
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  has released a significant number of expansion packs over the last decade, which many fans have invested in.
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  's most recent DLC is Enchanted By Nature, wherein players can turn their Sims into fairies and engage in other whimsical activities. If players have spent a lot on these expansion packs, then it might become difficult to leave
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  for
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  once it finally launches. Likewise, newer and longtime players might still want to get the DLCs in the future, so it might not be good if EA and Maxis suddenly pulled them out.
 </p>
 <p>
  One possible solution would be to turn
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  into a
  <em>
   Sims 4
  </em>
  spin-off or another expansion pack, especially if reports are true that it's not necessarily going to be treated as the fifth mainline game.
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  has been stagnant when it comes to spin-offs, so
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  's release could be a great opportunity to do a major update in order to accommodate the advanced graphics and customization features. It's like killing two birds with one stone:
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  will be here to stay, so players won't have to let go of the process they made and the expansion packs they've collected over the years; and expectant
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  players will be able to enjoy an entirely new experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever
  <em>
   Project Rene
  </em>
  comes out, it has the potential to improve upon many
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  features, like deepening the furniture and character customization. With similar life simulation games like
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  capitalizing on hyperrealistic characters and immersive worlds, the
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  franchise definitely has to keep up.

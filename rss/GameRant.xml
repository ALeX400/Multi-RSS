   Unfortunately, there are no active codes at the moment, but we are sure that the developers will provide new ones very soon. So keep this guide handy because as soon as a new freebie appears, you'll be able to find it here.

  There are multiple English social media accounts owned by the

  staff. By following these accounts, players will be able to discover new redeemable codes when they are first released to the public. Some of these accounts are:

 <p>
  It is important to know that publicly released codes can only be used once per DevPlay account and cannot be endlessly used in one kingdom.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the majority of players, the coupon redemption screen can be found by first entering the menu in the top right corner of the screen while outside of battle. In this menu, select the Coupons button to open up the web browser to the redemption screen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who do not have the option to go directly to the redemption screen from in-game can still enter it by going to this website.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to enter a code, players need to have both a code and the name of their DevPlay account. Players can find the name of their DevPlay account by going into
  <em>
   Cookie Run Kingdom
  </em>
  's Settings menu. From here, the name of the DevPlay account being used at the time can be found in the upper left corner of the Info tab. If the DevPlay account is an email address, the entire email address needs to be entered on the code redemption screen.

  The magical world of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hollow Knight

  </strong>
  is full of many things to discover, various challenging bosses to take on, and valuable abilities that make traversing through every area much easier. One of the greatest challenges players will encounter as they explore, are acid pools, which are not only quite dangerous, but also very inconvenient.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->

  While collecting various Mask Shards to be able to withstand as many hits as possible is a great way to survive, becoming impervious to things like acid will often go much further in terms of making exploration simpler. Here’s

  To get Isma’s Tear, you must have already discovered the City of Tears, as you’ll have to dive into the darkest reaches of the Royal Waterways, which are accessed through this area. As you explore the City of Tears, you'll eventually come across a latch on the ground with a sign that says that a Simple Key is needed to open it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many Simple Keys spread throughout the Hallownest, but for now, let’s focus on making you impervious to acid. If you haven't unlocked the Desolate Dive ability that you get from the Soul Master boss at the top of the City of Tears, you should go get that first, as you'll need it to access the bench from which this guide begins. Once you've gained access to the Royal Waterways and are sitting on the bench marked with the leftmost red circle in the picture above, you’ll want to follow the specified route. However, before you do that, you should go to the area marked with the white circle, as that's the lair of the Dung Defender. Defeating him is necessary to drain an area that would otherwise be filled with acid, making it impossible for you to go through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you beat the Dung Defender, go to the adjacent room to the right and hit the lever there to drain the room mentioned earlier. Now you can safely follow the path marked in the picture above to reach Isma’s Tear. You’ll come across various obstacles along the way, including a formidable fight with some winged sentries. When you defeat them, there’s nothing more standing in your way. Simply drop down until you reach Isma’s Grove—you’ll find Isma’s Tear in the right corner of the area.

  Simple Keys in
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  are not easy to come by, and they’re very rare, as there are only four. One can be found in the Ancient Basin, another one in the City of Tears, another one is obtained by defeating the Pale Lurker in a secluded area next to the Colosseum of Fools, and the last one is sold by Sly in his shop in Dirtmouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naturally, the easiest Simple Key to get is the one sold by Sly, as all you have to do, is save up some Geo to get it. That said, it will not come cheap, as Sly will want a whopping 950 Geo to part ways with this useful, yet expensive item. If you’re saving for something else, like the Lumafly Lantern, this might set you back more than you’re comfortable with. But if you want to swim in acid like water, the expense is, unfortunately, necessary.

      <title>What To Expect From Fallout 76 in 2025</title>

 <p>
  Between the success of the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  show, the first-ever Skyline Valley map expansion, the new legendary crafting system, and the Gleaming Depths update reintroducing endgame Raids, 2024 was one of the biggest years for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  so far. Although 2024 will be hard to compete with, given how much momentum the franchise has going into 2025, this will surely be another major year for fans of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   Fallout 76

  will be starting 2025 strong with the new playable Ghoul character and Season 20 coming in March, followed by fishing and two new Seasonal Events coming throughout the year. While some of the major content updates coming to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  in 2025 beyond this have yet to be revealed, it’s safe to expect that
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  will stick to its pattern of releasing a minimum of two major content updates with several smaller updates throughout the year.

  ’s Season 19 Community Calender has already revealed everything that will come to the game until March 2025. Beyond this, there have been a handful of individual announcements for other upcoming updates coming throughout the year, including new Seasonal Events, the Ghoul playable character, and fishing.

 <p>
  There will be two new Seasonal Events joining the rotation this year: Mischief Night and the Big Bloom, along with a new Challenge Event. Mischief Night was previously cut content for
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , although it will finally be returning in 2025, and it’s expected to run alongside the existing Spooky Scorched Seasonal Event. As for the Big Bloom Seasonal Event and Challenge Event, it’s unclear what these will entail. However, it’s been said that players will be helping to prune some deadly, mutated plants, potentially referring to the Overgrown or otherwise hinting at a new variety of enemies coming to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s Seasonal Public Events only ran once or twice a year, but recently there has been an effort to make these events occur much more frequently. So especially with new Seasonal Events joining the rotation this year, there will typically be at least one event running every month, giving players plenty of activities to enjoy and potentially new rewards to earn between
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s major updates coming throughout the year.

 <h3 id="fallout-76-rsquo-s-playable-ghoul-character-and-season-20-arrives-in-march-2025">
  Fallout 76’s Playable Ghoul Character and Season 20 Arrives in March 2025
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the biggest confirmed updates coming to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  in 2025 is the playable Ghoul character, arriving alongside the start of Season 20 in March. Players who transform their character into a Ghoul will be able to draw power from Radiation to utilize new buildcrafting tools, which will be especially powerful for unarmed melee builds. Everything revealed for
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s playable Ghoul so far includes:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Exclusive buildcrafting tools, including Ghoul Perk Cards and the Feral and Glow combat mechanics
  </li>
  <li>
   Unique story and world interactions
  </li>
  <li>
   New quests and locations
  </li>
  <li>
   Transforming into a Ghoul will be available for both new and existing characters, and it will be reversible
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Aside from how
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s playable Ghouls will impact the meta, this new playable character is going to be a major milestone for the franchise. More specifically, this could open the door for additional playable characters beyond Ghouls and humans, influencing the fate of the franchise’s future games.

     While the theme for Season 20 hasn’t been revealed, it will likely feature rewards related to the playable Ghoul character, such as weathered armor and weapon skins, as well as a potential Ghoul CAMP ally.

  This feature was first teased during the 2024 Fallout Day festivities, and it’s since been confirmed to arrive in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  in the Summer of 2025. Players can expect fishing in
  <em>
   Fallout 76

  to provide several new food consumables and recipes, along with a mysterious new NPC vendor, the Drifter.

 <p>
  The ongoing process of balancing changes in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  will continue in 2025, with this year said to be dedicated to alternative playstyles. It’s already been revealed that new Perk Cards will be coming for both Ghouls and humans, and while their exact details are currently unknown, players can likely expect these Perk Cards to introduce buffs for off-meta builds in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , like stealth, shotguns, and pistol builds. It’s also worth mentioning that potential nerfs for the Gleaming Depths Raid are a hot topic among the game’s community that may be considered for future updates.

  Graphics, Performance, and Gameplay Improvements Coming to Fallout 76 in 2025

 <p>
  Aside from big content updates,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  will remain focused on bug fixes and gameplay improvements, notably including a highly requested overhaul of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s CAMP and Workshop building menu, along with some graphics upgrades coming in 2025. There will also be performance improvements coming throughout the year, which will likely target the game’s overall performance on consoles and known issues with the Milepost Zero Caravans Public Event.

 </h3>
 <p>
  Fallout Day celebrates the date that the bombs dropped in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games’ canon timeline on October 23, and this event typically features sales on all of the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise games on most platforms. Then on November 14,
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  will be celebrating its 7th birthday in 2025, likely offering a free-to-play trial for new players. These two holidays normally only have special celebrations on milestone years, so while there may be community events and livestreams, there likely won’t be any in-game challenges or rewards in 2025.

  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  typically follows a pattern of introducing two to four major content updates every year. Considering that 2024 was such a big year after the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  show’s success led to a new record-high player count in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , the Skyline Valley update introduced the first-ever map expansion, and the Gleaming Depths update reintroduced endgame Raids, this momentum will presumably carry over into another big year for
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  . Therefore, despite the lack of announcements so far, a minimum of two major updates coming to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  in 2025 is all but guaranteed.

  ’s big yearly updates. Otherwise, the rest of the ‘big updates’ coming to

  in 2025 have yet to be revealed. However, the features that were delayed from

  in 2025 after being delayed from a previous update. Another delayed feature expected to arrive in 2025 is a new way to earn four-star legendary loot in
  <em>

  </em>
  . Currently, the only way to earn four-star legendaries is by completing encounters in the Gleaming Depths Raid, but eventually, players will be able to earn four-star legendaries from random legendary enemies that spawn around the map.

  So far, there’s one big leak that could be related to an update for
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  coming in 2025. According to leaks posted on the Fallout Fandom Wiki, a new Expedition has been datamined. This new Expedition potentially coming to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , the Bastion, takes place in the Pitt and the location is believed to be influenced by the real-life U.S. Steel Tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  still has plans to expand upon the Pitt, this could be a sign that the Pitt will become a freely explorable area outside of Expeditions, complete with a new questline similar to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s Atlantic City region. Additionally, if these leaks are true, this new Expedition coming to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  would presumably be one of the big yearly updates accompanied by a new Season.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  player online has transformed their in-game ship into a
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  -themed Christmas truck, bringing the festivities to the stars. This particular
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  ship build is a great crossover between two of Bethesda's franchises.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there is much that the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  community is split on in regards to Bethesda's latest RPG, the one thing that is just about unanimously agreed upon is that the game's ship builder is fantastic. The tools are extensive, with tons of depth, allowing players to bring their wildest ideas to life. In the year since
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's release, players have used these tools to great effect, with some even using mods to get more out of the ship builder. There was even another player who transformed their
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  ship into Shrek, which goes to show the complexity that these tools allow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Redditor lililiilillil shared their awesome
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  ship with the game's community online, which has been designed to look like a space truck. With a bright red color scheme and the words "Nuka Cola" on the side, it's also an awesome
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  crossover. According to the user, it was inspired by
  <em>
   Star Trucker
  </em>
  and the Coca-Cola Christmas truck, and both are very clear to see - lililiilillil has done a great job blending the best of both in this one. There have been other
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  ship crossovers before, given the natural Bethesda connection, but this might just be the best one so far.

  Previously, lililiilillil was the gamer who turned their
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  character into a space trucker with their original ship design. It's cool to see them continue to innovate on this design with the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  theme here. There was one user in thread who pointed out that with a quick change of color scheme, they could even create a Nuka Cola Quantum truck, although it would admittedly be moving away from the Christmas vibe of the original with that.

  It will be interesting to see what the future holds for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  . With Bethesda moving on to
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 6
  </em>
  and presumably
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  after that, it could be a very long time before a new
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​game is released. It's also unclear about how much new content will come to the original game in 2025 and beyond. Just recently,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  added new
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  content for free, but it remains to be seen if there will be any more major expansions like
  <em>
   Shattered Space
  </em>
  .

  Amazon Prime Gaming is giving out a bunch of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lost Ark
   </em>
  </strong>
  items to celebrate the ongoing holiday season.
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  players with an Amazon Prime subscription can claim the newly introduced batch of freebies until mid-January 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  The original, Korean version of the popular MMORPG was published by its developer Smilegate in late 2019. Two and a half years later, Amazon Games published the English version of
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  , which debuted in February 2022. The free-to-play action RPG has been the subject of frequent Prime Gaming promotions ever since.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a continuation of this trend, Prime Gaming members can currently grab a bunch of
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  items that the subscription service is offering as part of its holiday season celebrations. The new batch of freebies can be claimed directly from the Prime Gaming website. Called the Holiday Cache, the bundle includes one Event Reskin Ticket, a 5-Day Crystaline Aura, two Legendary Rapport Selection Chests, and 500 Amethyst Shards.

 <h2 id="prime-gaming-39-s-lost-ark-holiday-cache-is-available-for-nearly-a-full-month">
  Prime Gaming's Lost Ark Holiday Cache Is Available For Nearly a Full Month
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  players with an Amazon Prime membership have nearly a full month to claim this set of freebies, as the Holiday Cache will be available until January 17, 2025. In terms of the bundle's contents, the free rewards offer a varied mixture of benefits. The Event Reskin Ticket is used for changing the appearance of a single event-specific item without altering its stats. The 5-Day Crystalline Aura increases XP gains, makes fast travel free, halves Ocean Liner shop's prices, reduces Stronghold research, craft, and dispatch times, and offers a wide variety of other benefits. As such, it's extremely useful for making the daily grind more efficient. The Crystalline Aura even unlocks some new gameplay mechanics, like pet inventory and remote gear repair.
 </p>
 <h3 id="lost-ark-holiday-cache-contents">
  Lost Ark Holiday Cache Contents
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   1x Event Reskin Ticket
  </li>
  <li>
   1x 5-Day Crystaline Aura
  </li>
  <li>
   2x Legendary Rapport Selection Chest
  </li>
  <li>
   500x Amethyst Shards
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, the Legendary Rapport Selection Chest includes an aptly named Legendary Rapport Gift, which can be given to NPCs to strengthen relationships. Since NPCs have unique preferences and these items can be difficult to procure, it’s wise to use them carefully, ensuring each recipient gets something they truly desire. The final freebie included in the
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  Holiday Cache is a bundle of 500 Amethyst Shards, a type of in-game currency used for purchasing various resources, such as crafting materials and potions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Lost Ark
  </em>
  freebies are far from the only benefit of having an Amazon Prime subscription in December 2024. Prime Gaming is currently also giving away various games, including
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition
  </em>
  , and the first two entries in the
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  series.

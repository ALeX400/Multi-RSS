    Call of Duty: Warzone
   </strong>
  </em>
  Season 3, allowing
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans to earn free in-game rewards such as double XP tokens and a new weapon blueprint. The newest season of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  kicked off on April 3 after some lengthy server downtime, bringing back the game's very first Battle Royale map as well as some iconic weapons from 2019's
  <em>

  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  While Season 3 of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  kicked off on April 2,
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  fans were left waiting an extra 24 hours for the new season to begin as Activision took the game's servers offline in preparation for Verdansk's return. The beloved Battle Royale map has been absent for almost three and a half years, but Activision has finally brought Verdansk back with a fresh lick of paint. Although the map is still identical to its 2020 version, developer Beenox has rebuilt Verdansk from the ground up, featuring improved lighting, textures, and more complex and intricate foliage. Fans will also find more cover in areas of the map that were open, allowing for easier rotations between different points of interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  To celebrate the return of Verdansk in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  , Activision is once again enabling Twitch Drops with double XP tokens and a new weapon blueprint up for grabs. From April 3 until April 30, viewers can check out participating live streams to earn a double XP token, a double weapon XP token, and a new Green Machine weapon blueprint for the XMG. To obtain all of the new rewards up for grabs, players will need to watch a total of 6 hours of participating
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  Twitch streams. After watching for 2 hours, players will be rewarded with a double XP token, followed by a double weapon XP token at 4 hours and a weapon blueprint at 6 hours.

  Fans of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon TCG Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  have pointed out that the Sneak Peek feature could be considered "illegal." They're referring to a new limited-time event introduced on April 3, suggesting that the lack of transparency around one specific detail could potentially violate consumer protection laws. This is not the first time a gacha game has faced accusations of legal violations; however, it may be the first instance of such allegations aimed at
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  With the growing popularity of gacha games and their addictive nature, some regulators in regions like China and Europe have proposed specific consumer protection laws to safeguard players from gacha exploitation. One strict gaming regulation came from China, which mandated that all video game developers disclose the odds of loot boxes and random items. Since then, most gacha games, including
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  , have published their drop rates and pity systems to help players understand what they're paying for. However, a group of
  <em>
   TCG Pocket
  </em>
  players now believe that the game's latest event may disregard these legal requirements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reddit user BigGreyCatOwner shared their concerns on the game's subreddit, claiming that the Wonder Pick's Sneak Peek campaign in
  <em>
   TCG Pocket
  </em>
  could be potentially illegal. They argue that since the feature requires spending Poke Gold to get Wonder Hourglasses, the developer should have disclosed the odds of receiving a "Sneak Peek." As it stands, the event appears to rely entirely on RNG, which could be considered against the law in certain regions and countries.

 <p>
  <em>

  regular Wonder Picks let players choose one of five face-down cards that previously appeared in another player's booster pack. However, when the Sneak Peek feature is triggered, the first selected card is revealed without ending the Wonder Pick, allowing the player to make another selection if the first pick isn't desirable.

 <p>
  In the same Reddit thread, some fans highlighted another issue with the event: misleading instructions. According to them, the in-game text and pop-up prompts give a false impression that the player's current Wonder Pick includes a Sneak Peek chance. In reality, it doesn't, and players are sometimes forced to spend Wonder Stamina before realizing their pick isn't eligible for the feature. So far, The Pokemon Company and DeNA, the game's developers, haven't responded to these allegations or complaints. And with the ongoing backlash from the community, it's unclear whether the Sneak Peek feature will return in future

  The Bell will only spawn in the Study, a room that can be found past the East Foyer, through the Library, and up the stairs before entering the room with Elemental Pop (where the SWAT 5.56 wall-buy is located). It's important to know that this is the Bell room, and the Bell cannot spawn outside of this room. If players are having a hard time finding the Bell, then try a few steps before searching again, like:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Ensure that someone on the team has a Ray Gun Mark 2
  </li>
  <li>
   Pick up the Sconce from the Banquet Hall
  </li>

   Acquire any of the Empty Canisters

  franchise after Desmond Miles, Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, and Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and the final ancestor Miles would relive the memories of before his death. First appearing in
  <em>

  , Connor would go on to become one of the most popular characters in the franchise, appearing in two other games. With many players revisiting Connor’s story in response to A

  When gamers first delved into
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed 3
  </em>
  , most were already aware of Connor’s rich family tree, with 18th century man being a descendant of the legendary Assassins Altair Ibn-La'Ahad and Ezio Auditore da Firenze, as well as the ancestor of William and Desmond miles. However, fans were quickly shocked to learn just how complicated and tragic Connor’s immediate family history was. Connor is not the first character gamers play in the 18th century. Instead, the first three sequences of the game have players embody Connor’s father, Haytham Kenway, who is revealed to be the Grand Master of the Colonial Rite of the Templar Order, the Assassin Brotherhood’s archenemies. This was the first time gamers got to play as a Templar in
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  ’s main campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tasked with establishing a Templar presence in the British colonies, opening the Isu Grand Temple, and eliminating the Colonial Assassin Brotherhood, Haytham would eventually encounter the Mohawk warrior Kaniehti꞉io, otherwise known as Ziio, in 1754. Together, Haytham and Ziio thwarted the British's efforts to encroach on Mohawk territory and assassinated General Edward Braddock in 1755 during the French and Indian War.
 </p>
 <p>
  During these events, the two would briefly enter a romantic relationship together, with Haytham unknowingly fathering Connor before leaving to expand Templar control and continue destroying the Colonial Assassin Brotherhood. Ziio remained in colonial New England and raised Connor alone in a small Mohawk village until 1760, when she was killed by a British attack on the settlement.

  Connor’s Discovery of his Assassin and Templar Lineage
 </h3>
 <p>
  Orphaned at the age of four, Connor is raised by his remaining members of the village, swearing to avenge his mother’s death. In 1769, Connor is sent to seek out the disgraced Mentor of the Assassin Colonial Brotherhood Achilles Davenport, to become an Assassin. Reluctantly, Davenport successfully trains Connor and aids him in eliminating Templar leaders within both the British Empire and the American Patriots during the Revolutionary War. It’s during Connor’s time with Davenport that he discovers who his father is, as well as his paternal grandfather, the legendary early 18th-century British Assassin Edward Kenway. By 1778, Connor and Haytham would encounter each other numerous times, with the two attempting to convert each other to their causes. Eventually, Connor was forced to assassinate his father to stop him from dominating the colonies.

  Beyond Connor’s familial struggles and quest to defeat the Templars and free the people of North America, the Colonial Assassin repeatedly proves himself to be a selfless, resourceful, and skilled warrior. While training under Davenport, Connor discovers a deteriorating ship in the bay of the Davenport Homestead. With the help of Captain Robert Faulkner, Connor is able to restore the Aquila and uses it to support Patriots and colonists, trade supplies, and combat Templar naval forces. The Aquila additionally helps Connor reconnect with scattered remnants of the Colonial Assassin Brotherhood such as the Louisiana-based Assassin Aveline de Grandpre as seen in

  </em>
  .

  Connor himself spearheads the reconstruction of the Colonial Brotherhood by helping downtrodden colonists and training them to become Assassins, such as:

   Deborah Carter

   Stephane Chapheau

  By the end of the Revolutionary War, Connor had successfully rooted out most Templar control within the young United States of America and had begun supporting other Assassins, such as those in the Parisian Brotherhood. Not every person Connor aided helped the Assassins, however. Throughout
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed 3
  </em>
  , players could take part in Homestead missions, which had Connor rebuild the Davenport Homestead, help struggling colonists, and invite them to live on the estate. Connor further helped shape the young United States by directly helping several Founding Fathers, such as George Washington and the Sons of Liberty, as seen in

  After the defeat of the Colonial Rite of the Templar Order with the deaths of Haytham Kenway and Charles Lee, little is known about Connor’s later life. In
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  , Connor’s village is shown to have fled after the United States seized and sold their land. Despite this event, Connor still kept in touch with many leaders in the United States, such as when he helped free Washington from nightmares caused by an Apple of Eden in The Tyranny of King Washington DLC. Connor continued to help rebuild the Colonial Brotherhood, serving as its new leader, even requesting Grandpre to help recruit the former slave, Patience Gibbs, in Rhode Island in 1784.
 </p>
 <p>
  Connor makes no other game appearances following the end of
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag
  </em>
  ’s Aveline DLC, but some of his later life is depicted in books and graphic novels. In the novel
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed: Forsaken
  </em>
  , Connor reads through Haytham’s journal to learn more about his father’s early life and what Haytham truly thought of his son. In the comic
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed: Reflections
  </em>
  , it is revealed Connor eventually joined another tribe and married a currently unknown woman. Together they had three daughters, but only one, Io:nhiote, possessed the Eagle Vision ability present in the Miles family line. Due to this ability, it’s presumed Io:nhiote is Desmond Miles’ direct ancestor after Connor.

  Connor Kenway’s Legacy in the Assassin’s Creed Franchise

 <p>
  It’s currently unknown when exactly Connor Kenway died in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin’s Creed
   </em>
  </strong>
  timeline, but his impact and legacy on the franchise can forever be felt. Without Connor, the modern-day Assassins may never have existed, and the Templars could have dominated the entire US, if not the world. Connor’s actions paved the way not just for an improved generation of Assassins but for Desmond Miles to save the world from catastrophe in 2012. He was additionally the first major Native American protagonist portrayed in the
  <em>
   Assassin’s Creed
  </em>
  franchise, paving the way for more diverse characters and narratives to be featured in later games. While Connor’s story may have been divisive at launch, he’s gone on to become more accepted by fans for his rich, complex, story and groundbreaking naval gameplay.

  City Racers follows the same format of traditional Tycoon Racers events, where your goal is to collect the most number of medals across three intense races. Whether you’re playing in a team or all by yourself, you’ll need to collect Flag tokens to move your racers around the board.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can get Flags by participating in different activities like solo events, leaderboard tournaments, completing daily "Quick Wins," claiming free shop rewards, and landing on special tiles on the board. The end goal of City Racers is to
  <strong>
   score the most points in each race and collect the most medals by the end of the event.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the Lucky Rocket in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  , Scopely has released another flash booster named
  <strong>
   Ball &amp; Chain.
  </strong>
  This booster allows you to pick a competing team and slow them down. As soon as you use it, the targeted team is slowed down for a while, and needs to earn a set number of points to shake off the effect. This gives you or your team some breathing room in the races, allowing you to outrun the competition. It's a powerful tool that increases your chances of crossing the finish line first and claiming those top-tier rewards in the City Racers event.

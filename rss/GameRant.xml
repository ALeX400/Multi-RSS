  Valkyrae has harsh words about Jason Momoa, one of the stars of the upcoming
  <em>
   <strong>
    A Minecraft Movie
   </strong>
  </em>
  , following an alleged incident that occurred during filming for the movie. The movie based on the beloved sandbox survival game is one that has been rumored for years, following the game's explosion in popularity throughout the 2010s. Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. would officially debut the first teaser trailer for the
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  movie earlier this month, giving fans their first look at Jack Black in the starring role as Steve. However, one actor involved with the project now finds themselves in hot water.

 <p>
  The highly-anticipated first trailer for
  <em>
   A Minecraft Movie
  </em>
  has largely been panned by both fans and critics following its release. Many fans have criticized the artstyle and CGI used within the movie, with some even calling some of the designs "horrifying" or "unsettling" for its intended child audience. The film's casting has also been the subject of discussion among fans of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , poking fun at Jack Black's role as Steve and the live-action interpretation of the pixelated game. Now, Jason Momoa's behavior on set is being called out by a popular streamer.

  As reported by Dexerto, popular streamer Valkyrae shared her horror story about Jason Momoa during an interview about her time in the film. Valkyrae confirmed she is set to appear in a cameo role within
  <em>
   A Minecraft Movie
  </em>
  , detailing an incident involving Jason Momoa mistreating the crew working on the movie. The streamer revealed that Momoa was "angry and loudly yelling" at members of the crew for the film, calling it her worst experience with a celebrity. Jason Momoa plays Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison, one of the main characters in
  <em>
   A Minecraft Movie
  </em>
  .

  The upcoming
  <strong>
   <em>

  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  is set to launch on November 14 for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

  <em>
   Dragon Quest

  is an all-time classic in the realm of JRPGs, having pioneered many of the elements of modern turn-based role-playing games throughout the series while managing to stay successful, both critically and commercially. Developer Square Enix announced a remake of
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  to honor the series' 35th anniversary, and though things were quiet for a bit about the upcoming game, fans can rejoice at the latest news.

  A Twitter post from the official
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  account confirmed that
  <em>

  has gone gold, meaning that the game is fully finished and ready for shipment when it releases on November 14. The post contained an image of series co-creator Yuji Horii alongside the remake's producer, Masaaki Hayasaka, posing triumphantly while holding copies of the new game.

  Fans were excited in the replies, with many stating that they had already pre-ordered the game and would be looking forward to playing it on release day, while others expressed concerns about the game's alleged censorship of certain character models. Updated character designs are not the only new addition to the

  remake, however, as the game will also see the addition of a brand-new vocation and a few changes to the main story.

  Shiv is a hero with a penchant for making his own opportunities in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deadlock
   </em>
  </strong>
  . His kit revolves around bleeding enemies out before swooping in for the kill. This character is fairly flexible with many potential build paths that focus on his different strengths and weaknesses.

  The following is a build that capitalizes on the pressure Shiv can apply in-lane with his Bleed DoT, which can keep the enemy's HP just low enough for Shiv to pounce on them. This is what makes him one of the best heroes in
  <em>
   Deadlock
  </em>
  , and this build should serve as a good starting point for players who have just started trying him out.

  Shiv's playstyle is all about
  <strong>
   weakening the enemy before diving in hard for the kill
  </strong>
  . He does this by pelting his opponents with his
  <strong>
   Serrated Knives
  </strong>
  and dashing into their faces with
  <strong>
   Slice and Dice
  </strong>
  before blasting them with his shotgun. If that isn't enough, he can
  <strong>
   finish off any survivors with his Ultimate, Killing Blow
  </strong>
  , to secure the kill. The following focuses more on
  <strong>
   stacking Spirit Power and cooldown reduction
  </strong>
  so Shiv can spam his knives all game.

  <strong>
   Healbane
  </strong>
  is a great item on Shiv even if the enemy team doesn't have heroes with strong healing. Since Shiv tends to take a lot of damage, the heal-on-kill portion of Healbane can come in handy in clutch situations, especially since his third skill, Bloodletting, defers a portion of the damage Shiv takes. Healbane and lifesteal can keep Bloodletting from killing you.

   Unlock Serrated Knife first, then put one upgrade point into it for an extra knife charge

  Shiv's skill priorities are pretty versatile, but if you want to establish early-mid-game dominance, max out Serrated Knife after getting the second Slice and Dice upgrade. This increases both the impact damage and DoT of your knives, softening enemies up quicker for Slice and Dice and Killing Blow.

  Remedy Entertainment has taken the time and care to craft the Remedy Connected Universe which blends its different IPs. Officially, only
  <em>
   Alan Wake
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Control
   </strong>
  </em>
  are part of the RCU, but keen-eyed players can spot references to other Remedy games such as
  <em>
   Quantum Break
  </em>
  . These connections help the Remedy games feel like a coherent piece of art.

 <p>
  Remedy has another chance to include even more Easter eggs in
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  's sequel thanks to its collaboration with Annapurna. It would be nice if the upcoming games, films, and television series featured references to Annapurna's rich library of games, to celebrate both companies' successes and the potential in their new relationship.

  Remedy has never been one to shy away from featuring Easter eggs from its other games. This goes as far back as
  <em>
   Quantum Break
  </em>
  , which features references to Night Springs and even a blackboard outlining the convoluted plot of Alan Wake. For casual players, these are easy to overlook, but veteran fans will notice them immediately.

 <p>
  The Remedy Connected Universe expands with the AWE DLC for
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  which features
  <em>
   Alan Wake
  </em>
  interacting with Jesse Faden. Through this connection, players learn more about Bright Falls and the events that took place in the first
  <em>
   Alan Wake
  </em>
  game. The connections continue in
  <em>
   Alan Wake 2
  </em>
  , where FBI agent Saga Anderson interacts with FBC agent Kiran Esteves. Saga shows that she is more than capable of keeping up with the FBC agents, which may hint at further collaborations in the future.

 <h3 id="quantum-break-also-makes-an-appearance">
  Quantum Break Also Makes an Appearance

 <p>
  Remedy is fond of going crazy with its references to past games, even if they aren't part of the Remedy Connected Universe. This is seen with the appearance of Alex Casey, who bears a striking resemblance to
  <em>
   Max Payne
  </em>
  of the franchise of the same name. Sheriff Tim Breaker also makes an appearance, and he is played by the same actor who appeared in
  <em>
   Quantum Break
  </em>
  .

  Remedy has struck a deal with Annapurna to bring
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Alan Wake
  </em>
  to film and television. This is an exciting prospect that could see the world of the Remedy Connected Universe expanded. Annapurna has a rich library of games it has published and developed. This includes titles like
  <em>
   What Remains of Edith Finch
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Flower
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Journey
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Outer Wilds
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Twelve Minutes
  </em>
  , to name but a few. It would be a simple task for Remedy to include Easter eggs referencing these many games.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1003} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  This could be done by featuring characters from past Annapurna games, and this could be as trivial as including the
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  cat, which wouldn't impede on the story but would still provide a nice Easter egg for long-time Annapurna fans. The possibilities are limitless, so long as Remedy and Annapurna are willing to be creative. The biggest problem would be finding a way to naturally include these varied characters from Annapurna's roster while still having things feel natural and unforced. Fortunately, Remedy has shown that it has strong creative muscles, and it could make the plan work.

 <p>
  It may seem like there's been a wrench thrown into the works, as Annapurna Interactive's staff has recently resigned. However, Remedy's Thomas Puha has assured gamers that this won't affect the collaboration and that all things are still going according to plan. This is good news for fans who are eagerly awaiting to see the Remedy Connected Universe expand across different mediums. Until then, players can look forward to
  <em>
   Control 2,
  </em>
  which is still in development and is scheduled to release on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

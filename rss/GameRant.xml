  <strong>
   <em>
    Borderlands 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  and, to a lesser extent,
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  are brimming with content, but some gamers can plow through even the beefiest games in a matter of days. For something to play between entries in the franchise, the following discussion will present several
  <strong>
   awesome games similar to
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Borderlands

  Given how unique Gearbox's franchise is, none of the games listed are carbon copies, but they all share some elements with it, whether it be the art style, gameplay mechanics, or the addictive cycle of collecting better gear. Besides, trying to exactly replicate
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  is a foolish endeavor, since the series does it so well in the first place.

   </strong>
   While
   <strong>
    l
   </strong>
   <strong>
    ooter shooters like Borderlands
   </strong>
   do not come out often, this month might produce two projects that could hit the mark: Synduality Echo of Ada and Endless Alice. As they are not available yet, it is too early to say if they will be worth recommending, but they are at least worth monitoring. Also, Borderlands 4 is confirmed to be in the works, with a 2025 debut seeming likely. For all the criticism Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands received, they are still good games overall, with by far the strongest gunplay in the franchise.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   To help pass the time while waiting for Borderlands 4, another recommendation has been added. To be honest, this game is not that similar to Gearbox's series in most areas, but it is one of the few projects that can match Borderlands' love for loot. Click below to jump directly to this title.

  Fans of
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's gameplay will love what
  <em>
   Grim Dawn
  </em>
  has to offer, with its simple yet engaging gameplay making it worth checking out for any fan of amazing action RPGs that focus on getting as much loot as possible. Many people may find this game to be pretty different from the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  series in every way, with their tone, setting, and gameplay being quite different in many ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, that patented dopamine rush that players feel when bagging a rare piece of loot in this game is pretty similar to the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  series. The looter-shooter gameplay may be fun, but some fans can get tired of playing through titles with this same kind of gameplay over and over again... which is why a title like
  <em>
   Grim Dawn
  </em>
  can feel like a breath of fresh air!

 <p>
  Rocksteady's
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  has its issues. The game launched to a mediocre reception, which was reflected by an underwhelming Steam player count. The game's future does not look particularly promising, although there is always hope that things could turn around with a few updates. Still, at the moment,
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  cannot be recommended as a live-service project; however, as a single-player experience that can keep something engaged for 15 hours or so, the game gets the job done. Considering the developer's pedigree, the campaign is at its best when focusing on the story and the main characters. While not among Rocksteady's strongest offerings, both elements are inoffensive and overall entertaining.
 </p>
 <p>
  The combat is more of a mixed bag, at least depending on what somebody is craving. In a polarizing move, all playable characters utilize guns, a decision that was presumably made to complement a looter shooter system. Consequently,
  <em>
   Suicide Squad
  </em>
  showers players with new weapons frequently, although they are not quite as creative as
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  ' arsenal. The anti-heroes all have different movement skills that reflect their powers or personalities, so they are not complete copies of each other, even if they still play fairly similarly. Even if the gameplay is not what everyone wants, the minute-to-minute action can be fun regardless.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  is one of those games that could be worth picking up when it is on sale or if it joins a subscription service. Otherwise, only die-hard DC fans should give this a look.

  It probably does not need to be said, but
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  is nothing like
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  on nearly every level. Team Ninja's game is a tough-as-nails action RPG that focuses primarily on melee combat, with ranged weapons being secondary. The game (and its predecessor) takes obvious inspiration from
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , although the combat is far more fast-paced and in line with Team Ninja's earlier releases. The very long campaign follows a mission-based structure that drops players into sections of a map that they can explore to an extent, and they nearly always culminate in an epic and challenging boss fight. The game has almost no humor, and the story can be hard to follow if somebody is not familiar with Japanese mythology or history.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the above,
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  seems to share nothing in common with
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , but that is not 100% the case. Both games drown players in loot, with Team Ninja's release pretty much constantly giving away new weapons, armor, and other items. Similar to
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Nioh
  </em>
  uses a tier system for its weapons and armor, along with randomly generated stats and benefits. Honestly,
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  almost has too much loot since players will very quickly find their inventories full, forcing them to get rid of items. Still, people who enjoy constantly trying out new weapons in
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  will likely get a kick out of
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  , as long as they enjoy its combat.

  There's no better title to try out for fans of
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  than a game that is clearly inspired by it, with
  <em>
   Gunfire Reborn
  </em>
  being a blast to play through for a group of friends who just want to share a good time together. The roguelike structure of this game means that players will never get bored with playing through this title over and over again.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game has a palpable sense of progression that helps players feel extremely powerful once they kit themselves out with a bunch of upgrades and powerful weapons.
  <em>
   Gunfire Reborn
  </em>
  is an excellent title that deserves a ton of love, even if many people feel like the gameplay loop becomes tiring after a point.

  There aren't many games that nail a sequel as well as

  does... well, except maybe
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  . The first game is definitely fun in its own right, but the slew of improvements and refined gameplay
  <em>
   Risk of Rain 2
  </em>
  brings to the table make it clear why this roguelite third-person shooter became so incredibly popular.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the game gets more and more difficult with each level, players must engage in some tight teamwork and try to conserve their health as much as possible while dealing with powerful enemies. These deadly foes can take out the enemy in no time flat, making it imperative to purchase new weapons and improve existing ones to make them even more powerful!

  Whether something can be described directly as a live service game or simply a cooperative shooter with regular updates is sometimes hard to parse.
  <em>
   Outriders
  </em>
  certainly falls into this camp. The game is built around cooperative play and requires players to be online at all times, yet it has a fairly definitive campaign that can be finished within the length of most average shooters.
 </p>
 <p>
  This can be good or bad depending on the type of gamer, but it is just good to know what type of game it is before going in. Updates and expansions have come out since its initial release, but it is nothing on the level of an average live service game. Like
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , this is an adventure best done with friends.

  The sequel to Id Software's 2011 FPS has the same dark charm as the cel-shaded shooter franchise. The brutally chaotic barren waste is looked at through a tongue-in-cheek lens.
 </p>
 <p>
  A couple of principal differences between
  <em>
   Rage 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  are the setting – a post-apocalyptic planet Earth – and the lack of multiplayer, so one will have to solo when destroying enemy camps. Avalanche Games worked in conjunction with Id on this project, giving it a similar open-world destructive flare to their
  <em>
   Just Cause
  </em>
  series.

  All
  <em>
   Dead Island
  </em>
  games are solid recommendations for
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  fans, but the 2023 sequel arguably has the closest tone and sense of humor. While the series never takes itself too seriously,
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  revels in the absurdity far more than its predecessors. Set in Los Angeles following a zombie outbreak, the story guides players through semi-open areas that provide some room for exploration but are also quite linear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Killing zombies has never felt as good as it does in
  <em>
   Dead Island 2
  </em>
  , with Dambuster delivering a satisfying combat system with impeccable gore and some build variety. While ranged weapons are available, the game focuses more on close-quarters action.
  <strong>
   Similar to
   <em>
    Borderlands
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   , Dead Island 2
  </em>
  supports online co-op, although it is limited to three players.

  All of these shooter games are awesome, but there's nothing for the kids. Many people still play M-rated products, but should those forbidden to play them be left in the dust? Thankfully,

  is a larger, cooperative-focused experience where parties tackle missions from characters on a hub. Each plant is a different class, making teamwork and preparation vital to a mission's success. Don't be fooled by the cute aesthetic; some parts of the adventure will punish those who aren't on their toes.

  The older
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games are timeless classics, but
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  makes it on the list for the changes it makes to the formula. Instead of shaping the narrative through choices and ethical dilemmas, the 2015 game instead switches focus to exploration and combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some bemoaned this change in identity, but it feels more like a dungeon crawler these days, making it more akin to
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  than the prior titles. Narrative and dialog still feature heavily throughout the story, though, so veteran fans aren't left completely in the dust. If players are hankering for a multiplayer title, then they can jump into
  <em>
   Fallout 76.
  </em>
  This newer title had an admittedly rocky launch, but it has been much improved upon since its release and has plenty of content to devour with friends.

  Bungie's ambitious multiplayer shooter took a while to find its footing, but now it's in a better place than ever. Much of the content is free-to-play, meaning newcomers can enjoy dozens of gameplay hours before having to fork up a dime.
 </p>
 <p>
  By then, its hooks will be so deep in the player, they won't mind ponying up some cash to keep going. The distinct advantage
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  has over other multiplayer shooters of its ilk is the near-perfect shooting mechanics. One would expect nothing less from the makers of
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  , after all.

  After a few years in early access,
  <em>
   Roboquest
  </em>
  finally made its long-awaited debut in November 2023, coming out to a decent reception. The development cycle certainly helped the game maximize its potential, allowing it to build on its strong core ideas to provide an overall very enjoyable experience. As a roguelite, repetition is central to the experience, although death does not result in a return to square one. Players will regularly be upgrading their camps to unlock new robots/characters and weapons that will drop during runs, so there is a constant sense of progression even if players are shooting their way through the same few maps over and over again.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Roboquest
  </em>
  's loot is not quite on the same level as
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , but the weapons are fun to use and distinct enough from each other to justify their existence. The visuals are also somewhat similar to Gearbox's franchise, and the same can be said for the alien-esque world. More importantly,
  <em>
   Roboquest
  </em>
  's gunplay is rock-solid, offering fast-paced and satisfying action that rarely lets up.

  The first
  <em>
   Division
  </em>
  launched to a rough start, but the developer kept their heads down and worked to bring the product to quality. With
  <em>
   The Division 2,
  </em>
  they used all those lessons previously learned to give fans a great game out of the gate.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ruined Washington DC setting makes for the perfect backdrop to the chaos occurring throughout the world. The multiplayer shooter has something for everyone. Newcomers tackle the story missions with friends, while hardcore players can spend their time in Dark Zones, where the stakes are high but the loot is more valuable.

  Soulslike games are, naturally, very different from
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , but they tend to be decent picks if someone is craving loot. Unlike most of the entries in the subgenre, Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant
  </em>
  focuses on ranged combat, with melee serving as a secondary option rather than the core appeal. As good as
  <em>
   Remnant: From the Ashes
  </em>
  is, its sequel is the better overall package, even if it did have some issues at launch.
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  sends players on a surprisingly varied adventure as they travel to different universes to fight the root, and each of these worlds has a unique aesthetic and enemies that set it apart from the rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a few archetypes to pick from (along with unlockable ones),
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  emphasizes character customization and builds through a solid progression system and stat-based loot. While weapons and armor generally have to be purchased, players regularly pick up other items like amulets and rings that provide a wide range of benefits. It is not quite the same thing as
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , but it works well enough. Crucially,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is a fantastic co-op option, to the point that the project is arguably designed around it. However, the game does not ignore solo players either.

  Techland left the
  <em>
   Dead
  </em>
  <em>
   Island
  </em>
  IP behind and started a new zombie survival series.
  <em>
   Dying Light
  </em>
  takes all the best things from its spiritual predecessor and fixes all the jankiness. Additionally, movement is highly improved, with players given the ability to jump and run across rooftops while avoiding the undead.
 </p>
 <p>
  For players who have also exhausted all of
  <em>
   Dying Light's
  </em>
  content, there is always
  <em>
   Dying Light 2
  </em>
  for them to dive into. It maintains much of what made the first game special but reduces the survival horror aspect, so fans will probably not be disappointed. It had an arduous development cycle, but when it came out many were satisfied with its quality.

  Any movie or game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland was probably influenced by
  <em>
   Mad Max
  </em>
  , be it directly or indirectly. While
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  has a well-defined identity that sets it apart from other properties on the market, it certainly shares elements with George Miller's legendary franchise. Coinciding with the release of
  <em>
   Fury Road
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mad Max
  </em>
  received a rare video game, one set in an impressive desert hellscape defined by lawlessness, fear, and desperation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Avalanche Studios' project has a few things going for it that warrant a recommendation to
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  fans. For one, the open-world is gorgeous and a great deal of fun to explore, largely thanks to the stellar driving. Unlike Gearbox's franchise,
  <em>
   Mad Max
  </em>
  prioritizes vehicular combat, so much so that the main progression system revolves around upgrading a car (Max's Magnum Opus). These sections represent the game at its kinetic best, delivering action-packed and cinematic sequences that rival the movies. The on-foot action does not reach the same heights, and the same can be said for the short-ranged combat.

  While a more traditional open-world game than the looter-shooter action one finds in
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  , fans of the writing and atmosphere will find a lot to love in
  <em>
   Saints Row 4
  </em>
  . The third and fourth entries of the franchise are straightforward comedies filled with zany set pieces and unexpected pop culture references.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when the jokes are not funny, they still lend to the overall jolly atmosphere. Best of all, the game can be tackled with a friend cooperatively. The newest entry in the franchise, titled
  <em>
   Saints Row
  </em>
  , tones down the inanity while still striving for the open-world mayhem for which the series is known. The reception to it was mixed, with many agreeing that the previous games are still the height of the franchise.

  Zombies have almost been played out, but that does not make the classics any less enjoyable.
  <em>
   Left 4 Dead
  </em>
  took gamers by storm with its intense cooperative mayhem. Despite all the love for the franchise, players never received a third game in the franchise.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the game is over a decade old, it is still a pleasure to revisit the classic on PC or Xbox 360. In fact, it was still receiving updates up to a couple of years ago and fans regularly support it.

  When it first debuted,
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  was often described as
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  with guns, with both franchises revolving around their weapon drop systems. Beyond loot, the series do not overlap extensively, but they share enough similarities to warrant a recommendation. Firstly, they are both fairly accessible RPGs that emphasize co-op, with
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's console iterations supporting both local and online. The campaigns can be played entirely with a few friends, and they are both far better in this mode. Even more so than
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  has an impressive class system that provides plenty of customization and build options, allowing players to craft characters that best suit their playstyles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  has never particularly prioritized its story, which is not that far removed from the original
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  does push its narrative slightly more, but the main quest is mostly just there to keep someone busy until they enter the endgame and an endless grind for loot. Similar to
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  's Mayhem Mode,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>

  Ultimately,
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  is a worthwhile option for
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  fans, provided they enjoy isometric action RPGs to an extent. All four games have their positives, and
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  only got picked due to being the most recent.

  RPGs and first-person shooters have become closer and closer as the years go by. The
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  series mostly eschews loot, but players explore a large open-world environment while upgrading their character through leveling up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cooperative play is also available in the fourth and fifth entries. The narrative admittedly takes a backseat, but
  <em>
   Far Cry 5
  </em>
  provides countless hours of mayhem in the American Midwest, an environment rarely explored in video games. True to the trend of changing environments and locations,
  <em>
   Far Cry 6
  </em>
  takes place on a fictional Caribbean island where players have to take down a brutal dictator.

 <p>
  The first key tip to remember when playing
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 2
  </em>
  is to prioritize stress management over healing. Constantly trying to heal heroes is not a winnable strategy, especially when facing tough enemies on higher-difficulty chapters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 1
  </em>
  , healing health is more manageable in the sequel. However,
  <strong>
   maxing out stress can lead to Meltdowns
  </strong>
  that significantly reduce a hero's health and impose negative quirks, making it much harder to recover. Keeping stress in check is far more crucial to survival.

 <p>
  Some enemies in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 2
  </em>
  primarily focus on inflicting massive stress rather than physical damage. Ignoring them can be costly because they keep stacking stress damage on heroes (or the entire party with Horror) every round. This can quickly spiral out of control, forcing heroes to have Meltdowns.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hence,
  <strong>
   stun or disable stress-inducing enemies
  </strong>
  like Ghouls, Drummers, Cherubs, and Deacons in the first round to stop them from applying stress. Do not worry too much about taking physical damage from other enemies. Use front-line heroes or tanks like Man-at-Arms or Leper to taunt and mitigate damage while the damage dealers eliminate stress dealers.

  In addition to dealing massive damage, critical attacks heal small amounts of stress in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 2
  </em>
  . Heroes like Highwayman, Duelist, and Hellion have a good chance of stress-healing themselves multiple times during a fight. Hence, when building damage dealers,
  <strong>
   prioritize upgrades or items that increase their critical hit chance

  Whenever the Stagecoach reaches a crossroads, carefully evaluate the available routes and choose the path that the majority of heroes prefer. This will not always be unanimous. Check the speech bubbles over the heroes to see their preferred path. Taking a route a hero likes or dislikes will cause them to take or heal stress damage. That said, players should
  <strong>
   avoid dangerous routes
  </strong>
  if their heroes are suffering from high stress.

  Field Hospitals are rare location nodes that restore health, cure diseases, sell healing items, and importantly, manage quirks. They are the only places where players can lock in or remove quirks in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  While most negative quirks can be ignored, some like Boisterous, Cowardice, Needler, Pacifist, and Hemophobia can make stress relief pretty difficult. Hence, remove them from Field Hospitals provided that players have enough relics to spare.

  Heroes can loot and purchase combat items for various effects, including stress heals and stress resistance.
  <strong>
   Laudanum is the best consumable
  </strong>
  in this regard, removing Horror and reducing 1 stress point from an ally. It is typically useful against tough enemies or bosses that continuously inflict Horror. It also allows stress healers to use their other skills instead of being bound to giving stress relief in every round.

  There are a few trinkets that grant stress resistance or stress heals. While not the best trinkets to have in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 2
  </em>
  , they can be useful if players are running heroes without major stress-reducing skills.

  The Jester is the best stress-healing hero in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 2
  </em>
  . While a bit difficult to play for beginners, a good Jester build typically follows the
  <strong>
   Virtuoso hero path with Inspiring Tune
  </strong>
  . The former increases stress resistance for the entire party at the start of each round, and the latter removes Horror while reducing three stress points for any hero.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Jester is not the only one with strong stress-healing skills. Several other heroes also have powerful skills to keep them or the party from losing their sanity.

  Focus on buying Inn items that improve relationships between heroes instead of improving their combat capabilities. This is one of the easiest ways to gain stress relief. Heroes with positive relationships in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon 2
  </em>
  are less likely to cause stress to each other by bickering on the road. They also remove more stress points from each other during combat.

  Lava Hound is a Legendary air troop in

   <em>
    Clash Royale
   </em>
  </strong>
  that targets enemy buildings. It has a whopping 3581 HP at tournament levels but deals minimal damage. However, once it dies, it spawns six Lava Pups, each targeting anything within range. Because of the massive health pool of the Lava Hound, it's considered one of the strongest win conditions in the game.

 <p>
  Lava Hound decks typically play like a Beatdown Deck, but instead of going with Giant or Golem, you'll be using the Legendary card Lava Hound as your primary win condition. Most Lava Hound decks also use a variety of air troops as support cards, with only one or two ground units to defend or distract your opponent's cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  In most cases, these decks focus on creating an overwhelming push by placing a Lava Hound at the back of the King Tower, even if it means sacrificing a tower at times. These decks are slow and methodical, and you'll often have to sacrifice some of your tower's health to win the trade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lava Hound always had a respectable win and usage rate in
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  at all skill levels, similar to Log Bait decks. However, its popularity skyrocketed the moment Royal Chef made its appearance in the arena. Since the new champion building can level up your troops, it works extremely well with Lava Hound. If you’ve got the champion unlocked, you’ll always want to use it as your Tower Troop when you’re running a Lava Hound deck.

  This deck uses Valkyrie and Guards as its two ground troops, serving two specific purposes. The Evo Valkyrie acts as the mini-tank and takes care of swarm troops such as the Skeleton Army or Goblin Gang. If you're up against an X-Bow deck, you can use Valkeyrie to tank the hits. Guards, on the other hand, serve as your main ground DPS against troops like Pekka or Hog Rider. Since they don't go down as quickly as the 1-elixir Skeletons, you can often get excellent value out of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll want to use both the Lava Hound and the Balloon in a single push when you're using this deck. Start with a Lava Hound at the back, and place the Balloon on the bridge as soon as your Lava Hound reaches it. With the Lava Hound tanking for it, your main goal is to make sure the Balloon reaches its destination. A single Balloon hit can often mean the difference between victory and defeat when you're playing this deck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inferno Dragon is an excellent air DPS troop that can handle high-HP units such as the Golem or Giant if you're matched against those decks. As for your spells, you've got the Evo Zap to reset enemy towers or troops and Fireball to take out annoying counters like the Musketeer or get direct damage on the enemy tower.

  shifted the meta significantly when they first came out. However, most Lava Hound decks didn't benefit much from it. Sure, it added some extra firepower to the offense, but in most cases, these decks played pretty much the same way. However, with the Lava Hound Double Dragon deck, things were different.

  While Lava Hound is still your primary win condition, the Evo Bomber in the deck can help you deal massive damage to the tower if you use it smartly. On the other hand, the Evo Goblin Cage can stop pretty much any win condition, including the Royal Giant. Unless your opponent has something like a Lightning or Rocket to counter it, it's extremely hard to break through when you have your Evo Goblin Cage in cycle.
 </p>
 <p>
  You still have the Guards to offer DPS support and protect your tower against ground troops. But since you don't have a Balloon in this deck, you need to find a way to break through with your Lava Hound to win the matchup. For your air support, you've got the same old combo of Inferno Dragon and Skeleton Dragons.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for your spells, you'll use Lightning to take out opponents' defensive troops or buildings while getting massive damage to their towers and Arrows to take out swarms or units that your opponent uses to defend your push.

     Arrows deal more damage than Log or Snowball, so you can use them to spell cycle later in the game.

  The Lava Lightning Prince deck isn't necessarily the strongest out there. But it can serve as a decent starter deck for those who want to try out this deck archetype. Despite being a bit heavy, this deck is pretty easy to play since it uses some of the strongest cards in the meta.

  The Evo Valkyrie is typically considered the best evolution card
  <strong>
  </strong>
  to pair with a Lava Hound deck. Its Evo form creates a small tornado that pulls in both air and ground troops every time the Valkyrie swings her axe. In addition, the Evo Skeletons can help DPS down just about anything your opponent uses unless they take it off the field quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the addition of the Prince in this deck, you have a secondary way to pressure the enemy tower. The charge damage of the Prince can take out just about anything on the field, and if it connects to the tower, you'll have enough damage to win the game just with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  For your air support cards, Skeleton Dragons take care of swarms, and the Inferno Dragon can handle the tanks or mini-tanks. Like the LavaLoon deck we showcased earlier, you'll want to start your push with the Lava Hound behind the King Tower. Try to time your push in a way that Royal Chef gives your Lava Hound the level-up buff as soon as you place it on your side of the arena.

  Lava Hound decks in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Clash Royale

  </strong>
  can take a while to get used to, especially if you're a cycle deck player. It takes a slower approach to the game, focusing on building up an overwhelming push from the back instead of chipping down the HP of the opponent's towers. The decks we mentioned should give you a solid foundation to start. But it's also important to try out your own card combination to see what works best for your playstyle.

      Astro Bot is receiving critical acclaim for its gameplay and references to iconic PlayStation franchises.
     </li>
     <li>
      Despite positive reviews, Astro Bot and the PS5 are falling short in Japanese retail sales, with only under 12,700 and 9,097 copies sold.
     </li>
     <li>
      Potential factors for the low sales include increased PS5 prices in Japan and a lack of data on digital sales.

  The latest Japanese sales report paints some troubling news for PlayStation, especially when it comes to the recently released
  <strong>
   <em>
    Astro Bot
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Developer Team Asobi released
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  as a follow-up to 2018’s
  <em>
   Astro Bot Rescue Mission
  </em>
  and 2020’s
  <em>
   Astro’s Playroom
  </em>
  earlier this month, with this latest entry in the budding series being a full-scale platformer celebrating 30 years of the PlayStation brand. In
  <em>
   Astro Bot,
  </em>
  players control the cute robot Astro, who needs to gather the broken parts of his PS5-like spaceship by journeying across planets inspired by various PlayStation games.

 <p>
  Ever since its release on the PS5 on September 6,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  has been met with glowing reviews for its impressive graphics, innovative platforming gameplay, and a plethora of references and cameos from beloved PlayStation franchises like
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Crash Bandicoot
  </em>
  , and more.
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  has even managed to become the highest-rated first-party PS5 game, outranking past hits like
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  on review aggregate websites like OpenCritic. Additionally, people are already predicting that
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  will be a contender for Game of the Year at The Game Awards this December.

 <p>
  However, it looks like
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  is falling short in Japanese game sales, at least according to the latest report from Famitsu (via Gematsu). In its listing for retail software sales for the week of September 2, 2024 to September 8, 2024,
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  came in second place at under 12,700 copies sold, right behind
  <em>
   Touhou Danmaku Kagura: Phantasia Lost
  </em>
  at 16,631 units. This is a low showing for a first-party PlayStation release in Japan, but it should be noted that this list only counts physical copies sold at retailers.

 <p>
  Meanwhile, the PlayStation 5 console itself is also slipping in Japanese retail sales, only ranking third place at 9,097 units sold. This places it just behind the Nintendo Switch OLED and handheld Nintendo Switch Lite, and is a considerable drop from the previous week’s reporting. A possible factor in this decrease in retail sales could be the recent spike in PS5 prices in Japan, which was announced late last month as a response to the global economic situation.

 <p>
  It should be noted that these recent PS5 and
  <em>
   <strong>
    Astro Bot
   </strong>
  </em>
  sales numbers only pertain to physical copies sold at retailers in Japan, and that the latter might fare better in digital sales and copies ordered from online retailers like Amazon. As the positive word-of-mouth surrounding
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
   </em>
  </strong>
  continues to spread, the hit mascot platformer could also see a rise in physical units sold in Japan as the weeks go on, but so far it is off to a slow start.

  The Walking Dead: Road to Terminus involves players earning specific amounts of XP instead of completing challenges. All players need to do is
  <strong>
   play Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone matches
  </strong>
  to begin unlocking the rewards.

 <p>
  XP in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is distributed by in-game performance. Scoring
  <strong>
   high amounts of kills or keeping hold of the objective for extended lengths of time
  </strong>
  is a surefire way of racking up tens of thousands with ease.

 <p>
  For
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  , scoring kills also generates plenty of XP alongside completing contracts during matches. High placements also help.

 <p>
  There are some ways where players can earn XP at a faster rate.
  <strong>
   Using the Daryl Dixon Operator
  </strong>
  grants players a boost. The only drawback to this is that players have to purchase the skin from the in-game store.

  Max Battles allow players to battle Dynamax Pokemon. Winners of the Max Battle get a guaranteed encounter with the Dynamax Pokemon they defeated. You also get different in-game items as rewards for winning.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Dynamax Pokemon debut brought several new mechanics to the game. Players can use Max Moves, collect Max Particles, and engage in Max Battles. These Max Battles happen in Power Spots against Dynamax Pokemon Bosses, but there are numerous rules you must follow. That said, this guide details everything you must know about Max Battles.

 <p>
  Only
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Dynamax Pokemon can participate, and Regular Pokemon are ineligible for Max Battles.
  <strong>
   Four trainers can join a Power Spot Boss battle
  </strong>
  simultaneously as a team, each bringing up to
  <strong>
   three Dynamax Pokemon
  </strong>
  . While three Dynamax Pokemon is the limit, you can still participate with just one Dynamax Pokemon.

  You need
  <strong>
   Max Particles to join a Max Battle
  </strong>
  , with the amount varying by the battle's star rating (e.g.,
  <strong>
   250 for a 1-star battle
  </strong>
  ). Max Particles are only consumed if you win, so you can retry the battle without losing particles if you fail. It is important to upgrade your Dynamax Pokemon's Max Moves in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , as higher-star Power Spot Bosses are more challenging.

 <p>
  Unlike raids or GO Battle League, the
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Max Battles have a turn-based system which requires an even more strategic approach. The attacking steps are the same: Fast Attacks build energy for Charged Attacks while filling the Max Meter at the top. You can fill the meter faster by swiping energy icons during the match.

  When the
  <strong>
   Max Meter fills
  </strong>
  , you can
  <strong>
   Dynamax your Pokemon for three turns
  </strong>
  . One can switch which Pokemon to Dynamax by selecting another team member before the countdown ends. During
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  Dynamax, you have three turns to use your Pokemon's Max Moves.
  <strong>
   Each move counts as one turn
  </strong>
  , and the
  <strong>
   move's cooldown acts as your timer
  </strong>
  . You can let it play automatically, select it yourself, or choose another attack. Your chances to win can boost if you farm and use Max Particles to unlock and level up the Max Moves.

 <p>
  After three turns, your Pokemon returns to its original form but can Dynamax again. But you must watch for three lines above your Pokemon's head, indicating it is targeted for an attack, and dodge to avoid damage. In three-star or higher Max Battles, if all your Pokemon faint, you can still cheer for other
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  trainers on your team. This speeds up their Dynamax meters, helping them defeat the Power Spot Boss while you’re out.

  </strong>
  may be nearing the end of its run and while not overextending itself is probably for the best, it’ll be upsetting if Insomniac doesn’t get a proper chance to adapt many more of Spider-Man’s greatest comic book stories.
  <em>
   Miles Morales
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  wore their story influences on their sleeve, for instance, whereas
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  seems to have its antagonists and story wrapped in a delicate bow already. Of course, there’s always a chance that the third installment introduces a bunch of side characters whose role is to fill out substantial side content in the open world.

  <em>

  ’s optional side quests are a terrific balance of friendly-neighborhood community service and cinematic villain encounters, which is something
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man
  </em>
  ’s open world sorely lacked. The original game had tons of side quests, to be fair, but all of them besides the mission featuring Tombstone tackled relatively trivial issues in the city. Some of these moments are genuinely fun and heartfelt, but they are overwhelmingly concerned with random New York City citizens and are largely forgettable;
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  will need to consider its side quest balance accordingly.

  went overboard with its side quests and tripled down on villains they would debut or have players subdue, potentially in response to players being disappointed by how the original game left nearly no villains for its optional side quests. Indeed,
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man
  </em>
  ’s story campaign is brimming with antagonists, sometimes to a fault. The balance there is that side missions could be where slower, more pedestrian sequences take place, though such quests unfortunately need to be profoundly moving, well-written, or dynamic in order to outweigh anything related to an arch-nemesis of Spider-Man’s.

  Some side quests are brief but surprisingly lore-rich; for example, “Photo Help” is an unassuming quest that allows players to experience a flashback sequence with a young Peter Parker, who’s desperately trying to bike through New York City traffic on time to meet with J. Jonah Jameson about selling photographs of Spider-Man to The Daily Bugle. Further, “Graffiti Trouble” lends players Hailey Cooper’s perspective with no sound at all, inventive means of communication, and an expression of thoughts via pop-up emojis.

 <p>
  The throughline between the first game and its sequel with Howard and his pigeons is phenomenal while listening to an elderly man speak about his granddaughter and late wife is a strike to the gut that no villain could deliver as devastatingly. However, the villain-related side missions and citywide activities tend to obscure them.

 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  should definitely continue this trend of having multiple villain-related quests as optional missions in its open world, and if Insomniac deems those to be more positively received than others it might be best if they overthrow more street-level activities or FNSM app requests that could end up feeling like bloat.

  It’s still uncertain if
  <em>
   Marvel’s Spider-Man 3
  </em>
  will be the final Insomniac
  <em>
   Spider-Man
  </em>
  game. If it is, it should let loose and throw in the kitchen sink to ensure it doesn’t leave anything on the cutting room floor that would be great for closure in its continuity. Otherwise, if Insomniac can balance the epic scale it’s introduced with the humble scale it began the franchise with, it could have something quite special on its hands.

      <title>How Funko Fusion Turns IPs Into Worlds</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Funko Fusion
   </strong>
  </em>
  begins in a humble Funko POP factory but quickly takes players to a series of fantastical worlds from beloved films, TV shows, and more. From the icy Arctic wasteland of
  <em>
   The Thing
  </em>
  to the sinister suburbia of
  <em>
   Hot Fuzz, Funko Fusion
  </em>
  lets players experience their favorite media in a brand-new way. Alongside a cast of POP-styled characters, players will explore multiple worlds unlocking characters, upgrades, weapons, and more in their quest to help Freddy Funko defeat his evil doppelgänger. Eddy.

 <p>
  The 10:10 Games team enjoyed designing these levels - when asked about the process, animation director Andy Dolan enthusiastically responded that it was "a lot of fun." Dolan explained that the process was made easier because the team were already huge fans of many of the IPs they included in the game, and considered it an honor to translate these characters and worlds into video game form.

  Dolan described the process of creating worlds and levels once each of the IPs had been decided on. He emphasized the team really focused on recreating iconic, memorable moments from each IP: Doc Brown harnessing a lightning strike in
  <em>
   Back to the Future,
  </em>
  Scott Pilgrim competing in the Battle of the Bands, and many more. The team also made sure to focus on making each level funny, harnessing the inherent humor in the Funko POPs' unique proportions and movement.

   "As a fan, you are so desperate to do the franchise justice. But as a designer, you have to be aware that, ultimately, this is a game, and sometimes one might need to sacrifice for the other. The skill is blending the two, so both sides work as well as they can together."

  The result of the team's work is a series of worlds that
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  players can explore in any order, collecting characters, weapons, and abilities as they go. The team hinted that each world is filled with secrets and Easter eggs referencing the IP, encouraging players to thoroughly explore to discover everything hidden within.
  <em>
  </em>
  Even the game's original world, the Funko POP factory where Freddy resides, is filled with secrets and fun surprises that players can explore when
  <em>
   Funko Fusion
  </em>
  launches.

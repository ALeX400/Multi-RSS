  Update v30.20 added Fortnite Reload to
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fortnite
   </strong>
  </em>
  in order to give fans the opportunity to relive the Chapter 1 map once again, even if it has major changes. Since then, players have been enjoying their time with the weapons and locations that they once knew.

  To celebrate its release, when this game mode went live,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  added a set of quests for gamers to complete and rewards for those who participated. This guide will tell players everything they need to know about the Fortnite Reload Quests and rewards.

  When Fortnite Reload went live for the first time so did its quests. Fortnite Reload is completely separate from
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  Battle Royale, as it's set in a remixed version of the Chapter 1 map and players continue to respawn until it's disabled in the late game or their squad is eliminated all at once. Here are the nine quests available in Fortnite Reload:

  These quests don't have a deadline at the moment, so players can take their time getting through them. Nevertheless, Fortnite Reload Quests can be completed naturally simply by playing the game mode so it shouldn't take too long to finish all of them.

  Food is central to any respectable Hobbit's life, and will likely play a large role in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Tales of the Shire
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Although Hobbits are suspicious of food from outside their borders,
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  shows that their suspicions are allayed if the food is delicious and comforting.

 <p>
  Because
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  is about establishing Bywater as a village in the Shire, players may have the opportunity to take ingredients from across Middle-earth and turn them into new recipes that become staples of both Bywater and the Shire at large. This mechanic would go a long way towards broadening the world of
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  without the need for a larger map.

  Tales of the Shire Should Offer Dishes from Around Middle-earth
 </h3>
 <p>
  With the possibility of trade, players should have access to a variety of ingredients and even ready-made dishes from across Middle-earth. Some of the peoples of Middle-earth, such as the dwarves and elves, are very insular and protective of their culture, and are reluctant to share the recipes of their most famous foods. In cases such as these, Hobbits should still be able to buy the completed dish, as many of these meals are designed to be shelf-stable, such as lembas.

 <p>
  Middle-earth is a land mass based on Europe, with forests covering mountains, and wide plains containing a variety of grasses. As the climate is cool, many of the foods seen in
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  are hearty and warm, such as stews and bread. Because of the European inspiration, many of the dishes in Middle-earth are also based on food from Northern Europe.
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  needs to reach beyond both the Shire and Middle-earth to revolutionize Hobbit cuisine.

  Lembas, an elven bread wrapped in leaves, is possibly the most well-known food unique to
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  . It's designed to stay fresh for months if it remains unbroken in its original packaging, and tastes delicious. Other breads that travel well include cram, a bread similar to lembas but not as tasty and made by Men, and honey cakes, made by the skin-changer Beorn and his kin.

  Different roots are the specialty of the dwarves, and it may be possible that they brought potatoes to the Shire. Different varieties of potatoes may be on offer, along with the default white potato seen in
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  movies. Along with different foods, there are also unique drinks that could be consumed on their own, or used as an ingredient as a part of a larger meal. Ent-draught, seen in
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
  </em>
  , is an incredibly refreshing and invigorating drink that revitalizes the soul. The elves also make a similar drink, miruvor, that is said to be even more refreshing. While Ent-draught is very similar to fresh spring water, miruvor is a warming cordial that is very distinct in taste and appearance from water. Both would be great additions to any Hobbit's home.

  If there is a traveling tradesman, there may be the chance to trade for spices that originate from lands beyond Middle-earth. With new ingredients, creating new recipes by combining different ingredients should be possible. Successful dishes could become the centerpiece at dinner parties, and perhaps become new staples in the Shire.

 <p>
  This is also an opportunity to bring more diverse and interesting food to Middle-earth. As player Hobbits become more accustomed to farming, foraging, fishing, trading, and cooking, the diversity of meals available for creation should be expanded. Experimentation is a great way to express creativity in the kitchen and is often how many family-favorite meals are created.

  Bethesda is well-known for hiding little secrets in its games, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  is no different. From
  <em>
   Breaking Bad
  </em>
  references to a nod to the studio's massive hit game
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  <em>
   76
  </em>
  has lots of Easter eggs for players to stumble across while exploring the ruins of post-war Appalachia.

  The Skyline Valley update has brought in lots of new quests, events, and a whole new region for players to explore. There are also a couple of hidden secrets surrounding the new area, one of which is a fairly big one. In the update, there is a whole unmarked mystery surrounding the Steel Jack Statues that are dotted all over the Skyline Valley Region. For a walkthrough on how to collect the clues and solve this mystery, read on.

  To start this unmarked hidden storyline, head to the Shenandoah Visitor Center and go inside the restroom. In the stall on the left, you'll see a first aid box on the wall.
  <strong>
   Inside the first aid box is a note: Bee's Diary, Page 1.

  This note was left by a former employee who wrote about his experiences. In the letter, the employee mentions the Steel Jack Statues and questions what they are all pointing at. The note finishes with Bee mentioning an interesting trail that heads off to the side of the Slumber Mill, which may be worth sneaking off to and exploring.

  After reading this note, head to an unmarked region slightly northeast of High Knob Lookout. See the image above for the exact location. Be careful, as there tend to be a couple of Yao Guai that roam around this area.

  Once you have arrived, you'll come across a picnic area. Next to the picnic area, there's a wooden path. Follow it, and you'll come across a Steel Jack Statue pointing northwest. It's worth noting that there is a Cap Stash at the base of the statue, and a Bobblehead spawn point next to the Cap Stash. Head northwest in the direction that the statue is pointing.
  <strong>
   To the right of the picnic benches, there will be a large hollow tree stump.
  </strong>
  If you look inside, you'll find Page 2 of Bee's Diary, along with some Caps and some random aid items.

  In the note, Bee talks about sneaking off and wandering down the trail before being radioed to get back to work. He also mentions that he'll come back another time to explore more of the area.

  After reading the second note, head to another unmarked location east of Naked Creek. To find it, fast travel to Naked Creek and head east until you reach a dirt path.
  <strong>
   Follow the dirt path, and you'll come to another Steel Jack Statue.
  </strong>
  It's pretty difficult to miss, as it's at the top of the hill.

 <p>
  The Steel Jack Statue points southeast, so head in that direction. About 10 paces from the statue, you'll find a park ranger's corpse propped up against a tree. Just behind the ranger is another hollowed-out tree stump that contains a few random items and Page 3 of Bee's Diary. According to the entry, Bee is having issues with his job and is planning to go and have lunch at a rocky pass with a beautiful tree splitting the road. This clue leads you to the next location.

  To find the next location, fast travel to Old Rag Lookout and head towards South River Bridge.
  <strong>
   The Steel Jack Statue is very easy to spot, as it's located in a clearing.
  </strong>
  See the image above for the exact location.

  This Steel Jack Statue is pointing northwest. Turn so that the marker for Old Rag Lookout is in the center of your compass. Then, head straight and go between the Bear Proof Trashcan and the picnic benches. You'll come across a hollowed-out rock that contains Page 4 of Bee's Diary.

 <p>
  In this diary extract, Bee explains how Chief Piker warned him that the park is too dangerous to be wandering without telling anyone. Despite Chief Piker instructing a couple of other employees to watch over Bee, Bee ditched the other employees and decided to head to a place with a rocky overview. Bee also mentions that there is a plan to place a Steel Jack Statue on a wooden walkway that wouldn't be able to take the statue's weight.

  The next note is located just north of the Abandoned Convoy.
  <strong>
   It's pretty easy to find, as it contains a Steel Jack Statue that has fallen through the wooden floor it was placed on.
  </strong>
  It turns out that Bee was right. The statue was far too heavy for the walkway, and it fell right through it.

 <p>
  The statue is pointing towards a bridge to the west; head towards it. Behind the bridge, you'll see a tree leaning over the water. Climb up the tree, and you'll find a duffel bag containing Page 5 of Bee's Diary, some Caps, and a few other random items. Bee writes about his frustration regarding the poorly installed Steel Jack Statue. The note ends with Bee explaining how he has left a small trinket cache in a stump next to the resting area marked with an axe.

      <title>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is Showing Princess Peach: Showtime How It's Done</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-princess-peach-showtime-gameplay-design/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  As part of the June 2024 Nintendo Direct,
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans were shocked to find out that a new
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  spin-off was only three months away, and that's not all. For the first time since the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  CD-i games, Princess Zelda herself takes the spotlight as the sole protagonist of
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  . After one of Link’s typical quests to defeat Ganon goes awry, Zelda is forced to venture through a slowly disappearing Hyrule in his stead.
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is set to fulfill many long-standing fan requests, and it's not holding back.

 <p>
  It's a surprise to see a brand-new
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  title looking this fleshed-out so soon after 2023's
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , especially with a Nintendo Switch successor allegedly nearby. Due to the high-profile name attached to it, one could have expected
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  to be saved for that console’s launch window, or at least be cross-gen, but it appears to be launching alongside
  <em>
   Mario and Luigi: Brothership
  </em>
  as 2024's last major Switch games. Seeing
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  's titular princess be treated to an exciting adventure of her own feels great, especially if it means bigger things for another Nintendo princess’ next outing.

 <p>
  Back in March 2024, Nintendo Switch owners were treated to another spin-off oriented around one of Nintendo's lead heroines, with this instance belonging to the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  franchise. For the third time ever, Princess Peach appeared as the lone playable character in
  <em>
   Princess Peach: Showtime
  </em>
  , following up the 1990 game-watch title
  <em>
   Princess Toadstool's Castle Run
  </em>
  and 2005’s DS-exclusive
  <em>
   Super Princess Peach
  </em>
  . Seeing Peach in the driver's seat was a rare treat for many long-time fans, so there was a lot of hype leading up to its launch.

  Princess Peach’s Big Moment Didn't Feel Fittingly Ambitious
 </h3>
 <p>
  Only, it didn't live up to that hype. Little was wrong with the game; many would agree that a variety of theater productions is a great idea for a
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  title, and that was executed superbly here. Where issues arose were in
  <em>
   Princess Peach: Showtime
  </em>
  's identity as a Princess Peach game, rather than a
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game built around Peach. It opted for a rotating series of gameplay styles instead of building up core mechanics like many
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  titles are known for, and their low complexity never produced anything especially memorable. Plenty have enjoyed their time with
  <em>
   Princess Peach: Showtime
  </em>
  , but the Princess’ first solo console outing could have been so much more.

  Enter
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  , a game that would feel like a response to
  <em>
   Princess Peach: Showtime
  </em>
  if they weren't so close together. Unlike
  <em>
   Showtime
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is a typical
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  game through-and-through, to the point where it could be mistaken for a mainline entry if they still used top-down angles.
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is a top-down
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  with the
  <em>
   Link's Awakening
  </em>
  remake's art style, and not only will it provide fans with the Zelda-starring classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  they've been asking for, it will have even more to offer.

 <p>
  This ambition is fulfilled by the new Echo mechanic, which is already drawing comparisons to the game-defining Ultrahand ability from
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . With it, Zelda will be able to do everything Link can, but without a sword and shield to ensure she feels distinct. The subtle brilliance of this mechanic is how it aligns with the Triforce of Wisdom, while just as easily fitting into Link’s arsenal in any other
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game. When Princess Peach gets another entry for herself, hopefully it can include a clever twist on regular
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  gameplay like
  <strong>
   <em>
    Echoes of Wisdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  , and feel all the more exciting for it.

  Whether you're a beginner or an experienced player, getting some free gold and diamonds is always a plus. You can spend it on upgrading your characters, unlocking new ones, or buying the necessary items and equipment to be more effective in battle. Luckily, the developers are generous and often add new
  <em>
   AFK Journey
  </em>
  codes so you can use them and progress more quickly.

  </em>
  codes is not difficult, and compared to most other games of this genre, you can do it directly in the game, rather than in a browser. Before you can redeem the codes, you will need to complete the tutorial, which will take a total of 5–10 minutes, depending on whether you skip dialogue. After clearing the tutorial, you'll be free to follow these detailed instructions on how to redeem the codes in

 <ul>
  <li>
   After launching the game, pay attention to the lower-right corner. There will be a button with three lines on the icon and you should click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you do this, you will be taken to a new menu with many options and buttons.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the lower-right corner of this menu, you will notice a button with a gear icon. Click on it to open the settings menu.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you open the settings menu, you will notice many different options and several tabs that you can switch between in the top section of the menu. Among these tabs, interact with the last one that says Other.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you open this tab, you will again see plenty of buttons that are divided into three sections.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the second section, called Others, there will be a Promo Code button. It is the last one in the first row and you have to click on it.
  </li>
  <li>
   After doing this, you will open the redemption menu, where there will be an input field and two buttons, one with a cross and the other with a check mark. Now, enter manually, or better yet, copy and paste one of the above active codes into the input field.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once you've done that, click on the green checkmark button to submit your reward request.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you did everything correctly, you will see a notification on the screen listing the rewards you have received.
  </li>
 </ul>

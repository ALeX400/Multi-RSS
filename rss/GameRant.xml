  Luminescent Seeds are a new type of destination material in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  that's exclusive to the Pale Heart. Guardians may find their pockets full of these little seeds, and while they might not seem like much, they are actually very helpful when cleansing the Traveler of invaders.

  <strong>

  campaign missions, things don't end there. Players have more content to experience in the Pale Heart itself, and Luminescent Seeds can make fighting bad guys a little bit easier.

  Luminescent Seeds are consumable items that can be used in specific spots around
  <em>
   Destiny 2's
  </em>
  Pale Heart zone. Players can get these by finishing three levels of the Overthrow activity in the Pale Heart and beating the boss that appears in the final wave. Open the chest that appears after defeating them to get a seed.

  To use a Luminescent Seed, you'll need to approach one of the black hand clusters in the Landing, the Blooming, or the Impasse. You can easily find them by following the Ghost icons on your screen. The icons pop up whenever you're close to one of them. After that, interact with the hand to plant the seed, and a small shrub made of Light will appear.

  The luminescent plants alone won't do anything for you. To get any real value out of them, you need to get Pale Blessings, a type of Destination Mod that only affects Guardians inside the Pale Heart. Pale Blessings can be obtained by opening chests within the Pale Heart.

All available Pale Blessings in your inventory will be highlighted on the wheel to the right — pick a blessing that you want to use and interact with the flower you planted to activate the buff you selected. You can only have one Pale Blessing active at a time, and these last only for five minutes.

 <p>
  Ubisoft's commitment to expanding
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  doesn't stop at new content. In response to player feedback, the development team is making significant changes to sniper rifles, which many players have found to be overpowered. The upcoming
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  update is supposed to introduce flinch mechanics to make it more challenging to maintain accuracy while taking hits, aiming to balance the gameplay without removing the one-shot kill potential that many players enjoy.

 <p>
  Another area of player feedback that Ubisoft has promised to address involves the controversial bunny hopping mechanic in
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  . Players have found this movement technique disruptive and unbalanced, making it difficult to land accurate shots. To address these concerns, an aim-sway penalty will be implemented, ensuring that while skilled movement remains part of the game, it does not unfairly disadvantage other players. This change is part of Ubisoft's ongoing efforts to refine
  <em>
   XDefiant
  </em>
  based on player input and maintain a fair, competitive environment. As
  <em>
   <strong>
    XDefiant
   </strong>
  </em>
  evolves, its ability to adapt to player needs and innovate could secure its place in the competitive FPS market.

  is researching the various Ammunition Projects available at the Research Lab. There is a lab found on the Frontier, in the basement of the Lodge, and in multiple buildings throughout the game. There are three tiers of Ammunition projects, and each tier unlocks a variety of ammo crafting at any Industrial Workbench. Completing one tier will unlock the next. The three levels of Ammunition Projects are:

   craft ammo in

  Each type of ammo requires several unique materials for crafting, most of which will be familiar to you by now. However, there are four new materials that are used both in the Research Projects, and in crafting the ammo itself:

   UC Distribution

  and the

  </strong>

  <strong>
   Centurion Arsenal

   Neon Tactical
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Kore Kinetics
  </strong>
  very close to the Trade Authority and
  <strong>
   Newill's Goods
  </strong>
  . They are not expensive, with each pack rarely costing over 100 credits. Look for the main cities in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , as that is where you will find the most resources.

  An 8-year-old was rewarded with a Master Sword replica after beating
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
   </em>
  </strong>
  . There are plenty of ways to teach a player the value of completing a video game, especially with a game as large as
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom
  </em>
  . As exciting as the experience may be for seasoned gamers, it's plausible that an 8-year-old may have a harder time staying focused. Gifts can be a great motivator.

 <p>
  It has become somewhat of a trend for
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans to create real life replicas of artifacts from the games. Recently, one player made replicas of the stuffed plushes that can be found in
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  . There are so many different sections of
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  that offer unique ideas and designs that players could spend just as much time making replicas as they could playing the game.

  In a social media post, linuxknight shares a picture of a 3D printed Master Sword they rewarded their 8-year-old son with for completing
  <em>
   Tears of The Kingdom
  </em>
  . An apple is included in the picture for scale, but the fruit barely takes up the same amount of space that the Triforce does on the sword. Splitting the work between the two printers that linuxknight used, the sword took approximately 30 hours to print. The impressive design is something that linuxknight's son will be able to hold on to for years, and it may inspire the child to keep playing
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games to collect more items.

 <p>
  Linuxknight shares with
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  fans that they intend to complete a scabbard for the sword, as well as a mount for the design, which may be too large for an 8-year-old to carry around on their own, depending on the material used. In addition, Linuxknight states that they didn't need to paint the sword, and that the filament provided the color. This likely required precise work when coming up with the design. More commentary from the gamer reveals what may have inspired them to put together such an intricate piece of work.

  LinuxKnight further reveals that they've played all the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games, and that they have been a fan since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System. If a game inspires a player to become this passionate, it makes sense that once they become a parent, they might want to share that hobby with their child. An added perk of this is having another fan to discuss theories about the lore and hopes for future

  <strong>
   <em>
    No Man’s Sky
   </em>
  </strong>
  has the dubious honor of being one of the most-hated space games immediately post-launch. Yet despite this notoriously rocky start, the game is still going strong almost a decade later. Hello Games has earned the respect of the
  <em>
   NMS
  </em>
  community by addressing all the launch issues, and constantly delivering fresh new content for free.

  New content in this game comes in the form of major updates, the latest of which is the
  <strong>
   Adrift
  </strong>
  update. This brings some new items to the game, and a great new expedition in a deserted universe. Overall, this is one of the better
  <em>
   No Man’s Sky
  </em>
  updates, and has been well received by the player base. Here's what gamers love about it most.

  The
  <em>

  : Orbital update added ship customization to the game. This includes both the design of the ship, and also the paint job. The
  <em>
   No Man’s Sky: Adrift

  update builds on this new addition, by giving players a new paint job as a reward.

  The new stealth paint has a camouflaged look, and can be applied to any ship that the player currently owns. This is one of the best rewards given out in this update, especially for players that lack the artistic flair to design their own using the ship customization terminal.

  One of the most enjoyable aspects of
  <em>
   No Man’s Sky,
  </em>
  for many players, is the base building mechanics. Bases are functional, and are even required to achieve certain goals in the game. However, nobody wants to live in an unattractive base. Players can use the various decorations to place around their base, helping to spruce it up.

  <em>

  Players who complete certain goals in the new expedition that forms part of the
  <em>
   No Man’s Sky: Adrift
  </em>
  update will receive an Appalling Egg as a reward. This isn’t just an oddity or decoration, it is a live egg that can hatch a Gnawing Scuttler, a type of player-owned pet.

 <p>
  The Gnawing Scuttler is vaguely insect-like in terms of looks, but it does have some possibilities once it has been fully raised and trained. It can adapt to either the Nightmarish or Soul-Consuming states. Depending on which of these traits it evolves to have, it could become quite good over time.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   No Man’s Sky: Adrift
  </em>
  update gives players a completely new way to experience the game. This comes in the form of an alternate reality, where there are no other sentient beings anywhere. The player is completely alone.

 <p>
  There are still buildings, space stations, and other locations where NPCs would be located, but they are all empty and derelict. Although it can be quite pleasant not to keep bumping into funny-looking NPCs, this game mode does add some challenges. For example, the player won’t be able to purchase items from vendors, or take missions, since there's nobody to sell items or give objectives.

  update introduced player-owned freighters to

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   No Man’s Sky: Adrift
  </em>
  , the player can unlock a brand-new frigate to add to their fleet. This is a unique ghost ship frigate, which has a spooky, vaporous look about it. Despite its odd looks, it is incredibly capable, being an S class capital ship. It is a great new addition to any player’s freighter fleet.

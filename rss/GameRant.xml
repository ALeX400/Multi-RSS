  Valve has released a brand-new update for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Counter-Strike 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , which fixes an unintentionally hilarious glitch that the developer accidentally added in another recent patch. The latest
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  update fixes several small issues, although players have honed in on one particular change in this patch.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  is the latest iteration of the long-running series, and arguably the best tactical FPS of all time. Other games have come for the crown over the years, but very few have had any staying power, with players often choosing to return for their
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  fix. The series is now over 25 years old, which is incredible longevity for any series, let alone one that started life as a mod for the original
  <em>
   Half-Life
  </em>
  . As one of the most popular games on Steam on a daily basis,
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  isn't going anywhere.

  The latest set of
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  patch notes were pretty brief overall, but the most significant change is actually fixing a bug it unintentionally added a few days prior. On January 7, an update was released that "Fixed a regression in grenade interactions with ragdolls." This created a brand-new "feature," where players would often be sent flying across the
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  maps when killed, regardless of the way they were hit. It was an absolutely hilarious glitch for the few days it was present in the game, with Valve even referencing it in a tweet after fixing it, stating, "We will always have the memories." As fun as it was, it did need to be resolved, as it didn't exactly suit
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  's serious nature.
 </p>
 <p>
  This wasn't the only big change made in the latest
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  update. A few playability changes were made to the classic map Train, which was recently reintroduced to the game after not making the jump in the transition between
  <em>
   CS:GO
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   CS2
  </em>
  . This is in anticipation of Train being reintroduced to the competitive map pool in place of Vertigo, which will affect both the
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  esports scene and the game's Premier mode for regular players. Gamers should expect further changes to Train as Valve continues to refine the map for competitive play.

  Despite its overall gameplay premise remaining the same for the best part of 25 years,
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  has never been a game to rest on its laurels, and that hasn't changed with
  <em>
   CS2
  </em>
  . Valve continues to support the game with new maps, and frequent changes to help make the game feel a little more like
  <em>
   Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
  </em>
  , which to many, remains the pinnacle of the series. There's even a community of talented
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  modders, who support the game with maps and modes of their own to help keep the community active and happy. No doubt,
  <em>
   Counter-Strike 2
  </em>
  has a extremely positive future ahead.

  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  is on its way to the
  <strong>
   Switch 2
  </strong>
  , a well-established industry insider has said. The same source believes that at least one more
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game has already been greenlit for Nintendo's upcoming console.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first game in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  remake trilogy originally launched for the PS4 in April 2020. An enhanced edition of the game called
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade
  </em>
  debuted on the PS5 in June 2021 before making its way to PC in December of the same year.
 </p>
 <p>
  The critically acclaimed JRPG is now also in the works for the Switch 2, according to well-known leaker NateTheHate, who said as much during the January 10 episode of his podcast. The second game in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  remake trilogy,
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  , will be coming to Nintendo's next console as well, the insider said.

 <h2 id="ff7-remake-and-rebirth-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-xbox">
  FF7 Remake and Rebirth Are Also Reportedly Coming to Xbox
 </h2>
 <p>
  NateTheHate framed the purported Switch 2 ports of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  as part of Square Enix's multi-platform publishing push, which the Japanese gaming giant announced in May 2024. In addition to Nintendo's upcoming console, both games are also on their way to the Xbox Series X/S, the long-time leaker said.
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  is planned to land on Microsoft's current-gen consoles in 2025, while
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  will follow suit in 2026, as per the same source. NateTheHate did not specify the games' Switch 2 launch windows, but it's plausible that they will mirror the Xbox release schedule he laid out. While these alleged ports suggest the possibility of the trilogy's third game also going multi-platform, this won’t happen on day one, as Sony has already secured timed exclusivity rights for all three games.

 </div>
 <p>
  When exactly the new versions of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  may be confirmed is unclear. NateTheHate speculates that at least one of them might be announced at the 2025 Xbox Developer Direct, which is scheduled to take place on January 23. The Switch 2 ports obviously can't be confirmed before the console itself is officially revealed, which Nintendo promised would happen before the end of its fiscal year 2024, which runs until March 31. While new mainline entries in Square Enix's iconic series have consistently skipped the Switch, the Japanese publisher has still extensively supported Nintendo's hybrid console, which has received 16
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  titles to date, ranging from
  <em>
   FF15 Pocket Edition HD
  </em>
  in September 2018 to the first six
  <em>
   FF
  </em>
  games in April 2023.

  Elsewhere during the episode, NateTheHate claimed that
  <em>
   Halo: The Master Chief Collection
  </em>
  is on its way to the Switch 2 and PS5. Ditto for
  <em>
   Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
  </em>
  . Both ports are reportedly planned to hit the market sometime in 2025, the leaker said.

  still has no release date in sight. With silence continuing as director Tetsuya Nomura and the Square Enix team have been occupied with various other major projects, it seems clear that the title could be following the pattern of long development cycles between entries. Given the pattern of promotional periods ahead of the main games in the series,
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  still has the chance to be shown off throughout this year.

 <p>
  There have been relatively consistent releases over the years since
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  began, but the numbered titles have always seen the largest gaps between announcement and eventual launch. While there's still the potential for
  <em>
   KH4
  </em>
  to take as long as
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  's extended production timeline, several events set to take place this year could be where trailers make their debuts.

  Tetsuya Nomura's Comments on Finishing the Series Indicate a Lengthy Timeline is Still on the Table
 </h3>
 <p>
  Following Nomura's statements on the future of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  in a 2024 interview with Young Jump, it seems reasonable to assume that he could plan on being occupied with the series until his eventual retirement. Considering that he appears to be focused on
  <em>
   FF7
  </em>
  Remake's third part, ongoing support for
  <em>
   Rebirth
  </em>
  , the upcoming
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts Missing Link
  </em>
  , and possibly new projects at Square Enix, it's safe to say that his attention could have been mostly diverted from
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  over the last couple of years. While this doesn't mean a 2025 launch is out of the question entirely, it's unlikely that the next
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  will come without building up to its release date first.
 </p>
 <h3 id="following-in-the-footsteps-of-kh3-39-s-prolonged-hype-cycle">
  Following in the Footsteps of KH3's Prolonged Hype Cycle
 </h3>
 <p>
  It seems that the reveal of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  's new arc didn't come at a significant milestone in development, evoking the infamous wait for the third numbered entry of the series.
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  would see years of development following its initial teaser trailer, undergoing an engine change amid the launches of several other titles in the six years leading up to its release. Another connecting game was set to debut prior to the upcoming sequel, but its changed status could indicate a longer wait than expected.
 </p>

  Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link Could Be a Necessary Prerequisite

 <p>
  After originally being slated to come last year and bridge the gap between the previous and new eras, the delay of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts Missing Link
  </em>
  has potentially pushed
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  back. It was announced at the same time and has therefore been awaited for just as long, but it at least had a 2023 open beta that showcased its progress. This title is now seemingly slated for this year and its status remains as being possibly necessary set-up for the next game.

  Comparing the Release Timelines of the Franchise
 </h3>
 <p>
  Looking at the pattern of the promotional cycles associated with every major
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  title in the series, it's clear that the wait for
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  has already become one of the longest in the IP's history. It's been anticipated for a length of time that only the nearly six-year wait for
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  has outpaced it.
 </p>
 <p>
  There has been a focus on new
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  remasters and ports alike during both of these waiting periods, meaning the upcoming sequel could be following a similar roadmap with its promotion. A history of trailers dedicated to most
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  titles reveals that they premier consistently a year or two ahead of release has developed over time, so there would need to be some progress soon if a 2026 or 2027 launch is indeed being targeted.

  What a KH4 Trailer in 2025 is Likely to Contain
 </h3>
 <p>
  Given the precedent set by the promotion leading up to the launches of prior
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts
  </em>
  titles, the possible content of trailers this year is relatively predictable. While the main story and its core conflict could remain a mystery, it's safe to anticipate the reveal of several new Disney worlds in
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  and a preview of the new combat system. This would be in contrast to the seemingly CGI announcement trailer the game received, and will finally address whether Donald and Goofy will be returning as companions.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's a rumored Square Enix Presents set to take place in February, the first of the company's since E3 2021. This could be the ideal setting for a
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 4
  </em>
  gameplay showcase following its absence from last year's industry events. It would be surprising to see it once again sit out every major promotion opportunity for another year. Outside a first-party reveal, 2025 gaming events to look out for in the current post-E3 landscape include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Summer Games Fest (June)
  </li>
  <li>
   D23 Expo (August)
  </li>
  <li>

  The
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mario
   </em>
  </strong>
  games have come a long way since the series started back in 1985. Despite being around for several decades by this point,
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  is still seen by many as the king of the platforming genre, both in the 2D and 3D realms, but while there have been a lot of changes and alterations made throughout the series, there are also plenty of traditions. These can take the form of collectibles, enemies, or even gameplay mechanics that have helped forge the franchise's identity by appearing in many of the games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having an underlying thread of trends that pop up in almost every title also grants a sense of familiarity to players, letting them know right off the bat that this is still the same fun and vibrant series it has always been. However, when looking at specific traditions, these are among the ones Nintendo seems to prioritize the most.

 <p>
  Apparently, the idea of the pipes that appear in every
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  game was first conjured up by Shigeru Miyamoto, who came up with the concept after seeing a pipe sticking out of a wall while wandering the streets of Kyoto. Despite the rather unordinary inspiration, pipes have gone on to become a crucial tool for Mario and his friends in the games, since they are the primary method of transportation the plumber will use to get from A to B.
 </p>
 <p>
  The exact size of the pipes can vary wildly between games, and in
  <em>
   Mario Wonder
  </em>
  , some will even take on a life of their own as they crawl across the surface like a giant worm. The pipes themselves are a staple within the series, but additionally, the sound they make when someone enters or exits one has also been virtually untouched since they first appeared, filling longtime fans with a warm feeling of nostalgia upon hearing it.

  While players will usually start in the Mushroom Kingdom when kicking off the adventure in most games, as they progress through the adventure, they will eventually be free to explore entirely different worlds which can be accessed on the world map. These aren't just stages with slightly different backgrounds, but instead, totally unique environments that make players feel as though they are truly embarking on a globe-trotting adventure to try and take down the evil Bowser once and for all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the games have experimented with this tradition in their own unique ways, such as
  <em>
   Mario Galaxy
  </em>
  using planets instead of worlds, but the basic idea of transporting players to entirely different locales to keep the experience fresh and unpredictable has remained a core component of the gameplay for many, many years.

  Admittedly, there have been a handful of games where Bowser decided to take a day off from kidnapping Peach, but her kidnapping has happened in such a staggering number of entries that it has become one of the series' biggest traditions. Many of the games will start off the story by having Bowser kidnap Peach and take her away in an airship, setting up Mario's main objective for the adventure that awaits him.
 </p>
 <p>
  A popular fan theory is the reason Bowser is so obsessed with Peach is because he secretly wants to marry her, something which was more or less confirmed by
  <em>
   Super Mario Odyssey
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  movie. The truth is, no matter how many times Mario thwarts Bowser's plans, the King of the Koopas is always able to find a new way to steal Peach away for his satisfaction.

  The cute and cuddly dinosaur known as Yoshi would first debut in
  <em>
   Super Mario World
  </em>
  , where Mario can hop on his back for a ride, giving him a little extra movement speed and a double jump. Yoshi would become so popular that he would re-appear in nearly every mainline game going forward, including
  <em>
   Super Mario Sunshine
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Super Mario Wonder
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Super Mario Galaxy 2
  </em>
  after they were left absent from the original game.
 </p>
 <p>
  What may have started as a one-time gimmick has become one of the series' biggest traditions, with it being a given nowadays that a new
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  entry will feature a Yoshi at some point for players to take for a ride. The popularity of the Yoshi character and Yoshi species would lead to tons of spin-off games, alongside them appearing in the
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  games too.

  The Super Star is an ultimate power-up that grants whoever picks it up complete invincibility for a few seconds, and while it debuted in the very first game, it has appeared in the majority of the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  titles ever since. In many of the games, these little guys tend to hide away in blocks, forcing players to seek them out if they want to remain protected from enemy attacks and projectiles.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, in the case of games like
  <em>
   Mario Galaxy
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Mario Party
  </em>
  spinoff titles, they instead act as rewards players can earn through completing specific levels or tasks. No matter how they are used though, stars always play an important role in each of the games as valuable and powerful collectibles players are encouraged to strive for.

  No matter where Mario's next adventure takes him, whether it be a desert or a chilly icescape, there will always be at least a few Goombas along the way for him to squash. Goombas have become the most common enemy in the entire series, which makes sense since these are the first members of Bowser's army Mario encounters in the first entry back on the NES.
 </p>
 <p>
  While most Goombas will take the form of useless grunts who simply waddle back and forth, there's also the Goomba King in
  <em>
   Paper Mario
  </em>
  , who is a high-ranking member of Bowser's army, along with Goombella, who befriends Mario in
  <em>
   The Thousand-Year Door
  </em>
  . The Goombas have therefore stuck around for so long that Mario has even gotten to meet friendly versions of these stern-faced stepping stones.

  This tradition all started in the original
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros 3
  </em>
  with the Tanooki Suit, which gifted Mario more mobility and a higher jump distance. Since then, Mario and his pals have been able to jump into numerous kinds of suits that can completely change the way they play, giving them new attacks, abilities, and powers that are usually needed to progress through a tricky level.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, a Frog Suit, Penguin Suit, and even a Cat Suit - which was the main gimmick seen in
  <em>
   Super Mario 3D World
  </em>
  - were all introduced as power-ups inspired by the original Tanooki Suit back in the third game. They have since become a mainstay in the series which, alongside mushrooms, provide players with the boost they'll need to make it through a particular stage.

  First appearing in
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros
  </em>
  , mushrooms are an iconic power-up that Mario can use to grow in size, giving him an extra hit point in the process. While this is what the most basic Super Mushroom can do for Mario, there's been a plethora of others introduced throughout the series that can bolster his abilities in a few different ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Spring Mushroom which was introduced in
  <em>
   Super
  </em>
  <em>
   Mario Galaxy
  </em>
  , for example, will allow the plucky plumber to reach higher ground by transforming himself into a spunky spring. There's also the Mega Mushroom which, as the name implies, turns Mario into an enormous giant capable of sprinting through an entire stage, knocking down every block in his path as he goes. These are only a few examples of the many forms these items can take though, since there's no telling how Nintendo will decide to shake them up for each new game.

      <title>If Nothing Else, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Will Likely Be Top Notch in One Area</title>

  No stranger to controversy, Naughty Dog's reveal of its upcoming latest IP,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet
   </em>
  </strong>
  , has been met with what can best be described as a mixed reception. The debut trailer for
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  was flooded with negative reactions and suffered an unfavorable like-to-dislike ratio, prompting Naughty Dog to outright disable comments on YouTube. On the other side of the response to
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  's reveal is a contingent of fans who have high hopes that the game will maintain the same standard of polish and storytelling that Naughty Dog is known for. Regardless of which camp players fall into, there's little doubt that
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  's musical score will be an instant win for the title.

  In addition to briefly introducing players to the world and characters of
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  , the trailer dropped a bombshell by revealing that the title's original score would be composed by none other than Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. From what was shown of
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  's original, non-licensed music in the trailer, players can expect an evocative synth-laden score that carries many of the trademarks that Ross and Reznor are known for across their highly acclaimed and award-winning body of work. In terms of its soundtrack,
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  is already ahead of the curve.

  Though his more recent body of work primarily consists of official scores and soundtracks with composition partner Atticus Ross, Trent Reznor is perhaps best known for his pioneering work as the sole driving force behind Nine Inch Nails. While various artists including Ross have contributed to Nine Inch Nails' groundbreaking output throughout the years, the project is essentially a solo act with Reznor behind the helm, and the importance of Nine Inch Nails' contributions to industrial music and alternative rock can't be overstated. In his off time from Nine Inch Nails, Reznor has pivoted his artistic talents toward scoring films and games including the iconic soundtrack for
  <em>
   Quake
  </em>
  , with similar acclaim and success following in tow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ross and Reznor are fresh off of yet another award for the pair's work on the score to the film
  <em>
   Challengers
  </em>
  , with the recent Golden Globe win the 9th major award the duo have earned for their work. While Reznor and Ross' scores are unique and suited to each project, they share elements such as minimalistic, electronic composition meant to be evocative and emotional. Given
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  's retrofuturist sci-fi setting, it's hard to think of a pair more suited to score the game, and it just may earn them and
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  developer Naughty Dog further recognition for their efforts.
 </p>
 <h3 id="what-to-expect-from-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-39-s-ost">
  What to Expect From Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet's OST
 </h3>
 <p>
  In addition to the original compositions scored specifically for
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  by Ross and Reznor, it's a safe assumption that
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  will include at least some licensed music, as shown in
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  's debut trailer. The music in the reveal was a mix of what was immediately recognizable as moody electronic soundscapes akin to Ross and Reznor's previous work, and the back half of the trailer featured the track "It's a Sin" by British synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys. Given
  <em>
   I
  </em>
  <em>
   ntergalactic
  </em>
  's protagonist's apparent fondness for 1980s pop culture–and Sony's vast catalog of licensed music it owns rights to–
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  may feature a mix of original songs and other hits from the decade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite players knowing very little about
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  other than what was shown in the trailer, it hasn't stopped a sizable contingent of fans from sounding off regarding their expectations for the game. Naughty Dog's past work indicates that
  <em>
   Intergalactic
  </em>
  should deliver on both its gameplay and story, but at the very least, players can rest assured that the game will sound great thanks to the pedigree of its composers.

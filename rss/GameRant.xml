   <strong>
    Guilty Gear Strive
   </strong>
  </em>
  has rolled out Version 14.1 patch notes, detailing exciting updates and key fixes to enhance the gameplay experience. The highlight of this
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  update is the introduction of Team Of 3 mode to official play, while the patch also addresses several issues from the previous update.

 <p>
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  was released in 2021 and has continued to receive regular updates to keep its player base engaged. However, the Season 4 update sparked criticism among gamers. Many players voiced dissatisfaction with changes to the playstyles of
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  characters like Potemkin and Sol Badguy, along with several other concerns. In response, producer Ken Miyauchi acknowledged the feedback, stating that he was aware of the issues raised by the community and had been discussing them with the development team.

 <p>
  Arc System Works has now revealed the patch notes for the upcoming
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  update 14.1, introducing the highly anticipated Team Of 3 mode. This new online mode allows teams of three players, with one Main player and two Assist players, to battle it out in a unique 3v3 format. The Assist players support the Main player using a range of skills, and players can tag between the Main and Assist roles during matches. The mode also features ranked play, where teams are matched based on skill, starting from Iron up to Diamond. Other sub-modes, including Team Of 3 Player Match Mode, Skill Customization Mode, and Sparring Mode, offer opportunities for practice, skill upgrades, and experimenting with different team setups.

  The update also delivers a host of fixes addressing previously reported
  <em>

  issues. Notably, characters like Ky, Chipp, Potemkin, and Ramlethal received adjustments to correct unintended behaviors, such as inconsistent cooldowns, faulty collision mechanics, and glitches during Wall Break sequences. System-level fixes ensure proper scaling for attack and defense stats in Positive Bonus states, while gameplay smoothness has been enhanced by resolving responsiveness issues in specific scenarios.

 <p>
  Looking ahead, Arc System Works has acknowledged lingering issues slated for future updates. These include directional inconsistencies in Ramlethal’s sword attacks, unusual movement speeds with Dizzy's Ice Field, and display glitches in
  <em>

  Training Mode damage data, among other issues. An announcement regarding the timeline for these fixes will follow, reflecting the studio's commitment to continuous improvement.

  Juggle Jam is a fun mini-game in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  that requires you to guess the correct order of colored balls. Peg-E will present you with a sequence of colored balls, and your goal is to arrange them in the right order.

  You'll need Carnival Credits to play Juggle Jam. These can be earned through different activities, like completing Quick Wins or actively participating in ongoing events and tournaments.

 <p>
  Each guess costs one Carnival Credit. So, if there’s a sequence of five balls, you’ll need five tokens to place the balls on the stand. All correct guesses stay locked in place on the stand, but incorrect ones will drop through it and remain below the slot where you placed them. This clever setup helps you keep track of your previous attempts and prevents you from making more incorrect guesses.

     Peg-E will only scan your guess once all the balls are placed on the board. If you make a mistake and want to adjust your guess before placing the final ball, you can tap on any ball already on the stand to pull it back to your side. Doing so also refunds the Juggle Jam token you used to place and lets you reposition the same ball.

  As the appearance of the male option implies, the Gadabout is a clown, and overall not the best option to bring into combat. They have their quirks, but overall aren't completely useless; here's how to use the Gadabout Vocation and what it is best for.

  The unique quality of the Gadabout is that they
  <strong>
   have a chance of not listening to whatever commands you give
  </strong>
  , and will use an ability or attack based on their level instead. These surprise actions are fairly useless early into the game, but can occasionally be useful later on. They can range from a weak basic attack, a support ability, to not even acting at all. While they learn just a few decent abilities, their lack of consistency makes using them in battle difficult, as they have a chance of going against your plan in favor of something else.

  There is no way to get them to consistently listen to you, as their not listening is what makes this vocation unique. If you enjoy this gameplay and wish to fully use a Gadabout, the recommended personalities are:

 <p>
  The Gadabout naturally has a
  <strong>
   high luck attribute
  </strong>
  , and this will help further the one thing they are good at. That high luck also helps their survivability, which is further boosted by putting them in the back of your line-up. Overall, the best use of a Gadabout is to stay alive and maybe revive the party should situations look bad, but if you wish to have a Sage in your party, the Gadabout has a better use.

  What really makes Gadabouts unique is that
  <strong>
   at level 20 they can become a Sage without needing a Words Of Wisdom book
  </strong>
  which can normally be used once. Leveling up a Gadabout to level 20 lets you get additional Sages whenever you want, you just have to put up with them in combat to get them to level 20. This is easily done by taking down Metal Slimes to quickly give them XP, and not rely on them in any real battle.

  When living in a world where zombie and B.O.W outbreaks are a weekly occurrence, having a little bit of luck can go a long way to surviving the nightmare that many characters face in the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  series. The likes of Leon and Jill have certainly had some luck in their many adventures, but not every character has shared this character trait.

 <p>
  In fact, several individuals within the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games have had some downright rotten luck, making their lives harder than they already would be when coming up against bloodthirsty zombies and mutants. These characters really should have sought out a good luck charm of some kind before making an appearance in their respective games.

  When Leon first steps into Salazar's castle at about the midpoint of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  , the noble comes across as extremely cocky and arrogant, believing that the special agent will have no chance of making it through alive. Despite the entire castle being littered with an unbelievable number of booby traps, including a walking statue, collapsing ceilings, and even a lava room, Leon manages to take down each and every one of them single-handedly.

 <p>
  It's clear through Salazar's radio calls in the original game that his lack of luck is clearly starting to test his patience, as Leon trumps every single card up his sleeve. Even during his final transformation, Salazar doesn't stand a chance against the wise-cracking special agent; if only he had a different protagonist to face off against instead.

  Chris Redfield just cannot catch a break. It's almost become a running meme in the community by this point that any time Chris tries to get back on his feet and rally together a team, he inevitably will lose just about all of them in some sort of accident. Nowhere is this more evident than in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6
  </em>
  where, one by one, each of his team members is taken from him, causing Chris to lash out and question why exactly this keeps happening to him.

 <p>
  By the time fans see Chris return in
  <em>
   Village
  </em>
  , he's a worn down, solemn shadow of his former self who is still desperately trying to do what's right, even knowing that those around him tend to be the ones who bite the dust. He even fails to rescue Ethan at the end of that game, and while this wasn't his own fault, it's bizarre that Chris gets struck with such bad luck so often.

  It's hard to find many longtime
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  fans out there who hold any amount of admiration for Steve; Claire's unlikely ally for much of
  <em>
   Code Veronica's
  </em>
  story. However, no matter how much some people may dislike him, watching him face setback after setback can honestly make him somewhat easy to sympathize with, since luck really doesn't seem to be on his side at all.

 <p>
  After being thrown into Rockfort prison after his father was caught selling Umbrella's data, Steve is then forced to gun down his zombified father and is constantly being mocked by Claire, who it is implied he has feelings for. Unlucky for Steve though, he isn't even able to live out his dreams of getting with Claire since he mutates late in the story and ends up losing his life, all because of his dad's misdeeds.

  Ricardo Irving is an arms dealer who makes a few brief appearances throughout the story of
  <em>
   Resident Evil 5
  </em>
  . While he is continuously mocked and berated by a mysterious figure who would later be revealed as Jill, where Irving's luck really runs out is during his transformation sequence.

 <p>
  Becoming a large aquatic creature can be pretty dangerous for a protagonist to deal with, and Del Lago in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  is a prime example of this. However, Irving just so happens to gain a form that has large exposed sacks on its surface, and also swims right next door to a cruise ship that has multiple gatling guns, making for an easy target. If the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  gods had been a little fairer to this guy, maybe he could have had a fighting chance, but not in this reality.

 <p>
  Sherry experienced some truly horrific events as a child. As soon as Raccoon City became infested with zombies, both of her parents essentially abandoned her, causing her to fend for herself until Claire arrived. Despite barely making it out of that scenario in one piece, Sherry's life didn't get any easier as an adult where she was hunted down due to her rare genetic abilities.

 <p>
  As a result, Sherry constantly has a target on her back and has had a pretty abysmal level of luck throughout her life. Even when she seems to have finally found her purpose as a federal agent, she then comes to learn that her guardian, Simmons, was an evil mastermind all along; as if things couldn't get any worse.

  At first glance, Mendez can seem like little more than a stock villain whose only characteristic is being a mean and stern chief for Leon to overcome. However, there are documents scattered around
  <em>

  that reveal the tragic backstory of this villain, unveiling how everything went wrong for him over the course of just a few days.

 <p>
  After becoming the head of the village, things looked promising for Mendez as he reported how the village was thriving. Singing and dancing were a common sight, and education was being introduced into the area to benefit the children. Soon after though, a mysterious group of hooded figures entered the village, eventually turning everyone, including Mendez, into mindless Ganado. Just when everything looked hopeful, Mendez's dreams became tarnished by one simple unlucky encounter.

  Ethan might honestly be one of the most unlucky horror protagonists ever seen in a game. This random civilian is first thrust into the horrific Baker Mansion where he gets beaten, injected, and thrust into an unforgettable nightmare.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Rivals of Aether 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Rivals 2
  </em>
  , is a platform fighting game similar to
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  involving clashes between unique characters.
  <em>
   Rivals 2
  </em>
  enhances its predecessor with 2.5D graphics, smoother gameplay, and a returning roster of characters and a few new ones. This game catapulted into popularity and is an example of a high-quality fighting game with original characters and support for competitive gameplay.

 <p>
  Like with other fighting games, there are many characters to pick from, each with their own set of special combos and mechanics. What sets
  <em>
   Rivals 2
  </em>
  apart from other fighting games is how each character's mechanics are so distinct they practically shape the stages to their will. Due to the depth of each character, it may be hard to pin down which character is easiest to start with. The following will showcase the best beginner-friendly characters to try first.

  Orcane is a returning character from
  <em>
   Rivals of Aether
  </em>
  , a catlike orca creature capable of manipulating puddles and bubbles to quickly attack opponents and master the stage. Orcane may be the most challenging to learn out of these listed characters, but once players get a feel for his puddle teleportation and bubbling moves, they can be unstoppable. Orcane creates a puddle with his neutral special or down special, then up special to teleport and absorb the puddle, which increases the range, knockback, and damage of Orcane’s next attack.

 <p>
  Orcane’s ground attacks are simple and can hit at close to mid-range, especially down tilt which sweeps his tail and knocks enemies up a little bit. His aerial attacks involve a lot of flipping around and timing pushback with his bubble stream that helps evade backward while dealing damage. Orcane’s strong attacks involve shooting bursts of water which pack enough of a punch to K.O.

 <p>
  Ranno was introduced as DLC in
  <em>
   Rivals of Aether
  </em>
  , and returns as a base game character in
  <em>
   Rivals 2
  </em>
  . Ranno is a poisonous dart frog martial artist with two main methods of approach; attacking opponents with short-ranged aerials, or poisoning and trapping enemies through his toxic trap techniques. He makes for a slightly challenging but excellent beginner character, as once players utilize his poison moves effectively, they can shred the health of their opponents before getting those strong moves in.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1052} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Ranno’s basic moves involve a lot of close-range smacking, with combos that end with dealing poison damage, like poison spin or getting a few stacks of poison in with poison darts. Poison stacks up to four times, with poisoned opponents taking 1% damage for each stack every time they attack. This effect lasts until opponents parry Ranno or land a hit to remove a charge. The bulk of Ranno’s damage comes from grabbing opponents with his forward special toxic tongue, swallowing them, and spitting them out into a poisonous bubble.

  Loxodont is a newcomer to
  <em>
   Rivals 2
  </em>
  , a villain from the spin-off game
  <em>
   Dungeons of Aether
  </em>
  . He’s a fire-based elephant wielding a massive two-handed axe. His axe can pull opponents in or swipe them away. Loxodont has a range in terms of attack distance and maneuvering around the stage. Similar to Kragg, Loxodont is massive and hits like a train, making him a viable starter character.

 <p>
  Loxodont’s Molten Boulder move is an amazing neutral special that is flung at one of three angles and can be charged to increase the distance and power of its shot. Loxodont can also leave behind lava pools using his down special, which he can stand inside to gain a molten charge. He can gain up to three stacks of molten charge, and upon using a strong attack, will use up the charges and deal massive damage.

  Zetterburn is another original character coming from
  <em>
   Rivals of Aether
  </em>
  , a beast with a flaming mane and moveset to match. He makes for a great beginning character due to his deadly close-range combos paired with long-range fire projectiles. Zetterburn’s fiery moves set his opponents aflame, dealing damage over time while getting combos in.

 <p>
  Zetterburn’s strength lies in his combinations, like starting with his up tilt to sweep around him with his claws and launch opponents up and continue getting hits in. His neutral air makes him do a cartwheel, and down air will slam him and anyone he hits straight down. Zetterburn’s specials involve throwing fire and slamming his opponents with fiery bursts.

  Kragg’s specials can manipulate the stage in a series of ways; his down special shoots three rock spikes in the ground in front of him, his up special summons a pillar of earth beneath him, and his neutral special digs up a square rock from the ground that he can toss. These thrown rocks can be shattered to deal even more damage to nearby enemies. Kragg can also curl up into a ball and roll across the stage, forcing opponents to jump out of the way.

 <p>
  Clairen was originally introduced as DLC in
  <em>
   Rivals of Aether
  </em>
  and now returns as a base-game character. Clairen is a black panther with a flaming sword and possibly the easiest character to learn and master. On top of the speed and versatility of her sword, the tip of the sword does extra damage, stuns, and knocks back opponents. Clairen’s reach with her sword makes it easy for anyone new to
  <em>
   Rivals
  </em>
  or fighting games to put up a fight.

 <p>
  Clairen’s up special swings her and her bursting sword upwards and can be activated twice, with the second swing having a shorter trajectory. This move has great recovery and damage, making it an essential move when returning to the stage or throwing people off. Her side special dashes through opponents, stunning anyone within for a second and then throwing them upwards, setting up an opportunity to get a combo in.

  A surgeon has used a Sony
  <strong>
   PlayStation
  </strong>
  controller to perform a surgical procedure. The impressive feat combines a delicate procedure with a widely accessible PlayStation controller, and has the potential to change the future of surgery.

  While the vast majority of game controllers get used for their intended purpose, sometimes controllers are used for things other than gaming. One famous example of this is the game controller that was used to pilot the ill-fated Titan submarine. While that historical moment ended in tragedy, this use of a gaming controller could someday save lives.

  A surgeon in Switzerland has officially completed an endoscopic procedure using a PlayStation Move controller. According to the report, the procedure was performed on a pig located in Hong Kong, with 5,780 miles between the surgeon and the subject. The endoscopy was performed utilizing a robotic surgical system that can be controlled remotely which was connected to a direct WebSocket protocol for real-time data transfer. The surgeon did everything while watching a video feed and using the PlayStation Move controller to control the robot's actions, all while maintaining a latency of 300 milliseconds or less.

  Prior Attempts Used a Different PlayStation Controller
 </h2>
 <p>
  Although the PlayStation Move controller was used for this particular procedure, the PlayStation 5 DualSense controller has been utilized in prior attempts. It's not clear if the surgeon prefers one over the other. It's possible that the handling of the PlayStation Move controller may be more similar to what a surgeon would normally use to control one of these robotic surgical devices, and may feel more comfortable or natural for them.

 <p>
  The potential for this technology is impressive. Many endoscopic and surgical procedures in general are already performed with the assistance of robotic devices, which allows extreme precision. In some cases, these robotic methods allow surgeons to perform procedures with smaller incisions and far less trauma to the body, improving recovery time and reducing the risk of complications. The hope is that this existing technology could be done remotely, allowing surgeons to perform both life-saving procedures and routine ones without being physically located near the patient. This could allow doctors to save lives in places where on-site medical personnel are limited, or there's no one available with particular expertise.

 <p>
  Getting to the point where remote surgical procedures could take a while, as maintaining an excellent internet connection is an absolute necessity. However, the fact that the technology is already working well and that the delicate and precise movements can be controlled by something as accessible and relatively affordable as a PlayStation controller is genuinely impressive.

  Created by director and writer Michael Dougherty, Sam is a character that appeared in Doughterty's Season's Greetings short film that was released in 1996. The character then featured as one of the main protagonists 2007's Trick 'r Treat film. Trick 'r Treat is one of several in-game events taking place as part of The Haunting,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's annual Halloween event. Sam is expected to be one of the final crossover skins in the
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3

  An
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan has created a skin concept that transforms Kiriko into
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  's 2B, with impressive results. Kiriko was one of the first new characters added to
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  and has since become one of the game's most popular heroes for reasons such as her competitive potential.

 <p>
  Kiriko is one of the notable names when players debate about
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's best support heroes. With her skills kit, she can heal and protect allies, deal damage, and have considerable mobility on the battlefield. Because of this, Kiriko has been a highlight in the game's meta and a hot pick for players who want to stand out. Recently, a talented fan decided to give the support a different twist by transforming her into a character from another popular franchise.

 <p>
  On Twitter, a user called aixo_official created an impressive skin concept that turns Kiriko into 2B from
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  . The artist shows Kiriko with the same short white hair and a black blindfold that covers the eyes of the protagonist of PlatinumGames' JRPG. The
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  hero wears the same high-slit turtleneck dress and thigh-high black leather boots, and her abilities have got a visual makeover. Healing Ofuda's talisman is stamped with the logo of YoRHa, the military force that created the android, while Protection Suzu has the form of a Black Box, which is the “heart” of YoRHa androids. The Kunai has been given the same design as the Virtuous Contract, one of the swords used by 2B.

 <p>
  While the
  <em>
   Nier
  </em>
  franchise has a variety of android characters and YoRHa creations, 2B stands out as one of the most popular names among fans. Created to battle the machines that have invaded the planet in the name of humans, 2B is known for her striking and controversial appearance, and for being one of the central characters in the highly praised
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  . The character is also remembered for using the swords Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty, and for her appearances in games such as
  <em>
   Soul Calibur 6

  ,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  , and

  The skin concept shared by the artist has impressed the Blizzard shooter community, with some players commenting that if this skin became real, it would have a sales potential “capable of financing
  <em>
   Overwatch 3
  </em>
  .” After all, Kiriko is one of the game's heroes who frequently receives cosmetics, recent examples being the Legendary Oni skin, and the one part of the
  <em>

  x
  <em>
   My Hero Academia
  </em>
  collaboration.

 <p>
  The process for redeeming codes in
  <em>
   RIVALS
  </em>
  is a little different than it is in other
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games. This is because players will first need to follow the developers (@Sensei_RBX and @NosniyRBLX) on Twitter before the option to redeem codes becomes available. Thankfully, for those who don't have a Twitter account, it's possible to use the Twitter handle of an account that's already following both devs, which can make the process a lot easier. For those having trouble, though, the following step-by-step instructions should help.

  A developer of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </strong>
  </em>
  has confirmed there are no plans to add a new main weapon type, though there are some ideas of what weapon they would like to implement being kicked around. Capcom's
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  is the latest title in its illustrious franchise, launching for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S platforms in late February 2025. This title will kick off the sixth generation of
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  games, with the player exploring the Forbidden Lands, a hostile, unexplored region that holds all sorts of creatures that will need to be hunted.

 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  has 14 different weapons to choose from, all of which have their own unique mechanics and playstyles. Many of these weapons are very familiar to fans, as they are all returning from previous games, with classics like the Lance, Sword and Shield, and Gunlance all being back for
  <em>
   Wilds
  </em>
  . Of the 14 returning weapons, the "newest" of them all would be the charge blade and insect glaive, and even then, those weapons were first introduced back in 2013's
  <em>
   Monster Hunter 4
  </em>
  . As such,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  won't be introducing any new weapons to use, to the disappointment of some fans.
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  art director Kaname Fujioka and series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto commented on the possibility of new weapons being introduced to the series.

 <p>
  In an interview with Italian site Multiplayer.it (translation courtesy of GamesRadar) Fujioka states the idea of adding a potential new main weapon type for
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  was never an abandoned concept, but a lot of ideas have been piling up over the years. The
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise has technically 18 weapons total, with most of them having appeared in spin-off games or were only in one title.

  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  builds upon the approach of
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   World
  </em>
  by refining the 14 existing weapons with new reworks, adding new moves and features. For example,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  has a new counterattack and perfect timing mechanic for almost all weapons. Producer Tsujimoto commented on the current weapon lineup's depth of mechanics, noting that all the weapons have evolved dramatically compared to how they were introduced.

 <p>
  Tsujimoto noted that even the insect glaive and charge blade in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  have changed dramatically compared to their counterparts from
  <em>
   Monster Hunter 4
  </em>
  , despite being the "newest," and even classic weapons like the greatsword and longsword are "unrecognizable" from their original versions. Tsujimoto also noted that even if the development team had the resources to make a 15th weapon, the resources used for making it could be better used to invest and improve upon the current weapons or work on the next game. As such, it seems like making a new weapon type for the
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  franchise is considered a tough act to follow, given how many weapons already exist.

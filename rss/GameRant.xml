  Chapter 5 Season 3 received its first update nearly three weeks after the start of the season. However, a few days later, it got another major update, patch v30.20, which added the All Sweat Summer event, the
  <em>
   Pirates of the Caribbean
  </em>
  crossover, and Fortnite Reload, a game mode featuring a remixed Chapter 1 map, OG items, and locations.

  Between Chapter 4 and Chapter 5,
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  added a completely different season known as Season OG or
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  OG. This season lasted about a month, and during this time, each week players would get to revisit locations and use items from Chapter 1.

 <p>
  Even though it didn't require as many levels to be completed, Season OG had its own Battle Pass and exclusive skins.
  <strong>
   When Fortnite Reload was announced, many fans thought that
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
   OG had resurfaced for another season. However, that is not the case; Fortnite Reload is its own separate mode
  </strong>
  . Gamers can still play the standard Battle Royale and Zero Build while it's live.

  Is Fortnite Reload Permanent?
 </h2>
 <p>
  The Chapter 1 map is special to a major part of the
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  community, so it's not surprising that many fans would like to keep Fortnite Reload around for more than a few weeks.

 <p>
  <strong>
   At the moment, it is unknown if Fortnite Reload is a permanent addition to
   <em>
    Fortnite
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Just like Team Rumble, it's a big teams game mode with a capacity of 35 to 40 players, so there is a chance that it could be here to stay, especially if it gets a lot of active players within the first few days.

  Fortnite Reload is a Squads game mode;
  <strong>
   each match starts out with 40 players, 10 four-player squads
  </strong>
  . Gamers will consistently respawn as long as one of their teammates remains alive. This means that in order
  <strong>
   to fully eliminate someone, they will have to eliminate everyone in their squad before their opponents have time to respawn
  </strong>
  .

  When a player is eliminated in Fortnite Reload, they can wait to be revived or start a 30-second reboot timer start ticking immediately. If they're eliminated or choose to activate the timer, they'll return to the match once it reaches zero. The timer will increase to 40 seconds later in the game, and at some point, gamers won't be able to come back at all.

  has an entirely new region for players to explore known as the Shadow World. This land is full of new enemies, bosses, weapons, and armor for players to find and use. With the DLC being much more challenging, players should look around for new gear and options to better handle the challenges ahead.

  Like the base game, some of these items are more difficult to find and will require the completion of a puzzle. Paintings are one of these puzzles, as they task players with finding the painted location and where the artist stood when they made the piece. Just like the paintings in the base game, these will give players an image of a location found somewhere in the world, with players' goal being to find the exact spot the painter sat while making the piece.

  After getting the incursion painting from the Artist's Shack,
  <strong>
   travel to the Greatbridge: North Site Of Grace
  </strong>
  . From here, begin walking east and around the lower end of the lake. Be warned to run around the perimeter of the lake as there is a powerful dragon that will wake up an attack should you get too close, but enough Scadutree Fragments will make it much less of a threat.

  Still heading west but looking southwest, players will see two stone structures as they are depicted at the bottom of the painting.
  <strong>
   Find the nearby elevated rocks
  </strong>
  to get a better scene of the landscape to find the artist in their chain. After the artist appears and points in the direction of the painting, they will disappear and drop the Serpent Crest Shield.

  This
  <strong>
   shield's biggest focus is on its fire resistance
  </strong>
  , which is fairly handy considering the amount of enemies that use fire in the Shadow Lands. Its low stat requirements make it a great option to pick up and use even if you're not mainly a strength build. This shield comes as a blank slate without any useful skill, but players can travel back to the main map of
  <em>
   Elden Ring

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Shadow of the Erdtree
   </strong>
  </em>
  DLC for
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring
   </strong>
  </em>
  is so big that it's practically a whole new game for fans to explore. On top of an entirely new world, a myriad of bosses, and new weapons, Tarnished also have access to 39 new Talismans.

 <p>
  While some of these are superior versions of existing Talismans, such as 3+ versions, there are also plenty of unique effects granted by the best Talismans in
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  . These new Talismans often fill in gaps, meaning almost every build and playstyle can now be improved.

 <p>
  The Talisman of All Crucibles is an interesting option as it combines four fairly weak Talismans into one strong one. There are some downsides, such as taking more damage, but players should be pretty hard to hit with more I-frames on rolls and backsteps. This can then be paired with the Retaliatory Crossed-Tree, another of the best Talismans in the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC.

 <p>
  To get this unique Talisman, players will want to head to the west of the DLC map, and when they find a lift that heads down to the Ancient Ruins - Grand Stairway Site of Grace, they should ignore the lift and go beyond to a region where they will take out some enemies.

   Crusade Insignia
  </span>
  Talisman is easily one of the best from the expansion. While useless against most large bosses who fight alone, this Talisman is perfect for all other parts of the game. Although the damage doesn't stack, the timer does reset on successive kills, making this an ideal option for large battles and farming.

 <p>
  To get their hands on the Crusade Insignia, players will need to kill Fire Knight Queelign at the Belurat Tower Settlement specifically. If they instead kill this invader at another location, the Talisman won't be dropped, although other loot will be available instead.

   Two-Handed Sword Talisman
  </span>
  is likely something that many players wished they had in their original playthrough of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . Nevertheless, for those with the
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC, it is here now. Perfect for users of the game's best greatswords and the like, this Talisman grants an extra 15% damage when wielding any two-handed weapons. To be clear, wielding a different weapon in each hand does not count.

 <p>
  The Two-Handed Sword Talisman can be found in the Temple Town Ruins, but players will first need to defeat a Horned Warrior. They can then head up the stairs to a room that happens to be the highest point of these ruins.

  Whether players are exploring or fighting bosses, one thing is for sure in this tough expansion, lots of health potions will be chugged. This is why the

   <span>
    Crimson Seed Talisman +1
   </span>
  </span>
  is so good, as it greatly boosts the HP restored from any Flasks of Crimson Tears. With only a few ways to refill flasks, such as by resting or killing certain scarabs, getting more out of these health potions is a game changer in long sessions and boss fights.

 <p>
  While players can settle for the standard base game version which boosts the potion by 20%, the 30% buff from the +1 variant isn't that hard to find. Tarnished simply need to find the Finger Ruins of Rhia and sound the hanging bell.

  Many
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  players will spend a lot of their time rolling and backstepping to avoid the swings and strikes of enemies. As this is already an enshrined aspect of gameplay, it makes sense that a Talisman that enhances attacks following these evasive movements is strong. This is exactly what the Retaliatory Crossed-Tree Talisman does.

 <p>
  To acquire the Retaliatory Crossed-Tree, players will need to first defeat Ansbach in the Specimen Storehouse. Following this boss fight, players should then head to the Site of Grace known as the Highroad Cross, and talk to Leda, who will grant the Talisman as a reward.

      Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake is set for a November 2024 release date, and while this is exciting, fans may be a bit confused.
     </li>
     <li>
      This is because Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake is coming in 2025, meaning that the games are technically releasing out of order.
     </li>
     <li>
      Separate, backwards launches may seem a bit odd, but ultimately these remakes are exciting and show Square Enix's commitment to the series.

 <p>
  During the June 2024 Nintendo Direct,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  fans were delighted to see the return of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
   </em>
  </strong>
  . After its announcement three years ago, this remake of perhaps the most influential entry in the
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  series went silent for a worrying amount of time. The same can be said for the still-unaccounted-for
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 12
  </em>
  , though the return of
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  is probably a good sign of that as well. With a November 2024 release date set,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  should delight a whole new generation of fans in its best form yet.

 <p>
  The good news doesn't stop there, however, as
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  was also revealed, coming some time in 2025. Players will be able to enjoy the same enhancements
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  is getting in
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  , both of which chronologically follow
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  to form an entire trilogy around
  <em>
   DQ3
  </em>
  hero Erdrick's lineage. Aside from a western release for
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 10 Offline
  </em>
  or more news on
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 12
  </em>
  , it's hard to imagine better
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  news arriving right now. All that's dampening the situation is how strange it is that these games won't be released together.

  For whatever reason,
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  is launching several months before
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2
  </em>
  . There is enough content and replay value in
  <em>
   DQ3
  </em>
  for it to earn a standalone release, but
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2
  </em>
  coming separately runs the risk of making
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  look like it's not the full package. There are no objections to these games getting HD-2D remakes, especially given Square Enix’s excellent track record with games like
  <em>
   Live A Live
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  series, but it’s still confusing why they are launching so far apart.

 <h3 id="why-dragon-quest-1-amp-2-hd-2d-remake-was-made">
  Why Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake Was Made
 </h3>
 <p>
  If
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1
  </em>
  <em>
   &amp;
  </em>
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  was a later development that started while
  <em>
   DQ3
  </em>
  was underway, it's likely because these games share a lot of sprite-based assets. Finishing remakes of both
  <em>
   DQ1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  after
  <em>
   DQ3
  </em>
  laid their groundwork wouldn't take as long as making an HD-2D
  <em>
   DQ3
  </em>
  in the first place. That logic doesn't result in a clear development time schedule, but it does help explain why
  <em>
   1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  was made in the first place. Being less resource intensive, they could help recoup the initial
  <em>
   DQ3
  </em>
  project’s costs. None of that gets closer to unraveling these games’ separate launch dates, however.

 <p>
  ​​​​​​There are a few more possibilities to explain the disparity between these releases, but they're rather flimsy. First is that
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  will come out during the Nintendo Switch successor’s launch window. In theory, this would make up for the lower sales these games would otherwise get from being both the second release in their “series,” and from being lower priority games than
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  . However, this idea ignores the fact that these are multi-platform releases, as well as the common theory that
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 12
  </em>
  ’s reveal is coming alongside the Switch 2’s.

 <h3 id="dragon-quest-hd-2d-rsquo-s-separate-launches-might-have-a-simple-cause">
  Dragon Quest HD-2D’s Separate Launches Might Have A Simple Cause
 </h3>
 <p>
  A more mundane reason is that
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake
  </em>
  simply isn't done yet. Just because it began during
  <em>
   DQ3 HD-2D
  </em>
  ’s development using recycled assets doesn't mean it took less time to make. Standardizing each game’s mechanics, especially with how old and archaic
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1
  </em>
  is, would practically be its own project. There's even a chance that
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2
  </em>
  will have to miss the Switch successor’s launch because they don't meet Square Enix franchise quality standards yet. Regardless,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake
   </em>
  </strong>
  should keep fans busy, even if it's part of a situation that doesn't entirely make sense.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has developed an interactive map with real-time position tracking and dedicated presets for collectibles' locations. Of course, third-party maps are not new, and
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  already has several online versions. The issue with these maps is that players have to pause or exit the game to use them. Now, thanks to the efforts of a dedicated player, this inconvenience has been eliminated.

 <p>
  Upon the game’s global release, and as soon as players began farming Resonator Ascension materials in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  1.0, they encountered a problem: the in-game map did not display spawn locations. Fans quickly responded by creating online directories and interactive maps to help locate crucial items and enemies. Nonetheless, a resourceful fan went a step further to offer an improved alternative to the game's deficient map.

  Reddit user Embarrassed-Notice32 announced their interactive
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  map overlay with real-time position tracking and second-screen support on the game’s subreddit. Fans have enthusiastically embraced this creation, hailing it as one of the game's most useful add-ons. Embarrassed-Notice32's app displays Echoes' locations and reveals the whereabouts of all special enemies in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  . What's more, the app's presets enable players to locate various collectibles and Ascension materials while their avatar is tracked in real-time. The app is currently exclusive to PC, offering players the option to use their phones as a secondary screen to display the mini-map. Dveloping a dedicated mobile port for this app appears unlikely due to the complexities of integrating map overlay and position tracking with Android and iOS devices.

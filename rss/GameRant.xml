	 Disney Dreamlight Valley

	is a life-simulator where players can grow vegetables, craft items, cook meals, and fish, but with the magic of Disney in every aspect. Players can interact with their favorite Disney characters, completing quests and building friendships. Since the launch of the

	<em>
	 Disney Dreamlight Valley
	</em>
	appears to be constantly adding new content, characters, quests, and items.
	<em>
	 Disney Dreamlight Valley
	</em>
	also launched an expansion on May 1, which added characters Daisy Duck and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, more selfie options, and more Eternity Isle content for players with the DLC expansion pass.

	Earlier this week,
	<em>
	 Disney Dreamlight Valley
	</em>
	teased the addition of a character from the world of
	<em>
	 Mulan
	</em>
	. Fans are speculating the game will add ancestral dragon guardian Mushu because there is already a recipe, Mushu’s Congee, named after the character. Additionally,
	<em>
	 Disney Dreamlight Valley
	</em>
	recently teased new
	<em>
	 Alice in Wonderland
	</em>
	content.
	<em>
	 Disney Dreamlight Valley
	</em>
	continues to engage players, and with the new content and events, it seems as though Gameloft is listening to its players who are hungry for more. And with many characters yet to arrive in the game, endless potential exists for new content, quests, and items. When the Dreamlight Parks Fest event ends in a few days,
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Disney Dreamlight Valley
	 </em>
	</strong>
	will likely have exciting new updates to share.

	 <em>
		Blasphemous 2
	 </em>
	</strong>
	may not have made the same splash that
	<em>
	 Hollow Knight: Silksong
	</em>
	will whenever the latter happens to launch, but as a comparable 2D Metroidvania action-platformer bearing Soulslike characteristics it’s certainly one of the best of its ilk.
	<em>
	 Blasphemous 2
	</em>
	wields its dark fantasy Catholicism to its advantage with world-building not unfamiliar to anyone who’s played a Soulslike game, and while its gameplay is different it persists as a Soulslike in every positive sense.

 <p>
	Soulslikes are commonly defined by how rich and dynamic players’ chosen builds can be. This involves being able to orient stat allocations toward a particular weapon, for example, and detailing a custom character with a specific class that they can then mold toward stats they know they’ll desire down the road. The
	<em>
	 Blasphemous
	</em>
	games don’t have such RPG elements and instead concentrate on skill tree-based weapon and passive upgrades. That said,
	<em>
	 Blasphemous 2
	</em>
	<em>
	</em>
	stretched the franchise’s legs in a way that could make one FromSoftware Soulslike feature seem plausible and rewarding in
	<em>
	 Blasphemous
	</em>
	’ future.

	could have devised a lore-retconning reason to reprise the iconic Mea Culpa as its lone weapon, for instance, but instead The Game Kitchen chose to design three unique weapon playstyles that all have necessary and authentic utility in platforming as well.

	It’s unlikely now that a
	<em>

	would feature as many weapons as a
	<em>

	might, and yet it’s feasible that The Game Kitchen could enjoy this formula and what supplementary weapons can provide in terms of builds or playstyle preferences. If so, an interesting way to see additional weapons introduced in
	<em>
	 Blasphemous
	</em>
	would be if it adopted FromSoftware’s means of transposing a boss’ soul into a one-of-a-kind and otherwise unobtainable weapon, typically the one that the souls’ previous owner was wielding in their boss fight.

	Whether it’s a boss soul or a Remembrance transposed, FromSoftware Soulslikes gifting players the weapons that their greatest foes wielded is a massive sense of achievement. There are so many weapons in all of these games that players may not care much to pursue them, especially because it’s also not an explicit feature, not unlike most systems in FromSoftware’s action-RPGs.

 <p>
	Still, boss weapons provide a lot of variety with iconography players can be familiar with and behave like memorial tokens of a player’s favorite bosses. Then, part of why these weapons can be so engrossing is that they often grant a unique ability or attack that their respective boss had, such as the Waterfowl Dance as a weapon skill on
	<em>
	 Elden Ring
	</em>
	’s Hand of Malenia.

	This way, weapons could be granted to players via bosses exclusively and not necessarily be mandatory, while a starting selection is still available that can be swapped out for a preferable boss weapon. The possibilities are infinite for how a
	<em>

	might look, but with additional weapons being integral in
	<em>
	 Blasphemous 2
	</em>
	it makes sense that The Game Kitchen would want to iterate on that even more.

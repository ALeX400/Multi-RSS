  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  is losing
  <em>
   FIFA 23
  </em>
  and five more games later today. This imminent wave of departures mostly consists of titles that were day-one Xbox Game Pass releases.

 <p>
  With few exceptions, Microsoft's subscription service ordinarily removes games from its on-demand content library twice a month. It most recently did so on August 31, when Xbox Game Pass lost
  <em>
   NBA 2K24
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Atomic Heart
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  .

  Xbox Game Pass Is Losing 4 Day-One Releases Today

 <p>
  Another half a dozen titles are now scheduled to leave Xbox Game Pass later today, September 15. This wave of removals includes
  <em>
   Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   FIFA 23
  </em>
  , which were added to the service in September 2022 and May 2023, respectively. The remainder of the departing group consists entirely of day-one releases, specifically:
  <em>
   Payday 3
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Slime Rancher 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   SpiderHeck
  </em>
  , and

 <p>
  Microsoft doesn't make a habit of announcing exact departure times for Xbox Game Pass removals, but its service generally pulls games around the end of their designated departure day. Xbox Game Pass members thus likely have until around midnight, local time, to play these soon-to-be-departing titles. As far as achievement hunting is concerned, that is still nowhere near enough to feasibly complete any single one of them.

 <p>
  While this wave of departures has yet to go into effect, its games are already no longer available to new subscribers who aren't willing to pay for PC Game Pass or XGP Ultimate. This limitation went into effect on September 12, when Microsoft launched its Xbox Game Pass Standard subscription. Moving forward, day-one releases will only be available to PC Game Pass and Ultimate-tier members. Existing XGP for Console users have been grandfathered into the old, content-complete version of the service, and will retain access to it for as long as they keep paying for their subscriptions.

 <p>
  In terms of some net positive changes to the XGP catalog, the next addition to Microsoft's subscription service is scheduled to arrive on September 17 in the form of
  <em>
   Train Sim World 5
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ara: History Untold
  </em>
  are then planned to debut on September 20 and September 24, respectively. Since all three of these titles are day-one releases, they will be exclusively available to PC Game Pass and Ultimate-tier subscribers. Microsoft is expected to officially announce the second wave of September 2024 Xbox Game Pass releases during the week of September 16.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an exceptional open-world racing game. However, it is easy to overlook many elements when getting into a new game. The game may feature a fast travel feature, but this can result in players missing many offerings of the game, resulting in a much slower progression.

 <p>
  There is more to boosting progression than what a player does — it's more about how they do it. There are plenty of features that make the game easier to play, but using these features reduces the rewards players will see after each race. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when starting out.

  Players will have the option to fast travel using their map. However, doing so can actually hurt the rate at which players improve.
  <em>
   Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown
  </em>
  is an open-world racing game where players can drive to their next racing destination through the streets of the city, and this is highly encouraged.

 <p>
  Players should treat reaching these locations as pre-races in order to continually hone their skills and improve. There are many different types of cars that will perform better in different situations, so juggling between different cars while driving to destinations will improve players’ skills.

  Tasks are another great option for making Solar Coins, and can be seen while a player is looking at their map. Open up the map and look at the bottom to see “Open Task List” at the bottom.
  <strong>
   Press the assigned button to open up the list of tasks.
  </strong>
  These can range from acquiring a certain number of vehicles, coming in the top three of a certain category, traveling a certain distance in a specific class of car, and many others.

 <p>
  A lot of these will come naturally, but others are easy to overlook and are worth manually pursuing. It is worth noting that new tasks will be added as players level up, so they should check this list as they advance through the game. This will help them progress at a fast rate.

  In addition to driving to destinations to improve racing skills, the map also has hidden collectibles to discover. Driving through unfamiliar territory and into new places can allow players to come across wreckages and speed traps. Speed traps will have various degrees of stars, and getting all three stars for each will earn players a massive amount of Solar Coins to spend.

 <p>
  In addition to wreckages, players will also find pick-ups for both Solar Coins and reputation for their chosen clan. As another great benefit, players will gain reputation by driving through areas they have not yet been to. Players should aspire to traverse the entire map over the course of the game.

  Some players might feel the game is too strict with its controls, but luckily, it provides many different assistive features. This can help in any and all problem areas a player may be struggling in, but not without cost. The more Driving Assist features a player uses, the fewer rewards they will receive — and it can make the game feel less like a realistic racing experience.
 </p>

 <p>
  Players can find these options by pausing the game, going to the Car tab, and selecting Driving Assist. Having a lot of these on can help a player win races, and as such, progress faster, resulting in a higher number of total rewards in the process. It all comes down to finding the right balance.

  Each day comes with a new set of F.R.I.M. and Daily Challenges. F.R.I.M. stands for
  <strong>
   Free Ride Instant Money,
  </strong>
  and comes in the form of players completing impressive feats while traversing the free roads of the game. Players can gain points from hitting jumps, overtaking, drifting, and near-miss situations. The best way to get the maximum payout is to find a long stretch of highway where one can safely perform a wide drift on either end. If doing so causes the game's performance to drop, it might be worth lowering some settings to handle the racing game. This lets the player rack up plenty of points to cash in without risking small payouts.

 <p>
  Daily Challenges are more structured. To complete them, players need to complete set objectives each day. Players should start each day by claiming their Daily Challenges, then playing the game the way they want to, and cap it off by getting in their F.R.I.M.

  Another feature players can access in the Cars tab while the game is paused is Car Setup, which is located to the right of Driving Assists. These will show what aspects of the car will be enhanced, and which aspects are reduced. This can help a player bump up areas they feel their selected vehicle may be lacking, through a high range of customization options for their races.

 <p>
  There is also a custom option that lets players make their ideal setup that can grip tight corners better than any preset — or tweak each of the vehicle's gears in the Speed tab so that it performs at an optimal level for a particular track. This custom setup is a very powerful and in-depth mechanic. Some players may find overwhelming, but it is worth looking into for the harder portions of the game. Having this level of control can be great for racing games that feel much harder than they should be.

      <title>6 Nintendo Switch Games That Rarely Go On Sale</title>

    Key Takeaways

   <div class="custom_block-content key-points">
    <ul>
     <li>
      AAA game prices are increasing due to production costs and scope.
     </li>
     <li>
      Some Nintendo Switch games rarely go on sale, like
      <em>
       Zelda
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Pokemon.
      </em>
     </li>
     <li>
      Titles like
      <em>
       The World Ends With You
      </em>
      face scarce discounts compared to its sequel.

 <p>
  The price of games is not getting any cheaper. With increased costs and standards for what AAA games can produce, and the scope of games constantly growing, the baseline price for what a game can set someone back is steadily rising. This is why snagging a deal on a title can be so enticing.

 <p>
  However, not all games are discounted equally, and
  <strong>
   it can be a rare occurrence for games — especially Nintendo Switch games — to go on sale
  </strong>
  . For those looking to keep their eyes out on a particular bargain, maybe one that will coincide with the announcement of the Switch's successor, here are some
  <strong>
   games that almost never go on sale.

 <p>
  The HD remaster of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Skyward Sword
   </em>
  </strong>
  , with its intuitive use of gyro controls and vibrant, updated graphics, is one of the most sought after titles both for long-time, veteran fans of
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  series, and newer fans who were drawn in from titles such as
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  It's difficult to say why, specifically, this title does not go on sale often. 3 years is not terribly old in a game's lifespan, and considering it's already been on sale twice, this might be a game that sees reliable discounts in its future.

  This from-the-ground-up remake of
  <em>
   Red &amp; Blue Rescue Team
  </em>
  has brought storybook charm and a well-realized third dimension to the first of the much beloved Pokemon spinoffs. This title reignited a love for the roguelikes of the DS era, and stayed true to the "human-turned-Pokemon" trope that defined the rest of the series.

  This title, with a plethora of unique features like powerful recruitable Pokemon and compelling roguelike gameplay, has rarely gone on sale, only twice since its release in early 2020, making it only an occasional sale title that typically coincides with eStore's celebration of other Pokemon titles.

 <p>
  Another example of a revitalized title that rarely sees a sale price, this remade version of the DS cult classic contains extra post-game content and a revamp of the classic bold graphics that contributed to the title's enduring reputation. The game's cult status may have something to do with the lack of discounts for this title, as Square Enix has put some of their more widely played games, like
  <em>
   Octopath Traveller,
  </em>
  on sale more often.

  This artfully rendered 2.5D wonder from Square Enix has one of the most compelling narratives among any title on the Switch. The fusion of deep tactical gameplay, the confrontational difficulty, and stellar graphics make this an essential title for any strategy fans with a Switch.

  However, fans hoping to grab
  <em>
   <strong>
    Triangle Strategy
   </strong>
  </em>
  on the eStore during a sale might have to keep hoping. Since its release in 2021,
  <em>
   Triangle Strategy
  </em>
  has only gone on sale once, in late 2022, just over a year after its launch. While
  <em>
   Triangle Strategy
  </em>
  was undeniably a success, it may suffer a similar fate to
  <em>
   TWEWY
  </em>
  , where the more popular series in Square Enix's umbrella are the ones that go on sale more often.

      <title>Superman Could Succeed in Gaming By Following One Great Batman Venture</title>

  For decades the video game medium has been filled with games focusing on or featuring
  <strong>
   DC Comics
  </strong>
  ’ Batman. From titular roles in the
  <em>
   Batman: Arkham
  </em>
  series to smaller appearances in games such as
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  , the Dark Knight has remained a consistent figure in modern gaming generations. The same could not be said for the other half of the world’s finest heroes, Superman. While the Man of Steel has been featured in several games, including
  <em>
   Injustice
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League
  </em>
  , he’s seldom been the singular focus. DC Comics could rectify this issue by adapting Superman into a more story-driven game similar to
  <em>
   Batman: The Telltale Series
  </em>
  .

  Batman has dozens of games to his name, but Superman only has a few dedicated to him alone, with most of these games playing just alright or being abysmally broken and tedious. Games such as
  <em>
   Superman: The New Superman Adventures
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  were glorified flying simulators, more often restricting players to fly through rings than performing combat or rescuing people. Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Superman Returns
  </em>
  was based loosely on the 2006 film of the same name but functioned more similar to Hulk video games, rather than allowing gamers to truly play as the Man of Steel.

  The biggest issue with creating a Superman video game is how to properly adapt Superman’s powers into balanced gameplay. Superman is often claimed to be an overpowered hero since he has near impenetrable skin, heat vision, x-ray vision, freezing breath, super strength, super speed, a genius-level intelligence (depending on who’s writing him), a solar flare explosion ability, and he can fly. Allowing players to be practically invincible with all of these powers could make Superman's gameplay dull very quickly if not executed properly. Due to this concern, Superman is hardly ever able to use his powers to their full extent in his various game appearances.

 <p>
  One way DC Comics could solve this Superman gameplay issue is by developing a more story-focused game for the Last Son of Krypton akin to
  <em>
   Batman: The Telltale Series
  </em>
  . Similar to previous Telltale games,
  <em>
   Batman: The Telltale Series
  </em>
  and its subsequent season had gamers play as Batman via a point-and-click and quick-time event format. During action sequences, players had to pay attention or miss a button prompt, forcing players to restart a scenario or be left with a negative impact on future events. In between action sequences, players could often explore areas looking for items or clues for potential dialogue instances. During dialogue sequences, players can make choices that will impact their relationship with other characters and affect branching narratives.

 <p>
  With Telltale-like games, gameplay is rarely the focus. Rather, the story and the player’s choice to affect and change the story is the main appeal. For example, in
  <em>
   Batman: The Enemy Within
  </em>
  , players could either choose to trust John Doe Joker or attempt to arrest him, leading to widely different endings. If DC were to develop a Telltale-like Superman game, Clark Kent could still use all of his abilities as he normally would in the comics without making him feel overpowered. It could also spotlight more of Superman’s less destructive side by having sequences focus on Kent’s relationship with his co-workers at the Daily Planet or having him work stealthily as an investigative journalist.

  Potential Story Influences for a Telltale-like Superman Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Batman: The Telltale Series
  </em>
  was designed as an original narrative, it still used aspects from classic Batman tales to construct its narrative, such as
  <em>
   Batman: The Long Halloween
  </em>
  . A Telltale-like Superman game could also be built around an original narrative or be built around one of the Man of Steel’s many acclaimed comics. If DC wants to reach a broader audience with a Superman game, they could adapt aspects of Peter J. Tomasi’s
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  run featuring Superman and Lois Lane raising their son Jon Kent as Superboy. For a more traditional
  <strong>
   DC Comics
  </strong>
  story, this type of Superman game could adapt Geoff Johns’
  <em>
   Superman: Secret Origin
  </em>
  and use parts from Johns’ later books on Superman, such as the New Krypton storyline.

  A creative
  <em>
   <strong>
    Minecraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  fan made a unique and extremely creepy iteration of the game's iconic creeper enemy with a piece of fan art that is taking the fan base by storm on social media, garnering thousands of views. The design comes with a backstory as well, as the creator established their own
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  lore to explain the design in a fittingly unsettling way.

  is a game full of various mobs and creatures for the player to encounter, ranging from friendly animals and cattle to dangerous creatures like the zombie and, of course, the creeper. Despite the danger some of these creatures can present to the player, their designs generally retain a family-friendly aesthetic, preventing them from becoming too scary for younger audiences.

  Reddit user twolegmike took things in a much more mature and horrifying direction, however, with a drawing they shared to the official

The art shows the creeper as a much larger, quadrupedal monster with spider-like legs and an exposed, human-looking skull, covered in a sagging layer of greenish skin with steam emanating from it. The art even includes a diagram of sorts written in the in-universe language from the game.

  The design comes with its own backstory, as well, as, according to the creator, the design is based on their own headcanon, which dictates that creepers are actually corpses of past players who were blown up by one in the past. Of course, this led to some debate in the comments about where the first creeper would have come from, since the in-game lore of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  never explains the creature's origins.

  This user's creation is not the first time fans have gotten a look at a "realistic" creeper design, either, as the upcoming live-action
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  movie features its own lifelike iteration of the creature as well. However, the film's design is understandably more family-friendly, taking on a slightly fuzzy look that makes it fit in better with the world's overall aesthetic without changing too much about its usual design elements.

  Horror-themed creations are nothing new to the fanbase, as many players create mods or texture packs for
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  with a creepy aesthetic or even entire maps that turn the game into a traditional horror experience. Still, this fan's creeper art proved popular, garnering over 7,000 upvotes and hundreds of comments from fans chiming in to praise their work and discuss how much it creeped them out.

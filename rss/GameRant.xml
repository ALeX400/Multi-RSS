      <title>Best Free Open-World Games To Play Right Now</title>

  Free-to-play games come in many shapes and sizes. Battle royales and hero shooters are probably the most oversaturated in this day and age, but genres like MOBAs and MMOs are not going away anytime soon. The latter tend to have a few big names that dominate the scene, but they occasionally welcome new properties that manage to survive beyond a year or two.

  <strong>
   Free open-world games
  </strong>
  are not extremely common, with most examples falling squarely in the MMORPG sphere. Simply put, these sorts of projects are huge investments for developers and publishers, so they rarely go the free-to-start route unless they are specifically focusing on multiplayer. Still, not every MMO is open-world, and the ones that do qualify cover a wide range of quality. What are the
  <strong>
   best free-to-play open-world games

  Even if they might not always hit the mark, the launch of a new MMO is always exciting since they promise potentially years' worth of content.
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  has been available in some corners of the world for a while, but its (free) Western debut landed on October 1, 2024; currently, NCSoft's project is in a decent and exciting state, although it remains to be seen whether it achieves greatness or ends up being a flash in the pan.

  Now,
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  is very much designed to be a classic-style MMORPG, which means a heavy focus on multiplayer combat and guilds. Consequently, this game requires players to get social and is somewhat hard to recommend to those who mostly want to be lone wolves.

  More importantly for the topic of
  <strong>
   free open-world games
  </strong>
  , the map is segmented into zones like traditional MMOs. While open enough,
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  is not a sandbox and players will mostly be working their way through each area rather than just exploring the entire map freely. While not for everyone, the game has plenty of positives, including impressive visuals, fun traversal, a mix-and-match class system, and decent combat. Customization is decent too.

  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is an ambitious hodgepodge of mechanics that is set in a large sandbox. While far from flawless, Starry Studio's project can be a lot of fun, regardless if it is played solo or with a few friends. Due to an alien substance known as Stardust, Earth has fallen in dark, apocalyptic times, leaving behind a corrupted hellscape overrun with twisted mutants that once were humans (or something else entirely).

 <p>
  Along with following a story that explores the group responsible for this situation,
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is primarily an open-world survival game with third-person shooter gameplay and a fun creature-collection system. Players must collect resources, craft shelter and tools, fight monsters, and even collect them so they can help out.

 <p>
  Although not too unique, the open-world benefits from pretty good visuals and creative monster designs that reward exploration. The crafting and building aspects are arguably
  <em>

  's strongest feature, and they are both relatively deep. The gunplay is decent too, even if enemies do not put up much of a fight.

  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  have somewhat similar takes on open-worlds. For the most part, the games focus on missions set in fairly self-contained areas; however, players can visit open locations that are designed to be explored freely, and they contain stuff like missions. Basically, they are expansive hub areas, and they are not immediately available. New players will have to work their way through a somewhat lengthy tutorial/opening section before gaining access to these landscapes. Still, they are worth the effort and add a great deal of content to the overall experience.

  Unlike

  's limited free-to-play options,
  <em>
   Warframe

  is quite accessible and does not punish players for not investing cash. The campaign can still be a grind, but the combat and lore are both good enough to keep things interesting. If someone is looking to immediately play an open-world project,
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  is not the best pick; however, those who are fine with an open-world being one piece of an overall great puzzle should check out this freebie.

  Somehow,
  <em>
   RuneScape

  is still thriving more than two decades following its debut. The MMORPG was one of the first of its kind on the market, and while hundreds of other games have shown up to take its place, precious few have had the longevity and appeal of

  The RPG's calling card is its progression system that allows players to gain experience points through the execution of skills. It makes most actions feel purposeful, even if the combat itself is quite simplistic. The open-world offers a surprising amount of variety, although the free version does come with its share of restrictions that reduce the overall enjoyment of the experience.

  <em>

  was a massive success right out of the gate, and miHoYo has done a good job of maintaining the game's momentum. Set in the beautiful world of Teyvat, the action RPG allows players to build teams of four characters that they can swap in battle, and the campaign's harder challenges require a balanced party filled with fighters who complement each other.

  Launching in 2014 and still going strong,
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  has enjoyed a long and healthy life. Largely revolving around survival, the game has a few notable things that have helped heighten its popularity. For one, most modern PCs should be able to run
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  since it really does not require powerful specs. Obviously, its "free" price tag does not hurt, especially since the game can generally be enjoyed without requiring monetary investment. The community is also active and fairly welcoming, and this extends to the modding scene.

  Although not much of a looker compared to plenty of modern open-world games,
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  's voxel art style actually sets it apart from most of the genre's survival offerings since they tend to lean into realistic visuals. Sure,
  <em>

  is closer in gameplay and tone to something like

  Thegamecompany has earned its immaculate reputation.
  <em>
   Journey
  </em>
  is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest games of all time, and the developer followed up that masterpiece by crafting an expansive MMORPG built around creating connections. Rather than focusing on combat,
  <em>
   Sky: Children of the Light
  </em>
  is all about exploration and socializing, two elements that should be treated as inseparable. Now, technically, the game can be enjoyed solo, and players can spend weeks flying through this kingdom's various regions in search of winged lights. However, the process is way more fun with a couple of companions.

  Although initially premium products,
  <em>

  and its sequel are both free on the Xbox Store, and the games are backward compatible with the Xbox One and Series X/S. While the second entry has its positives, the original
  <em>

  utilizes a skill-based progression system that rewards experience orbs depending on the player's actions; basically, the more somebody uses a skill, the more proficient they become at it. This creates a satisfying and rewarding gameplay loop that ensures players never feel static. As the project debuted in 2007, Pacific City is a fairly quaint open-world by modern standards, although it works well as a sandbox to facilitate absolute mayhem.

  can be grueling, but the game can also be really addictive. Rather than focusing on an overarching story, the MMORPG is primarily driven by its resource-gathering, crafting, and Fame systems. The latter determines the equipment players can equip, and acquiring weapons and armor serves as the main gameplay loop. Essentially, players grind until they can craft their desired equipment and then head out into the world's zones to take part in PvP. If an adventurer is killed by another player, they lose their equipped loot (if they are in a Full Loot area), which means they will have to start crafting once again.

 <p>
  <em>
   Albion Online
  </em>
  does offer different ways for players to approach its content. For instance, if someone wants to solely focus on PvP combat, they can skip the whole crafting element by simply buying weapons and armor from other players. While fairly vast, the open-world is sectioned into zones to accommodate various playstyles or routines. Certain areas only have PvE, while others incorporate PvP action but lessen the death penalty.

  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  takes a few obvious hints from HoYoverse's playbook, to the point of mostly incorporating the same mechanics, just slightly tweaked. While not garnering too many points for originality, Kuro Games turned to these systems for a reason: they are popular.
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  brings to life a post-apocalyptic setting where humanity has been pushed to the brink due to a phenomenon that has caused monsters to appear, and Resonators are the only people capable of taking on these threats. After picking a gender, players are cast as Rover, an amnesiac with a few unique Resonator abilities. Mostly a blank slate, the protagonist does not have much going for them beyond good designs for both genders; consequently, the campaign quickly pairs them up with a couple of characters who have bigger personalities.

  At the moment,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  is very much a mixed bag with plenty of positives and negatives. On the one hand, the real-time combat is fast-paced, satisfying, and relatively challenging. Unsurprisingly for a gacha game that wants to encourage rolling for new Resonators, players have access to a party of characters at any time, allowing them to switch between fights in the middle of battle (and swapping is promoted). Echoes are another neat mechanic that grants players an opportunity to pick up a defeated enemy's echo, which can then be equipped. Moving away from combat,
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  becomes a bit more messy. While not terrible so far, the story is so front-loaded with exposition that conversations become tiresome rather quickly. The open-world looks decent, especially Huanglong, but is not extremely fun to explore at the moment, although that could change in the future.

     , but it is not quite there yet. That said, the main campaign should not take that long to complete at this stage, with most playthroughs likely lasting just over 20 hours. As such, this is not a bad time to give

  Launching out of nowhere alongside
  <em>
   Fortnite Rocket Racing
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Lego Fortnite
  </em>
  sounds like a match made in heaven, and the crossover is well on its way to proving that. While not officially labeled as "early access," Epic's spin-off feels like a work in progress. Consequently,
  <em>
   Lego Fortnite
  </em>
  is currently a bit light on content and might struggle to keep someone's attention as indefinitely as a few other survival games like
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  . However, the game's current state contains more than enough positives to justify a recommendation, especially if players plan to engage in co-op. Outside a few (very popular) releases, the survival genre tends to cater to older players rather than younger ones, so a project that prioritizes the latter is always welcome since the world needs alternatives to
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  .

  Dropping players into randomly generated worlds,
  <em>
   Lego Fortnite
  </em>
  challenges players to craft a base by gathering materials. The game does not try to reinvent the wheel, opting instead to streamline some of the genre's core concepts while still encouraging creativity and experimentation. When venturing into the unknown, players can expect to engage in a touch of combat, which is generally quite simplistic. Nevertheless, these encounters offer a pleasant change of pace from the material-gathering and base-building loop, and they can be somewhat difficult too.

  This absolutely

  lets players fully immerse themselves in the universe of the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>

  <em>

  This tailors a unique narrative experience depending on how players play the game. There are also various PvE and PvP activities sprawled across more than 20 different planets across the galaxy far far away, making for an impressive amount of content for even free-to-play players.

  Yet another movie franchise-based RPG game,
  <em>
   Lord of the Rings Online
  </em>
  lets
  <em>
  </em>
  players explore the shared open-world of Middle Earth. There are six different races to choose from in the game; dwarf, elf, high-elf, hobbit, man, and beorning. There is also a wide array of classes and specializations to select from in
  <em>

  .

  The game is an amazing recreation of Tolkien's books and is available for everyone to immerse themselves in. Whether someone is a fan of the movies or an MMORPG-head in general, this is a title worth getting into; however,
  <em>
   LOTRO
  </em>
  shows its age in quite a few places, particularly its uninspiring combat. That said, any die-hard fan of the source material should take it upon themselves to try out the game. The developers do a great job of adapting the world and storylines, to the point of being the most thorough version on the market. The free content should keep somebody busy for a very long time.

  Nowadays, the market is oversaturated with RPG Maker games, to the point that many of these releases can blend together. However, despite inspiring many fan projects and spiritual successors, there is only one
  <em>
   Yume Nikki
  </em>
  . Madotsuki does not need to physically leave her room to visit strange worlds – she only needs to fall asleep. Once the girl starts dreaming, players can jump into more than 10 worlds (and many strange locations within them), each of which comes with its own surreal aesthetic.

 <p>
  <em>
   Yume Nikki

  foregoes a story in favor of atmosphere and free-roaming. Madotsuki is essentially lucid dreaming, and the indie game does an incredible job of replicating that feeling. Outside of collecting costumes, the title leaves players to their own devices, encouraging them to lose themselves within the bizarre and uncomfortable environments. While not for everyone,
  <em>
   Yume Nikki

  is such a unique experience that most people should give it a go.

  is a different type of open-world game, especially for the free-to-play market. Since most of these projects lean into MMO territory, they are designed to keep players coming back for weeks, months, and years. Even if they might not cost any initial money, they are huge time investments that not everyone can afford. Consequently,
  <em>
   Babbdi
  </em>
  offers a refreshing change of pace since it will likely not keep anyone busy for more than maybe an hour or two. Created by a very small team, the game drops players in the eponymous city and challenges them to escape. That is largely it. While not completely devoid of lore or environmental storytelling,
  <em>
   Babbdi
  </em>
  's selling point is primarily exploration, along with the implementation of some neat items like a trumpet.

  Open-world games are defined by scale and ambition, and that extends to this release. Sure, the city is relatively small and barren, but it is atmospheric and has impressive verticality. The world is fascinating and oddly relaxing, all the while still coming across like something ripped from a fever dream. There are not all that many indie open-world free games, so
  <em>
   Babbdi
  </em>
  fills a niche while not overstaying its welcome.

  <em>

  has lived in
  <em>

  's shadow since its launch, despite the games not overlapping all that much in most categories. However, they are both free-to-play open-world action RPGs with anime visuals and gacha systems, so comparisons were always going to happen. While rough-around-the-edges,
  <em>
   Tower of Fantasy
  </em>
  has its positives that justify a recommendation, and one of them happens to be perfect for this discussion. In terms of open-world exploration, this project is surprisingly good, delivering both fun traversal mechanics and a varied range of locations.

  The game has quite a few major regions and cities, like Aesperia and Vera, and they are not only expansive but also gorgeous while having distinct styles.
  <em>
   Tower of Fantasy

  also generally nails its mobility, presenting players with quite a few exploration options so they can decide how to tackle the map. In other areas,

  can be hit-and-miss, although the combat and character selection are both respectable for the most part.

  Featuring an origin story that is
  <em>
   almost
  </em>
  more interesting than the release itself,
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  is an addictive roguelike survival game that does the basics extremely well. Players spawn into a sandbox and simply have to survive, which involves crafting, eating, fighting monsters, working with allies, or engaging in PvP. All these elements are fairly conventional for both the sandbox and survival genres, but
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  combines them in a way that is both accessible and fairly challenging.

 <p>
  While the core experience does not change much,
  <em>
   Muck
  </em>
  has a few different game modes that slightly alter its rhythm. For instance, if players want to have a more leisurely playthrough, they can pick Creative Mode so they won't have to constantly fear for their lives. Although not overly packed with sights to see, the islands/maps are pretty in their own stylish way.

 <p>
  Launching into open beta in 2023,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  has become more accessible thanks to a Switch port and a Steam release. The full release is expected to drop at some point in 2024, so anyone who decides to dive into this
  <strong>
   free open-world game
  </strong>
  should expect a few bugs; however,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  is not too terrible in that area, even if experiences can vary from user to user. Singularity 6's life sim aims to provide a carefree escape from reality, dropping players into a rich and peaceful fantasy world. As with most of these games, players will spend their time setting up their perfect homestead, which involves developing a decently-sized plot.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  moves at a slow pace, purposefully so. Farming and refining resources take a while, and quite a few hours will pass before players have a proper home to call their own. Everything takes time, although this is negated by a skill system that features eight professions that should be developed; consequently, players should be jumping from skill to skill rather than waiting for one to complete a cycle.

 <p>
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  is not going to be for everyone. As popular as life sims have become, they are still an acquired taste, and Singularity 6 has taken the genre and stripped away intrinsic incentives or traditional goals. However, if someone is craving a second life,
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  presents that opportunity.

  Nexon's
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  is a strange case. While one of the better free games with an open-world, it is not one of the
  <strong>
   best open-world free games
  </strong>
  . Contradictory as this might sound, it boils down to the fact that this project's value is determined by other areas, and its open-world element is among its worst aspects.
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  is worth playing for its satisfying third-person shooter gameplay, which is arguably among the most enjoyable in the free-to-play scene.

 <p>
  The playable characters, known as Descendants, also have pretty fun designs, and they all come with unique traits that make them worth trying out. Beyond that, the story is fairly cliche, although it is elevated by a sometimes impressive presentation. Due to using Unreal Engine 5, the graphics are generally impressive, and an argument could be made that this is the best-looking free game.

 <p>
  The great thing about your Inkpet is that it isn't stagnant. In fact, players can level up their Inkpet as they go through more and more runs and obtain more resources. Increasing your pet's level increases its overall stats, making life easier for you. Your Inkpet, Momo, has
  <strong>
   multiple forms
  </strong>
  that change during each run depending on which Ink gems you pick up. Increasing Momo's level increases the level of all its forms as well.

  To

Once unlocked, players can find the Pet's Playground on the first floor of the hub area, where they can interact with Momo by feeding him any dumplings they have, and check their pet's different forms.

  Dumplings are fairly
  <strong>
   rare resources
  </strong>
  in the
  <em>
   Realm of Ink

  , and finding them can be tough. However, all players need to do if they want more dumplings, is to go through the world more times. The more runs you complete, or attempt to complete, the more dumplings you'll get.

 <p>
  Keep in mind that dumplings
  <strong>
   only drop from bosses
  </strong>
  , so if you reach a point where you think your character won't be able to progress past a biome and defeat the next boss, restart the run. Grinding can be difficult at times, but the wide build variety in the game makes it easier. After finishing a run, you can go to the pet playground in the hub and feed Momo its hard-earned dumplings.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Frostpunk 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the 2024 sequel to the 2018 survival city-builder,
  <em>
   Frostpunk.
  </em>
  The setting for both games is a steampunk version of Earth in the early 1900s where the Earth is inexplicably plunged into a very intense ice age. The first game has players assume the role of the Captain, who takes charge of a city of survivors who have made their way to a steampunk generator built in the frozen Arctic wilderness. They must guide their city through multiple crises and establish a new society in the face of immense hardship.

 <p>
  The sequel takes place thirty years later, just after the Captain's death from old age. The player assumes the role of the Steward, who also guides the city and its people through the hardships of the frostland, but with significantly less power. Players must appease a city council, balance the wants and needs of various factions, and expand their steampunk society to a scale that would have seemed impossible in the original game. Many aspects of
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  are expanded versions of ideas from the original, which changes the experience for the game's players.

  In the original game, players can lose the game by having low hope or high discontent for too long. If either happens, the player is banished from the city and a short message shows that the city and its exiled captain will likely not survive the frost.

 <p>
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  has a similar system in Trust and Tension, although they operate somewhat differently. Tension builds between the people of New London through faction relationships with the Steward, certain laws, and even through buildings like Patrol Watchtowers. Trust, like Hope in the first game, falls as citizens die, especially without ceremonial funerals. Players need to manage their citizens' happiness to have a chance at keeping the city together and functional.

  Guiding the society of New London is more nuanced in
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  than its predecessor. Rather than simply furthering the chosen path of Order or Faith, the player must balance their apocalyptic society's values across several metrics that come together to form the

  The
  <em>
   zeitgeist
  </em>
  , or dominant cultural attitude, is measured along the axes of Adaptation/Progress, Equality/Merit, or Reason/Tradition. Each faction has a specific set of values that correlate to the
  <em>
   zeitgeist
  </em>
  , such as the Icebloods' value of Adaptation or the Technocrats' devotion to Progress. Players need to keep these balanced or find ways to appease factions that stand against the Laws and tech that the player has been choosing. Otherwise, they will face protests and even civil war.

  The Idea Tree is a unique take on the standard research tree found in many strategy games. Rather than progressing along a branching or linear path, the technologies in the Idea Tree are proposed solutions to problems that the city faces. Players have to side with one faction whenever choosing something to research.

  For example, Adaptation-oriented factions like the Icebloods approve of Moss-Filtration Towers but Progress-oriented factions would rather see standard Ventilation Towers built instead. The fact that research involves the politics of the game is a great way that the sequel differs from the original
  <em>
   Frostpunk
  </em>
  as well as the majority of strategy games.

  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  expands on the idea of factions and makes them a more central part of the story and gameplay. Outside of the prologue, there are always at least two factions represented by the citizens of the player's city and settlements. They have different ideas for solutions in the Idea Tree, different values they want represented through laws, and even different types of buildings that they demand to be built or demolished. Appeasing and maintaining good relations with each of the factions is a large part of the game, and can be a delicate balancing act, especially when a whiteout is in the forecast.

  Since

Clicking on the problem also shows whether the issue is growing more problematic, remaining stagnant, or diminishing. Managing these more abstract problems takes some time to get used to, as things may not seem as urgent for new players as they do in the original game.

  In the first game, players had a limited number of resource types — wood, metal, raw food, and cooked food — to manage while building New London. In
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  , the two types of food were consolidated into a single category, as were the construction materials. This streamlined one part of the game's resource management to make other aspects more complex.

  The sequel adds goods to the list, which are necessary to keep crime from growing. Another addition is Prefabs, which are required to build or expand districts, and to construct buildings. Both of these can be manufactured from materials in Industrial Zones. Other new resources are different fuel types for the generator, so even managing the city's heat is more complicated than it was in the original game. Having so many resources to stockpile is a major challenge when starting a new game in the story or Utopia Builder.

These districts are significantly larger than anything players could build in the original game, and they showcase how much larger New London is thirty years after the original game. Once a district has been expanded, players can place buildings that they have unlocked through the Idea Tree in the two slots they can control directly.

  As players explore the frostland in
  <em>

  Transferring resources and people between these settlements and the main city becomes a difficult balancing act, as each subsequent city is specialized in an area like Food or Materials and typically can't become self-sustaining without a lot of effort. Switching between up to four cities at a time makes this balancing act even more precarious, but it is extremely rewarding to truly create a society that spans the frozen wastes of the game's post-apocalyptic world.

  <em>
   Frostpunk 2

  is larger than its predecessor in every way. It is normal for players in the sequel to manage thousands of citizens, while the original game had a cap of 600 people. They manage multiple cities instead of just staying in New London, and the use of districts means that even the first build ordered by the player increases the city to a size that would have been unfathomable in the first game.

  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  uses is even more impressive. The original game's story takes place over 48 days, making it nearly two months long. The sequel, by contrast, measures time in weeks. It can take longer than the original game just to research an idea or explore the frostland. Managing the sheer scale of the world of
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  is a major change from the original game and is a great showcase of the expansion of the original game's ideas.

      <title>Why Indiana Jones and the Great Circle May Not Be Pulling The Big Guns With Its December Release</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
   </em>
  </strong>
  is bringing a new adventure in the
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  franchise to life. Indeed,
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  has been a highly anticipated release for this year, but its December launch date may not have the desired outcome.

 <p>
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  promises a fresh chapter on the horizon. Since
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  is such a beloved series, there are high expectations to get the adventure-focused narrative correct. From solving puzzles to diving deeper into the mystery of what the Great Circle is, the game could be a compelling new story to experience. However, the game launching in a surprisingly barren month begs the question of whether this is a calculated move on Machine Games and Bethesda's part.

 <h3 id="a-slow-release-month-may-not-be-beneficial">
  A Slow Release Month May Not Be Beneficial
 </h3>
 <p>
  There have been some strong releases this year, but December's schedule is shockingly empty at the moment. As of now, the two biggest releases are
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  . Despite their release dates only being three days apart, the vast difference in genre between the titles doesn't really allow for much competition. There is likely to be some overlap, though each game caters to a different audience.

 <p>
  For
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  to take on such a big franchise, it's a little bit surprising that it's being released in such a barren slot. Of course, this is likely strategic in order to get a chance to be the best-selling game of the month and draw in more players, but it also raises the question if that will help as much as Machine Games and Bethesda are presumably hoping.
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  being included on Xbox Game Pass already gives it a big advantage, and being such a distinct title may not make it far-reaching.

 <p>
  Many fans of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  would be interested in the game whether it was released during a busy month or not. Placing it in a release dead zone doesn't necessarily mean that gamers will gravitate toward it just because it's one of the few options for the month. Even if the holiday season was packed with releases, there are very few games that could really compete with the specificity of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  . Now that
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  is also coming to the PS5, it will already be reaching a larger audience than intended later on, and that may have to be enough.

 <p>
  Despite the iconic nature of the franchise, the popularity of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  has unfortunately been in decline. It's been a long time since a game based around
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  was released and, so far, the early looks at the game are promising, capturing the essence of Indy and his adventures. If Machine Games and Bethesda are hoping that the game will fare better in a release desert, they may turn out mistaken.

 <p>
  If anything, the title releasing on Xbox Game Pass will likely do more for its outreach than its release date. Once the game launches on December 9,
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  will bring action-adventure into the spotlight. Not being up against much competition may not be as beneficial as the launch date hints, but there is also always room for surprises.

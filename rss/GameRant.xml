 <p>
  A creative
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  player just shared an impressive wooden sculpture of Cubone. The original
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games introduced gamers to a wide variety of elementally empowered monsters that they could collect and train to battle NPCs and other players, and the Lonely Pokemon Cubone stands out due to its surprisingly deep and emotional background. This reptile-like Ground-type Pokemon keeps to itself due to the tragic death of its Marowak mother, wearing her skull as a mask and using a bone as a weapon to defend itself against attackers.

 <p>
  Cubone remains a popular Pokemon to this day, with talented fans creating artwork and alternate forms for the orphaned Ground-type creature. These include hardwood carvings of Cubone and 3D-printed replicas of its signature skull mask, as well as new designs combining it with the likes of Growlithe and Eevee. Others have devised interesting theories about Cubone’s dark origins, suggesting that it might actually be a baby Kangaskhan or an abandoned young Charmander whose tail was never ignited.

  Meanwhile, Reddit user LunarLegacy23 recently shared photos of a wooden Cubone sculpture that they made with a few subbreddits, including r/pokemon. Cubone’s head, body, and bone were all made from different pieces of wood that the user carved and pieced together, giving the Generation 1 Ground-type Pokemon a special wooden texture that stays true to its original design. Other Reddit users have complimented LunarLegacy23 for their woodworking skills, with some even wanting to buy a Cubone sculpture for themselves.

  <em>

  expansion. Since then, it has been notably absent from both
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  , though it did appear in the
  <em>
   Brillant Diamond

  and
  <em>
   Shining Pearl
  </em>
  remakes that were released as part of Generation 8.

  Fans are still waiting for Cubone’s next
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  appearance, which could come in next year’s
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A

  . In the meantime, these fans are paying tribute to the lonely Pokemon that wears its mother’s skull as a helmet by crafting custom Cubone rubber ducks and yarn dolls, and LunarLegacy23’s wooden Cubone does a great job of capturing its memorable design in a way that fits its nature-based theme while offering up a new take on one of

  </strong>
  ’s original collectible monsters.

  <strong>
   Double Fine
  </strong>
  has shot down fans who were hopeful for new games in the
  <em>
   Banjo-Kazooie
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Conkers Bad Fur Day
  </em>
  franchises. These requests came after Double Fine posted to Twitter about the recently released
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  , and some fans replied to the studio inquiring about the older platformers.

 <p>
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  is a 3D platforming game by developer Team Asobi that follows the titular robot as it traverses 80 levels, spanning various galaxies and planets. The game was released to celebrate PlayStation's 30th anniversary and seemingly did so to great effect, as
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  has risen to critical acclaim, becoming the highest-rated first-party launch on the PlayStation 5. The game's primary antagonist, Space Bully Nebulax, bears a striking resemblance to a character from the
  <em>
   My Alien Buddy
  </em>
  DLC from the 2013 release
  <em>
   The Playroom
  </em>
  . Developed by Team Asobi,
  <em>
   The Playroom
  </em>
  is a collection of Augmented Reality games for the PS4, and Double Fine made a DLC pack for the game with
  <em>
   My Alien Buddy
  </em>
  . Double Fine took to Twitter to point out the similarity with
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  and congratulate Team Asobi on the game's success, but fans were much more interested in something else.

 <p>
  Fans were quick to jump on the use of "platformers" in the original tweet, accompanying the Tweet with a GIF of Banjo giving a thumbs up, to which Double Fine responded with a curt "No." Another fan inquired about Conker, referring to the cult classic
  <em>
   Conker's Bad Fur Day
  </em>
  which was released back in 2001. Double Fine responded to this request with an equally clear response, adding that "We want to make *our* games." Both aforementioned platformers were developed by Rare, and while it isn't uncommon for remakes and sequels to be handled by studios who did not create the original product, Double Fine has been quick to shut down any speculation that it will be working on these games.

  Double Fine has been fairly quiet since the release of the highly successful
  <em>
   Psychonauts 2
  </em>
  , presumably busy on its next big project. Despite Double Fine's acquisition by Xbox Game Studios during the development cycle of
  <em>
   Psychonaut 2
  </em>
  , it seems that studio head Tim Schafer has managed to keep Double Fine in its indie roots, and has made it clear that the team only intends to work on what they truly want to work on.

  At the start of the year, Double Fine teased its plans for the future, noting that the studio's 25th anniversary was approaching and that it had big plans for that moment. The 25th anniversary of Double Fine won't be until June 2025, so this early teaser shows that the studio already has its own plans in motion, leaving fans excited about what the future holds.

  . Whether you are doing Raids, Mythic+, or Delves, this how you improve your character's power once you've hit level cap. Yet no matter how good you are, there is one thing that will always stand between you and endgame loot: RNG (short for random number generation).

  The gear that drops is entirely random. As such, you are at the mercy of whether something that drops is an upgrade or not. Fortunately, there is a way to alleviate the pain caused by RNG and that is through the Great Vault.

  The Great Vault has been around since

  , and it is essentially a weekly reward system. The location of the Great Vault varies, but for
  <em>
   The War Within

  When you complete one of the objectives above, an item from the loot table of that activity is added to the Great Vault. This is indicated by the check mark and glowing sphere as depicted in the image above. The item level of each item is determined based on the difficulty of the activity you completed. The item level can be improved by completing activities at a higher difficulty.

 <p>
  For example, say you killed two bosses in Nerub-ar Palace on LFR difficulty. The result will be an item with an item level of 584 being added to the Great Vault. Later that week, you go in Nerub-ar Palace with your guild and kill two bosses on Normal difficulty. This will upgrade your previously unlocked item in the Great Vault to item level 597.

 <p>
  Despite being able to add items to the Great Vault, you won't be able to claim them until the next weekly reset. At that point, you will be able to pick one item. The amount of items in the Great Vault will depend on how many activities you complete or raid bosses you killed. If you complete six of the nine objectives, you will have six items to choose from. Alternatively, if you did everything you will have nine items to choose from.

  As the Season progresses, it is entirely possible to end up in a situation where all of your available rewards are not upgrades. If that happens, you can choose the reward at the bottom of the menu, and you will get Algari Token of Merit instead. You can earn up to six Algari Tokens of Merit per week. Algari Token of Merit can be used to purchase items from Ardgaz, the NPC that stands right next to the Great Vault. His inventory is as follows.

  players have the chance to redeem a code to get free Max Particles. New features are added to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  on a regular basis to keep the game fresh. By constantly giving
  <em>

  players something new to do, Niantic ensures that longtime players stay engaged with the game and those that have stopped playing may be convinced to come back.

 <p>
  Dynamaxing is one of the latest additions to
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . The battle gimmick of the Generation 8
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing allows Pokemon to grow to immense sizes, and in the case of Gigantamaxing, dramatically change their forms.
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  offers its own spin on the concept, with players needing to collect Max Particles to utilize the feature. With Max Particles, players can fight in Max Battles and beef up their Dynamax Pokemon.

  250 Max Particles will give players enough to battle a one-star Dynamax Pokemon. These powerful enemies are found at Power Spots, not unlike the Max Particles themselves. Power Spots have popped up all over the place and are often found near existing PokeStops and gyms, so
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players may want to keep an eye out when visiting their favorite places to play the game. Max Particles will be a big part of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  moving forward, and in fact, are important for the game's latest Special Research quest.

  's To the Max quest teaches fans about Max Particles and the concept of Dynamaxing. The quest challenges
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players to win three Max Battles, unlock a Max Move, and catch a Max Pokemon. It's relatively straightforward, though players will need to collect Max Particles and find a Power Spot if they hope to complete it. Players will be rewarded with 100 Max Particles for winning their first Max Battle, plus they'll get the coveted Dynamax Band for finishing the entire To the Max quest.

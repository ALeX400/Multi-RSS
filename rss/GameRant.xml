  Life in medieval Bohemia isn't easy, and in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,
   </em>
  </strong>
  players can experience the day-to-day struggles of the people there via side quests. One such quest includes Feast for the Poor, an unexpectedly altruistic job that involves more than just handing out food.

  <em>
  </em>
  can lead to a lot of rewards and other surprises, and Feast for the Poor is only the beginning of a chain of quests in Kuttenberg. Here's a quick guide covering the most important parts of this mission.

 <p>
  After you speak with Chenyek during the Into the Underworld quest, you can talk to him again and ask for a job. The first one he'll give you is Feast for the Poor, which involves stealing some sausages from Sigismund's stockpile and distributing them to the beggars in Kuttenberg. To start the quest, go find Chenyek again in The Hole, the tavern on the southeastern side of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  Chenyek will ask you questions that you likely won't know the answer to.
  <strong>
   It doesn't matter if you get these right or wrong
  </strong>
  , as long as you agree to drink and join his guild afterward.

  Exit the tavern to find Knuckles yelling at you by the crossroad. He'll give you an optional objective:
  <strong>
   steal some wine from Sigismund's storehouse
  </strong>
  . If you accept, he'll give you some lockpicks as well as a Weak Quickfinger and a Weak Nighthawk potion. This guide will also cover how to get the wine later on.
 </p>
 <p>
  You won't be fighting anyone here, but you'll be doing a lot of sneaking, so consider changing your outfit to something more appropriate. Head south of The Hole and go to the marked quest area to find a guarded compound with some tents in the middle.
  <strong>
   There's an entrance around the back of the compound's walls
  </strong>
  . The guard will occasionally leave the entrance, giving you time to enter.

  The sausages are in a chest inside
  <strong>
   the big green tent on the camp's eastern end
  </strong>
  , while the wine is in a chest
  <strong>
   behind the wagon shed in the middle of the camp
  </strong>
  . Guards will be patrolling the paths leading to these chests. If one's in your way, throw a stone or two to divert their attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both chests are protected by very hard locks, so unless your lockpicking skills are up to snuff, you'll need to get keys from a guard by pickpocketing them or knocking them out.

 <p>
  Once you've acquired the sausages, run around Kuttenberg and give some of them to the beggars you find on the streets.
  <strong>
   You'll often find a few of them around churches or city gates
  </strong>
  . You don't need to give away all the sausages, but you can give up to five per beggar.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for the wine you stole, you can either sell it to Knuckles or find someone else who'll buy it from you. You can also just drink it yourself. Just keep in mind that everything you copped from the camp are considered stolen goods, so you'll need to either wait for a bit or sell them to a fence. If you do give it to Knuckles, ask for a reward, and he'll give you 100 Groschen.

  The saga of hooded killers operating in history's shadows has endured for a reason. Besides the gorgeously rendered and historically accurate architecture, generationally spanning narrative weaves, and iconic hood-shrouded, hidden-bladed characters, the music of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed
   </strong>
  </em>
  stands as one of the most memorable components of the series, rising with and above some of gaming's greatest musical offerings.
 </p>
 <p>
  While each game brings its own breathtaking acoustic marvels with standout tracks from legendary game composers like Sarah Schachner, Jesper Kyd, Austin Wintory, and Chris Tilto, specific games in the series fly above the others in terms of historic and heroic resonance, emotional force, and musical soul.

  While the soundtrack to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed: Syndicate
  </em>
  certainly pulls romp and poignance in equal measure with its period-accurate sad violin and cello renditions, the melancholy strings of Victorian London can end up sounding as stale as crumpets and cold tea to some.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soundtrack has its moments of brilliance, such as the whimsical and dancy "Waltzing on Rooftops and Cobblestones," but it somewhat lacks the variety and hopeful swell of previous titles to put it further up the list.

 </ul>
 <p>
  Assassin’s Creed: Revelations marks the end of Ezio Auditore’s journey, and its soundtrack, composed by Jesper Kyd and Lorne Balfe, is a fitting send-off for the beloved assassin. The music is darker and more introspective, reflecting Ezio’s quest to uncover the secrets of Altair and the Assassin Order. Tracks like "The Crossroads of the World" seek to set the mood for a story about a man finally entering his winter period after a long and storied life.
 </p>
 <p>
  That said,
  <em>
   Revelations
  </em>
  ' soundtrack often feels iterative rather than innovative, which may be appropriate given Ezio's questing back into the past, into Altair's time. Lacking the bluster and confidence of the previous two games, its sweeping orchestral waves feel somewhat "go with the flow" and lack a hook, unlike Ezio's blade, but still appropriately epic for a sendoff of Ezio Auditore da Firenze.

 <p>
  There is a faint air of revolution about the soundtrack of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed: Unity
  </em>
  that is hard to shake. The ghost of the French national anthem is hummed as if from around the corner of a future uncertain of itself, such as in "Rather Death Than Slavery." The ripe, jumpy synth pairs off beautifully with the classical French bourgeoisie musical stylings of the time, and the ticking clock metronome that seems to hack throughout the soundtrack is perfectly emblematic of Arno's underrated parkour stylings: urgent but graceful; mischievous but consistently deadly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soundtrack occasionally runs away into over-orchestrated or overly sentimental territories but slips back fast with moody, playful synth hopscotch over delicately concerned strings that almost allows the player to forget how distracting it is to pilot an assassin who wears an anachronistic hood stitched into a three-piece suit around a French Revolution Paris.

  The music of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, rendered with traditional Greek instruments, such as the lyre and bouzouki, is as vast and beautiful as the Aegean Sea itself, with compositions that evoke the grandeur of ancient myths.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soundtrack manages to be varied and interesting to carry the player through their long journey. Of course, such a long playtime leaves little room for standout tracks, but
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  's rendition of "Ezio's Family" is one of the finest in the series.

 <p>
  The soundtrack to the original
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  may not have its memorable tracks or leave a stark impression on players. Its music is as subtle and underfoot as its protagonist. Some may argue that this first soundtrack falls in the "background ambient" variety, but its hybrid of synth driving over the traditional instrumentation of the Crusades-era Middle East makes for an astonishing and unique listen.
 </p>
 <p>
  "Access to the Animus" is a fevered, steadily escalating track that blends the feeling of dexterous stealth with urgent action. The soundtrack is a technical gem as much as it is a bop. Jesper Kyd scatters traditional Christian, Muslim, and Jewish influences throughout each location-specific exploratory track to provide a soundscape as diverse as the time and place.

  Just as the series took a new perspective with a wider scope than previously seen in the series with the introduction of a truly massive world and more options for tackling missions with RPG-esque character development,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed: Origins
  </em>
  ' soundtrack clearly set out to stun with its Ancient-Egypt-meets-science-fiction soundscape. What this game's soundtrack lacks in standout tracks it completely makes up for in overwhelming immersion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The soundtrack, ambient but in an up-front, ubiquitous fashion, evokes the feeling of crossing a hostile land without the comforts of the familiar flourishes the series had been known to return to since the days of Ezio (with one major exception, which was still used with restraint), which is perfectly in line with
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  ' intention to throw players back into ancient Egypt, a land of mystery and fresh possibility without the laurels or convolution of the series' own heavy history weighing it down.

  The musical thrust of the entire
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series is ever-tinged with notes of melancholy, but it is most profoundly felt in the emotional soundtrack of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 3
  </em>
  . Lorne Balfe's score swells with an uncertain patriotism borne out of a messy and contradictory American Revolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Blending Native American instruments, colonial chanties, and contemporary electronic sweeps drive forward the themes of the future and past clashing and combining. Tracks like "Fight Club" and "Trouble in Town" capture the chaos and heroism of the American Revolutionary War, while Connor’s Life reflects the emotional weight of carrying clashing heritages amid a time of great upheaval, both personally and politically.

  The eeriness of a living, corrupt Rome at the height of the Borgia papacy can be seen and felt through the haunting songs of
  <em>
   Brotherhood
  </em>
  's music. Although much of this game's soundtrack lacks the delicate variety of
  <em>
   AC2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Brotherhood's
  </em>
  music is thick with dreamy fear and mysticism. Half of its tracks, such as "Roman Underworld," seem crafted from the rusted iron and raw dark of the world's past to instill awe and terror in equal measure.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other half brings cool heroism and healing to the listener in their pursuits across the city's broken and bustling back, such as the driving and supremely self-assured "City of Rome" (the Eternal City in its place in history) and "Echoes of Roman Ruins," both gems at the tippy-top of the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  musical crown, at least in terms of individual tracks.

  It takes work to capture the essence of the wind on a seemingly endless sea and the feeling of guiding a ship across it to unplundered horizons, but the
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  soundtrack captures it effortlessly. The driving, rattly guitar and clattering percussion never fail to put players in the upbeat, deadly mood that
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  's open world of sailing and pirating demands.
 </p>
 <p>
  What really makes the
  <em>
   Black Flag
  </em>
  soundtrack special are the sea chanties. These collectible songs instill the crossing of the great, salty waters with a sense of adventure (and their lyric sheets might be one of the few
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  checkbox items that players look forward to picking up, rather than participating in the collectathon out of a sense of obligation).

  While the original Assassin's Creed brought its own motifs and flavor to the acoustic landscape of the Holy Land, the music of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed 2
  </em>
  brought a renaissance in terms of musical flavor. There are occasional tones of the sacred blended with notes of rebellion in this groundbreaking entry, generally where the religious choirs cross wires with the riff of an electric guitar, felt most of all in the iconic "Ezio's Family," which unleashed a leitmotif that would make itself felt throughout the entire series and its soundtracks to follow.
 </p>
 <p>
  That isn't simply down to nostalgia for one of
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  's most iconic characters. While most fans will likely have this anthem in their mind's ear when thinking most fondly of the series and hopping around the rooftops of Italy, the whole soundtrack is bursting with Kyd's genius, including "Dreams of Venice," the haunting "Leonardo's Inventions," and "Home In Florence," to name but a few.

  With the Mariana's Veil update,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fisch
   </em>
  </strong>
  now features some new spots, including Abyssal Zenith. As the third layer of the deep trench, it’s set thousands of feet below the ocean, making it trickier to reach than the first two areas.

  But it’s worth the trip, as you’ll get the Rod of the Zenith and a shot at completing the area's bestiary. The fish here have never seen sunlight, having dark and purple hues, and there’s even a secret creature lurking in the shadows for players to find. Here’s

 <p>
  To get to Abyssal Zenith in Mariana’s Veil, you’ll first need to finish the
  <strong>
   submarine ice upgrade
  </strong>
  at Challenger’s Deep. Once that’s done, just head down from
  <strong>
   Challenger’s Deep ocean side
  </strong>
  . The path has some huge black barriers, so keep moving and descending. Also, it’s a long way down, so expect to dive for some time.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the location header pops up, you’ll see
  <strong>
   five tunnels
  </strong>
  with giant Anglerfish hanging around. Just make your way through them to reach the fishing pond for bestiary fish. If you’re stuck on the third layer, this guide might help you.

  After you catch all nine fish, your Abyssal Zenith bestiary will wrap up, but it's not time to move on just yet. Aside from the deep upgrade, this place also offers a giant secret creature called the
  <strong>
   Crowned
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Anglerfish
  </strong>
  , which has a golden body and a lantern hanging from its head. It's one of the three secret fish needed to solve the Giant Gate puzzle at Calm Zone.

  Here’s a quick rundown on
  <strong>
   how to catch all the Abyssal Zenith bestiary fish in
   <em>
    Fisch
   </em>
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   While some native fish bite easily with random bait (like Insect and Squid), others might take a bit more effort. To catch them quickly,
   <strong>
    use their preferred bait
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Fish needed for the Deep Upgrade, like Voidglow Ghostfish, can be extra tricky to reel in. Along with using their favorite bait,
   <strong>
    boost your luck
   </strong>
   using the Merlin or Aurora totem—this might also help you hook the secret Crowned Anglerfish.
  </li>
  <li>
   Some of these fish have tough progress speeds, ranging from
   <strong>
    -60% to -80%
   </strong>
   , so you'll need a strong rod like the Tempest Rod or Abyssal Specter Rod to handle them.
  </li>
 </ul>

  The
  <strong>
   PlayStation 5
  </strong>
  boasts a formidable game library, with titles that showcase the very best of what the medium of video gaming has to offer. The catch is that some of these games can be huge time sinks, and the amount of hours needed to do them justice can run into double and even triple figures. Add to that boss battles that can take ages to crack, the hunt for save points, and the quest for items, and the whole experience can end up devouring precious time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily, there is a vast array of games that offer
  <strong>
   huge fun in bite-sized doses.
  </strong>
  These titles run across a variety of genres, from platforming to fighting games to stealth and even survival horror, so there should be something for everyone. If, for whatever reason, a player needs to enjoy their time on a PS5 in short bursts, then these are the best selections to choose from.

  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
  </em>
  shows no signs of slowing down. The pop culture phenomenon is still going strong with recent films, a TV show, and this, a four-player co-op beat 'em up that takes many of its cues from the iconic Konami arcade game, which created huge buzz after it was released into arcades in 1989. Like that game.
  <em>
   <strong>
    TMNT: Shredder's Revenge
   </strong>
  </em>
  has an endearingly simply premise: select a fighter and then use them wisely to beat up various members of the villainous Foot Clan.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   TMNT: Shredder's Revenge
  </em>
  is a great fit for any gamers who have fewer gaming hours in the day, as its short, punchy levels can be enjoyed a few minutes at a time. While there is a co-op option, the game is also designed with a single-player experience in mind, and players can choose one of seven different characters in total to play as. The game is a love letter, both to the 90s
  <em>
   TMNT
  </em>
  cartoon and the golden age of arcade games, and it positively sings with joy.

  Best described as a cross between Takeshi's Castle and a Saturday morning kids' cartoon,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fall Guys
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a delirious sugar rush that mixes chaotic platforming with battle elements and day-glo visuals. Players control jellybean-like creatures who hurtle their way through a series of obstacle courses, mini-games, and team challenges to make it to the final round. Up to 60 players can take part, making for a chaotic but ultimately effervescent slice of gaming.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Fall Guys
  </em>
  is a great example of pick-up-and-play gaming, and its punchy courses and mini-games are ideal for a few short minutes of play, with enough variety to ensure the player will keep coming back for more. The game was made even more accessible after it switched to a free-to-play model, and its combination of variety and giddy thrills make it an ideal fit for competitive and casual gamers alike.

  An ingenious mix of roguelike and brawler,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Sifu
   </em>
  </strong>
  pays tribute to classic martial arts movies and is one of the most satisfying beat 'em ups in recent memory. The game's story involves a young kung fu student with a thirst for revenge after they witness the murder of their father. What comes next is a flurry of punches, kicks, and parries, and in a novel twist on the formula, the player must forfeit maximum health each time they are killed—represented by their character aging—in order to increase their damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Sifu
  </em>
  has a variety of game modes, from a digestible campaign to a time attack mode where the player must take on several opponents at once, reminiscent of classic Bruce Lee films where a room full of lackeys must be dispatched with optimum kung fu skill. While the game offers quick thrills, its finely tuned combat system also offers plenty of depth, ensuring that this is a game that can be returned to again and again.

  It's very difficult to imagine a video gaming world in which there is no
  <em>
   Street Fighter.
  </em>
  The legendary fighting game series has been a fixture for decades and its latest iteration is one of the best yet, suitable for fighting veterans and newcomers alike. The set-up is the same as it's always been, this time with an impressive starting roster of 18 fighters and a horde of different modes to try as the player aims to fight their way to everlasting glory.

  such a treat are the tweaks that have been added to make it a compelling experience. The World Tour mode is ideally suited to players who don't have a lot of gaming time, as it enables them to make their way through a single-player campaign one fight at a time, unlocking progress as they go. This, plus a variety of head-to-head and multiplayer modes, make this one of the best quick-fix fighting games in years.

  The trusty roguelike genre was given a shot in the arm with this dynamic sci-fi shooter that blends horror elements with unique gameplay to create an unforgettable experience. The game follows Selene, a space explorer stranded on the alien planet Atropos. Surrounded by hostile forces, she is caught in a grim cycle of death and rebirth. Every time she dies, the game's environments are altered and environments shift, and she must start her journey anew as she tries to find a way out of her living hell.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Returnal
   </strong>
  </em>
  ensures a fresh experience every time, and each of Selene's runs are self-contained, meaning that her progress is reset upon death. No two runs are the same, thanks to the randomized weapon drops and layouts, so players are able to take in short, sharp chunks of atmospheric action. The game is perfectly suited to play sessions of 15 to 30 minutes, so players will find it to be a perfect experience if they aren't able to allocate extra hours.

  A striking, esoteric shooter and one of the most original video game experiences in years,
  <strong>
   <em>
    SUPERHOT
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a fiendish mix of puzzle game and first-person shooter that takes a novel concept and runs with it. In the game's world, enemies and environments move only when the player moves, meaning that some logistics have to be considered when figuring out how to get from one end a room to the other, killing all enemies and making it out without a scratch.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game starts out simply enough, with relatively straightforward scenarios that can be completed in just a few moves. As the game progresses, the challenge ramps up, and the player can make use of guns, swords, and fists in order to survive increasingly daunting odds. The game's short-but-sweet approach to levels means that players won't have to worry about their precious time getting swallowed up. This game is an action classic that will still be a blast ten years from now.

  Cat lovers were rejoicing when they were gifted with a game that left them "feline" good all over.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stray
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes place in a mysterious future cyberpunk world, and its protagonist is a lone kitty, guided only by a friendly robot, who must navigate puzzles and environmental challenges in order to make progress and uncover the secrets of a bizarre robotic civilization. The game is a celebration of cats, as the player is encouraged to knock over objects and scratch the surroundings as part of the gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Stray
  </em>
  has a brisk playtime of only a few hours, which makes it a condensed but hugely memorable gaming experience. The player is encouraged to wander about as idly as they like or get sucked in by getting to grips with the game's many challenges. There is a chapter-based structure, which makes it a perfect choice for any players who want to break up their gaming into more manageable chunks.

  It was a bold choice to remake the classic
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  games, but it paid off handsomely, and the third game in the series gets a majestic reinvention that keeps the setting intact but essentially reinterprets it from the ground up. When Jill Valentine heads to Raccoon City to get some answers, she is swept up in a nightmare, as she is at Ground Zero of a zombie outbreak and is stalked by a terrifying mutated foe named Nemesis. Along the way, she must survive everything from giant mutant frogs to a deserted hospital crawling with the undead.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an intense but gratifying game that clocks in at around 5 to 6 hours long, making it an economical experience if players are keeping an eye on the time. Despite its brevity, it boasts some truly horrific set-pieces and all manner of revolting creatures, but thankfully, it also makes liberal use of typewriters so that the player is never too far from a save point. For anyone looking for survival horror in quick doses, this is their best bet.

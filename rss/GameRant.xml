  Originally revealed in 2020 and made available to a select group of people,
  <strong>
   Amazon Luna
  </strong>
  officially launched on March 1, 2022, in the United States, before expanding to the UK, Canada, and Germany. A cloud-based service, Amazon Luna offers subscribers an opportunity to stream a curated selection of games, with its library being divided into a few channels that each come with a unique monthly price.

 <p>
  Besides the channels, Amazon Luna also grants Prime subscribers access to a handful of free games per month; at the moment, four titles are usually the standard, although some temporary surprises might be included. Since Amazon Luna requires a stable internet connection to work, with 10 Mbps being the recommended speed, Prime owners can test the service using these titles before looking into the platform's channels. It also helps that
  <strong>
   Amazon Luna's free games for Prime lineup
  </strong>
  are generally pretty good.

  The main attraction of
  <strong>
   Amazon Luna's free games with Prime
  </strong>
  lineup for February 2025,
  <em>
   Devil May Cry 5
  </em>
  is an interesting and, arguably, confident pick. Capcom's 2019 hack and slash title does not provide much room for error, and quick reflexes are important for offensive and defensive moves. If the streaming performance is not up-to-scratch and adds even a hint of sluggishness to the gameplay,
  <em>
   DMC 5
  </em>
  can become frustrating.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such, this game should be a good litmus test for Prime subscribers who have never tried Luna. If they enjoy their time with
  <em>
   DMC 5
  </em>
  , there is a good chance that most other titles will be enjoyable, at least in terms of playability.

  <strong>

  </strong>
  that should test a player's streaming capabilities,
  <em>
   Hot Wheels Unleashed 2
  </em>
  is a fun arcade racer that delivers stunning visuals, tight controls that focus on drifting and boosting, and a silly campaign that is entertaining for a few hours. While all of that is good, the game's biggest selling point is its collection of cars, providing more than 100 vehicles that players can gradually unlock. There are even fun licensed pieces that might ignite someone's nostalgia.

  DrinkBox's
  <em>
   Nobody Saves the World
  </em>
  was among 2022's best indie games, and the "indie" qualifier is arguably unnecessary. The action RPG has a clever twist on the concept of classes. The protagonist, the eponymous Nobody, is a blank slate who can transform into a wide range of forms that are effectively different characters, and they all come with unique abilities and stats. The concept works well and presents plenty of opportunities for experimentation by combining different forms. Outside of this concept, the game is a polished dungeon-crawler with plenty of replayability.

  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  is generally regarded as the high point of the 3D era, at least when it comes to pure role-playing. Obsidian crafted a player-driven campaign that provides plenty of freedom in crafting the Courier's identity and directing his journey through the eponymous city.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  is quite old by this point, and it was always rather rough around the edges. On PC, the game has a lively modding community that has not only kept it alive but also improved the vanilla content; unfortunately, mods are not an option on Amazon Luna. Still, if someone wants to try out the base version, this freebie should be great.

  Considering its accessibility and longevity,
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  has likely been experienced by anyone who has ever been remotely interested in it. Nevertheless, the 2008 RPG will always be a big deal in its own right, and it is still fun to play all these years later. At the time, Bethesda's shift to a 3D sandbox open-world marked a significant departure from previous
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  entries, and this decision helped propel the series to new commercial heights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nowadays, the standard version of
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  is antiquated in quite a few areas. The gameplay was never particularly good and has not gotten better with age. While not quite as action-driven as
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , the 2008 release does not emphasize player choices as much as
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  or the series' isometric releases; however,
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  still offers solid customization and an awesome playground.

  Ubisoft's most recent
  <em>
   Trackmania
  </em>
  project has been around for a couple of years, although it only launched on most platforms in 2023. Unlike most racing games,
  <em>
   Trackmania
  </em>
  prioritizes time trials and short tracks, with most laps lasting only a small handful of minutes. Although incorporating an online aspect, players will also be competing against themselves as they try to shave a second or two from their best times.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Trackmania
  </em>
  is a free-to-play game that only provides a sample of content in its base version. The Starter Access iteration is a bit more robust and should keep people engaged for a while.

      <title>Hello Kitty Island Adventure: Can You Time Travel</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Hello Kitty Island Adventure
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an all-new Hello Kitty experience, bringing together the vibes of
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  but with everyone's favorite characters from the Sanrio franchise. The game will remind many people of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Disney Dreamlight Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  and other cozy games as it mixes a lot of what the players love best in those games; allowing players to live on a cozy island with their villagers and do various things to take care of the area.

  Many games allow players to be able to do time travel to skip a period, whether that be a whole season or just a couple of days. One game that does allow this without problems is
  <em>
   <strong>
    Animal Crossing: New Horizons
   </strong>
  </em>
  , which made it super easy to time travel to see what items would be in the shop the next day, even take part in seasonal events, or get different villagers on the island. However, not every game is cut out for time travel. This guide will explain if players should time travel in
  <em>
   Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

  When it comes to
  <em>
   Hello Kitty Island Adventure
  </em>
  and how players can level up and progress, a lot of the way the game is built is around friendship levels, and players can earn more levels within friendships by gifting. Players will need to gift characters presents to level up quickly. However, gifting is limited to a certain number every 24 hours.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a lot of recent games,
  <em>
   Hello Kitty Island Adventure
  </em>
  runs on a 24-hour clock which is connected to real time. The way that people are tricking the game into thinking it is a different day is by going into their device settings, whether that is their Nintendo Switch or PC, and changing the time and date altogether. For example, players first will need to make sure their game has been saved, exit, change the time in their settings, and proceed back into the game and the in-game time will have changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, there are some issues when it comes to time traveling in
  <em>
   Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
  </em>
  Upon time traveling and turning the time forward, the game fleshes up an error post, telling the player that the game has sensed some issues with the in-game clock being messed with. After this, it is really hard to fix the issue, as players won't be able to fix the clock back without the clock still being off. This might then require players to uninstall their game altogether, fix their clock, and re-download. This is a reason why players will want to avoid time traveling altogether to avoid losing their game save. That is everything to know about time traveling in

   Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

      <title>If DC Had Its Own Marvel Rivals, Two Characters Would Have a Rough Go</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/dc-marvel-rivals-aquaman-namor-green-arrow-hawkeye-kits-potential/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Itâ€™s no secret that DC has fallen quite far behind Marvel when it comes to video games.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  is only the latest game to reiterate this, and even though Marvel and DC donâ€™t need to be perpetually locked into a competition between one another it would be wonderful if DC could wield Marvelâ€™s wins as inspiration to produce its own. If that was to manifest itself transparently and unabashedly, DC would hop on the 6v6 hero-shooter bandwagon sooner than later and put forth its own take on
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  .
 </p>

 <p>
  Batman and Superman could have great variety in a DC
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  between all of Batmanâ€™s gadgets and vehicles or Supermanâ€™s yellow sun-fueled Kryptonian abilities. Likewise, characters like Martian Manhunter or Green Lantern could have ridiculously whimsical and creative kits. That said, itâ€™d be nearly impossible to design kits for Aquaman or Green Arrow and not have them mirror Namor and Hawkeye.

  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  â€™ Namor has proven to be fairly high-tier in Season 1. Heâ€™s not the most dynamic Duelist character players can choose from the roster, but his unassumingly powerful Monstro Spawns make up the brunt of his kit while he mainly hurls his trident and rises into the air with a protective bubble in a pinch. Itâ€™s a simple set of abilities that hone in on Namorâ€™s character well, and if a DC
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ever came out and had an Aquaman on the roster it would be hard not to have his own abilities merely mimic Namorâ€™s.

 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_6">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Of course, something DC could do is have Aquaman summon other underwater creatures to battle alongside him, though that would still reflect Namorâ€™s Aquatic Dominion ability as well as his Horn of Proteus Ultimate.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>

 <p>
  Likewise, if Aquaman were able to submerge himself into the map and swim around speedily with a movement boost, that would then lean too heavily on
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  â€™ Jeff the Land Shark. As a result, there isnâ€™t much that DC could do to greatly distinguish Aquaman, which is unfortunate because his popularity and ubiquitousness would suggest that heâ€™d have to play a role in an ensemble hero-shooter if DC ever decided to develop one.

  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  â€™ Hawkeye hasnâ€™t been terribly broken in Season 1, but like Namor heâ€™s quite high in many community tier lists. On paper, Green Arrow having a kit designed for a hero-shooter would have trouble avoiding inspiration from Hawkeye; however, while both characters share expertise with a bow and arrow as their weapon of choice, Green Arrow could triple down on another gimmick they both possess that
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  â€™ Hawkeye doesnâ€™t indulge in much.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hawkeye only has Blast Arrows as a trick arrow type and instead has more utility with a katana and a wakizashi in his Crescent Slash and Ronin Slash abilities. In this case, a DC
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  game would be able to possibly eclipse Hawkeye by giving its Green Arrow a few different trick arrows that enhance his gameplay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anything could be on the table between arrows that propel Green Arrow into the air for better traversal and arrows that require a large cooldown but create an AoE with a fun status effect. Either way, with no DC take on
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  even rumored,
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  doesnâ€™t have to share the limelight with anyone else but
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  at the moment.

      <title>Tales of the Shire Has A Big Chance to Stand Out on One Classic Cozy Sim Feature</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set to take place in the village of Bywater in the Shire, and stands alone as a game in the world of
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  because it's a cozy game rather than an action-oriented game. Rather than engaging in combat,
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  's main premise keeps the player within the bounds of the Shire, homesteading, foraging, and building relationships with the local hobbit inhabitants.
 </p>

 <p>
  Cozy games often include engaging with a small village community, and one of the best ways to do that is through a holiday system. Many cozy games involve unique festivals and holidays that are tied to the community's culture. As
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  has so much established lore and history, especially for the inhabitants of the Shire,
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  should include the holidays and festivals that are detailed in the source material.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  , hobbits had their own calendar system separate to the rest of Middle-Earth. As hobbits are an argrarian society, most of their calendar is based around the changing seasons. The Shire was originally based on Tolkien's home country of England, and the hobbit calendar and holidays are very similar to the ones found in England. Holidays that are unique to the Shire would be a natural fit for
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  , even considering the canon appendices and going beyond them because of the thousands of years of potential history that hobbits remember in
  <em>
   The Lord of the Rings
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In the canon calendar, hobbits have two important holidays, namely the summer solstice and the last and first days of the year, which happen in the middle of winter. Both of these holidays are primarily feast days, although the Lithe Days in the summer are also popular trading days.
 </p>
 <p>
  Official holidays in the Shire include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   2 Yule
  </li>
  <li>
   1 Lithe
  </li>
  <li>
   Mid-Year's Day
  </li>
  <li>
   Over-Lithe (only observed on Leap Years)
  </li>
  <li>
   2 Lithe
  </li>
  <li>
   1 Yule

  2 Yule is the first day of the year, and the second day of a two-day feast celebrating the New Year. The Lithe Days, also known as The Summerdays in Bree, is a festival between three to four days and places an emphasis on feasting. Both of these festivals happen over several days, but
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  could adapt them to instead run for one day, as is typical in cozy games. As the emphasis of these holidays is on feasting, the
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  's core gameplay mechanics of harvesting, cooking, and hosting guests for a meal could play a central role in participating in these festivals, while the Yule festival could include Gandalf and his fireworks to ring in the New Year.

 <p>
  Other celebrations that
  <em>
   Tales of the Shire
  </em>
  could include are birthday celebrations. Hobbits are depicted as loving birthday parties, and being able to plan and execute parties for NPCs that the player hobbit has a close relationship with should be included.

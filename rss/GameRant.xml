  Mt. Firmament is an area released in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  1.1. It has some different puzzles compared to the earlier area of Jinzhou, but it's not any less satisfactory to explore. One key difference between the two places is that there's no
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  Sonance Casket in Mt. Firmament. Instead, players will have to collect an item called
  <strong>
   Windchimer
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  After collecting some Windchimer, Rovers naturally want to find the person who'd take it in exchange for some sweet Astrite in
  <em>
   WuWa
  </em>
  . According to the item's description, Xian'ge is the one they should seek. However,
  <strong>
   Xian'ge location in
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  is not so obvious. That is, at least, for those who haven't done the required quest yet.

  Players can find Xian'ge in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  by teleporting to the
  <strong>
   Hongzhen
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Resonance Nexus
  </strong>
  . However, the lady won't appear until Rovers complete
  <strong>
   Main Quest Chapter 1 Act 7 - Thaw of Eons
  </strong>
  , so they must first fix the time anomaly on Mt. Firmament. In this mission, players will join Jinhsi to Mt. Firmament to free Sentinel Jue and eventually reach her second awakening. All this must be done for her to assume full leadership over Jianzhou.

 <p>
  Afterward, players will also get the chance to speak with Sentinel Jue and ask them about their past and origins. Here, Rovers may be surprised to learn about their past roles and their relation to the Sentinel; which explains why they had visions of the dragon when they first arrived in Jinzhou and why they have been dreaming about Mt. Firmament.

  <strong>
   YouTube
  </strong>
  has suspended monetization on Dr Disrespect's channel following recent allegations regarding his permanent Twitch ban. The controversy has significantly impacted YouTube star Dr Disrespect's career, drawing criticism from fans and fellow creators, and leading to the termination of several partnerships.

  For those not familiar with the backstory, Herschel "Guy" Beahm IV, known as Dr Disrespect, was banned from Twitch in 2020 under circumstances that sparked speculation and theories. The exact reason for the ban remained undisclosed for about four years, fueling ongoing online discussions. However, a former Twitch employee, Cody Conners, made claims on June 21 suggesting that Dr Disrespect's ban was related to inappropriate conversations with a minor via Twitch's "Whisper" direct messaging feature, allegedly with plans to meet at TwitchCon. Conners did not provide evidence to support these allegations, and Dr Disrespect later confirmed having engaged in "inappropriate" conversations with a minor in 2017.

  Dr Disrespect's YouTube Channel Monetization Suspended
 </h2>
 <p>
  Since these revelations, Dr Disrespect is facing significant repercussions as companies such as The San Francisco 49ers and Turtle Beach have ended their associations with him. Adding to these mounting challenges, IGN reported on June 28 that a representative from YouTube informed them that Dr Disrespect's channel has been removed from the YouTube Partner Program. This decision means that the channel can no longer generate revenue through YouTube. YouTube stated that this action was taken due to violations of their Creator Responsibility policy, which dictates that if a creator's behavior outside of the platform negatively impacts users, employees, or the community, monetization may be suspended as a measure to safeguard the community.

  It is notable that Dr Disrespect moved to YouTube following his Twitch suspension in 2020 and amassed a substantial following, currently standing at 4.7 million subscribers. However, his subscriber count has recently declined by over 30,000, highlighting the significant impact of the controversy on his channel. It is also notable that Dr Disrespect's Twitch suspension also resulted in significant repercussions, as he discussed losing several partnerships in April as a consequence.

  Furthermore, several fellow streamers, including TimTheTatman and Nickmercs, have publicly criticized Dr Disrespect's behavior, expressing disappointment. Popular streamer Turner "Tfue" Tenney has called on Twitch to release Dr Disrespect's chat messages with a minor. In addition,

  A fan-made
  <strong>

   </em>
  </strong>
  chart reveals characters with the highest appearance rate in the Divergent Universe.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  has introduced a brand-new mode in version 2.3, Divergent Universe, to make it easier to farm Planar Ornaments. It serves as an expansion to the Simulated Universe, featuring a number of Curios that give players temporary buffs. In addition to Planar Ornaments, the combat-oriented mode offers Stellar Jades and Self-Modeling Resins.

 <p>
  The purpose of
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's Divergent Universe is to clear multiple stages to collect Synchronicity Points and farm Planar Ornaments. Increasing the Synchronicity Level grants players various rewards, including Stellar Jades, Refined Aethers, Lost Crystals, and Relic Remains. The Divergent Universe works similarly to the Simulated Universe, but there are several differences between the two modes. For instance, unlike the original SU, the DU features equations and allows players to create save files once they've completed a run.

  chart shared by LvlUrArti on Reddit has revealed the appearance rate of all characters in the Divergent Universe mode. Ruan Mei secures the top spot with an impressive 80.39% usage rate, which is somewhat predictable given that she also dominates the Apocalyptic Shadow mode. The newest five-star unit, Firefly, ranks behind Ruan Mei with a whopping 68.11%.

  l's Divergent Universe is a combat-only mode that offers five-star Planar Ornament sets, including Fleet of the Ageless, Space Sealing Station, Inert Salsatto, Broken Kneel, and Rutilant Arena. Each set has a permanent effect that improves a certain aspect of the wearer. For example, Inert Salsotto increases the character's CRIT rate, while Broken Kneel boosts their effect resistance.

  The Jagged Peak area is one such place that players will likely visit after encountering the vengeful Igon, who is lamenting the fact that he won't be able to face down the foe known as
  <strong>
   Bayle the Dread

  . This will mark the start of this side quest that will lead

  players on a journey to get rid of the dragon once and for all, and this guide will show you just how to do that.

  Before you even try to start the questline, make sure you have sufficiently upgraded your character, equipment and done the same for your Scadutree Blessings and Revered Spirit Ash Blessings. This will ensure that you are going to be able to dish out and take more damage, and so will your chosen Spirit Ashes summons.

  Now, head
  <strong>

  and reach the

   Igon

  . Speak to him to find out about Bayle the Dread. Now, head southeast on the path, defeating the Ancient Dragon-Man once when he invades and later on in the Dragon Pit. This will lead you to

 <p>
  The path forward is full of encounters with a few Jagged Peak Drakes, so consider using the

  to deal extra damage to these foes. After defeating the pair of warring drakes, you will find Igon once more and can speak to him to obtain
  <strong>
   Igon's Furled Finger
  </strong>
  . Continue forward, avoiding the encounter with
  <strong>
   Ancient Dragon Senessax
  </strong>
  if you wish to, and go into the nearby tunnel.

  As a dragon-type enemy, Balye the Dread's

  There is absolutely no shame in counting on some help when it comes to dealing with Bayle the Dread, so be sure to use your strongest Spirit Ash summon.

  How To Beat Bayle The Dread In Elden Ring

 <p>
  This threatening foe is definitely among the hardest players will face in the DLC and even the base game, with its agility and damaging abilities making for a fatal concoction. The large size of the enemy can also prove to be a hindrance, requiring players to manage their stamina and positioning well in order to fight effectively. Aiming for its head will always deal more damage, but that is easier said than done, especially compared to other dragons.

  With your two allies by your side, it is now time to take on Bayle the Dread. The dragon is capable of AoE and focused attacks, and it is vital for players to keep calm and
  <strong>
   dodge towards the attacks
  </strong>
  . This will not only negate the damage, but it will also give you a chance to
  <strong>
   attack its head
  </strong>
  for additional damage.

 <p>
  Staying close means dealing with its swipes and lightning-infused wing attacks, with dodging at the very last second being your only hope of survival. If you are further away, Bayle the Dread will use its breath to attack, so you will need to keep moving to the sides and wait it out. The boss will repeat these attacks in this phase, so take your time and master your timing.

  Once you get it down to half health, this is when Bayle the Dread will get really angry. At the start, get a fair distance away from the dragon while it is
  <strong>
   charging up an AoE attack
  </strong>
  that has a large range, all while indicated areas on the floor erupt in flames. Get past that, and Bayle starts flying around the arena,
  <strong>
   bombarding the player with lightning
  </strong>
  . The best way to avoid damage is to keep moving or, if you are lucky, skirt along the boundaries of the arena to prevent its attacks from reaching you.

 <p>
  Another new attack Bayle uses sees the boss
  <strong>
   spray the ground with fire
  </strong>
  . Sprinting is your best bet here, and when you see the dragon scream into the air, it will send a
  <strong>
   line of lightning
  </strong>
  towards you, so keep moving to avoid getting caught. Finally, Bayle the Dread might utilize a
  <strong>
   powerful ground attack
  </strong>
  that can be fatal for weaker characters. When it starts gathering energy, start moving away and jump when the attack is unleashed to prevent yourself from getting caught. Players with the

  <em>
   <strong>
    Dungeons and Dragons
   </strong>
  </em>
  ' archlich-turned-deity supervillain Vecna recently made his way into
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  , standing shoulder-to-shoulder with icons like Freddy Krueger and the Xenomorph. For veteran fans of the dark god, this guest appearance has many fun references to his and
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  ' shared history.

  Vecna's cameo in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is coming at the zenith of the TTRPG's popularity, with 2024 being
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  's 50th anniversary. This occasion coincides with a massive rules update to the game's current ruleset of
  <em>
   D&amp;D 5e
  </em>
  —undoubtedly the biggest edition of the game in terms of reach and notoriety. Interestingly, the show that helped
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  reach this peak,
  <em>
   Stranger Things
  </em>
  , is also featured in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  . Not only that, but the form its inclusion takes is with the Demogorgon killer, itself one of that show's
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  references.

 <p>
  The Whispering One has been no slouch in terms of popularity, with the lich god also getting a namedrop in
  <em>
   Stranger Things
  </em>
  . Moreover, he also featured in the live-play show
  <em>
   Critical Role
  </em>
  , which also accelerated the mainstream appeal of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  . Vecna's proliferation was further proven with the star role he was given in the module
  <em>
   Vecna: Eve of Ruin
  </em>
  , the epic-level finale to the last ten years of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  . As such, it's no wonder that his appearance in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  bends over backwards to pay tribute to Vecna's legacy.

  Vecna's Voice Actor Is A D&amp;D Legend
 </h3>
 <p>
  The VA for Vecna's
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  appearance is very fitting. Here Vecna is played by prolific voice actor Matthew Mercer, known for his roles in series like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  and many more. He's also the dungeon master for the aforementioned
  <em>
   Critical Role
  </em>
  , where he naturally played Vecna back when the lich was the first campaign's main villain. His reprise in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is as deliciously malevolent as ever.

  The Book Of Vile Darkness
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Book of Vile Darkness gives Vecna a variety of spell abilities in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  , sitting proudly in his chest cavity as he hunts down Survivors. The tome itself is also a magical item within
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  , one that dates back to 1979. In its current
  <em>
   D&amp;D 5e
  </em>
  form, it retains the customizable list of properties—with examples available on random tables in the
  <em>
   Dungeon Master's Guide
  </em>
  . This foul almanac is said to be a record of incredible evil, from formulae on becoming a lich to descriptions of horrific acts and ideas.

 <p>
  What may not be known by newer fans is that The Book of Vile Darkness is a real handbook, albeit not in the form of a magical item.
  <em>
   The Book of Vile Darkness
  </em>
  is a supplement for
  <em>
   D&amp;D 3.5e
  </em>
  , one that contains rules on playing evil characters, running evil creatures, the mechanics of desecration and torture devices, and much more. That book stands as one of the most controversial to ever come out of the IP's 50-year history, going into incredibly gruesome subject matter to an extent that many find distasteful. In that sense, it certainly reflects the maddening evil of the arcane tome that shares its name.

  Cues From 5e Vecna
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Vecna of
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  is very much the one found throughout
  <em>
   D&amp;D 5e
  </em>
  , sharing the design that was released back in 2022 with
  <em>
   The Vecna Dossier
  </em>
  and used partially throughout
  <em>
   Eve of Ruin
  </em>
  . Both that dossier and the 2024 module use the same statblock for Vecna, one referenced in
  <em>
   Dead by Daylight
  </em>
  . The biggest references are the Afterthought dagger, a magical weapon put front-and-center by
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  <em>
   5e
  </em>
  's Vecna, and the Flight of the Damned ability.

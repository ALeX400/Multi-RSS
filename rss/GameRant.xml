  Politics is a fascinating system. Part machine, part popularity contest, and part insider trading boot camp, it has the power to transform society and take it apart in equal measure. For the morbidly curious, plenty of political simulation games offer a glimpse at how exactly the sausage is made from a whole plethora of different countries, cultural climates, and visual depictions of the inside of that figurative butcher's abattoir.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Political simulations
  </strong>
  distinguish themselves from the grand strategy or nation-building genre (although they might include elements of both) by incarnating their players into precarious flesh-and-blood meatbags that are just as vulnerable to an assassin's blade as they are to briefcases of sweet, intoxicating dollar bills. Rather than hang above their citizens' heads in the sky, players of political simulation games are exposed to the twin tensions of corruption and death (political or otherwise) while navigating a nightmarishly complex ecosystem of checks, balances, and lobbyist lunches.

   Political simulation games come in various flavors. Ranging from the traditional 4X grand strategy to hardcore survival sims to online-only web page-based titles that are underground cult classics. By their very nature, political sims are always complex, but there are varying degrees of complexity, and more isn't always better. How granular a game becomes is both a strength and a weakness. Luckily, this genre is moderately popular, and plenty of options are suitable for different tastes.

 <ul>
  <li>
   The shifting economic landscape of the Victorian era and the subsequent political possibilities are simulated in this grand strategy game
  </li>
  <li>
   While not the central focus, the simulation of a country's internal politics and the knock-on effects of policies can lead to intriguing scenarios
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Victoria 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes a top-down approach to its simulation of politics as players must navigate the tension between appeasing their populations and getting their own way, lest they endanger their legitimacy and, therefore, their political capital. The game takes place during a time of political and economic transformation, the Victorian era, and as such, players have to prepare themselves for unexpected outcomes to their decisions. For example, factories might be a huge economic boost to a country, but the political clout that factory owners accrue as a result may have major disruption potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  Favor doesn't just come from within political parties, as players can leverage the popular support of movements. The legitimacy that democratic votes, special interest groups (clout), or a country's ruler (president, monarch, and so on) lend also depends on the country's setup.
  <em>
   Victoria 3
  </em>
  is not a pure politics simulator, as it fits more in the "grand strategy/builder" genre, but its inclusion of these systems and the run-off effects into other areas enriches the experience by demonstrating the interconnectedness of political, social, and economic factors and giving weight to every action.

  Politics isn't just about raising campaign funds, serving interests, and backstabbing. Policies can be set by individuals and the charismatic archons that influence them, as

  's "Ideology" DLC deftly demonstrates, albeit in an off-world political arena. Players can create their own "ideoligion" (or choose from presets) that allows them to customize the nitty-gritty, "invisible" policies held by ordinary people or, in RimWorld's case, the cult policies their (ostensibly doomed) colonists.
 </p>
 <p>
  From choosing who has to change their family name to deciding on the validity of vampirism or the benefits of voluntarily going blind, "Ideology" hands the player powerful political control, expanding the game's already excellent potential for emergent storytelling. With a full spread of precepts, structures, styles, and cultures to pick from, players can mold their colonies into just about anything.

    Twilight Struggle

Historical events come to life as hot-blooded politics, as each round could lead to disaster or opportunity, depending on the player's political finesse. With the world to win, it's the US versus the USSR in the most chilling game of chicken the world has ever seen.

 <p>
  The interface, soundbites, and art immersively rack up the tension. Games can last an hour or weeks, and for strategy, fans will prove difficult to put down once they have the rules down, thanks to a helpful tutorial.

 <ul>

   <em>
    We. The Revolution
   </em>
   takes place during the French Revolution when the heads of nobles weren't the only things on the chopping block
  </li>
  <li>
   The player needs to navigate the wrath of the crowd, powerful figures, and their own conscience
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Modern politics can seem like a mess at times, so perhaps the best way to understand it now is to witness how it all started: during the first days of the Reign of Terror following the French Revolution. The player in
  <strong>
   <em>
    We. The Revolution
   </em>
  </strong>
  is put into a judge's chair and asked to navigate the fraught and deadly political landscape of Paris in 1794 when the heads of royalty and other figures of power were regularly rolling courtesy of the liberal use of the guillotine.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game mixes turn-based battling with clue-finding and case-building, and each genre snippet integrates well with the other. The cases themselves are sublimely ethically ambiguous, but the head of a judge is hardly safer than any other, and the player will need to win over the people and powerful influencers if they want to keep theirs as well as contend with the opinions of their family and their own moral compass as they reach their decisions.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Cynical, biting, and satirical:
   <em>
    This Is The President
   </em>
   portrays the dark side of modern politics
  </li>
  <li>
   The player will be asked to deal with policy, handle crooked colleagues, and ultimately, get themselves off the hook for past crimes
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  It's an open secret that politics can be a dirty business. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    This Is The President
   </em>
  </strong>
  , dirt is a currency that players can use to keep their opponents (and even members of their own team) compliant and quiet. The player's goal is to amend the constitution in order to make all those past bad business boohoos go away by achieving full immunity from the law for all presidents. Political video games are always a matter of controversy, but this one is more charged than an electric chair.
 </p>
 <p>
  Being a narrative game, there are moments of political decision-making, but the President is unambiguously a crook, and the player is asked to play accordingly. As games about being the President of the United States go, this one really takes the cheeseburger in terms of its cutting satire and bizarre plot twists, and it can get downright silly at times (perhaps a reflection of realpolitik today), but it may delight those political lovers with a dark disposition all the same.

   <em>

   </em>

  <em>

  <em>

 <p>
  One of the most notable ways in which
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  deviates from the original is through the council system. Thirty years have passed since the events of the first game, and perhaps the city-dwellers have rediscovered democracy, but they've implemented a council system whereby different factions of the city get a say in what laws can be implemented in the game. To get any laws passed through this council, players will have to negotiate and cajole the council members, introducing an element of political intrigue that was not there in the first game. With enough political acumen, savvy players can even convince the council to give them dictatorial powers. Quelling rebellions before they have a chance to gather steam, negotiating with neighbors, and keeping the council members pacified is all a balancing act that adds a political sim element to
  <em>
   Frostpunk 2
  </em>
  , making the already difficult task before the player even harder.

  For the true sticklers of the real-life process, AKA political nerds, most video game simulations probably don't cut it. But when it comes to dishing out the nitty gritty of arduous committee meetings and grueling reading sessions,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lawgivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  gives players a chance to take part in evolving or protecting the state or country's constitution to their heart's content. Amend or pass bills, deal with lobbyists, take part in diplomatic missions, enable trade, wars, or trade wars; as government simulation games go, there's a lot to contend with that others of the genre shy away from digging into.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game is open-access but still receives regular updates from this massively ambitious project's (solo) developer: for example,
  <em>
   Lawgivers 2
  </em>
  had a sizeable update right at the end of 2023 that added options for military intervention, a country-appropriate "first past the post" system, and most impressively, multiplayer functionality. As the game continues to develop, it is exciting to see more political possibilities open up. Considering that the first game has been well-received so far, this might be the candidate to back.

  Booting up any entry in the

  series seems daunting at first, with the UI blasting the player with an ungodly amount of information at once. However, once the player gets used to which screen does what and how to juggle political capital (the game's primary resource), the game itself becomes remarkably focused and simple. Each game in the series pretty much does the same thing, but it makes sense to play the newest

  entry
  <em>
   du jour
  </em>
  , as each attempts to mirror the politics of the real world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every tweak and newly implemented idea in
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  tips one or many of the various political scales, and the results, while mostly delayed as with real-life politics, feel realistic and meaningful. While the governance of the population's health and the health of the economy is the main gameplay loop, in-person politics is there. However, it is not as involved as other games of the same ilk, for which it loses a few points in the "best political simulation games" contest.

 <ul>
  <li>
   The politics of the past are on full display as
   <em>
    Crusader Kings 3
   </em>
   does not shy away from the gruesome truths of feudalism
  </li>
  <li>
   Players can do pretty much anything they can imagine that a ruler in times past would have done, reshaping the history of the world as they see fit
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Far from the buttoned-up, polished, media-trained rulers of the modern era, the lords and royals of old seem like rabid savages, and that's exactly the kind of role players of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Crusader Kings 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   <strong>
   </strong>
  </em>
  are expected to follow after seizing control of their chosen dominions. Court intrigue, monstrous power grabs, and circular family trees are par for the course. And unlike other medieval strategy sims, the player's resources and tools have minds of their own. Family members, vassal lords, and even mad court jesters could be the knife in the dark that ends generations of sovereign rule.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keeping everyone in the circle of power happy is politics at its purest, and
  <em>
   Crusader Kings 3
  </em>
  is a prime example of this concept, gamified. That isn't to say that a playthrough will be entirely constrained to pacifying brothers, uncles, or brother-uncles, as
  <em>
   CK3
  </em>
  offers a vast world to negotiate, explore, and conquer. Players can alter history, warp the face of the medieval world, and create wild scenarios, for example, a Europe ruled by a Mongolian nudist dynasty of cannibal giants.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Player decisions alter the course of history, ensuring no two games are the same.
  </li>
  <li>
   Guide a nation, big or small, from the 1444 in the Middle Ages all the way to 1821.

 <p>
  Initially released back in 2013,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Europa Universalis 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  has been in active development since then, with regular updates in the form of new DLCs, quality-of-life improvements, and polish. Like the previous EU games,
  <em>
   EU4
  </em>
  is a historical strategy game where players take control of a country in the Middle Ages and guide it through the ebbs and flows of history to modern times. Political intrigue is at the core of
  <em>
   EU4
  </em>
  because in order to make sure their nation doesn't get overtaken or destroyed before reaching the end, players will have to rely on warfare, economy, and diplomacy in equal measure.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it's possible to build an army big enough to take on the entire world, it's unlikely at best, especially for new players. It's much easier to fall back on diplomacy to pacify the neighbors, ease relations, and gradually expand than to directly defeat enemies in open warfare. Naturally, this means recognizing when to push and when to pull back, and understanding the political motivations of the other world leaders is key. Fans of the political sim genre will have plenty to scratch their itch here because players can choose to take on the role of any nation that existed in 1444; the replayability value is incredible.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Suzarain
   </em>
   takes place in a real-life-inspired fictional world steeped in the same problems as an emerging nation from the 1950s
  </li>
  <li>
   The gameplay is narrative-heavy and places emphasis on immersing the player in the world and its politics
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Much of the time, bystanders outside the machine might forget that while certain stances in politics seem like no-brainers, it is a vast network of people who operate within, and they themselves constitute that system. Nothing conveys
  <em>
   realpolitik
  </em>
  better than
  <strong>
   <em>
    Suzerain
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a game in which the player takes on the role of a politician in a fictional geopolitical setting in the 1950s. The fantasy-European-ish world helps to immerse the player in their role and takes away the benefit of hindsight that a student of history might have.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first playthrough, the player's ability to reload a save is disabled, which forces the player to think seriously about their decisions. The story is as occasionally hopeful as it is cynical and crushing, but the ever-incoming crises are a real test of any player's ideals as they anxiously await the next line of text. The politics and lore of the world are richly realized, but the narrative-based gameplay may make some power-hungry leaders feel a little constrained.

The people may rise up to kill their less-than-benevolent dictator or one of those two Cold War superpowers currently duking it out might take a dislike to the political vibes of the banana republic and will need buttering up to (best case scenario) leave the dictatorship alone.

   The replayability potential is huge, considering its level of customization and variety of starting options

  While other political simulations turn their focus on top-level governance and begin after the player has been elected as president or prime minister,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Political Process
   </em>
  </strong>
  gives the player the freedom to rule over US constituencies large and small, from mayor all the way to the top and everything in between. Miraculously, very little is sacrificed to achieve this ambitious feat, making it one of the best political games out there, especially for those with a penchant for realism and policy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The player can choose to run in one of 3,000 counties across 50 states, customize just about everything in their policies (so long as voters sign off), and customize their personal appearance with sliders. While the UI is a little basic and isn't as flashy as other pol-sims, the level of detail involved in creating this political masterwork and its potential for replayability is staggering.

  <li>
   One of the most polished WW2 grand strategy games with AAA quality.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Paradox Interactive has been the face of the historical grand strategy genre and the
  <em>
   Hearts of Iron
  </em>
  series is their take on a World War 2 era grand strategy war game.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Hearts of Iron 4
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the direct sequel to
  <em>
   HOI3
  </em>
  and leans heavily into the war aspect of the genre, keeping tasks like politicking and diplomacy as a secondary focus. Fortunately, it more than manages to achieve what it sets out to do because military management is where
  <em>
   HOI4
  </em>
  really shines.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game can essentially serve as a crash course in military strategy, from managing supply lines and building factories to making weapons to equip soldiers to then deploy those soldiers on the ground, in the air, and on the water. Of course, it's only possible to deploy them if there are tanks to drive, fighter jets to fly, and ships to sail. All of which can only be made if there are robust, functioning factories that pump it all out. But none of the above would even be possible without food, which is a whole other can of worms. Thanks to its incredible complexity, players can easily sink dozens of hours into fine-tuning and optimizing their army strength, creating an unbeatable WW2 army to take over the entire world in the least amount of time possible.

   <em>
    Supreme Ruler Ultimate
   </em>
   is the sixth installment in the
   <em>
    Supreme Ruler
   </em>
   series, melding the best of the previous games into one.

  <li>
   Focuses on implementing real-time strategy on a global scale with the ability to pause the game at any time.

 <p>
  If there is one thing
  <strong>
   <em>
    Supreme Ruler Ultimate
   </em>
  </strong>
  gets right, it's realism. Managing a country in this game will see players forced to contend with problems that feel like they are plucked out of a local news broadcast. The world feels familiar, and the problems feel like their solutions should be apparent, but it's never quite so easy. Just like the real world,
  <em>
   Supreme Ruler Ultimate
  </em>
  is a game of compromise. Of course, players can eventually figure out the most optimal route to success in any given situation, but that's the nature of games. Best of all, even players who aren't very familiar with this genre can dip their toes into this title thanks to the abundant presence of AI helpers disguised as government ministers. Don't know how to untangle the web of economy because numbers are confusing? Don't worry; simply ask a minister to take over the task and delegate responsibility like a true politician.
  <em>
   Supreme Ruler Ultimate
  </em>
  is a daunting game at first glance, especially for newcomers to the genre, but it's one of the most rewarding political simulation games to get a handle on, and it's easier than it looks.

   <strong>
    Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
   </strong>
  </em>
  was a major deviation from FromSoftware's usual soulslike gameplay, with a main feature being the difference in combat. Focusing on deflection rather than dodging,
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  has become known for its combat, often cited as the best in FromSoft's repertoire of games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another feature present in
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  is Combat Arts; damaging abilities that the player can use with a range of different effects. Some are the regular damage dealing attacks, while others should be used for specific scenarios, while still others can completely obliterate enemies. There aren't a vast number of Combat Arts, but there are definitely some that are better than others, and some that are amazing to use for any encounter.

  There are a vast number of Combat Arts in
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,
  </em>
  but the one that is the easiest to obtain is
  <strong>
   Whirlwind Slash.
  </strong>
  Available early in the game for one skill point, Whirlwind Slash is a solid and consistent option for dealing with enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  It deals two slashes in a circular motion, allowing players to quickly damage enemies and dispatch groups of adversaries. It costs no Spirit Emblems to use, making it a reliable Combat Art, and one that can be used repeatedly.

  FromSoftware's games always have some flashy and over-the-top attacks.
  <strong>
   One Mind
  </strong>
  fits the bill, as it looks like something that Vergil would use. However, despite its attractive visuals, it isn't very useful to use in combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  While capable of dealing with regular enemies, tougher opponents can simply tank it and poise through the barrage of slashes, attacking the player when they are vulnerable while using the Combat Art. However, the final slash of One Mind can be a powerful attack if players pull it off.

  Not every Combat Art is as good as others.
  <strong>
   Spiral Cloud Passage
  </strong>
  is definitely better than some others, but doesn't quite compare to some higher-tier Combat Arts. Its use on its own is still sufficient, but doesn't do much compared to its peers.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, when combined with status effects, Spiral Cloud Passage shines. It can burn enemies, leading to easy damage and a window of opportunity to quickly attack them as setting opponents on fire staggers them. With status effects, it can work well against bosses and not just normal enemies. Despite this, its cost can be hefty. It requires 3 Spirit Emblems for the full combo, while also needing more Spirit Emblems if using a status effect acquired from a Prosthetic Tool via the Living Force skill.

  A large part of
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  is dealing posture damage. This is the prime way to defeat bosses, even more so than attacking their health. Another notable portion of the game is Senpou Temple, in which the Senpou Esoteric Text can be found to unlock
  <strong>
   Praying Strikes - Exorcism
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This might not be the flashiest of Combat Arts, but its unique properties can be powerful. Praying Strikes - Exorcism can't be deflected, and is able to deal a good bit of posture damage, with the final attack dealing the most,. It can also be charged to deal a heavier hit that can stagger enemies.

  <strong>
   Ashina Cross
  </strong>
  is at the end of the Ashina Arts tree, as it is a strong Combat Art.
 </p>
 <p>
  With two quick attacks, this Combat Art can damage enemies who let their guard down for a bit. Even if enemies have their guard up, Ashina Cross can deal a decent amount of posture damage, which can be repeated several times as it only costs two Spirit Emblems. It is also very responsive, letting players deflect attacks by redrawing their sword in time.

Players can use Prosthetic Tools in combination with the Combat Art, or very quickly after Shadowfall ends, making for a heavy-hitting flurry of attacks.

  Combat Art is a pretty good one, being a skill that can cause great damage against enemies in subsequent playthroughs.

 <p>
  Dragon Flash is an extremely long-range Combat Art, with both the initial slash and the follow-up attack able to hit enemies from a greT distance away. On top of that, it deals a respectable amount of posture damage, making it useful as an attack that can keep the pressure up for enemies that escape out of melee range.

  isn't too punishing on an enemy's vitality or posture. What it is useful for is its convenience, as it can dodge an enemy's attack as it launches the player into the air.

  As it is frequently used by Isshin,
  <strong>
   Ichimonji Double
  </strong>
  , as would be expected, is found in the Ashina Arts skill tree, as a higher-end skill. As an upgraded version of the regular Ichimonji, it now features an additional attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the added attack, it can still be used as the regular Ichimonji. It can be used in the air to decrease the time it takes to use the first attack, requiring the Mid-air Combat Arts skill. It deals a large amount of posture damage, while also restoring some of the player's own posture. However, if using the Combat Art while on the ground, it leaves players vulnerable for a long period after they use it.

  A fabled and legendary sword, the Mortal Blade allows the player to unleash devastating power against any enemy. As an upgraded version of the regular Mortal Draw, the
  <strong>
   Empowered Mortal Draw
  </strong>
  is one of the last skills available, which adds up given its strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  It ican deal a severe amount of posture damage, easily skipping through portions of the target's posture. It can also harshly harm, being able to deal noticeably more damage than regular attacks. It can trivialize fights, as it can bully enemies, especially when paired with the Mid-air Combat Arts skill, since it is treated as a charged attack when jumping. The only negative is the Spirit Emblem cost, requiring six when using both attacks.

  Fasnacht Day is one of the most popular limited-time events in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76.
   </em>
  </strong>
  Despite being called Fasnacht Day, the event typically takes place over a two-week period. During this period, the Fasnacht Day event will automatically start at the top of every hour in Helvetia. Players have a small chance of being awarded some pretty rare items upon successfully completing a Fasnacht Day event.
 </p>
 <p>
  From hyper-rare masks to unique and highly sought-after plans, there are lots of things for players to grind for. Each year, Bethesda adds new rewards. By introducing new rewards each year, veteran players constantly have something new to work toward getting. This article will cover some of the most valuable rewards available during this event.

   Item: A CAMP resource generator that produces cooking oil passively
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This tradable plan is a valuable one. Players are willing to pay quite a lot of caps to get hold of a copy of the Motorized Butter Churn plan. While it isn't as valuable as many of the other items on this list,
  <strong>
   players have been known to pay over 20k caps for this particular plan.
  </strong>
  What makes it such a good plan is its ability to produce cooking oil at the player's CAMP. Cooking oil can be broken down into 1 plastic and 1 oil. Since oil is quite a rare resource, it's easy to see why this plan is so valuable.

  CAMP decor items are always pretty popular. Bethesda is seemingly always releasing new CAMP decor items to please those who enjoy coming up with creative CAMP builds. For this year's Fasnacht event, players can collect a total of 10 different flower/flowering box plans.
  <strong>
   While most players will easily get one or two of these plans, getting all 10 might be a challenge, making the whole set pretty rare.

   Item: A unique T-45 Power Armor Helmet designed to look like the Winter Man Mask
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  There are two versions of this mask. There's a tradable version and an untradable version. Due to various duplication glitches, the tradable version doesn't hold much value. However, the untradable version is still a rare and hard-to-come-by item.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   It counts as a rare mask drop, meaning that players have only a small chance of receiving this helmet upon completing any given Fasnacht Day event.
  </strong>
  Unfortunately, nobody aside from the player will know that it's a rare item because there's no way to distinguish it from its tradable counterpart, aside from the player being unable to drop it.

 <p>
  There are plenty of masks to collect. While many of them aren't worth much, some are worth a lot.

   Players are often willing to part ways with top-tier weapons or other rare apparel pieces

  in order to get hold of some of the rare Fasnacht masks.

 <p>
  While the masks in this entry aren't as valuable as the glowing masks, they are still worth getting. The list of old rare masks can be seen below. Keep in mind that their values fluctuate. That said, the list below has been arranged by their typical value (from least to most valuable):

   Items: A collection of four glowing masks
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The first collection of glowing masks was introduced during the February Fasnacht event in 2024. This set consists of four masks:
  <strong>
   Glowing Honey Bee, Glowing Blue Devil, Glowing Scorchbeast,
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   Glowing the Scorchbeast Queen.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Out of the masks in the set, the Glowing Scorchbeast Queen is the most highly sought-after. That said, the value is determined by how much a player is willing to trade for one of these rare masks. Since these masks have been in the game for a year, they aren't as valuable as the newer masks, but they are still worth way more than max caps.

   Items: Six ultra-rare glowing masks
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Fasnacht made two appearances last year. Once in February, and then it came back for two weeks in the summer. When they were released,
  <strong>
   players had less than a 0.3% chance of being awarded one of these glowing masks upon completing Fasnacht Day.
  </strong>
  That chance only applied to events that were completed with all five robots still functioning. All of these glowing masks are very rare. They should never be sold in a player's CAMP Vendor. The six masks can be seen below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Glowing Alien
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Minotaur
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Pig
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Robot
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Turkey
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Unicorn
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As for the value order, there are two that most players want above all others. They are the Glowing Alien and the Glowing Unicorn.

   Items: Four new glowing masks to collect
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Bethesda has added four new masks for Fasnacht's 2025 festivities.
  </strong>
  Until players start getting their hands on these new masks, it is unclear which one is going to be the most popular one. The four new masks can be seen below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Glowing Abe
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Bigfoot
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Jackalope
  </li>
  <li>
   Glowing Veggie Man
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Just like all the other glowing masks, there will also be an uncommon variant. These masks will look exactly the same as the glowing versions. The only difference is that the uncommon ones don't glow. While the uncommon ones are fun to collect, they aren't going to be worth very much.

  <em>

  series has been ongoing for some time now. With each new installment, Nihon Falcom has tweaked the gameplay with new features and systems to keep the experience fresh and interesting in this lengthy JRPG series. For
  <strong>
   <em>
    Trails Through Daybreak 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the combat simulator has been greatly expanded and now features a series of mini-dungeons that provide generous rewards. But to make the most out of this experience, you will want to gather as many S-Tokens (short for Shard Tokens) as possible, and here is how they can be obtained.

  While you do get some S-Tokens early on in the game, you can only really start collecting them once you've reached Act I-A. As part of the story, you will have to access the Marchen Garten a second time. When you log out, you will unlock the ability to reveal hidden nodes containing S-Tokens with the Search function. Small nodes are worth 50 S-Tokens while the larger nodes are worth 200.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is important to note that these nodes do not appear to respawn, but there are a lot of them scattered all over the place. You can also get small amounts of S-Tokens from destroying crystals you come across while exploring Marchen Garten.

  <strong>
   S-Tokens have two uses. The first and most important purpose is to use them to analyze the Mystic Cube while in Marchen Garten.
  </strong>
  By holding down the button (the left mouse button on PC) depicted in the screenshot above, Mare will be able to use the S-Tokens. Each time you fully analyze the Mystic Cube, you will gain a variety of rewards like:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Cosmetics
  </li>
  <li>
   Skill Stones
  </li>
  <li>
   Sepith (All eight kinds)
  </li>
  <li>
   Consumables (including Zeram Capsules on occasion)
  </li>
  <li>
   Ingredients for cooking
  </li>
  <li>
   Fishing Bait
  </li>
  <li>
   U-Material
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once you've fully analyzed the Mystic Cube, the progress bar goes back down to zero percent and will keep filling up the bar as long as you hold down the analyze button. On occasion, the Mystic Cube will upgrade to a rarer version which will contain unique items.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   S-Tokens can also be used to refund any skill points you've allocated via Craft Enhance.
  </strong>
  While it only costs 500 S-Tokens to refund, it is recommended that you save them for analyzing the Mystic Cube instead.

  Unless you are close to filling the bar to 100%,
  <strong>
   you are better off waiting until you have at least a few thousand S-Tokens
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   The more you use to analyze the Mystic Cube, the more Sepith you get.
  </strong>
  This also includes Sepith Mass, which is exchanged for Mira. You will also have a lot of Sepith to craft new Quartz and unlock Orbment slots on your Xipha.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since S-Tokens are fairly easy to farm, you can quickly amass a large amount and then analyze the Mystic Cube to stock up on Sepith and Mira, which will allow your party to be better prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.

      <title>Best Indie Games With Gloomy Settings</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Many games over the years have championed bright and colorful graphics, cartoon styles, and a general sense of joy and charm. There's something to be said about this outright hopeful, sunny outlook, but the quiet, dark, and gloomy atmospheres of games such as
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  provide a stark alternative.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  These titles are deeply atmospheric, featuring downtrodden spirits and dark, mysterious environments that evoke a sense of eeriness. For players who enjoy the murky, dreary atmospheres of
  <em>
   Metro 2033
  </em>
  , the
  <em>
   Stalker
  </em>
  games, or even
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  , these indie titles are worth a try.

  <em>
   Rain World
  </em>
  is a hardcore 2D platformer that tasks players with surviving in a truly harsh, interconnected world. The overgrown ruins of
  <em>
   Rain World
  </em>
  make for a surprisingly immersive setting, elevated by unique art direction and creature designs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The game's creatures are often menacing, almost creepy, and fit perfectly in the industrial wasteland. Coupled with a dark color palette and the occasional spikes of horror,
  <em>
   Rain World
  </em>
  makes for a decidedly gloomy experience.

  This hardcore survival simulation does little to hide its gloominess; the game's dark and gray environments, facilitated by constant winter weather, consistently suppress and subdue, but the rich gloom that overwhelms
  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  is counterbalanced by moments of true tranquility and fiery coziness.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is because of
  <em>
   The Long Dark's
  </em>
  eerie, lonely setting and the forgotten expanses that run between its various abandoned shelters that the moments of peace are able to shine. Stumbling into an inky-black cabin, sparsely lit by shafts of dusty light, and bringing the warm orange glow of fire into the room evokes a certain coziness that's unique to
  <em>
   The Long Dark

  Action-packed and truly challenging on harder difficulties,
  <em>
   Ravenswatch
  </em>
  is an action-roguelike that excels in online co-op. While somewhat typical in its action, the slick art direction and dark fantasy of its fairy tale world give
  <em>
   Ravenswatch
  </em>
  a unique look and feel.
 </p>
 <p>
  The desperation of the gameplay, facilitated by a constantly ticking timer, prevents
  <em>
   Ravenswatch
  </em>
  from feeling too dreary or plodding, but its world is layered with gloom. The first two acts, in particular, with their dark forests and stormy sands, make for particularly gloomy locales.

  The clue's in the name;
  <em>
   Gloomwood
  </em>
  is a dark and appropriately gloomy immersive sim with a focus on stealth, elevated by a few twists borrowed from the survival-horror genre. The game's low-poly 3D art style and sparsely-lit but wholly cinematic environments give
  <em>
   Gloomwood's
  </em>
  unique Victorian setting a truly gloomy atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is only furthered by the at-times horrifying enemies and their deranged voice lines, the balance of silence with eerie music, and the slow pace of its gameplay. For fans of stealth-focused immersive sims and gritty, gloomy fantasy settings,
  <em>
   Gloomwood
  </em>
  is certainly worth checking out.

  With so many retro-FPS titles out on Steam,
  <em>
   HROT
  </em>
  may not look like much in comparison. At least, not right away. Its gunplay leaves something to be desired, especially when comparing it to the likes of
  <em>
   CULTIC
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   DUSK
  </em>
  , but it's the game's unique look and immersive setting that elevates it above the competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   HROT
  </em>
  is packed with drab, dreary environments, its levels punctuated by brutalist architecture. This makes for some truly gloomy and highly immersive locations, many of which manage to be memorable despite a repetitive color scheme.

  From the very start,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  casts a gloomy blanket over its dark and dreary world. The underground setting is packed with unique biomes that balance color with gloom, but there's almost always a tragic and often dark undertone to the atmosphere of each location.
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand-drawn art style and careful color scheme provide a gloomy look and feel to many of
  <em>
   Hollow Knight's
  </em>
  environments, barring a few. The City of Tears and the Forgotten Crossroads are particularly gloomy, thanks to dark colors, sparse lighting, and truly melancholic music.

   INSIDE
  </em>
  is a dark and gloomy platformer with a heavy focus on light puzzle-solving. Despite featuring a handful of satisfying puzzles and a vague, unsettling narrative that's deftly woven, the game's gloomy art direction and hopeless dystopian setting are arguably its greatest strengths.
 </p>
 <p>
  The total lack of dialogue and truly minimalist character designs, combined with flat textures, provides a heavily stylized look. However, the subdued colors and gloomy lighting prevent
  <em>
   INSIDE

  from ever looking cartoonish.

  <em>
   Kentucky Route Zero
  </em>
  is a narrative adventure game that features little-to-no gameplay, instead driven by dialogue choices and slow, methodical exploration. This essentially makes for interactive fiction, but
  <em>
   Kentucky Route Zero
  </em>
  is highly experimental in its approach, elevated by a magical-realist setting that's rooted in Americana and surrealist imagery.
 </p>
 <p>
  The truly strange nature of
  <em>
   Kentucky Route Zero
  </em>
  and its twisted world makes up for most of its gloominess. The downtrodden characters that life won't leave alone, the emotional music, and the frequently dark and eerie environments make for a truly memorable and utterly gloomy experience.

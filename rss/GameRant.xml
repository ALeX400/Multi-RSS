  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur’s Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been praised for its world building, scale, and attention to detail. These are undoubtedly traits that made the game as popular as it is, but there are always aspects of games that can be improved. Though this detail is a nitpick, its addition could have been a catalyst for new character interactions and lines, ambiance, and environmental changes, taking
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  to a whole new level.

  Time is an important aspect of
  <em>

  </em>
  ’s storytelling. Certain character interactions can only occur at night or at camp, making rests not just important for combat, but also for story progression.

 <p>
  Rests in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  largely follow the typical rest mechanics of
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  5th Edition. Players are able to take two short rests before ending their “day” and can complete a long rest at camp. Short rests restore 50% of a party’s hit points, refresh any actions that require a cooldown per short rest, and restore warlocks’ spell slots.

 <p>
  This makes short and long rests cut and dry features. However, more story development occurs over the course of long rests in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  . Players must return to their camp and end their day in order for long rests to occur. While players can visit their camp during the day, some of the only nighttime interactions in
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  occur at camp. It’s surprising that this change in time isn’t visible at other points of game play, particularly with short rests.

 <p>
  It’s understandable that certain character interactions are mutually exclusive to camp and long rests. Taking a short rest is optional for players, whereas long rests are not. Making long rests mandatory solidifies the chances of players developing relationships with
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  ’s companions and unlocking more character-specific quests.

 <p>
  <em>

  shows the passage of time during long rests, but neglects this during short rests. Changing the lighting or environment after taking a short rest to indicate the passage of time would have not only made the game even more immersive, but could have led to more character-specific interactions.

 <p>
  It would be impossible for
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  to include its most important story beats through short rests due to the feature being optional, but short rests still could have included their own fun and exclusive scenes. For instance, considering that players can only take two short rests per day, the first short rest could lead to the lighting changing from morning to afternoon and the second could change the lighting from afternoon to dusk.
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  companions are known to make light comments while traveling around Faerun, even outside of player dialogue and cutscenes. These time changes would have been the perfect reason to add even more of these lines while also making the game feel even more immersive.

 <p>
  When it comes to exclusive events or features that could occur during these specific time periods, perhaps Larian could have made specific
  <em>

  herbs available at certain times of the day or made vendors change their wares per time period rather than refreshing them daily. Not only would this justify the new immersive element, but these changes could make or break a player’s inventory.

 <p>
  Additionally, maybe some side quests could have been time period exclusive or the time of day could have given players buffs or disadvantages for certain battles. For example, taking on the goblins in Act 1 could have been more difficult if players decided to charge in at dusk rather than in the morning.

  These are just a few of the ways that shifting time between short rests could have made

  There aren’t a lot of actually challenging games made for younger girls, but that’s something Outright Games and Mattel change with the new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster High: Skultimate Secrets
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The platformer is accessible to players of any gender or age but fills an important and underexplored gap in the gaming market by not just giving pre-teen girls a game suited to their interests but one that will actually challenge them.

  Outright’s narrative designer Destinee Cleveland and associate producer Miguel Ortiz de Urbina Díaz shared their insights on this target audience and how
  <em>
   Monster High
  </em>
  serves them in a recent interview with Game Rant. These traits make it a winning choice for a pre-teen gamer girl’s favorite holiday gift.

  The Skultimate Secrets to Reaching Girl Gamers

 <p>
  <em>
   Monster High: Skultimate Secrets
  </em>
  is based on the recent third generation of
  <em>
   Monster High
  </em>
  , which has reach for both pre-teen girls and those, like Díaz, who grew up with Mattel’s popular IP. Released in 2022, Generation Three has refined its appeal for that pre-teen girl audience, as well as made intentional efforts to present a uniform
  <em>
   Monster High
  </em>
  experience from films to games.

 <p>
  Outright’s game goes a long way toward both being a consistent part of Generation Three but also expanding players’ understanding of the titular Monster High school itself. Cleveland, who worked closely with Mattel on the game’s characters and narrative, gave some insight into bringing the school to life:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There was only so much information online and so much that you can glean from the series, especially because they've had three generations so far. But getting to see how they want to go with it really helped me to develop the characters so that they were seamless with the series and things like that. Watch the series and play the game, it's still the same Twyla, it's still the same Draculaura…This is kind of open world where you can go in explore and see all the things that you can't see in the show or you can't see in other games.

 <p>
  She also hinted that some of the mysteries at the heart of
  <em>
   Monster High
  </em>
  may have answers in the game, but said that players would have to pick the title up for themselves to find out what those answers are. And that attention to detail wasn’t the only thing Mattel helped bring to the game to connect with the target audiences of pre-teen girls and the secondary audience of long-time
  <em>
   Monster High
  </em>
  fans. Mattel, the pair explained, makes good representation a top priority. Since introducing career Barbies–including both a game designer and Tomb Raider Barbie–Mattel has put the diverse experiences of girls as a front-and-center part of their franchises. Frankie from
  <em>
   Monster High
  </em>
  ’s current generation identifies as genderfluid and the player character in
  <em>
   Skultimate Secrets
  </em>
  has no gender defined for them, for instance.

  Girl Gamers Want a Challenge
 </h2>
 <p>
  Many games developed for girls, and even ones targeted at adult women, have a tendency to be focused on low-stakes experiences. The quintessential girl games are walking simulators or dress-up titles. While these, and cozy games in general, have an important place in the industry, gendering them as feminine does a disservice to gamers at large, who have complex interests. That includes gamer girls.

 <p>
  Díaz mentioned that over the past few years, the trend toward giving girls more simplistic games has started to turn around, and part of that is
  <em>
   Monster High: Skultimate Secrets
  </em>
  . And it isn’t just an instinct about gender equality that Outright is pursuing, but cold statistics as well, he explained.

  <p>
   We have actual data from our playtests with this game and other titles from the catalog that show us really clearly how girls want that challenge as much as boys, so this is one of the reasons why
   <em>
    Monster High: Skulltimate Secrets
   </em>
   is not just a dress-up game. Obviously, there's a part of customization that plays into the diversity and inclusion and being yourself, which is integral to Monster High, but also it's first and foremost a platforming game. We have some fairly challenging platforming sections aimed at a younger target audience; we really wanted to make sure that the game wasn't just extremely easy. If you wanted to find a challenge within the game, you could.

 <p>
  Anecdotally, Cleveland shared experiences from her own life that supported those statistics and offered some insight into why the market
  <em>
   Monster High
  </em>
  targets are so underserved. It should go without saying that gamer girls exist, but according to Díaz, women make up over half of the market. Despite this, attitudes about women gamers aren’t always supportive.

 <p>
  Cleveland started a group called Dames for Games, which had their inaugural event last year to try to uplift women’s voices in the industry to counter the conception that gaming remains a masculine space. Mattel also wants to challenge that idea, so working with them to create a game that was very welcoming to young girls was something she jumped at.

   I'm always promoting that you should be seen, heard, and respected in this industry because it's truly important…I think, as we were growing up, there was this idea that games were kind of for boys and not so much for girls, but just statistically looking at it, girls are just as involved in playing games, wanting to be streamers, wanting to become developers, wanting to do all sorts of things that involve the gaming community. I think the reason why this was important is because we're growing as an industry and we want to make sure that everyone is included as we're moving towards the future, and that includes girls, that includes all genders, who want to see themselves represented in games.

  And the reception to the game has been extremely positive. The main complaint Cleveland and Díaz have heard is that the 10-hour game could have been longer, which both characterized as a good problem to have. That kind of positive review so soon after the game’s late October release bodes well for a possible sequel in the future, which both were interested in potentially working on.

      <title>Why Battlefield 6’s Extensive Playtests Are Such a Necessary Evil</title>

  The next
  <strong>
   <em>
    Battlefield

  </strong>
  game is officially in development, but details on its gameplay, setting, and story are still very scarce. But as is usually the case with a project of this scale (at least four studios are working on the game), some information is bound to slip through the cracks during development, and
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  has seen plenty of leaks sprout up in the last few months.

  Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson has been the source of many of
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  's leaks over the last year or so, and his latest report paints an interesting picture of the sequel's development process. On November 19, Henderson published a report that claimed
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  is currently undergoing the most extensive playtests in franchise history, with both small feedback sessions and large-scale play sessions occurring frequently. This might seem a bit excessive at first glance, but it's exactly what the
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  franchise needs.

 <p>
  When
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  launched back in October 2013, its first few months of life were plagued by an onslaught of technical issues. From major server issues that would kick players out mid-match, to severe netcode problems that would cause extreme lag, to progression-breaking bugs, to minor glitches like wrong audio files being played,
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  had no shortage of problems at launch.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1163} -->

 <p>
  These issues were so bad, in fact, that EA and DICE had to delay all planned updates and expansions to
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  so that they could focus solely on fixing the game. But despite EA's CEO Andrew Wilson telling Eurogamer in June 2014 that
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  's launch was "unacceptable" and that something like it would never happen again, 2018's
  <em>
   Battlefield V
  </em>
  repeated history.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Absurdly long matchmaking queue times, progression tracking issues, server filtering issues, a bevy of UI and menu problems, and a litany of other grievances hampered
  <em>
   Battlefield V
  </em>
  's already controversial launch.
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  didn't fare much better a few years later, and that one-two punch of disappointment is a large cause for the fan-base's heel-turn on the
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  franchise.

 <p>
  So, if
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  is truly undergoing more playtests than ever before, that could only be a good thing. Testing so long before launch will presumably let
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  's developers troubleshoot and resolve any issues long before fans get to play the full game, hopefully paving the way for a much smoother launch day experience. And in this modern age of gaming where server issues can have severe long-term effects on a game's reception,
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  can't afford a bad launch.

  Back in September, IGN's Kat Bailey interviewed Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization, Vince Zampella, about the next entry in the
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  franchise. One of the lasting impressions fans had coming away from this interview is that Zampella and the rest of the
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  development team are trying their best to give fans exactly what they want, with him directly stating that the team is trying to hearken back to fan-favorite entries like
  <em>

  These extensive playtests for the next

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  franchise has long been a cornerstone of Xbox gaming, known for its emotional storytelling, action-packed gameplay, and memorable characters. However, after almost two decades of installments, the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  series has shown its age, primarily in its ability to introduce new players to the series today. This is where
  <strong>
   <em>
    Gears of War: E-Day
   </em>
  </strong>
  comes in, with a chance to welcome newcomers in with open arms, thanks to its prequel status.

 <p>
  At its core,
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  bridges the gap between the past and present of the
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  universe. With its story centering around Emergence Day — the day the Locust Horde emerged from the surface of Sera, and the most important event in
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  history — it could potentially act as a new entry point to the series for new players, while simultaneously enriching the series' lore with fresh insights into the Locust War’s origins for
  <em>
   Gears
  </em>
  veterans.

 <p>
  Apart from a major dip when
  <em>
   Gears of War: Judgment
  </em>
  was released in 2013, the reception of the mainline
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  series has become increasingly negative with each release. The original trilogy has been widely praised for its gameplay and emotional narrative, but even it saw a slight decline in its reception with the release of each game.
  <em>
   Gears of War: Judgment
  </em>
  , a prequel to the original game, lacked the depth of its predecessors and therefore fell flat, garnering the worst reception of all titles in the
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  series. Since then, the franchise has been doing its very best to regain the magic that it lost, but neither
  <em>
   Gears of War 4
  </em>
  nor
  <em>
   Gears 5
  </em>
  that followed have managed to accomplish that.

 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  has a chance to reignite a fire in the series that it arguably hasn't had since
  <em>
   Gears of War 3
  </em>
  in 2011. Since
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  is an origin story of sorts for the series as a whole, it could serve as a new entry point for the franchise — a chance to start over that no other sequel in the series has ever offered. Even
  <em>
   Gears of War: Judgment
  </em>
  , which takes place 14 years before Emergence Day, making it a prequel, is not enough of an origin story for the series to make it an entry point. However, since
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  revolves around the most important event in
  <em>
   Gears of War
  </em>
  history, it could spark change for the series from here on out and welcome in newcomers with ease.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  potentially acting as a new entry point for the series, newcomers could see a level of character growth for Marcus and Dom that even veteran players have never witnessed. In
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  , Marcus and Dom will be thrown into the thick of it with no experience in dealing with the Locust Horde, which will ultimately create new challenges for them to face that will encourage growth in both of them. In light of this premise, newcomers could potentially grow alongside Marcus and Dom, especially if the series plans to continue after
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  with more titles like it.

 <p>
  Finally, since
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  is a self-contained narrative as a standalone title, it should be more accessible for newcomers who are unfamiliar with the series. Players can dive into the chaos of the Locust invasion without needing extensive backstory, and since everything will also be new to the playable characters, new players likely won't feel left behind. Of course, just because
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  is an origin story doesn't mean veteran players will be left behind either. By focusing on a foundational event in the timeline,
  <em>
   E-Day
  </em>
  serves as a rich storytelling opportunity for longtime fans while introducing the series' core themes of survival, camaraderie, and war to new players​. In the end,
  <em>
   Gears of War: E-Day
  </em>
  might be what the series needs to come alive again.

   <em>
    Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl
   </em>
  </strong>
  is packed with a ton of content, including a variety of side quests that pull you deeper into the heart of the Zone. One early-game side mission that you’ll come across is
  <strong>
   Invisible Nets
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The Invisible Nets side mission is triggered when you stumble upon Gaffer’s house while exploring Zalissya. Inside, Gaffer and Richter are talking to each other about someone.
  <strong>
   Once you enter the house and speak to Gaffer, he’ll ask for your help in activating an antenna tower in the settlement.
  </strong>
  Doing so will help them trace Squint’s location before the Ward gets him. If you choose to help them, you’ll begin the Invisible Nets side quest and need to reactivate the antenna to progress.

  To reach the antenna tower, explore Zalissya till you find the
  <strong>
   large town hall building
  </strong>
  . You’ll see the tower behind it right away, since it’s the tallest structure in the area. If not, use the blue marker on the compass in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  to guide you there.

  Once you arrive at the tower, climb to the top using the ladders. Here, you’ll find a lever on the dish. Interacting with the lever will activate the antenna, but it immediately short-circuits and starts smoking. This frustrates Lens, who is on the radio with you. He'll then direct you to another nearby ARMS antenna that should work.

     Before getting down, it’s worth climbing all the way up to the top of the tower. This gives you a chance to loot some supplies in
     <em>
      Stalker 2

     , including a rare energy drink.

  Once you get down from the tower, follow the blue marker on your compass till you reach a building with what looks like a satellite dish on the roof. This is the second
  <strong>
   ARMS Antenna
  </strong>
  Lens mentioned.
  <strong>
  </strong>
 </p>

 <p>
  As you approach the building, you’ll be ambushed by a pack of
  <strong>
   Blind Dogs
  </strong>
  . There will be about five of them, and they’re quite aggressive. These dogs will chase you relentlessly, making it difficult to get to the antenna. It’s a good idea to eliminate them before moving forward. The dogs are quick and tricky to hit, but they don’t take much damage to kill.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1043} -->

 <p>
  Once the Blind Dogs are dealt with, you’ll be free to continue towards the ARMS Antenna. Carefully jump on top of the broken van outside the building. From there, jump onto the roof and interact with the lever at the back of the satellite dish. This activates the ARMS antenna, and you’ll receive a call from Gaffer and the crew to congratulate you.

  Invisible Nets Rewards
 </h3>
 <p>
  Activating the ARMS antenna allows Lens to track down Squint’s location, and you can then get more information about Solder. Lens also rewards you with 700-875 Coupons in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  for your efforts and the Invisible Nets mission will conclude.

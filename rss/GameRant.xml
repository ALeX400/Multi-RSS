	 <em>
		Don’t Kill Them All

	</strong>
	wears its roguelike inspirations on its sleeve. In particular, Fika's upcoming turn-based strategy indie game takes heavy inspiration from 2022’s
	<em>
	 Cult of the Lamb

	.

	The bond between the two titles is most evident in
	<em>
	 Don’t Kill Them All
	</em>
	’s Kickstarter campaign, which
	<em>
	 Cult of the Lamb
	</em>
	developer Massive Monster backed. Getting that support for
	<em>
	 Don’t Kill Them All
	</em>
	from their spiritual sibling was an important goal for Fika, the studio’s co-founder Antoine Grégoire-Slight told Game Rant in a recent interview. Grégoire-Slight spoke on how
	<em>
	 Cult of the Lamb
	</em>
	is woven into
	<em>
	 Don’t Kill Them All
	</em>
	’s DNA, and why getting to work with the team behind it on a small collaboration for the Kickstarter campaign meant so much.

 <blockquote>
	<p>
	 Cult of the Lamb is an inspiration for the game because it's split into two phases. There's the build your own cult aspect and then going on raids and exploring dungeons with the roguelike phase. It was also a loop that we felt really compelled to play and wanted to have a game that can have the thrill of building your own things and going to explore dangerous environments.

 <p>
	This general design heavily informed the core gameplay loop in
	<em>
	 Don’t Kill Them All
	</em>
	. Orcs will spend their mornings engaging in hobbies, passions, and mindfulness exercises before going out on an afternoon raid. At camp, the player can use resources gathered on raids to construct new means of improving the emotional well-being of the orcs, which in turn makes them better, more versatile raiders to join the player’s orc life coach out on the field.

 <p>
	In the afternoon, a small war band will explore procedurally generated environments, gather resources, recruit new orcs, and carry out side quests. Those resources go back to the camp, and the orcs from yesterday’s war band rest and recuperate during the next raid. The moods orcs are in when they head out–ranging from the
	<em>
	 Inside Out
	</em>
	main five of anger, happiness, sadness, disgust, and fear to feelings like confusion and shame–have impacts on the orcs' abilities in combat.

 <p>
	The inspiration taken from
	<em>
	 Cult of the Lamb
	</em>
	is clear in that gameplay loop, but the two games seriously diverge in their execution of that loop. Where
	<em>
	 Cult of the Lamb
	</em>
	is about gaining worshippers,
	<em>
	 Don’t Kill Them All
	</em>
	is about learning that bloodlust isn’t the whole of being an orc. Some orcs are painters, or fishers, or magicians, and there's even a Lamb Orc, in theory at least.

We’ll decide later on if we put some of those skins in the game or not…We just want to make sure that it fits with the characters and the environment that you are exploring in the game. This is mostly for fun, but we had fun with that collaboration.

	Stretch Goals Are More than Money to Fika
 </h2>
 <p>
	Kickstarters for games have a bit of a checkered reputation. For every hit like
	<em>
	 Sea of Stars,
	</em>
	there are plenty of promising Kickstarter campaigns that get canceled. Already having secured the funding to finish their campaign successfully,
	<em>
	 Don’t Kill Them All
	</em>
	cleared the financial hurdle they sought to vault with Kickstarter’s help, but that’s far from the only purpose a Kickstarter campaign has. Fika figured out a way to maximize the second primary goal of Kickstarters: to generate attention and interest in a game.

	<em>
	 Ship of Fools

	, the previous title from Fika, wasn’t Kickstarted. Grégoire-Slight explained that the process of developing a Kickstarter was a new challenge for the company, but it was something very educational.

	Launching a Kickstarter means developing eye-catching graphics, a presentation video, deciding rewards, finding fulfillment partners, and coming up with potential features to unlock through the innovative use of stretch goals Fika employed. Fika was doing all of this at a relatively early stage of development given the game is targeting a 2026 release.

	Players who are making a seasonal character and skipping the main story can get instant access to the Tree Of Whispers and begin earning its rewards right away. The Tree of Whispers is a great source of XP and items and even gives players a choice of what specific rewards they want.

	 <em>
		Mortal Kombat 1

	has already featured its fair share of high-profile crossovers with the likes of Omni-Man, Peacemaker, and the upcoming inclusion of Homelander. But
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat 1
	</em>
	still has plenty of room to add more and the game's creator, Ed Boon, has been teasing a variety of potential new characters that may be part of

	Recently, Ed Boon has been hosting a variety of polls on his official Twitter account that are asking for fan feedback on what characters should come to
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat 1
	</em>
	next. That said,
	<em>
	 Friday the 13th
	</em>
	's Jason Voorhees has stuck out among these teases due to Ed Boon not only featuring him in a poll but also hyping up his inclusion in
	<em>
	 MultiVersus
	</em>
	.

	As one of the most iconic faces, or masks, in the horror genre, Jason Voorhees is already part of the

	franchise. His first and only appearance in the long-running fighting series was in
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat X
	</em>
	as a DLC character, but there is a very real possibility that he or other classic slashers could return.

	Ed Boon Asks Fans Which Characters Should Return
 </h3>
 <p>
	On May 14, Boon went to Twitter to ask fans who they thought should return to the
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat
	</em>
	franchise. The poll offered three options, with each option containing three characters that could possibly be featured in
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat 1
	</em>
	:
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":237} -->
 <ul>
	<li>
	 Freddy, Kratos, and Leatherface
	</li>
	<li>
	 Alien, Predator, and Jason

 <p>
	Although all the options offered would be great to see again, Alien, Predator, and Jason were the winners among fans who participated in the poll. With the game's first DLC Kombat Pack nearing completion, it only makes sense that a second one could already be in the works, and based on the feedback of this poll, it could lead Jason back to the brutal world of
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat
	</em>
	.

 <h3 id="paying-special-attention-to-jason-voorhees">
	Paying Special Attention to Jason Voorhees
 </h3>
 <p>
	Not only has Ed Boon been offering polls for fan feedback, but he's also been really focused on Jason Voorhees in general. It's now been revealed that Jason Voorhees is in
	<em>
	 MultiVersus
	</em>
	, the brawler title based on Warner Bros. properties, and Ed Boon has clearly been quite excited about the inclusion of the character. Once again, on Twitter, he mentioned that those who miss playing as Jason in
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat X
	</em>
	can at least play as him in
	<em>
	 MultiVersus
	</em>
	.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":701} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":941} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
	This could easily just be the enthusiasm of someone who is a huge fan of the character, but the constant attention Boon is giving to Jason could be hinting at something bigger.
	<em>
	 MultiVersus
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat
	</em>
	don't have much in common, especially when it comes to the violence, which will make it interesting to see Jason in a cartoonish setting.
 </p>

 <p>
	However, with both games being owned by Warner Bros., it isn't too far out of the realm of possibility for
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat 1
	</em>
	to bring back Jason, in addition to him being in
	<em>
	 MultiVersus
	</em>
	. Jason was incredibly fun to play in
	<em>
	 Mortal Kombat X
	</em>
	, so hopefully Ed Boon's excitement regarding the character is hinting at something more.

 <p>
	A creative
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Pokemon
	 </em>
	</strong>
	fan is showing off their impressive hand-crafted Vileplume figure, showcasing a stunning homage to the classic Kanto Grass Pokemon. With over 1,000 Pokemon to choose from, the long-running monster-catching franchise has featured plenty of fan-favorite designs throughout its nine generations of games and multiple anime series. Fans have often shown off their love for their favorite Pokemon with stunning real-world creations, crafting everything from figures and art to shoes based on Pokemon like Espeon. However, one subset of Pokemon remains among its most popular.

 <p>
	The 151 Pokemon featured in the original games continue to hold plenty of nostalgic value for long-time fans of the series. The first
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	games welcomed in some of the series' most iconic designs, like franchise mascot Pikachu, the original three Starter Pokemon, and the powerful Mewtwo. The original games also still serve as
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	's most successful titles to date, with the first generation Game Boy games selling over 40 million copies worldwide. Now, classic Grass Pokemon Vileplume is the subject of a stunning fan creation.

The user confirms that the adorable Vileplume figure was hand-carved and hand-painted, with the Grass Pokemon carrying a walking stick against a natural rocky background. The Vileplume features a recessed mouth and small extrusions on the figure for its eyes, giving the figure a 3D appearance similar to how it would look in real life.

	While the intricacies of the Vileplume figure saw plenty of praise from fans in the replies, the comments were also filled with one fun fact about Vileplume. Vileplume is said to be based on the "Rafflesia Arnoldii," a poisonous type of flower that emits a particularly unpleasant odor. Vileplume's inspiration and foul stenches are even mentioned in the Pokemon's Pokedex entries, said to turn the air around it yellow as it walks due to the paralysis-causing pollen it emits. The creator also shared that the Vileplume was not their first carving of the evolutionary line, previously creating an Oddish figure.

 <p>
	Since Vileplume's debut in
	<em>
	 Pokemon Red and Blue
	</em>
	, the Grass Pokemon and its evolutionary line have been mainstays throughout the Pokemon franchise, appearing in nearly every main-series game. While Vileplume did not appear in the base game for
	<em>
	 Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
	</em>
	, the Pokemon was added with the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero's Pokedex expansion. The only main-series game to not feature Vileplume was 2022's
	<em>
	 Pokemon Legends: Arceus
	</em>
	, with the Oddish line not available in the Hisui region. The stunning Vileplume figure is an impressive homage to one of
	<em>
	 Pokemon
	</em>
	's original creatures.

	Mojang has released a small pre-release patch for
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Minecraft
	 </strong>
	</em>
	ahead of the game's 1.21 update. The Tricky Trials update for
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	is set to launch in mid-June and promises to bring a slew of exciting new content with it.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	has long stood as a shining beacon in the gaming community, being the best-selling video game of all time and maintaining a massive player base 15 years after release. Frequent content updates that have kept the game refreshing and fun for longtime fans of the game is a large part of this success, and Mojang intends to keep this going with Tricky Trials, the upcoming 1.21 update for the game.
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	revealed the name of the 1.21 Update in April this year, and since then, gamers have been given teasers of what is to come, such as new locations, enemies, and weapons.

 <p>
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	's second pre-release patch for update 1.21 is out now. The pre-release consisted of a few minor changes, like making End Crystals immune to fire damage and changing the rarity of certain items. What the second pre-release mostly consists of is bug fixes, all of which were reported by players during the pre-release test. The patching of these bugs aims to make for a smoother launch of
	<em>
	 Tricky Trials
	</em>
	when the update drops for
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	on June 13.

 <p>
	The Tricky Trials update looks to be a big one for
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	, and many fans are already having fun navigating the pre-release and exploring what's in store. The introduction of Trial Chambers and Vaults offers a new location for veterans to explore and grants a reward to those willing to overcome its challenges. The reward for these chambers, and a major talking point among fans of the game, is the ever-powerful mace, a weapon that completely turns the combat of
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	on its head. The mace is the first new proper weapon added to the game since the Trident in 2018 and introduces a slew of unique and devastating mechanics that have the capability of completely changing how combat in
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	plays out.

 <p>
	It's not just the player becoming powerful, as two new mobs are also being introduced that will test the mettle of anybody adventuring in the wilderness, and they look to be a satisfying addition to
	<em>
	 Minecraft
	</em>
	's impressive roster of hostile mobs. The Breeze and the Bogged will both primarily populate the upcoming trial chambers, with Bogged also having a chance to spawn in Swamp biomes. Breezes fire ranged attacks from the air that can easily dislocate the player, while the Bogged have a chance to inflict poison with their arrows, forcing gamers to carefully evaluate how they will approach these chambers if they wish to succeed.

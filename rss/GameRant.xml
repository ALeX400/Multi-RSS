      Valve's Steam Deck is finally coming to Australia in November, with LCD and OLED models available: $649 LCD, $899-1,049 OLED.
     </li>
     <li>
      The Australian pricing for the Steam Deck is slightly higher than US equivalents, possibly due to different power systems and manufacturing costs.
     </li>
     <li>
      The Steam Deck features custom AMD APU, optimized for handheld gaming, providing performance for AAA titles on the go.

  Valve's
  <strong>
   Steam Deck
  </strong>
  is finally arriving in Australia. The update on the Steam Deck distribution came directly from Valve during PAX Australia.

 <p>
  The Steam Deck has been an extremely popular gaming handheld since its launch. Initially selling out entirely, the Steam Deck now has a steady supply and multiple models that fans can choose from. Being able to play nearly any game on the Steam platform on the go is a very impressive feat, and while the Steam Deck now has competitors, many eager gamers have been waiting for their chance to grab one of Valve's devices.

 <p>
  Valve announced at PAX (via GamesHub) that starting in November, Australian residents can purchase a Steam Deck directly from the company. Previously, it was only possible to get one through resellers or anyone who would be willing to ship in one from another area. In November, the handheld will officially be available in Australia, the US, Canada, UK, EU, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. While the exact date hasn't been stated, Valve has provided information on how much Australian residents can expect to pay for the device.

  Valve's Australian Pricing and Available Steam Deck Models
 </h2>
 <p>
  Gamers may be pleased to know that both the original LCD and newer OLED versions of the Steam Deck will be available in Australia. The 256GB LCD model will cost $649 AUD, while the OLED 512GB model will sell for $899 AUD and the 1TB OLED for $1,049 AUD. While the performance between the two models is nearly identical, the OLED version has a slightly larger screen, longer-lasting battery, higher refresh rate, and Wi-Fi 6E for faster downloads.

 <p>
  It's worth noting that the Australian prices for the Steam Deck seem to be a bit higher than their US equivalents. Based on currency conversions at the time of publication, there's roughly a $40 USD increase in price for the base LCD model, whereas the OLED variants are priced roughly $60 (USD) more. The reason for the pricing disparity isn't entirely clear, though It might have something to do with the build, as the power systems in Australia are different from those in the US. Australia uses a higher voltage than the United States. Manufacturing, supplying parts, and storage may also play a role. In any case, it will likely still be less expensive than finding a resold version elsewhere.

  There are some truly marvelous sights that players can discover during their time in
  <em>
   Throne and Liberty
  </em>
  , and none can be quite as majestic as the Gigantrite. This flying whale is a massive behemoth that flies around the skies as soon as the game truly starts. In fact, after they have completed the tutorial, players will be met with a cinematic of the Gigantrite flying by. Even more, the whale is not just something cool to like, it's also something that plays a role in
  <strong>
   plenty of Codex entries
  </strong>
  and traveling to different areas.

 <p>
  One of the Codex entries that it is involved in
  <strong>
   is the Little Friend in the Sky
  </strong>
  , a Codex entry for the Nesting Ground section of the map. It can be unlocked once a player has activated the Waystone for the Nesting Grounds and then can be attempted once the player has reached Level 15. They must also have completed another mission: Meeting a Friend in the Field. With these requirements met, the quest will be available and players can prepare themselves for an encounter with the Gigantrite in the sky.

  The objective of Little Friend in the Sky is to
  <strong>
   collect a small doll

  that can only be found on the tail of the Gigantrite. That's right: for this quest, players are going to have to climb aboard the massive creature and fly around with it for a bit. But first, players will have to complete another Codex entry, Meeting a Friend in the Field, and then reach Level 18 for this to become available in the Nesting Grounds region.

  After that, they must go north to read Someon's Diary, which can be found on a rock near the bridge. The first thing they will have to do is wait for the Gigantrite event where the animal is going to be flying around the sky. They can check when the event is going to take place by looking at the Schedules that can be accessed by
  <strong>
   clicking the icon to the left of the mini-map
  </strong>
  . This will inform the person on when the event is going to happen next.

  When they know the start time of the event, players need to head to the Starlight Observatory Ruins and climb to the
  <strong>
   very top of the tower here
  </strong>
  . This is the best spot to be able to get to the Gigantrite and players will surely see many players here, waiting to jump on as well.

 <p>
  Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and Limited Run Games have announced a collaboration for seven new physical releases in the
  <em>
   <strong>
    Yakuza
   </strong>
  </em>
  series. This collaboration is starting with brand-new collector's editions for
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Kiwami
  </em>
  , available for pre-order right now. Limited Run Games has also confirmed that the other mainline
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  games will be getting new physical releases as well, complete with a special bonus for early adopters who decide to pre-order.

 <p>
  Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  /
  <em>
   Like a Dragon
  </em>
  series has been incredibly popular in the past five years. While the series was popular back in Japan, the 2017 release of
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  was such a huge success that it brought in a brand-new audience from the West. Following the release of
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  , many of the mainline games have since been brought over to the West. Even the Nintendo Switch is getting
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  eight years after it was originally released on PlayStation 3 and 4. While Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has been doing physical boxed releases for all platforms post-
  <em>
   Yakuza: Like a Dragon
  </em>
  , many of the mainline games are only available physically on PS4. Limited Run and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio are teaming up to provide new physical versions for these older titles.

  Limited Run Games made this announcement on its official website and social media, with these new premium physical editions starting with
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Kiwami
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
  </em>
  both considered great starting points in the series. Limited Run has revealed a Standard and Classic Edition for both titles, along with a pre-order window from October 11 to November 10, 2024. The Standard Edition comes with a boxed copy of the game, priced around $35 USD, while the Classic Edition comes with a lot more extra bells and whistles.

  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  's Standard and Classic Editions were also detailed by Limited Run Games, which includes an option for the Switch. Initially,
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  's Switch port was announced to be digital-only, releasing on the eShop at a lower price. However, many fans suspected that Limited Run might collaborate with Sega to release a physical version of the Switch port, based on past releases.
  <em>
   Yakuza Kiwami
  </em>
  's Standard and Classic editions have the exact same price and pre-order window as the
  <em>
   Yakuza 0
  </em>
  releases.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Minecraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has made a clip highlighting how fast Minecarts can be after a few changes to the game rules.
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  updates have made multiple changes to Minecarts over the years, but one Snapshot adjustment seemingly flew under the radar of many players.

 <p>
  Minecarts have been part of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  since the game was released, offering players an easy way of getting around a Seed. The game also features Minecarts with Chests, Hoppers, TNT, and Furnaces. The Minecart with Chest is almost as common as a standard Minecart, as players can find many of them in Mineshafts. A change that players have previewed in Snapshot gave Minecarts adequate momentum to jump over vast gaps using Powered Rails. This has resulted in multiple gamers creating rollercoaster-like
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  designs. Another change may make getting around a Seed even easier, as it has increased Minecart speed.

  Reddit user MikeOxlong2420 recently shared a video highlighting the speed of a Minecart compared to Elytra with Fireworks. The clip begins after the player alters game rules related to the Minecart. They equip Fireworks before pushing a Minecart that's placed on a straight line of
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  Powered Rails, which can be made with six Gold Ingots, one stick, and one Redstone Dust. Before the Minecart significantly speeds up, the gamer flies using their Elytra and Fireworks. As the Minecart catches up to the player, they quickly burn through more Fireworks, but the cart shoots past them at extreme speed and moves beyond the world's draw distance. The Minecart briefly comes back into view after it drops onto a lower track, disappearing again before the player reaches it at the end of the line.

 <p>
  Gamers can adjust the speed in their game rules to make Minecarts move 71 blocks per second, one block less than a Boat on blue ice. This speed is significantly faster than that of a Minecart in the standard Bedrock Edition. Because Minecarts can be acquired fairly early into a playthrough, this adjustment may benefit players who haven't beaten the game yet the most. Once players beat
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  in The End, they can receive Elytra which enables them to fly around their Seed using Fireworks. This was the easiest and most convenient way to get around for a long time, but this change may make Minecart tracks even more necessary. Because Minecarts are known to slow down in multiplayer, this speed may be subject to change.

  The long-running
  <strong>
   <em>
    Street Fighter
   </em>
  </strong>
  franchise has gone through numerous changes in its various iterations. Like many long-running franchises, its most major transition (on a visual level, at least) was the switch from 2D to 3D. Since
  <em>
   Street Fighter 4
  </em>
  and its many updated editions, there has been a continued emphasis on adding many characters from previous iterations of the series to this newer medium.

 <p>
  Frequently, the focus has pivoted towards the
  <em>
   Street Fighter 2
  </em>
  era, with a number of characters from other titles thrown in for good measure. That being said, several characters who appeared in the 2D era
  <strong>
   have yet to become playable fighters in the 3D versions
  </strong>
  . To qualify for this list, characters have to have been playable before in a 2D format (this means many non-playable enemies in the original
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  do not qualify.)

  This ex-mobster is an American Japanophile, who previously served as a member of the Mad Gear Gang and a boss in
  <em>
   Final Fight
  </em>
  . Like many characters in the beat-em-up series, he was added to the
  <em>
   Street Fighter Alpha
  </em>
  series, being one of the first characters from the series with this distinction, along with Guy. His character is something of a commentary on Americans who glorify and fetishize Japanese culture, as he is well-versed in certain topics and subjects to the point of pretending as though he is Japanese, but he also has a shaky understanding of the language, in both verbal and written forms.

  Unlike the majority of these characters,
  <strong>
   Sodom
  </strong>
  has not appeared as a proper fighter since the
  <em>
   Alpha
  </em>
  era concluded. That said, in
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  , he is mentioned by E. Honda, a Japanese sumo wrestler who is a regular fighter in the games. Honda notes that Sodom is a friend of his, who also patronizes his restaurant. Sodom also owns an apparel shop known as Kiss Ache Away, where an employee named Gomorrah mans the storefront.

  <strong>
   Sean Matsuda
  </strong>
  is a fan and eventual disciple of Ken Masters, who utilizes a similar fighting style. He is of mixed race, as despite being a native Brazilian with ancestry from the country, his father's ancestors originate from Japan (hence his surname). Although Sean is not considered as weak as Dan Hibiki, another "shotokan" fighter, his endings in the various
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  games confirm he is not quite on the level of his idol. He notably makes continual negative mentions of Dan, and hates being compared to him.

  . Her fighting style varies greatly from Sean's, deriving from her family's variation of Jiu-Jitsu. Sean consistently makes appearances and references and was shown to have won a martial arts tournament in Laura's ending in the
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  route of
  <em>
   Street Fighter 5: Arcade Edition,
  </em>
  which director Takayuki Nakayama confirmed was canon via social media. Ironically, Sean's limited appearances are likely due to his similarities to other fighters. Dan, the traditional "weak shoot," is notably a fan favorite, as are many others who echo the same style.

  <strong>
   Eagle
  </strong>
  was one of two Englishmen to appear as enemies in
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  , alongside the similarly nicknamed Birdie. Eagle's style was listed as Bojustu, but his usage of two sticks in many of his attacks gives it more of a resemblance to the Filipino art of Eskrima, although the two sticks can form a singular Bo. Eagle eventually notched a playable role in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Capcom vs SNK 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which gave him some mannerisms similar to Freddie Mercury, and in the Japanese version, characterized him as a homosexual.

 <p>
  Birdie was one of a few previous enemy characters to appear in the
  <em>
   Alpha
  </em>
  series, alongside other fighters from the era. Eagle was added exclusively to certain portable editions of
  <em>
   Alpha 3
  </em>
  , where he tests his skills against Guile and later aids him in defeating Bison.

  Although the 3D era of
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  introduced a few playable characters to the series implied or confirmed to be LGBTQ+ (such as Poison, Juri, and Marisa), Eagle himself has yet to return. A likely reason behind his lack of further appearances may be that
  <em>
   Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper
  </em>
  is his only playable appearance in the
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  series to date. Except for Yun (who was already playable in the
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  era), none of the characters added to the portable versions of
  <em>
   Alpha 3
  </em>
  have appeared in 3D, nor any other 2D game in the
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  series.

  <strong>
   Necro
  </strong>
  was a Russian man by the name of Illia who was experimented on by Gill's organization, referred to either as the Secret Society or the Illuminati. He has electrical powers and the ability to physically stretch his body. He is often seen alongside his girlfriend, Effie. The pair is continually on the run from the Society, being hounded by another experiment known as Twelve in
  <em>
   Third Strike
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Little else has been noted of Necro, although
  <em>
   Street Fighter 5
  </em>
  establishes that the experiments that transformed him were conducted around this time and that he was apparently in contact with Rashid then as well, if not also in the present. It is unclear why exactly Necro has yet to make playable appearances outside the
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  era, as, unlike other 2D-exclusives such as Remy, Q, and Twelve, he was in each game relating to the series.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  One likely factor negating further appearances is that several
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  characters were designed to fill niches that others had previously filled consistently in most other iterations. This fact is supported by the series only having four fighters who were playable before
  <em>
   Street Fighter 3
  </em>
  . This is also likely why Remy, who has special moves similar to Guile and Charlie, has not appeared elsewhere. Necro, while having fundamentally different powers from Dhalsim, another series fixture, still fits the bill of having elongated limbs as a primary aspect of his moveset.

  The Dolls were brainwashed young women who were forced to serve as assassins and bodyguards to M. Bison. Cammy, one of the most consistently playable characters in the series and a female clone of Bison, was previously a part of this group. Other members were instead kidnapped by Shadaloo and made to serve them.

 <p>
  Two of their number,
  <strong>
   Juli and Juni
  </strong>
  , appeared in
  <em>
   Alpha 3
  </em>
  , acting as sub-bosses that took on the player at the same time. Juli was given some distinction as Julia, Thunder Hawk's lover prior to her brainwashing, and his wife sometime after it ceased. Juni was notably rescued by Cammy, and protected by Delta Red, the same Special Operations Unit Cammy works for. Although neither Juli nor Juni are playable again, another doll, Decapre, is playable in
  <em>
   Ultra Street Fighter 4
  </em>
  . After Bison's "death" in
  <em>
   Street Fighter 5
  </em>
  , all the surviving dolls seen since then are confirmed to have regained autonomy.

 <p>
  With this recent development, it is unclear why their relative playability is limited. It is likely connected, once again, to the existence of an established character who is similar enough in terms of playstyle and has a more consistent narrative, with Cammy, another ex-doll, being a far more popular character.

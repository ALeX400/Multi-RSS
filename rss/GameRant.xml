  The standard edition for
  <em>

  contains the core game,
  <strong>
   offering over 40 hours of main story campaign

      <title>After Elden Ring: Nightreign, FromSoftware’s Next Step Feels Obvious</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-next-game-similar-pvp-likely/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  The newly announced spin-off game
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring: Nightreign
   </strong>
  </em>
  will mark a new chapter for FromSoftware’s Soulsborne games finally embracing a dedicated multiplayer experience. With
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  ’s focus on co-op multiplayer, the obvious next step for From Software would be a purely PvP-focused game.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":308} -->

 <p>
  As primarily single-player games, FromSoftware’s Soulsborne games inevitably face decreasing player counts as players finish the game and move on, which unfortunately affects the PvP community surrounding each game. Therefore, a standalone PvP Soulsborne game could be the key to uniting the community on a timeless platform. Especially after
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  appears to blend iconic features from past Soulsborne games into a modern co-op experience, PvP multiplayer arguably deserves the same treatment.

  While multiplayer is a large part of FromSoftware’s Soulsborne games, the core of these games is a purely single-player experience. Naturally, this is part of what makes FromSoftware’s new spin-off game
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  so special, as it essentially flips the script. Based on what’s been shown off so far,
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  is already shaping up to be the most seamless co-op Soulsborne game to date, presumably inspired by one of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ’s most popular community mods that abandons some of the restrictions that are commonplace for multiplayer in Soulsborne games.

  This new approach to multiplayer in
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  could potentially signal a shift for the next generation of FromSoftware’s Soulsborne games after
  <em>
   Elden Ring

  to maintain a seamless multiplayer experience. At the very least, it creates a golden opportunity for a PvP-focused Soulsborne game or spin-off to finally become a reality.

  A Standalone PvP Soulsborne Game Could Unite the Community With a Timeless Platform
 </h3>
 <p>
  The existing Soulsborne games make for great platforms for PvP, as they have the benefit of in-depth progression systems and a variety of buildcrafting tools that players can carry over into PvP game modes. This results in nearly infinite build variety that generally makes no two duels quite the same. However, the downside to PvP multiplayer in FromSoftware’s games is that the community tends to face decreasing player counts as more and more players defeat their last boss and move on from the game.

 <p>
  It is typical for single-player games to gradually lose their player count, though this occurrence doesn’t make it any less frustrating for the players who remain committed to these games solely to participate in PvP activities. Therefore, a standalone PvP Soulsborne game could serve the purpose of uniting the community on a timeless platform that will outlast the inevitably short lifecycle of a single-player game.

  From Software’s PvP Multiplayer Deserves the Elden Ring: Nightreign Treatment
 </h3>
 <p>
  While the existing Soulsborne games have the benefit of unique progression systems and buildcrafting tools, a standalone PvP Soulsborne game could still recreate parts of these features, similar to how
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  blends past Soulsborne games into a new, modern experience. For example, each Soulsborne game could have a specific game made that includes unique features from the respective game, like a mode with
  <em>
   Bloodborn
  </em>
  e’s dynamic health recovery and trick weapons, or an
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  mode with mounts and Spirit Summons.

 <p>
  There has always seemingly been a void for a standalone PvP Soulsborne experience made by FromSoftware, and the need for such a platform is naturally at an all-time high following the announcement of
  <em>
   Elden Ring: Nightreign
  </em>
  . Regardless of whether this upcoming co-op spin-off will spark a chain reaction in future mainline games changing their approach to multiplayer, a PvP-focused game still seems like a natural progression for FromSoftware’s Soulsborne titles.

  first launched as a PC exclusive in June 2016, though it's been ported to multiple other platforms over its eight-and-a-half years in operation. The mobile version of

  became a huge hit when it launched in April 2020, being downloaded more than a million times within its first 48 hours of availability on mobile stores.

  However, after nearly five years and the addition of plenty of

 <p>
  Game Rant exclusively reported on the existence of a
  <em>
   Captain Laserhawk
  </em>
  game in January 2024. At the time, a premature PEGI rating revealed that Ubisoft was working on a laser deathmatch game with microtransactions called
  <em>
   Captain Laserhawk Niji Warrior
  </em>
  . PEGI pulled the rating from its public database following Game Rant's report and has yet to restore it.

 <p>
  The mysterious title was finally launched nearly a year later, materializing with a slightly altered name:
  <em>
   Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E.
  </em>
  Behind that straightforward moniker is an arena shooter with a top-down perspective for up to eight players. It's currently only available on PC and can be played via the Ubisoft Connect launcher. The current build of the game, which is labeled as an early access version, is approximately 1.19GB in size. A December 19 version of the game's leaderboard listed fewer than 100 players, Game File reports, suggesting that the NFT shooter hasn't yet generated significant momentum.

  Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E. Is Technically a Far Cry Spin-Off
 </h2>
 <p>
  Much like its name suggests, Ubisoft's recently debuted title is based on Netflix's animated series
  <em>
   Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix
  </em>
  . The six-episode show—set in the same universe as
  <em>
   Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon
  </em>
  —debuted in October 2023 to largely positive reviews. Like the animated series,
  <em>
   Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E.
  </em>
  stars Rayman in the role of a commentator.
  <em>
   A Blood Dragon Remix
  </em>
  depicted a much more unhinged version of Rayman than the one from Ubisoft's popular platformers, though it's unclear how much of his larger-than-life show persona made its way to

  allows players to customize their "Niji Warrior" ID card with a headshot, gender, age, and their favorite pro wrestler. This card is part of the game's blockchain, which makes it unique. It can also be changed through regular play, with the overall idea being to build up its value for the purposes of showing off or potentially selling it.

  Ubisoft Released 2 NFT Games in 2024

  <em>
   Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E.
  </em>
  marks a continuation of Ubisoft's efforts to experiment with NFT gaming applications. In late October 2024, the company released its first blockchain-powered game in the form of
  <em>
   Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles
  </em>
  , a turn-based PvP RPG. Prior to that, Ubisoft launched some NFT weapons and armor for
  <em>
   Ghost Recon Breakpoint

  in 2021. Neither of those initiatives generated significant player interest.

  <strong>
   Open-world games
  </strong>
  are amazing thanks to how versatile they can be. Between the immersive sound design, various characters, NPCs, weapons, armor and challenges they offer players, games in this genre are always a blast to play and can keep anyone busy for months.

  Some titles in the open-world genre present players with the possibility to pick an evil route for their character, which can impact the outcome. Others focus more on character customization and class systems, which are also very entertaining. What seems to be an ever-present factor in titles like these is thrilling combat and interactions. Here are some of the best

   <em>
    Sunset Overdrive
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of those games that takes a very original concept and combines it with popular game mechanics that were present in the early 2000s. The game's premise is quite unique, however, the way in which The Player moves and explores the city is reminiscent of the popular skating games that everyone loved back in the day.

 <p>
  Players will have to slide on railings, jump on storefronts and use every element at their disposal to fight off the mutants taking over the city. This makes

  a game that will keep players on their toes at all times.

    Far Cry 5

  Similar to other

  Although
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  had a rough start to its life due to various performance bugs, it’s now safe to say that it’s one of the best open-world games with the greatest atmospheres out there. Set in the dystopian Night City, this game always offers players something new to discover. Whether it is interesting NPC interactions, fun side quests, street races, or infiltration missions, players will find that there’s no shortage of activities or challenges.

  Many players agree that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  is FromSoftware's magnum opus. This title took many of the already popular game mechanics from the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  franchise and implemented them into a vast open world full of possibilities and dangerous enemies.

 <p>
  At the beginning, players might feel like discovering The Lands Between is a bit tedious given the size of the map. However, when they discover new Sites of Grace and can fast travel throughout various locations, the gameplay experience picks up significantly, delivering fast-paced action through area enemies and mighty bosses at every turn.

   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

  is arguably one of the best open-world Nintendo exclusive games to have ever been released. While this title isn't the first to be set in an open world in the

  universe, it does present players with new, daring game mechanics that make it fun, complex, and entertaining to play.

  By the time
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was first released, Rockstar Games was already a critically acclaimed developer. However, this title and its massive success helped the studio grow even more and establish itself as one of the greatest in the world.

 <p>
  Even when players are dozens of hours into a game,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  still has many things to offer, making it one of the best open-world games of all time. While some players have gone as far as calling
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  a walking horse simulator, a wider number of people agree that that’s part of its charm, and that the game almost always feels exciting and fast-paced.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto 5
   </em>
  </strong>
  is, without a doubt, Rockstar Games’ most popular title to date. The game has been out for more than 10 years, and it still retains a recurrent player count that's well into the hundreds of thousands every month. Based on various real-life locations in Los Angeles, Los Santos remains one of the most complete and complex maps in open-world gaming.

 <p>
  As players drive through Los Santos, they'll find no shortage of things to do. Whether it is helping a rogue reporter get some compromising pictures of a celebrity, collaborating with an elderly couple of tourists to collect Hollywood memorabilia, or saving a damsel in distress' day by recovering her stolen purse, the fun never stops.

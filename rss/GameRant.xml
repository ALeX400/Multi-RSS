  During the 80s and 90s, pixel art graphics dominated the gaming scene, mainly due to the technical limitations of the consoles of that time. This simple yet detailed visual style marked a generation, creating vibrant worlds and memorable characters. Although today games have high-definition realistic graphics, many JRPGs still choose pixel art to capture the nostalgia and charm of the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes a
  <strong>
   pixel art JRPG special
  </strong>
  is the combination of charming visuals and creative design. Good games in this style balance captivating graphics with deep stories and engaging gameplay. Richly detailed environments, smooth animations, and epic soundtracks are elements that enhance the experience, proving that this artistic direction is timeless and capable of delivering beautiful results.

  Released for the Game Boy Advance,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an excellent example of how pixel art can create striking visual experiences. The carefully crafted environments and expressive portraits are impressive, considering the platform. However, the highlight is the combat animations, which are extremely smooth, especially during critical hits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Agile movements, detailed weapon effects, and dramatic strikes turn each encounter against adversaries into an impressive battle choreography. This is one of the main strengths of the game's pixel art, making this strategic JRPG one of the most beautiful games ever released for the Game Boy Advance, making the most of the graphical capabilities offered by the console.

  The first game in the franchise was responsible for creating Square Enix's trend of producing JRPGs with pixel art, using the HD-2D style, which mixes pixel art with modern techniques to create a visually pleasing result. However,
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler 2
  </em>
  further refines the technique, delivering one of the most beautiful games that follow this artistic direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the environments have a good level of detail, with lighting effects that add plenty of life and depth to the locations. In this way, the game manages to convey a strong sense of nostalgia to players, but by mixing pixel art with other visual effects, the game is a visual masterpiece that also suits players who want modern options.

  Although the original visuals of
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3
  </em>
  haven't aged as well, largely due to the limitations of the time, the HD-2D remake the game received served to do justice to the title's quality. This new version, made with the same techniques used in games like
  <em>
   Octopath Traveler
  </em>
  , transforms the pixel art of this JRPG into one of the best ever produced.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is because, even though the comparison between the graphics of both games is clear, Square Enix managed to preserve the essence of the original version, such as the bright color palette and monster designs, but enhanced some details. For example, the villages were remade to appear more lively, making
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remaster
  </em>
  pleasing to both old fans and the new generation.

  The first games of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  are notable, both for their gameplay and for being timeless JRPGs. Among them,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  stands out as a true masterpiece of the franchise, delivering also one of the best pixel arts produced among retro games. This is because, even with the limitations of the time it was released, it managed to deliver an incredible result.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, what makes
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  so special is the unique combination the game has of visual design with one of the series' best narratives. The pixelated animations, although simpler, give life to characters and environments, while the story delves into themes such as sacrifice and hope. All these elements result in an incredible experience for JRPG fans.

  Having legendary Akira Toriyama as one of its creators,
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  arrived in video games as one of the best JRPGs ever produced and also owning incredible pixel art. The result the developers achieved, both in the composition of the environments and in each of the characters, with all of them being varied and possessing their own charisma.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover,
  <em>
   Chrono Trigger
  </em>
  also impresses with the variety of different settings it has, as being a game about time travel, players journey through different periods of humanity. So, whether in the prehistoric period or in a distant future, the developers managed to give each place a unique appearance, contributing to the feeling of being in different locations.

  Curio Domain is a pink cube in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Infinity Nikki
   </em>
  </strong>
  that hosts one Whimstar inside. Players can activate the cube and transform it into a doorway by walking near it. Once the Whimstar is collected, players can still enter the Curio Domain, but there won't be any rewards. Additionally, the pink color will also disappear, signifying that there's no more Whimstar inside.

  The Curio Domain Challenge near Gliding Training Stonetree is located southwest of the Warp Spire, on level 2F. The goal of this challenge is to
  <strong>
   place two boxes to activate the switch
  </strong>
  and reveal the locked Whimstar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the switch requires two weights to unlock, it may look like players can activate the button using one box and Nikki's weights. But if players do this, when Nikki moves to get the Whimstar, the weight will be lost and the switch gets deactivated. Therefore, it's necessary to bring both boxes to the switch.

  To place both boxes on the switch, players must first use one box as leverage to reach the second box. Here's the full steps to completing this challenge:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Push the first box to the platform on its left. This will lower the platform and raise the far-away floor.
  </li>
  <li>
   Jump to the ledge on the right to reach higher ground.
  </li>
  <li>
   Leap to the platform and
   <strong>
    keep skipping to not lower the platform
   </strong>
   . This will allow you to reach the second box far above.
  </li>
  <li>
   Push the second box down.
  </li>
  <li>
   Jump and push the second box to the switch.
  </li>
  <li>
   Head back to the first box and move it manually all the way to the switch.
  </li>
  <li>
   Place the first box next to the second box.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  After both boxes press down on the switch at the same time, the pink cubes will reveal the hidden Whimstar. Grab it to get teleported automatically out of the Curio Domain in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  .

  Tier 15 Waystones are the highest level Waystones players can get as drops in
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  , but keen players may have gathered that there are ways to reach higher tier maps, specifically Tier 16, 17, and 18, using alternate methods.

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Tier 16 Waystones are actual items that can be obtained in the game, but Tier 17 and 18 are a different story. The effect Waystones of this tier would have had if they did exist can be achieved, but the process is a bit convoluted. Here's the breakdown.

    Vaal Orb
   </span>
  </span>
  <strong>
   on a non-corrupted Tier 15 Waystone
  </strong>
  . There are four possible outcomes of using a Vaal Orb on a T15 map:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The Tier 15 Waystone is converted into a Tier 16 Waystone.
  </li>
  <li>
   The Tier 15 Waystone is converted into a Tier 14 Waystone.
  </li>
  <li>
   The Tier 15 Waystone modifiers are randomized.
  </li>
  <li>
   Nothing happens.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  From testing, it appears that the chance of a Tier 15 Waystone turning into a Tier 16 is less than 5%, and is easily the best outcome. The Waystone turning into a Tier 14 is also relatively rare, which is the worst outcome. The other two possibilities are far more common.

  While the center position saw a fall out of popularity for a long time in the NBA, this has reversed course in recent years as players like Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid have come to dominate the game. For players creating their ideal center in the MyCareer mode of
  <strong>
   <em>

  , it isn't going to be realistic to assume they can make up the last three MVP awards as soon as they start out, but it's not impossible for them to achieve that after a little bit of time.

 <p>
  Not every team is going to provide the same opportunity to do so, however, as some have already found their starting center. The Denver Nuggets and Philadelphia 76ers certainly have, and more teams have some young talent like Victor Wembanyama that are coming up strong. But there are some teams that are going to be great options for new players to try and make a name for themselves.

   As the NBA season enters its halfway mark, more teams have emerged in need of help at the center position. Because of this, this article has been updated to provide further context for the already discussed teams as to why their need for a center has been evident. This update also adds other teams that have shown to be in need, providing players with more options when creating a center.

   Clint Capela can be easily replaced

   A solid chance of contending

 <p>
  Despite an incredible run to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2021, the Atlanta Hawks have seen a bit of a drop-off in terms of their success in recent seasons. This is largely due to their play at center, which
  <strong>
   hasn't been anything more than "good enough" truly
  </strong>
  . Clint Capela is, by no means, a bad player, but it wouldn't take a lot of time for a player to overtake him in the roster.
 </p>
 <p>
  It won't be an immediate change, and players can expect to ride the bench for a decent amount of time. However, once they reach that spot,
  <strong>
   they can expect to have a lot of success
  </strong>
  . Pairing a great center to hold down the paint while Trae Young does his shot-making magic around the perimeter would be hard to stop for any team. Plus, he can make the right pass to open them up for a monster slam when needed.

   Despite not being a contender, there is ample playing time available

  <li>
   Some good players that could complement a good center
  </li>
  <li>
   Can give the satisfaction of helping build it up
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Brooklyn is a weird team that possesses some talented players but is
  <strong>
   missing some key pieces
  </strong>
  that have kept them at the bottom of the NBA since Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden all left. They're struggling mightily this season and need some backup ASAP. A good center could be just that to help them elevate their game and give Cameron Johnson and Cam Thomas someone to rely on under the basket.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be
  <strong>
   a quick path to starting with the Nets
  </strong>
  , and while it may not make them an instant contender, there are some really good players on the roster who can certainly make them a permanent playoff participant. Then, with some successful seasons leading to big free agency signings, a championship could be on the table.

  Charlotte fans have, unfortunately, had to endure a long success drought, though they have some good pieces to start taking steps forward. With players like LaMelo Ball, Terry Rozier, and Brandon Miller creating a pretty stout foundation, a center to
  <strong>
   help provide a solid frontcourt for this offense
  </strong>
  could be a huge get for them.
 </p>
 <p>
  A player could emerge easily for this team,
  <strong>
   creating that ideal center
  </strong>
  that they need to make the Hornets a team to be reckoned with. Even more, it won't take much time at all to get to that starting role. Players may even get that spot right away and can hit the court as soon as possible.

   Historic franchise that is looking to take that next step

 </ul>
 <p>
  The Pistons seem to be doomed for eternal irrelevance despite having a player like Cade Cunningham, but that could change if they were to get a great center to hold down the paint.
  <strong>
   They have been showing a lot of progress this season
  </strong>
  , and while Jalen Duren has provided plenty of solid play, they could use a true star to take them to the next level.
 </p>
 <p>
  A point guard like Cunningham could
  <strong>
   benefit greatly from a center who can score at-will
  </strong>
  and knows how to block a shot when an opponent goes in for a layup. This means that using a center would be seen as an absolute must for the front office, and if the player shows how much they can do, becoming a star center might be on the horizon for them.

  The Bucks are not living up to expectations, and that is

  would be a big upgrade for the team, especially one who can use their size to score easily. With that three-headed monster, the Bucks could improve quickly and become a real threat in the East.

 <p>
  The Phoenix Suns are in
  <strong>
   dire need of some presence underneath the basket
  </strong>
  . While Jusuf Nurkic had promise, his age has quickly emerged this season and has led to him being benched and appearing in plenty of trade rumors. With his regression, it has led to Mason Plumlee taking his spot.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, Plumlee has always excelled as a backup center, never having the ability to take that next leap into starter potential. Because of this, there is a lot of room for a new center to come to the team and
  <strong>
   make their presence felt on the roster
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  The Trailblazers may have the 2018 number-one pick on their roster, but DeAndre Ayton does not look like someone who was once taken over Luka Doncic. Even when he was on the Suns,
  <strong>
   Ayton just never reached his potential
  </strong>
  or showed a desire to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that he's on the Blazers, this has continued, and it
  <strong>
   has left a clear path to the starting center role
  </strong>
  on the team. A star center could end up being the focal point of the team, and with likely-good picks in the upcoming draft, Portland could begin creating a great, new roster.

      <title>7 Scariest Eldritch Horrors in Video Games</title>

 <p>
  At the risk of starting this list like an English essay, it’s important to establish a definition of Eldritch. Merriam-Webster defines Eldritch as “strange or unnatural, especially in a way that inspires fear”. Eldritch is particularly associated with weird fiction, including the works of the Cthulhu mythos, and video games are filled to the brim with weird and unnatural enemies.

  Eldritch abominations by their very nature are difficult to perceive. They exist on the borders of reality, breaking down definitions of nature and reality. Here are some of the scariest Eldritch horrors and Lovecraftian monsters in video games.

 <p>
  The God of the
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  series is willed into being and creates time so that suffering will not last an eternity. God then dies, but on her deathbed she tells her followers she will come again. This is interpreted by The Order as rebirth, and it becomes their mission to bring about the rebirth of their God. They seek a human vessel, a human womb, to birth God and bring about an eternal paradise.
 </p>
 <p>
  She is an extremely powerful god who manifests in the series in many ways, not all of them inherently malevolent. Sometimes she is a hideous incubus, other times she appears more ambiguous, even nurturing. Definitions of her appear to be highly subjective, just like Silent Hill in general. What is truly terrifying about God is the awful things that are done in her name by The Order.

  The titular “Sinking City” is the flooded town of Oakmont, which is besieged by all kinds of Eldritch horrors. The town is home to monsters known as the Wylde Beasts, zealous cultists, mysterious disappearances and supernaturally triggered madness. The protagonist, Charles Reed, is drawn to Oakmont by visions and begins to investigate the connections between these strange happenings.
 </p>
 <p>
  It turns out that Charles is destined to sacrifice himself to a cosmic creature straight out of the pages of the Cthulhu mythos, Cthylla, the daughter and mother of Cthulhu. Cthylla and the King in Yellow are part of a complex ecology of ancient beings operating beyond human understanding. By sacrificing himself, Charles Reed can choose to end or perpetuate an apocalyptic cycle of birth, death and suffering.

  The Hiss, like many of the paranormal phenomena in
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  , is very difficult to explain. But in incredibly reductive terms, it is a resonance that behaves a bit like a virus. It spreads through the chanting and incantations of those who are essentially enslaved by it. Tuning into its opposing resonance, known as Polaris, can help people resist The Hiss.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who are fans of the developer Remedy will not fail to notice the similarities between The Hiss and the Dark Presence in
  <em>
   Alan Wake
  </em>
  . This makes it very clear that The Hiss is not a unique phenomenon in the Remedy Extended Universe and that there may be myriad mind-warping entities out there that are difficult to comprehend, let alone contain.

  Behind the grimy blood-drenched veneer of Yharnam as the player encounters it at the beginning of
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  is a world of cosmic horror and old gods. This is the realm of The Great Ones who loom large over the world of Bloodborne, invisible to those without insight until Rom is defeated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike the monstrous beast-form bosses in the earlier game, the Great Ones often fail to make any anatomical sense whatsoever. They descend and impregnate women in the hope of creating a new Great One. The Great One, known as Moon Presence, is the true final boss of
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  and is unlocked by consuming three “third of umbilical cords” in a single playthrough.

  Despite its anachronistic nature,
  <em>
   Dead By Dayligh
  </em>
  t does have an overarching narrative. It also has an Eldritch creature pulling the strings known as The Entity. It is a being of “pure consciousness” that consumes suffering and negative emotions. The trial grounds that the player traverses are an elaborate means of feeding The Entity.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Entity appears not to understand the cultural context of the worlds it is pulling subjects from. This results in a strange amalgam of established horror properties and unique characters colliding in what is essentially a hunting ground. The participants are resurrected and have their memories wiped so that they can begin suffering anew and provide The Entity with further sustenance.

The Shape is a parasitic growth that has penetrated the rig and is now laying waste to the crew. It is very difficult to ascertain its form, but it appears as a fleshy tentacled root like mass.

  Eveline may look like a precocious 10-year-old girl, but she is functionally a shape-shifting fungal bioweapon. This obviously sounds terribly dehumanizing, and her backstory is absolutely tragic, being the result of scientific experimentation. She still perceives things as a young girl might, meaning that her isolation and exploitation have horrifying results. Her desperation for a family and to belong is the root of the horrors of the Baker house.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eveline is part of a cycle of trauma and violence that stretches back to the death of Mother Miranda’s daughter in a small village many decades ago. The fact that she is scared and emotionally vulnerable does not stop her from being one of the most terrifying antagonists in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise.

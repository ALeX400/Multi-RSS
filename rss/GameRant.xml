      <title>Final Fantasy Should Hop Back on the Kart Racing Train Alongside Sonic Racing CrossWorlds, Mario Kart 9</title>

 <p>
  Given the recent reveals of
  <em>
   Mario Kart 9
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic Racing Crossworlds
  </em>
  , it would appear that the kart racing subgenre is back in full swing. Plenty of franchises have tried and failed to compete with the seminal
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  series over the years, leveraging brand recognition and simple controls to achieve similar cultural dominance, though precious few endeavors have yielded enduring classics, and plenty fail in spectacular fashion.

  One of the most infamous kart racer failures in recent memory is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Chocobo GP
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the 2022 revival of the PS1 classic
  <em>
   Chocobo Racing
  </em>
  . As the name suggests, this kart racer is molded around
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  iconography, with locations, characters, and music stemming from the storied JRPG franchise. Such a project seemingly had all the ingredients for success, and it did in fact gain some traction with fans, but the prevailing sentiment is that its predatory monetization and grind-heavy progression systems poisoned the well. Square Enix ceased support for
  <em>
   Chocobo GP
  </em>
  less than a year after its release, apparently accepting defeat and choosing instead to move on to other ventures, but it might be time to give the concept another shot.

  Final Fatnasy 7 Rebirth Proves a Chocobo Kart Racer Still Has Potential
 </h3>
 <p>
  Bad publicity and hardware restrictions may have caused
  <em>
   Chocobo GP
  </em>
  to fly under the radar, but the same can't be said for
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  , one of 2024's most significant releases. The second chapter in the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  remake project is defined by variety and density, filled to the brim with varied content for players to engage with, but even so, the Chocobo Racing minigame at the Golden Saucer stands out as an particularly pleasant surprise.
 </p>
 <p>
  The side activity has all the hallmark mechanics of the kart racing genre, such as drifting, boosting, and randomized power-ups, but it also brings enough new ideas to the table to make it enticing for kart racer veterans. For instance, the different special abilities of each base chocobo and the variety of gear-related perks. More important than these mechanical particulars, however, is the raw sense of charm and energy that the minigame exudes: it's
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  , through and through, boasting the same goofy earnestness and glossy sheen that the beloved franchise is known for. It's certainly good enough to inspire a full-fledged, standalone game.
 </p>
 <h3 id="more-mario-kart-competitors-can-only-be-a-good-thing">
  More Mario Kart Competitors Can Only Be a Good Thing
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are certain genres that feel more or less dominated by a single series, and Nintendo is behind many such decisive victories. 3D platformers, platform-based brawlers, and kart racers are all defined by
  <em>
   Super Mario
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  , respectively, to the point where other developers and publishers rarely even attempt to compete. This reluctance isn't unfounded, especially since such endeavors have to compete with years of cultural relevance and brand recognition, but the likes of
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sonic Racing
  </em>
  should still be encouraged, if only to keep Nintendo on its toes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Put another way, variety is the spice of life: one can never have too many options in a given game genre. While a
  <em>
   Chocobo GP
  </em>
  comeback might not knock
  <em>
   Mario Kart
  </em>
  off its pedestal, it could certainly carve out a comfortable niche for itself, especially among
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  fans who want another way to engage with the series. And with the upcoming
  <em>
   Sonic Racing Crossworlds
  </em>
  looking promising, yet another option for players can only be a good thing, encouraging greater experimentation and risk-taking across every kart racer series, growing the genre into a healthier, more diverse whole.

      <title>Rogue Pinatas: VRmageddon Review</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/rogue-pinatas-vrmageddon-review/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Roguelikes are a dime a dozen on PC and consoles, but they are harder to come by in the virtual reality space. While there are a few great roguelike games readily available for the various virtual reality headsets on the market, there's still plenty of untapped potential when it comes to VR roguelikes.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Rogue Pinatas: VRmageddon
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the latest attempt at a VR roguelike game, featuring seemingly never-ending hordes of deadly pinatas for players to smash and shoot through. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas: VRmageddon
  </em>
  is one of the weaker roguelike VR games.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  takes clear inspiration from
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  , one of the best roguelikes ever made, and also compares itself to
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  . The
  <em>
   Dead Rising
  </em>
  comparisons don't really track, but
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  definitely has some of
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  ' DNA. As players kill pinatas, they are rewarded with candy that levels them up and unlocks new weapons and gadgets. Like
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  , players can grab a power-up that summons all the missed candy in the stage to them instantly, resulting in a rush of dopamine and multiple level-ups in a row. Also like
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  , weapons and gadgets can be paired together so that if players have the right combination of gear and level them up enough, their weapons will evolve into significantly more powerful forms.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a tried-and-true upgrade system for roguelikes that helps foster an addictive gameplay loop, which is no different in
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  . The problem is that the game gives players access to the best weapon out of the gate, which ultimately discourages experimentation. Players start
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas: VRmageddon
  </em>
  with a bat that, when paired with the healing gadget, eventually evolves into the Vampire Bat. The Vampire Bat heals great chunks of health upon making contact with enemies, and if used correctly,
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas: VRmageddon
  </em>
  players can effectively make themselves invincible.

  By swinging my arm wildly whenever pinatas got close, the Vampire Bat instantly nullified any damage they were dealing, even in situations where I was dogpiled and couldn't move. Throw the gatling gun into the mix, and all the challenge is effectively sapped from the game. Now, that's not to say there isn't some fun to be had with this; it's mindless action, and those looking for that will certainly find it with
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas: VRmageddon
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  also gets props for stage and objective variety. Each level offers something different. The first stage has players exploring their pinata-infested neighborhood with the goal of surviving for 15 minutes. The second level is about restoring power to generators dotted around the desert, while the third level is an escort mission. There is also plenty of variety in the pinatas that players face off against, from llamas to creepy floating eyeballs that shoot lasers. Most of the pinatas are fun to smash, though there are obnoxiously loud, screeching explosive ones that make replaying certain levels an unappealing prospect. The bigger problem, though, is that there are only six levels total, and so, despite the variety, things can still get repetitive pretty quickly.

 <h2 id="rogue-pinatas-has-some-serious-problems">

 <p>
  Progression is also an issue due to how easy
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  is, robbing the roguelike of one of the key elements of the genre.
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  players can earn XP to purchase permanent upgrades to make runs easier, but when multiple levels can be completed solo with no upgrades, it makes the upgrade system almost pointless. Earning these upgrades in other roguelikes is rewarding because they offer meaningful improvements that greatly increase one's odds of survival, but the same can't be said for
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  . The upgrades only make an already easy game even easier.

  Upgrades are purchased in the garage that players visit between rounds. This is also where online multiplayer sessions are set up and characters are selected. Players only have access to one character when they first start
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  , but new ones can be unlocked by completing challenges. Different characters have different starting weapons, but the bat is so powerful when it's upgraded that there's no real compelling reason to swap, especially since the other weapons can be acquired during missions and dual-wielded anyway.

 <h3 id="rogue-pinatas-is-too-easy-and-too-glitchy">
  Rogue Pinatas is Too Easy and Too Glitchy
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  is simply too easy, and whenever the game presents something that may be challenging, there's almost always a way to cheese it. For example, the second stage ends with a boss fight against two massive rodent pinatas joined by endless swarms of bees, lizards, and llamas. This was intimidating at first, but then the two bosses started walking into a wall and never stopped until they were dead. The aforementioned escort mission was a bit tricky at first, as the pinatas relentlessly attacked the RV that players protect. But then I figured out that walking as far away from the RV as possible made the mission ridiculously easy. The pinatas only seemed to spawn near me, effectively saving the RV from taking any damage. That mission ended with another boss fight against an impressive-looking creature that also got stuck on a wall and ignored me for the rest of the round.

 <p>
  Pinatas are not the only ones at risk of getting stuck in walls when moving around
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  ' colorful, cartoony worlds. I became stuck in the terrain on multiple occasions, and while I eventually was able to get free, these situations were always irritating. It seemed to happen a lot more when using teleportation movement versus continuous, and so I highly recommend anyone that buys
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  ditches teleportation immediately. Teleporting will help players move across the
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  battlefields at a faster rate, but it's not worth the chances of getting stuck.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides getting stuck in the environment and dealing with wonky enemy AI,
  <em>
   Rogue Pinatas
  </em>
  players also have to contend with frozen UI elements and the game's abysmal draw distance. As far as the UI goes, there was one instance where the level meter froze and stayed that way until I reset the game. I was still able to level up, but it was impossible to tell how much more candy was needed to do so. The draw distance, meanwhile, makes the more open levels look downright ugly, with enemies phasing in and out of visibility, almost like a fog of war situation. The game does manage to fit a dizzying number of pinatas on screen at one time with no slowdown, but it seems to have come at the expense of the draw distance, at least when played on the Meta Quest 3 headset.

     It took me about 2.5-3 hours to beat all six levels in Rogue Pinatas. I only failed a couple of times, so it was more or less a straight shot through the game, which is unusual for a roguelike.

  <em>

  is occasionally entertaining, and it's likely more fun to play with friends, but solo gamers aren't likely to get much value out of it. The game does have a great deal of content to unlock through achievements, new characters, and permanent upgrades, but the core gameplay isn't nearly compelling enough to keep players hooked. The idea of a
  <em>

  -inspired first-person roguelike certainly has potential, but

  At the top, you'll find more switches to shoot, and you can use your grappling hook to reach two
  <strong>
   mech turrets that need to be destroyed with your blasters
  </strong>
  . Move forward, shoot the switches to activate the moving grapple hook platforms, and jump toward the ladder leading to an up-and-down platform. Ride it up, then jump onto the moving platform, where enemy mechs will spawn — take them out.
  <strong>
   Jump off where you see "02" written on the wall,
  </strong>
  and shoot the switches multiple times to lower the platform.

  Go through the doors to find an energy pod with a glowing orb inside.
  <strong>
   One player must shoot the switches while the other shoots the orb
  </strong>
  when its energy depletes. This will create a hole in the red shield ahead, allowing you to pass.
  <strong>
   Repeat the process on the other side
  </strong>
  , but with reversed roles. Finally, interact with the panels ahead to activate a new mech armed with chainsaws.

  For this mini-boss fight,
  <strong>
   players must coordinate by luring the mech into the glowing field
  </strong>
  on the floor. Once it stands on top of it,
  <strong>
   shoot the nearby orb to disable its shield temporarily
  </strong>
  . This gives you a window to deal damage before the shield regenerates to a different color. Repeat this process a few times to destroy the mech, which will activate the platform, acting as a lift. Ride the platform up to reach a large red shield.

  To the left of the large shield, there is a
  <strong>
   weapon station where you can upgrade your guns
  </strong>
  . After the cutscene, you’ll gain additional control for your blasters, allowing you to
  <strong>
   fire a Shield Buster using L2/LT

  The Kites Run is a race where both players must use their
  <strong>
   grappling hooks to outpace each other
  </strong>
  . After a few grapples, you'll pass through
  <strong>
   air rings that propel you forward
  </strong>
  , requiring precise
  <strong>
   aerial control to glide effectively
  </strong>
  . The final section features rotating air rings, so you'll need to aim carefully to catch the speed boost and avoid falling. Once you complete the race, the side story concludes, and you can return to the facility.

  At the slope, you’ll find a jump pad that Zoe must shoot to launch Mio to the other side. Mio then interacts with the panel to open the gate for Zoe, allowing her to enter the factory. Inside,
  <strong>
   Zoe must shoot her shield buster at the boxes moving along the rail, while Mio uses hers on the red shield
  </strong>
  . Once the box reaches the blue shield on Mio's side,
  <strong>
   detonate it to open a hole for Mio to pass through
  </strong>
  , then open the red shield for Zoe.
  <strong>
   Align the nodes
  </strong>
  , use the shield buster to spawn a pressure plate, and shoot the last switch to propel up to the ramp.

  The first phase of this fight is straightforward.
  <strong>
   Use shield busters on the mech's legs to reveal switches — shoot them
  </strong>
  to make the mech lose a leg. After
  <strong>
   each leg loss, it enters a defensive mode
  </strong>
  , spawning laser drones and occasionally slamming the ground to create a

   Attack using the correct shield buster color based on the boss's glow.

  The Moon Market side story takes place in a castle with a
  <strong>
   lively marketplace where merchants sell various wares
  </strong>
  . There are
  <strong>
   plenty of interactive elements
  </strong>
  , such as turning your partner into a frog, mixing potions to transform into a mushroom, or becoming bloated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your main objective is to explore three different paths and
  <strong>
   retrieve the cats
  </strong>
  waiting at the end of each one. Once all three cats are returned, the gate will open, marking the completion of this side story.

  <strong>
   You can step on the yellow tiles, but they disappear after a few seconds

  . Continue going right, and you will come across a toxic river with
  <strong>
   platforms that rise if you shoot at them

  Go through the purple portals to reach the moving purple portal puzzle. First,
  <strong>
   Zoe will need to move the portals to the right
  </strong>
  , ensuring Mio does not land on the green laser. Once Mio is across,
  <strong>
   repeat the process for Zoe
  </strong>
  . Climb the ladders while avoiding the lasers, then shoot the buttons to pass through the purple portals and reach the next boss arena.

  This sub-level starts with a massive mech destroying the wall in front of you.
  <strong>
   Begin by shooting at the face of the Overseer
  </strong>
  . After taking a small amount of damage, it will step back and deploy a moving spike ball. Destroy it to make the boss come forward again.
  <strong>
   Avoid the green toxin balls while aiming for the head
  </strong>
  . The boss will then deploy drones from its eye sockets, each with shields. Detonate the shields and take out the drones to deal more damage.

  After depleting 35% of the boss’s health, it will begin leaking acid, preventing you from standing on the lower part of the arena.
  <strong>
   Individual portals will appear, and you must go through them as the acid rises

  . Players also need to shoot the colored boxes between platforms to clear a path upward.

  In the next phase, the camera shifts to show the fight from the boss’s perspective. It will spawn
  <strong>
   exploding canisters that you must shoot to trigger a prompt, allowing you to throw them at the boss
  </strong>
  for damage. The next section requires
  <strong>
   one player to focus on shooting while the other deals with vertical lasers
  </strong>
  that can be disabled by shooting them. Keep firing while avoiding the rolling obstacles behind you.

  In the final segment, the boss tries to hold the door shut.
  <strong>
   Shoot it while dodging a sweeping laser
  </strong>
  that moves from corner to corner and a head slam that causes debris to fall. Once weakened,
  <strong>
   you can shoot the gears to make the door shut

  With the jetpacks acquired,
  <strong>
   hold down the jump button to boost
  </strong>
  . The boost is not unlimited, so you will fall after a few seconds.
  <strong>
   Avoid the green lasers as you ascend through the individual laser fields
  </strong>
  , then shoot the switch to burst out of the factory. You will come across another large wire with a spike mechanism moving along it.
  <strong>
   To the left of the wire, there is a small platform where you can find the final side story
  </strong>
  of this level.

  <strong>
   side story takes place inside Zoe's notebook

  , where everything is drawn in pencil by the narrator. You’ll play as two heroes on an adventure, battling enemies, scaling mountains, and exploring deep caves — only to face off against a... Duck?
  <strong>
   After rescuing the captured prince, you can head to the ship in the distance
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   marking the end of the side story

  After exiting the side story, go to the right of the wire to find smaller platforms. Shoot the switch to create a platform, then
  <strong>
   navigate through the individual lasers to refuel your jetpack
  </strong>
  . Use it to reach the grappling hook point and deploy the shield buster on the nodes. In the next area, numerous turrets can be dealt with directly, or you can move left to a platform where turrets can't reach you — though drones will still pursue you, requiring you to destroy them.

  <strong>
   place a shield buster on the glowing yellow orb

  ,

   then shoot the switches to retract the arm before detonating the bomb

  . Inside, move through individual portals until you reach a rotating green laser. On the ground, there’s a section matching your color — use your shield buster to create a hole and drop down before the laser comes around.

      <title>Pokemon Legends: Z-A Could End Up Reviving One of Gen 6’s Biggest Controversies</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  February 27th’s
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  Presents gave fans a long-awaited look at
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends: Z-A
   </strong>
  </em>
  , which came with a lot of information to unpack. Some of the new revelations about
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  revolve around returning moves and mega evolutions, but this combination might reignite a long-dormant debate.

  After the reveal of
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  nearly a year ago, players have been longing for any news about the new
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  spin-off game, and the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  Day celebratory presentation didn’t disappoint. The extended sneak peek at the upcoming game provided answers to some of the title's biggest mysteries. Among the large reveals of the time period and starter trio, though, were a few hints that went unnoticed by many. When touching on the game’s new battle system, some fans noticed that a previously cut Pokemon move is returning for
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  . Power-Up Punch, a fighting-type move that boosts the user’s physical attack, was at the heart of a controversial strategy used during the
  <em>
   X and Y
  </em>
  era, leading the move to be cut from
  <em>
   Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  . But with its return, an overpowered strategy might be revived.

  Just like
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  before it,
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will treat fans to a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  experience that strays from that of the mainline games. Among the many changes in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , such as new areas and
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  catching mechanics, is a change in the way battles will play out. Unlike the classic turn-based battles of the core
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  titles,
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  will be introducing a real-time battle system to the series. Perhaps this change can explain the decision to incorporate attacks that were deemed too powerful in the past. With a new battle system comes a new meta, which could see Power-Up Punch become more balanced than in previous entries.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_6">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Power-Up Punch is a fighting-type move with 100% accuracy and 40 power. After the attack, the user's physical attack stat is raised by one level.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Another major change that the
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  games bring is the removal of Pokemon abilities. Typically, each Pokemon has an ability that might help it during battle, such as eliminating or gaining stat boosts or immunity to special conditions. With the different mechanics explored in
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  , abilities were removed in favor of new move types. Now, although unconfirmed, there are rumors that suggest abilities will be absent from
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  too. This also helps to rebalance Power-Up Punch, as the strategy that abused it relied on Mega Kangaskhan’s Parental Bond ability, which allowed it to attack twice in one turn, reaping double the stat boosts of the attack. Without that signature ability, Mega Kangaskhan would no longer be able to abuse Power-Up Punch in competitive battles.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-mega-evolution-will-change">
  How Mega Evolution Will Change
 </h3>
 <p>
  Kangaskhan was far from the only Pokemon to receive a powerful mega evolution in the Gen 6 era, with nearly 50 monsters gaining new moves, abilities, and types from the short-lived feature. While many trainers are excited about its return, the new real-time battle system means that mega evolution needs to be changed in order to balance the gameplay. It seems that instead of remaining in their new form for the duration of the battle, Pokemon will now have a limited time to utilize their special form before reverting to normal. Coupled with the removal of abilities, this could lead to mega-evolved Pokemon being less overpowered than they were in the past, with the title hopefully dodging balancing concerns as a result.
 </p>
 <p>
  It remains to be seen exactly how mega evolution will play into the battle system and story of
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , but it is believed to play a major role in the new title. Fans remain eager to find out which mega evolutions will be returning, as well as which other Pokemon might receive new forms. With the success of
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  and the mystique surrounding the Kalos region,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends: Z-A
   </strong>
  </em>
  seems to have already captured fans’ attention. No release date has been announced, but the game is set to come out in late 2025.

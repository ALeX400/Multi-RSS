  After completing the first chapter and learning the basics of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ninja Gaiden 2 Black,
   </em>
  </strong>
  players will take on the
  <strong>
   Castle of the Dragon.
  </strong>
  This second chapter jumps right into the action, placing Ryu at the entrance to his family's estate, and tasking him with reaching the very top of the eponymous castle. There are several important items players can find in
  <strong>
   chapter two
  </strong>
  , including two new weapons. In this guide, we'll show you
  <strong>
   how to complete Chapter 2: Castle of the Dragon in
   <em>
    Ninja Gaiden 2 Black
   </em>
  </strong>

  Hayabusa Village – Path to Save Point 1:
 </h3>
 <p>
  You'll start chapter two at the entrance to Hayabusa Village. Make your way through the red Torii gates and stop at the end to examine the first item you encounter:
  <strong>
   Notebook: Flying Swallow.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Continue into the small graveyard area, and you'll encounter the first enemies of chapter two. Here, you'll face three basic dual-sword ninjas. Once they are dealt with, you can examine some of the graves for some interesting Hayabusa family lore. Continue along the main path until you reach the next clearing. In this courtyard you face several
  <strong>
   blade-wielding dogs
  </strong>
  . These enemies are a real pain. Use block and counter to get the upper hand. They are incredibly good at dodging, so button-mashing will just lead to frustration (a sentiment that only becomes more accurate at higher difficulties).

  After defeating the dogs, you'll want to make sure to head down the bridge path first. There is a chest at the end of the bridge that contains the area's first
  <strong>
   Life of the Gods
  </strong>
  . Collecting nine will permanently increase your max health. Before you get the chest, you'll have to defeat a mix of basic and claw ninjas. If you need any healing or Ki items, there is a
  <strong>
   Shop
  </strong>
  near the entrance to the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, head in the opposite direction from the bridge entrance, and make your way around the outside of the buildings. Just before you turn the corner, you'll find the
  <strong>
   Reverse Wind Technique scroll
  </strong>
  on a dead body. As you come around to the other side of the building, you'll be ambushed by five basic ninjas. After you defeat them, continue towards the large flags with
  <strong>
   bullseye-like symbols
  </strong>
  .

  When you reach the stairs that lead down to the water's edge, you'll find a
  <strong>
   Herb of Spiritual Life
  </strong>
  on a dead body. You can jump straight into the water, and you'll get a prompt telling you to press the A (or X on PlayStation) button to run on the water. However, you'll want to dive below the water, as there is a
  <strong>
   Crystal Skull
  </strong>
  below the left side of the bridge. When you come up, watch for the
  <strong>
   archer
  </strong>
  shooting at you from the small ledge at the other end of the water.

  Take out the archer, then continue past them up the main path. Near the top of the slope, you'll be attacked by another
  <strong>
   archer
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   two dogs
  </strong>
  . After defeating them, move into the courtyard, and you'll find
  <strong>
   The Counter Attack Technique scroll
  </strong>
  on a dead body. In the corner of this courtyard, you'll encounter the first
  <strong>
   Dragon Save Point
  </strong>
  .

  From the first save point, head up the small stairs and around the left side of the large building. You'll encounter several enemies in the small corridor between buildings. Watch for the archer at the end of the corridor, as he'll continue to shoot while you deal with the aggressive ninjas. If you stay on the walkway and turn left, you can interact with the door between two dragon statues. This is the
  <strong>
   Relic Room
  </strong>
  door.

  While you cannot yet open the Relic Room, you can enter the opposite building. Head back and go through the rear entrance, and you'll find a
  <strong>
   chest
  </strong>
  containing a
  <strong>
   Herb of Spiritual Life,
  </strong>
  as well as the
  <strong>
   Falcon's Talons
  </strong>
  at a small shrine in the far wall. After picking up the claws, you'll be attacked as you make your way to the exit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, make your way to the outer courtyard, and you'll be attacked by two basic ninjas, and a
  <strong>
   floating, flame-wielding ninja
  </strong>
  . The flame ninjas are particularly pesky, as they can conjure flames beneath Ryu's feet at any given moment. They will also launch fireballs at Ryu while he is fighting other enemies. It is in your best interest to take them out early.

  Once these enemies are dealt with, you'll see the gate that blocks the exit to the courtyard open. Make your way up the rock steps. At the third flight of stairs, you'll encounter several descending ninjas. At the top of the stairs, there are two towers. There is an archer at the top of one, and a
  <strong>
   chest
  </strong>
  containing
  <strong>
   Herb of Spiritual Life
  </strong>
  at the top of the other.

  The next flight of stairs will essentially be a replay of the previous one. Ninjas will attack as you get closer to the top, and there are two more guard towers. This time, there are archers in both towers. Once you get past the towers, you'll encounter the
  <strong>
   second Dragon Save Point
  </strong>
  . Make sure to
  <strong>
   save and heal
  </strong>
  before moving on.

  Path to Dragon Save Point 3:
 </h3>
 <p>
  From the second Dragon Save Point, make your way through the narrow corridor until you reach the dead end. Here, you'll need to
  <strong>
   wall jump
  </strong>
  back and forth until you reach the top. As soon as you exit, you'll encounter two basic ninjas. The only path forward is up the stairs, where you'll encounter an archer. Before you continue onto the wooden structure, pick up the
  <strong>
   Notebook: Counter Attack
  </strong>
  item off the dead body.

  You'll encounter more archers and basic ninjas as you make your way along the large wooden deck-like structure. At the end of the structure, make your way along the main path until you see the
  <strong>
   chest
  </strong>
  on the left side of the gate to the next area. Inside the chest you'll find

  Now, you'll begin to make your way up the base of the castle. At the top of the first stone steps, Watch out for the archers shooting through the murder holes. Move by as quickly as you can, then make your way up towards the narrow stone steps. Just before you reach the steps, make sure to pick up the
  <strong>
   Guillotine. Throw scroll
  </strong>
  from the dead body, then turn left, and you'll see a
  <strong>
   chest
  </strong>
  at the end of a small alcove. The chest contains a
  <strong>
   Devil's Way Mushroom
  </strong>
  , which replenishes Ki.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now you can make your way up the narrow steps to the courtyard at the base of the castle. Here, you'll face a large group of different enemy types. There will be dogs, basic ninjas, and flame ninjas. Once you defeat them, grab the
  <strong>
   Notebook: Ultimate Technique
  </strong>
  item from the dead body near the locked door. To continue, make your way up the rubble at the wall. This will allow you to reach the roof.

  On the roof, you'll immediately encounter two claw-wielding ninjas and a flame ninja. Once they are defeated, jump down into the flaming hole in the roof to enter the castle. You'll end up right at the murder holes where the archers were shooting from. Take them out, then head to the far end of the corridor to find the third
  <strong>
   Dragon Save Point
  </strong>
  .

  ssdFrom the third Dragon Save Point, head to the opposite end of the corridor. Before you turn and exit, look for a golden dragon-headed statue mounted on the wall. Approach the head and you'll notice it is holding a bow. Get close enough, and you'll be able to take the bow from the dragon. This is the
  <strong>
   Fiend's Bane Bow
  </strong>
  , which is the
  <strong>
   first
  </strong>
  <strong>
   ranged weapon
  </strong>
  in

    Ninja Gaiden 2 Black

  From the third save point, you must collect the bow before the gate blocking the main path will open. As soon as you go through, you'll drop into a large arena area. There will be several archers shooting from openings around the arena walls. If you hold down RT (or R2), the reticle will automatically snap to a target. After you defeat the archers, the mid-level boss
  <strong>
   Gyuki
  </strong>
  will descend from the ceiling.

  Gyuki is essentially the same as the Spider Clan boss from Chapter 1. Focus on dodging attacks, and then attack from behind. Your attacks will briefly stun Gyuki, so make sure to punish it when you connect. Certain attacks, like the Flying Swallow technique, don't seem to work with Gyuki. Air-based attacks seem to be less effective in general, so try to keep to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can
  <strong>
   counter
  </strong>
  Gyuki, which seems to be one of the more effective ways to fight. Don't worry about saving your Ninpo, as you'll be able to refill your Ki immediately after the fight.
 </p>
 <p>
  When you exit the arena after the fight, turn right to find a
  <strong>
   chest
  </strong>
  with
  <strong>
   Ki-restoring red orbs
  </strong>
  . Then turn back and head the opposite way down the corridor. When you reach the stairs, head past them on the right, and you'll find
  <strong>
   Grains of Spiritual Life
  </strong>
  on a dead body. Head up the stairs, and you'll end up at a screen door. As you approach, enemies will burst through and attack.

  Once they are dealt with, head to the dead end, then turn right and attack the screens. You'll see

  The next save point is surprisingly close. From the fourth save point, head up the stairs and attack the screen on the right at the very top of the stairs. You'll enter a balcony overlooking the earlier boss arena. There is a massive dragon statue in the center of the chamber, and there are platforms to the left and right where more archers will appear. Take them out, and another platform will be lowered in the center. Head across, and the mouth of the large dragon statue will open, allowing you to enter.

  After crossing through the dragon's mouth, you'll find

   Dragon Save Point 5
  </strong>
  at the end of the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the fifth and final save point, head out to the roof through the hole in the wall. On the roof, you'll be attacked by both basic and flame ninjas. Take them out, then turn and head to the side of the structure, where you'll be able to use the roof to reach the next level. Once you reach the upper level, head back into the castle through the hole in the wall.

  As soon as you enter, you'll be attacked by archers. Use the bow to quickly take out each enemy. Remember to press RT/R2 to quickly snap to each target. With the archers gone, turn right and look for a small hole in the floor of the wooden walkway. You'll see that there is an opening with a ladder that will take you to a lower level. On the lower level, you'll find a
  <strong>
   shop
  </strong>
  at one end of the corridor, and the
  <strong>
   sixth and final Dragon Save Point

  at the other end of the corridor.

 <p>
  The buildup to fighting Genshin makes the fight seem like it's going to be much harder than it actually is. Like Gyuki, your best bet here is to stay grounded and use dodge and counter to chip away at his health. The heavy-attack counter is especially powerful, as it allows for a follow-up attack before Genshin recovers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Genshin has a very powerful projectile attack that you want to watch for. When you see the air around his fists begin to form into an orb of energy, prepare to dodge. You'll have a split second to attack here where you'll catch Genshin off guard. Remember as well, that blocking is Ryu's best friend.
 </p>
 <p>
  The big difference here is that Genshin does much more damage with each hit. Pay close attention to your health bar, as it will deplete incredibly quickly. This is when you want to use your health items.
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 2 Black
  </em>
  has an incredibly player-friendly healing mechanic in which time essentially stops when you are in the item menu, so don't be scared to use your items.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you die, there is no need to use your Talisman. Simply restart from the previous checkpoint, as it is extremely close to the end.

  Who could have predicted that FromSoftware's
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  would usher in a new subgenre of gaming? The 2009 release set the stage for its spiritual successor, 2011's
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , to take the world by storm. FromSoftware's titles have undoubtedly influenced gaming as a whole.

  The

   best Souls-like PS Plus games
  </strong>
  are typically difficult, prioritize boss encounters, and feature weighty combat that incorporates a degree of strategy. While games such as

  wear their

  FromSoftware's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Bloodborne
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the
  <strong>
   best Souls-like game on PS Plus Extra and Premium
  </strong>
  . A Gothic masterpiece set in the nightmare-inducing Yharnam, this PS4 exclusive is a masterclass in atmosphere, environmental design, music, and gameplay. Even post-
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , an argument could be made that FromSoftware peaked with
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  , reaching a high that precious few developers ever get to achieve.
 </p>
 <p>
  Utilizing a far more aggressive battle system than the
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  does not allow players a single restful moment. When playing this game, every instance is spent on edge as a new terrifying beast lurks around every corner, waiting to brutally demolish the Hunter. It is glorious. Compared to
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  has a smaller pool of weapons and armor, allowing for a more limited range of builds. Even though this decision can be disappointing, the included items are valid candidates that can carry players for most of the campaign, and the weapons have multiple forms. That said, the game still has a decent selection of options, so it is not fully a case of quantity over quality.

  2009's
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  started the Souls-like movement, and FromSoftware's masterpiece is still worth a playthrough beyond just its historical significance. In terms of pure atmosphere,
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  is near-untouched, and most of the levels are incredibly well-designed (even if some are quite frustrating). Still, for all its brilliance, the original version shows its age in places.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, 2020's remake is readily available and does a great job of modernizing its ancestor without diminishing most of its strengths. Arguably the best-looking
  <strong>
   Souls-like on PS Plus
  </strong>
  , Bluepoint's
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  drops players into Boletaria, granting them immediate access to five Archstones that link them to different Worlds. Each one has a unique feel, and players are encouraged to jump back and forth between them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compared to something like
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  ' difficulty comes from the trek to the bosses rather than the fights themselves, most of which are fairly easy by the standards of the genre (a few exceptions notwithstanding). However, the stages are long, dense, challenging, and puzzling.

  As fun as Souls-likes are in general, the genre's releases can threaten to blend together, with most games featuring fairly similar combat. As such, Gunfire's
  <em>
   Remnant

  stands out due to emphasizing ranged gunplay over melee or magic. The 2023 sequel expands well on its predecessor's solid foundations, presenting an improved experience that shines brightly in co-op while also working well enough as a solo adventure.

  Split into worlds/realms that all have wildly different esthetics,

  strikes a middle-ground between curated linear progression and open-ended exploration, the latter part coming courtesy of optional dungeons that use light procedural generation. The combat is pretty typical for a third-person shooter, but it is supplemented by a robust class system and modifiers like mods and mutators. The game also nails its boss fights, a few of which are massive in scope.

  Team Cherry's
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  was one of the most popular indie games of the 2010s, and time has not dulled any of the project's shine. This 2D Metroidvania is set in Hallownest, a deceptively massive underground kingdom that is filled with beauty and nightmares. Cast as the Knight, players must traverse this strange world, battling enemies and defeating bosses along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  does not hold the player's hand in any significant way. Encouraging exploration and backtracking, the game fills its world with lore drops and NPCs that deliver side quests.
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  is not only one of the
  <strong>
   best PS Plus Souls-like games
  </strong>
  but also one of the greatest titles on the service.

  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  is a 2D Metroidvania with rogue-lite elements in the sense that death sends players back to the start. As the Prisoner, players must traverse a dangerous island in order to kill its king, a process that entails defeating plenty of bosses along the way. During a run, the Prisoner picks up new weapons, items, and upgrades, all of which outside a select few are lost upon death.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to its procedurally generated levels,
  <em>
   Dead Cells
  </em>
  constantly shake things up so no two playthroughs are exactly the same. This design not only extends the game's replayability and lifespan but also ensures that players never feel too comfortable as they traverse this challenging world. The combat system is fast-paced and addictive.

  games are available on PS Plus Premium and Extra, and together they should provide more than 50 hours of Souls-like gameplay.

The combat is smooth and satisfying, especially since players have the option to target specific limbs of enemies.

  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  wears its
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  influences on its sleeve, although the game does introduce a couple of fresh ideas. As tends to be the case with this sub-genre, the core gameplay loop revolves around exploring a dark fantasy world filled with enemies that pack a punch and respawn whenever the player dies. While a bit more linear than most FromSoftware's projects,
  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  's level design is cut from the same cloth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though the combat system is relatively typical for these sorts of games, Cold Symmetry shakes things up in two major ways. For one,
  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  incorporates different shells that correspond with classes, and players can swap between them at specific locations. These shells serve as replacements for traditional loot. Another unique concept is that players can harden their shells to block incoming attacks, a mechanic they will need to master if they want to overcome the campaign's reasonably challenging bosses.

  <em>
   Eldest Souls
  </em>
  does not hide its appreciation for FromSoftware's genre-defining
  <em>
   Souls
  </em>
  series, but it is also not afraid to try and establish a distinct identity. Played from an isometric point-of-view, the indie game tells a simple story about humanity's revolt against the gods and the latter's counterattack that pushes the former to the brink of annihilation. As such, players must eliminate a string of gods to ensure their species' survival.
  <em>
   Eldest Souls
  </em>
  is a boss-rush game, so the campaign centers solely around a collection of enemies that must be defeated. This is a notable change from the typical Souls-like since exploration is not really part of the package, although there are some interludes between the boss encounters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Eldest Souls
  </em>
  plays well, and it should hit the spot with people who seek out direct and aggressive combat. Each boss comes with their own arena, all of which are visually impressive in their own right. The bosses are, generally, enjoyable, and they pack a challenge without venturing into unfair territory all that often. The game even has skill trees to provide some build options, which does add an element of replayability to what is ultimately a fairly short experience.

   Kena: Bridge of Spirits
  </em>
  is an admirable indie project that could easily pass for a triple-A release. Ember Lab created a beautiful and immersive fantasy world that just demands to be explored, even if the campaign itself is fairly linear. Cast as the eponymous spirit guide, players must use their skills to put the deceased to rest and also fight back corruption as it spreads across the mountain. Along with a small pool of abilities, Kena is armed with a staff that can also be used as a bow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although not quite as combat-driven as some Souls-likes,
  <em>
   Kena: Bridge of Spirits
  </em>
  nevertheless incorporates frequent fights, including a myriad of boss encounters that can pack a considerable wallop. Melee actions are reasonably satisfying to execute, and they are complemented well by Kena's ranged and spiritual abilities. When not engaging in battles to the death, the game shifts its focus to puzzles, exploration, and light platforming. None of these elements are particularly original, but they are generally executed well.

  Ever since
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  exploded in popularity, the gaming industry has been steadily putting out a stream of indie projects that adapt ideas introduced by FromSoftware. While most of them are 2D Metroidvanias, there are a few releases that kind of slot into the AA field, which has largely gone extinct during the last two console generations.
  <em>
   Thymesia
  </em>
  exists on the same level as
  <em>
   Mortal Shell
  </em>
  , at least in terms of production value; however, the games play completely differently, with the former taking a few pages from
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  's playbook rather than conventional Souls-likes. Yes, that means parrying is a cornerstone mechanic that players will need to master if they want to see the end credits, and the timing can take some getting used.
 </p>
 <p>
  Featuring a plague doctor protagonist who, frankly, looks extremely cool,
  <em>
   Thymesia
  </em>
  is set in a kingdom that has succumbed to a disease, leaving mutated monsters in its wake. Corvus has to mostly clear out three zones, with each one containing a main boss and a couple of mini-bosses tied to secondary missions. This structure is arguably
  <em>
   Thymesia
  </em>
  's most divisive aspect, and players will spend all their time accepting missions that take them to one of three areas. While the side quests introduce new parts to each area, they still look the same, which can make the short-ish campaign feel repetitive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still,
  <em>
   Thymesia
  </em>
  has quite a few things going for it, including pretty fun combat that prioritizes speed and challenges the player's reflexes. While weapon variety is limited, the game has a decent progression system that enhances Corvus' movesets or performance.

  Like its spiritual predecessors, the
  <em>
   Zeno Clash
  </em>
  games,
  <em>
   Clash: Artifacts of Chaos
  </em>
  is an acquired taste, even more so than other Souls-likes. Honestly, ACE Team's game just about qualifies as Souls-like, largely due to the combat taking inspiration from the fighting genre. Immediately after booting up the game, players will be hit with a wave of absurdity and weirdness, two traits that define the entire experience. The characters are grotesque, the storytelling is bizarre, and the campaign loves obtuse design.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, despite being quite off-putting at times,
  <em>
   Clash: Artifacts of Chaos
  </em>
  has more than enough charm and strengths to warrant a recommendation. The melee-driven combat focuses heavily on combo strings and cancelations, creating a gameplay loop that can be intense and enjoyable when everything clicks. While not perfect, the game makes clever use of a day-night cycle, with the latter coming with an increase in difficulty.

  Ultimately, there is only a limited number of games that fit the Souls-like
  <em>
  </em>
  descriptor. However, that does not mean PS Plus Premium and Extra subscribers who are fans of FromSoftware's franchise have nothing to play once they have exhausted the above titles – they just have to expand their criteria. While the following
  <strong>

  Developed by the company responsible for 2014's
  <em>
   Lords of the Fallen
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Surge
  </em>
  series,
  <em>
   Atlas Fallen
  </em>
  could be mistaken for a Soulslike at a glance. However, the game is primarily a hack-and-slash RPG that tries to be a bit more accessible and mainstream, while still offering a respectable enough challenge. Honestly, new players who are tempted to give this project a try should put aside the developer's previous outings as they are wildly different experiences.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Atlas Fallen
  </em>
  drops players in a sandy open-world and grants them a gauntlet that can take multiple forms. While threatening to become repetitive at times, the combat is fast-paced and fairly satisfying, particularly once players expand the gauntlet's moveset and start to take advantage of the momentum system. Movement is also great, arguably the best part of the whole package.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deck13 deserves credit for sticking with
  <em>
   Atlas Fallen
  </em>
  , despite its rough launch. About a year following the game's debut, the developer released a fairly substantial update (Reign of Sand) that addressed some of the base game's issues (voice acting and enemy variety, for example). While not resulting in a substantially different experience, these changes were for the better.

  Similar to
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  birthing a new subgenre, Capcom's
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  effectively accomplished the same thing in 2004. Regardless of sharing similarities with other action RPGs, this franchise is very much its own thing that cannot be directly compared to anything else (except for games inspired by
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  ), and that includes Souls-likes. Sure, both subgenres revolve around battling massive bosses, feature robust weapon systems, and focus on builds; however, their execution is nothing alike. Still, fans of one type of game are likely to get a kick out of the other.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  's formula is simple: accept hunt, search for the target monster, engage in a fairly lengthy battle, loot their carcass, craft better equipment, and repeat. While there is a story, it is just a glorified tutorial designed to ease newcomers into the
  <em>
   MH
  </em>
  routine and teach them the basics, while also allowing veteran players to skip forward and start the real hunter missions. As the most accessible entry in the series,
  <em>
   Rise
  </em>
  starts as quite easy, but it picks up significantly as it goes along, with later missions requiring players to properly prepare loadouts to target a monster's weaknesses. Despite feeling very different from a traditional Souls-like, the combat is great, deep, and flexible, with the latter stemming from the 14-weapon system that encourages players to try out different builds to see which ones work best for them.

  Santa Monica soft rebooted
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  for the franchise's 2018 entry, turning the over-the-top hack-and-slash series into a more intimate over-the-shoulder action game. Utilizing Norse mythology,
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  sees Kratos and his son, Atreus, undergoing a journey to fulfill the dying wish of the former's wife and the latter's mother. Although not all that similar to a Soulslike,
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  's combat is visceral and fluid, particularly once Kratos expands his arsenal and Atreus unlocks a few new moves.
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  pushes its emotional and gripping story to the forefront, but once the main campaign is complete, players can roam the gorgeous world to complete leftover quests and take on some Valkyries.
 </p>
 <p>
  2022's sequel mostly retains its predecessor's formula, albeit with the introduction of a new weapon, new companions, and a second playable character. Unlike the previous title, which lacked variety in its enemies,
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  features a far more impressive range of foes and bosses, to the point that the campaign throws out larger-than-life fights frequently. While still story-driven, the game goes for more of a blockbuster approach, which means rampaging through most of the nine realms en route to a bombastic finish. The Valhalla mode is also great.

  Souls-likes obviously take some inspiration from Metroidvanias, particularly the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  side of things. If a PS Plus subscriber wants something close to
  <em>
   Symphony of the Night
  </em>
  , they should check out
  <em>
   Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night
  </em>
  . Developed by ArtPlay and a key producer who worked on
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bloodstained
  </em>
  comfortably captures the magic of its inspiration, all the while managing to establish its own identity. Set in a massive gothic castle that can sit alongside FromSoftware's greatest architectural behemoths, the indie game delivers varied locations, epic boss fights, and a surprising range of customization options.
 </p>
 <p>
  The latter quality makes
  <em>
   Bloodstained
  </em>
  an especially good pick for Souls-like fans since the genre is well-known for its class systems and loot.
  <em>
   Ritual of the Night
  </em>
  has an expansion selection of weapons that slot into 10 types, and each category feels unique enough to be worth trying. More impressively, the game allows players to pick up more than 70 demon abilities in the form of shards, paving the way for plenty of build options.

  Sucker Punch's
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  acted as something of a swan song for the PS4 era, and it allowed Sony's last-gen console to conclude its main run on a high. Set during the Mongol raid on Japan, the story follows a samurai who goes on a quest to protect Tsushima Island after it has been overrun by the invading force. Boasting a large and visually stunning world,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  immerses players in a bygone era that has rarely been adopted as a setting by games.
 </p>
 <p>
  While not quite as difficult as the standard Souls-like,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's combat is still fantastic and addictive. The game presents players with quite a few options on how they would like to approach scenarios, and they can even decide to challenge enemies to duels. Along with the PS4 version, PS Plus Extra also has
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut
  </em>
  , which incorporates the Iki Island expansion. This section adds roughly 5–10 hours of content.

  Like how FromSoftware created a new genre in Soulslikes, Capcom effectively did the same with
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  . Similarly, both developers have a stranglehold on their respective categories, overshadowing all imitators that have followed in their footsteps. Honestly,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  's shadow is arguably deeper than
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ', to the point that no other IP has ever come close to challenging Capcom's dominance. That said,
  <em>
   Wild Hearts
  </em>
  was one of the more valid efforts to provide an alternative to
  <em>
   MH
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  While primarily known for Musou games like
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Hyrule Warriors
  </em>
  , Omega Force is not averse to trying out different types of action RPGs or hack and slash titles, usually to pretty great success.
  <em>
   Toukiden 2
  </em>
  is among the better attempts to replicate
  <em>
   MH
  </em>
  's formula, and it is available on PS Plus Extra and Premium; however,
  <em>
   Wild Hearts
  </em>
  is a considerably bigger game, perhaps thanks to the involvement of EA. Inspired by Japanese mythology, the story casts players as a hunter who must take down Kemono, beasts that have been corrupted and are now running wild.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gameplay loop boils down to accepting missions, tracking down the Kemono in question, and then engaging in pretty epic fights.
  <em>
   Wild Hearts
  </em>
  ' most original idea is the inclusion of Karakuri, which are buildings/structures that can be created at camp or in the middle of battle. They provide unique advantages and are a great deal of fun to master. While a bit clunky, the combat is not bad either, and it prioritizes movement above everything else.

  Bluepoint should just handle all the remakes. 2018's
  <em>
   Shadow of the Colossus
  </em>
  wisely changes very little about Team Ico's 2005 masterpiece since it is a tall order to improve upon near perfection. While preserving the original's story, characters, tone, and structure, the remake provides a graphical upgrade along with improved controls.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>

   Path of Exile 2

  The Morior Invictus Grand Regalia is an exclusive drop from the Arbiter of Ash, the final pinnacle boss in the endgame of
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  . In fact, Morior Invictus is the most valuable drop from this boss, with the other uniques he drops being of a lesser potential value.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Arbiter of Ash can be fought at the Burning Monolith after collecting the three Crisis Fragments from the Citadels on the Atlas. Each Citadel contains a boss that players will need to defeat in order to obtain the related Crisis Fragment. They are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Iron Citadel:
   </strong>
   Count Geonor (Act 1 boss)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Copper Citadel:
   </strong>
   Jamanra, The Abomination (Act 2 boss)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Stone Citadel:
   </strong>
   Doryani (Act 3 boss)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Like Towers, Citadels can be seen from above the fog of war covering the unexplored areas of the Atlas if they are within two or three screens from the area uncovered by the player. Their presence is indicated by a glowing pillar of light that peeks above the clouds.

     The Morior Invictus cannot be chanced using an Orb of Chance because it is not a part of the regular item pool but a limited drop from the Arbiter of Ash.

 <p>
  The reason Morior Invictus Grand Regalia is so coveted is because of its special ability to increase player power based on the number of socketed runes or Soul cores in the armor set.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike regular Body Armors that have two,
  <strong>
   the Morior Invictus has a minimum of 4 empty sockets by default.
  </strong>
  Every piece also has two unique modifiers, taken from a pool of seven possible modifiers that can only be seen on the Morior Invictus. These modifiers give the Morior Invictus inherent percentage scaling in certain player stats directly in correlation to the number of socketed runes or Soul Cores in the armor piece.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are seven possible unique modifiers on a Morior Invictus. They are:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   +10% to all Elemental Resistances per Socketed Rune or Soul Core
  </li>
  <li>
   10% increased Global Defences per Socketed Rune or Soul Core
  </li>
  <li>
   10% increased Rarity of Items found per Socketed Rune or Soul Core
  </li>
  <li>
   5% increased Maximum Life per Socketed Rune or Soul Core
  </li>
  <li>
   5% increased Maximum Mana per Socketed Rune or Soul Core
  </li>
  <li>
   5% increased Attributes per Socketed Rune or Soul Core
  </li>
  <li>
   +10 to Spirit per Socketed Rune or Soul Core
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The ideal Morior Invictus armor piece will be corrupted using a

    <img loading="lazy" src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/12/currencyvaal.png"/>
    Vaal Orb
   </span>
  </span>
  to gain
  <strong>
   five rune slots instead of four
  </strong>
  and have
  <strong>
   two useful stat upgrades
  </strong>
  . None of the modifiers that can spawn on the Morior Invictus are useless, but how impactful an upgrade it is depends on the exact nature of the build it is being used in. The most desirable modifiers on the Morior Invictus is the
  <strong>
   ‘+10% to all Elemental Resistances’
  </strong>
  as it immediately gives the body armor a passive +40% to all Elemental Res (+50% if you have five slots), which is, of course, incredibly useful to have.

  An indie horror game that became popular courtesy of its Let's Plays,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Ao Oni
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an RPG Maker horror game that locks players in a mansion where all their friends have disappeared. To make things worse, the player is regularly hunted down by a blue monster with an overly large head who should look goofy, only for the chase sequences to make a player's hair stand on end.
 </p>
 <p>
  There's nothing more horrifying than hiding in a closet, only to be too late as Ao Oni spots the player and jumpscares them. Despite showing its age, the game is still worth checking out for fans who are fascinated by the history of RPG Maker horror game, which were all the rage at one point.

   <em>
    The Evil Within
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the most underrated survival horror games that players can check out. Shinji Mikami is a legendary director whose strengths can be seen in every aspect of this title, with
  <strong>
   Laura
  </strong>
  being a great example of how horrifying this game can be.
 </p>
 <p>
  This twisted, durable, multi-limbed monster is a horrifying reincarnation of a poor woman who agonizingly lost her life after being trapped in a barn that was set on fire. While she's impervious to most forms of damage, players can use flames to debilitate and possibly kill her once they get access to a flamethrower.

  The remaster of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Until Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  may be disappointing for many fans, but that should take nothing away from the allure of this horror adventure that channels the spirit of campy teen horror movies. The immersive performances and horrifying scenarios that players are thrust into make
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  an unnerving yet fun title for them to sink their teeth into.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  such a terrifying experience are the
  <strong>
   Wendigos
  </strong>
  , cursed humans who hunt down anyone unlucky enough to go to Blackwood Mountain. It's easy to lose one's nerve at the sight of these monsters, which can quickly lead to a character's death if the right split-second decisions aren't made.

    Silent Hill 2

  </strong>
  is one of the best horror games of all time, and fans were glad to see that the remake faithfully adapted the original game for the most part. James' adventures in this haunting town delve into the realm of psychological horror as monsters start appearing to target his addled mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the scariest monsters in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  that players are urged to run from time and time again is
  <strong>
   Pyramid Head
  </strong>
  . This monster looks disturbing and engages in some horrifying activities, making it even more intimidating to face when players are within striking range and have no other means of escape.

  The bundle also includes back bling and pickaxe items. Kafka's back bling is a broken Kaiju No. 8 mask, while Kikoru and Reno's back bling are based on their gear bags, with Reno's featuring glowing green vials of ice-element ammunition for his weapon. One pickaxe is based directly on Kikoru's massive battleaxe, while the other two are inspired by Kafka's Kaiju form and Reno's affinity for ice powers, respectively. The bundle also packs in an emote that shows the spirit of Kaiju No. 8 hovering over the character, and a wrap that decorates a weapon using Kaiju No. 8's skin pattern.

  Online reaction to the launch of the
  <em>
   Fortnite Kaiju No. 8
  </em>
  bundle was largely positive, stemming from the show's popularity. Some fans noted that the bundle's timing was conveniently ahead of the launch of
  <em>
   Kaiju No. 8
  </em>
  Season 2 in July 2025. That said, some fans did express some disappointment that other popular
  <em>

  </em>
  characters like Mina Ashiro and Gen Narumi weren't included, but expressed hope that a future bundle might add them.

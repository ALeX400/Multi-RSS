      Many Elden Ring players can beat the game without facing most bosses, only 12 are required to complete the main storyline.

     <li>
      Malenia, the Goddess of Rot, is renowned as one of the toughest bosses in the game and can be beaten with specific weapon upgrades.

  An
  <strong>
   <em>
    Elden Ring
   </em>
  </strong>
  player showed a very simple way to beat the arguably most difficult boss in the game. One of Elden Ring's greatest assets is its enormous, carefully designed world, which includes over 230 bosses. Despite featuring so many different boss fights, players only need to complete 12 main boss instances to complete the main storyline.

 <p>
  This means that most bosses in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  are optional and a lot of players wrap up their journey through the Land Between without meeting them. However, one optional boss that most players have encountered at least once is Malenia, Blade of Miquella, also known as the Goddess of Rot.

   Malenia, Blade of Miquella

  has been one of the fan-favorite characters in the game. She is widely considered the hardest boss in all of Elden Ring and, luckily for many players, the Tarnished don't need to beat her to progress the main storyline. A new post on Elden Ring's main subreddit has revealed an interesting way that players can easily go through the first phase of Malenia's boss fight. Reddit user dspencil has shared a video showing how to beat Malenia by using the Nightrider Glaive

  Incantation enhances the players' weapons with Festering Bloodflame, which applies a debuff that builds up Blood Loss. This powerful

  Incantation is dropped by a Teardrop Scarab northwest of the Rose Church in Lurnia of the Lakes. The recommended level for beating Malenia is 120, and her boss arena can be found at the bottom of Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree.

  While this seems to be one of the easiest ways to beat Malenia's first phase in

  Throughout the world of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Elden Ring,
   </strong>
  </em>
  players will come across various paintings that can be collected. After players collect a painting, they will need to try and track down the location where the artist stood while painting the piece.

  After collecting, paintings can be found in the maps section of the inventory to remind players of the view they are looking for. Traveling to these spots will offer players unique items that often can't be found anywhere else in the game. The Sorcerer Painting will have players running around the Mountaintop Of The Giants; here's where to solve it.

  The Sorcerer Painting is located towards the very

  The Greathood's main selling point is the fact that it boosts Faith and Intelligence, but does lower the player's total health. The total difference is
  <strong>
   9% less health while equipped
  </strong>
  , so leveling up your vigor won't negate the health negation of this headgear. While equipped, the Greathood grants a
  <strong>
   plus two to both Intelligence and Faith
  </strong>
  and is best used in a build that needs both of these stats to get the most out of the lowered health. Should you play a more glass-canon build, this headgear is worth it, as a weapon or spell that scales from both Faith and Intelligence will receive four additional levels of damage to scale from.

 <p>
  With the announcement of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Civilization 7
   </em>
   ,
  </strong>
  many players have been wondering which leaders of historical civilizations around the world will reappear in the newest installment of the franchise. Some returning leaders might be a mainstay of the series, while others might be relatively new to the games.

  These leaders might return to lead the same civilization, or even a different one. The civilizations to be included is still a topic of heated discussion among fans of the series. Nevertheless, fans around the world are excited to see which leaders will make their reappearance in the sequel, even if it is not their favorite.

 <p>
  Although absent in
  <em>
   Civilization VI
  </em>
  and its downloadable content, Isabella I could make an appearance in the upcoming title due to her prominence in previous games. Leading the Spanish, Queen Isabella has the potential to become a leader that focuses on the religion aspect of the game.

  It is not clear yet whether

  The queen of Carthage is iconic in the series. This is thanks to her ability to bless the civilization she leads with a unique mechanic, which can be powerful once used correctly. In
  <em>
   Civilization V
  </em>
  , units of Carthage can cross a mountain after gaining a Great General. They are the earliest civilization that is able to do so.

  Her unique mechanic returned in
  <em>
   Civilization VI.
  </em>
  It gives players the ability to move capitals between Dido's owned cities, as long as it fulfills the requirement of having a Cothon district. Players can expect Dido to introduce some unique mechanics if she is included in the game.

  Making his debut in Civilization III, many players expected the first Chancellor's return in
  <em>
   Civ VI
  </em>
  years ago when the game was announced. However, Bismarck did not appear once, even in downloadable content that introduced many other leaders.

 <p>
  Feeling his absence, many players expect Otto von Bismarck to make a return in the upcoming
  <em>

  </em>
  due to his popularity as one of the famous German leaders. The Iron Chancellor could also introduce the powerful unique unit Panzer in the upcoming sequel, should he be included in the game.

  Making his debut in
  <em>
   Civilization V
  </em>
  , Sejong quickly became a fan favorite. He leads the Koreans in the series, with a tendency to focus on technological advances. With his orientation to Science in previous games, fans can expect him to have the specialty of Science Victory if he appears in
  <em>
   Civ VII.
  </em>

 <p>
  Along with his Science tendency, Sejong could also introduce unique naval units such as the Turtle Ships. This would make him a great addition to the title.

 <p>
  Missing onlyl the fifth installment of the
  <em>
   Civilization
  </em>
  series, Julius Caesar has been included in every game in the franchise. It makes sense, as he is one of the primary examples that people use as one of the greatest leaders of history. His popularity and his power make him fun to play in almost all the
  <em>
   Civ
  </em>
  games.

 <p>
  With this in mind, most fans will have high hopes for the popular Roman statesman and general to reappear in

  Most hope that he will be present in the base game instead of bonus content, as was the casem in
  <em>
   Civilization VI.

  Since he has appeared in every game in the franchise, players can expect Mahatma Gandhi to be present as the leader of India in the upcoming
  <em>
   Civilization VII
  </em>
  as well. The famous pacifist leader is perhaps most famous in the
  <em>
   Civ
  </em>
  franchise due to his chance of being incredibly malicious with nuclear weapons, which originated as a bug.

 <p>
  His inclusion in
  <em>
   Civilization VII
  </em>
  won't be a surprise to most fans of the series. However, there is still a chance that he might not be included in the base game, and will instead make his return in downloadable content.

 <p>
  He is known as the most famous general in the world, due to his undefeated streak during his lifetime. Alexander the Great's inclusion in
  <em>
   Civilization VII
  </em>
  is highly expected, even by casual fans of the series. His warmongering tendency will also give him the high potential to win a Domination Victory, as it has in previous games.

 <p>
  Still, there's a small chance that his inclusion might not be guaranteed. Firaxis Games might have another idea to keep the sequel fresh. However, even though he might be a part of the base game, his appearance in the game might appear in future content.
  <em>
   Civ Vi
  </em>
  introduces a number of leaders in its downloadable content, and
  <em>
   Civ VII
  </em>
  will likely do the same.

  It took twenty-six years, but fans finally got a new
  <em>
   Streets of Rage
  </em>
  game back in 2020 with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Streets of Rage 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  . Made by Dotemu, Lizardcube, and Guard Crush Games, it brought the classic sidescrolling brawler back in style with bolder, crisper graphics, new gameplay techniques like "Star Moves," additional modes, and a new story where the heroes must battle a new Syndicate headed by the Y twins, the children of Mr. X.

 <p>
  Still, five characters may have been enough for a roster back in the early 1990s, but
  <em>
   SOR4
  </em>
  may need more than that to get players to pick it up, even with it now being on PlayStation Plus. This is why, on top of the base roster, there are three DLC characters, and thirteen retro characters to give players twenty-one brawlers to get to grips with. But when they go up against each other, some prove to be better than others.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Streets Of Rage 1
  </em>
  characters suffer overall in
  <em>
   SOR4
  </em>
  as they lack the advances their sequel counterparts gained. They don’t really have any special moves, lack defensive options, and are generally quite dull to play due to the lack of combo potential.

 <p>
  They do more damage to make up for that, with
  <em>
   SOR1
  </em>
  Axel having some particularly strong jabs. His range is pretty decent compared to the other Axels too, and his Pipe Rage Star Move does a lot of damage. But with his limited moveset, he's unable to capitalize on it as effectively as his counterparts.

  Being more advanced, the

  The cyborg scientist can be quite fun to play, as he has some long-range strikes and powerful projectiles to make up for his lack of speed and jump. His Blitz Attacks are some of the weakest in the game, and he can’t pick up weapons either. Players must rely on his Energy Ball, which is the strongest projectile in the game, but requires careful use as it’s slow to fire.

  <em>
   Streets Of Rage 2
  </em>
  may be a classic game, but its characters lack the damage buff of their
  <em>
   SOR1
  </em>
  counterparts or the mobility of their
  <em>
   SOR3
  </em>
  predecessors in
  <em>
   SOR4
  </em>
  .
  <strong>
   <em>
    SOR2
   </em>
   Axel
  </strong>
  particularly suffers as his jab recovery and throws are slow, making him come off like a weaker version of the regular Axel.

 <p>
  Thankfully, his speed has been buffed with updates, making it easier to get his combos going, as players can just jab away. Still, like the other
  <em>
   SOR2
  </em>
  characters, he can’t cancel his Blitz Attacks into special moves, limiting their combo potential. His reach is bad too, so like
  <em>
   SOR1
  </em>
  Axel, he has to risk a pummeling to deliver a pummeling.

  was snuck in without warning as part of the Mr. X Nightmare DLC. Once it’s bought, players can hold Up+Attack on the main menu, press Start, then let go of all buttons and select Story Mode, where they'll see the boxing kangaroo on the character select screen. Players then just have to beat one stage with Roo to make him a permanent addition.

  On the one hand, it’s neat to be able to play a character without spending real or in-game currency. He has some strong default abilities too, with his Here Comes Bruce Star Move coming in handy against bosses. The only default thing that holds him back is his strength, as his damage output and punch range are quite weak.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Strengths

   : Good attack range, great weapon reach, strong jump kick and Roundhouse Kick.

  <li>
   <strong>
    Weaknesses
   </strong>
   : Worse range than the other

    SOR1

 <p>
  Like in the original game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    SOR1
   </em>
   Adam
  </strong>
  is a powerhouse character with a decent attack range. His flying kick is better at connecting opening strikes than
  <em>
   SOR1
  </em>
  Axel’s flying knee strike, and his follow-up strikes have the heft to put enemies down faster.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Still, with how basic the
  <em>
   SOR1
  </em>
  characters are, players will have to rely on Adam's flying kick a lot to get in against enemies. He has the worst range of the
  <em>
   SOR1
  </em>
  characters and, since they don’t have great crowd control,
  <em>
   SOR1
  </em>
  Adam would be better off skipping his Slash Kick in favor of the Summon Police Star Move to get them off his back.

  <strong>
   Floyd
  </strong>
  is essentially a mix of Dr. Zan and
  <em>
   SOR2
  </em>
  ’s Max Thunder. He’s got the size, strength, and throws of the latter, with the cybernetic shenanigans of the former. Before it was patched out, his Magnetic Grab, where he could pull in people from a distance, gave him an infinite combo.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Without it, he’s still a tough character with some good crowd-control options, like his Thunder Sphere move. But he’s also one of the slowest characters on the roster, if not the slowest, and he doesn’t have a sliding kick or tackle to make up for it as Max did. Players just have to deal with his tank-like movement as best as they can.

  The original incarnation of the series’ femme fatale,
  <strong>
   <em>
    SOR1
   </em>
   Blaze
  </strong>
  was considered the best of the trio in the first game, and she’s still the best here. What she lacks in strength she makes up for in mobility, as she can leap out of trouble as easily as she can leap into it.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Like Adam, she has a flying kick that gives her more range for an opening strike, and her basic combo is better at crowd control as it can hit foes standing behind her too. Still, her low damage is an issue, and she has fewer combo options than every other version of Blaze in the game.

  <strong>
   Blaze
  </strong>
  used to be one of the best characters in
  <em>
   SOR4
  </em>
  , and she’s still a decent character now. It’s just that everyone else in the game got more buffs than her, while her old OTG (off-the-ground) combos got significantly nerfed. The updates were meant to stop infinite combos, among other issues, but it made a combo-heavy character like Blaze less fun to play.

 <p>
  That said, she’s still a sturdy character with plenty of tricks up her sleeve. She’s got special attacks to counter all sorts of foes, like the Uraken Uchi for crowds, Embukyaku for combo launchers, and the Kikou Shou for zoners. Nerfed as she is, Blaze still has plenty to offer.

  Blaze is generally meant to be the agile one in the
  <em>
   SOR
  </em>
  games, yet
  <strong>
   <em>
    SOR2
   </em>
   Blaze
  </strong>
  manages to have some of the strongest combos in the game. Her additional mobility, special moves, and Hishou Souzan combo chain can tear through enemies and their armor well if used correctly.

  Her Ring of Fire Star Move is great for crowd control too, as it lingers on the screen for a while, giving the player and their friends something to chuck their foes into for extra damage. They just have to be wary of her low stamina, and that her best combos work when her opponents have their backs to the wall.

  The third time seems to be the charm with
  <strong>
   <em>
    SOR3
   </em>
   Blaze
  </strong>
  . That game introduced Blitz attacks, and she can use them with aplomb. Her Blitz moves don’t do as much damage as her other versions, but they have more invincibility, letting them connect through enemy strikes without them hitting her back.

  Her Hishou Souzan also gained I-frames to make up for its damage reduction, making it a better tool against aerial opponents. She’s great at getting combos going and is stronger still when she’s holding a weapon. She’ll need it too, as
  <em>
   SOR3
  </em>
  Blaze has bad reach on her standard punches.

  <strong>
   Adam Hunter
  </strong>
  has been away from the series for a long time. The Genesis sequels used his younger brother Skate, and
  <em>
   SOR4
  </em>
  seemed like it would bypass him again for his daughter Cherry. But if players beat Stage 4, he’ll be unlocked for regular play for the first time in decades.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":13,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":13,"nbrPlacementsScanned":13,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1028} -->

 <p>
  Adam’s essentially been rebuilt from the ground up, as he now has a versatile moveset where he can be played in all sorts of ways. He’s got a decent attack range, decent combos, and is good at getting people off his back. While he doesn’t excel in one area or another, he’s strong in all of them. He's a jack of all trades, so to speak, but that's better than being a master of none.

  Adam’s daughter,
  <strong>
   Cherry
  </strong>
  , is the successor to her uncle, Skate, as the superfast but super-weak option. Like Skate, she can run all around the screen, with plenty of dashing, leaping, and sliding attacks to close the distance. Her guitar moves, like Sound Check, are great at keeping people off her back too.

 <p>
  With expert play, she could be the best damage dealer in the game, with her head-stomping aerial combos and mounting strikes. For beginners, they’re likely going to be punished a lot until they get to grips with her, as she doesn’t have a lot of health, and some moves (like Sliding Knee) leave her open to attack.

  Originally, Axel was only the best all-rounder in the game until players unlocked Adam. But he’s since received plenty of buffs, improving his jabs, damage output, and combo options. For example, he can chain his combos into his classic Grand Upper, which can be canceled into his Dragon Smash, and still leave room for a Star Move.

 <p>
  With that and his weapon blitzes and strong special attacks, he’s great at handling burlier foes and bosses. But the nimbler they are, the harder a time he’ll have chasing after them. As such, he might be better as a co-op partner for nimbler characters like Cherry. They can deal with the flying, leaping foes while Axel beats up the big guys.

   Estel

  , the foe-turned-friend from the main story, is as strong as she looks, with great jab range and charging attacks. She’s got some of the best Star Moves in the game too, from the screen-nuking Tactical Support to the swift Surgical Strike.

 <p>
  Her Grenade moves are good at dealing damage (Grenade), or for opening foes up for strikes (Flashbang). She’s slow by default but has quick leaping attacks to make up for her lack of speed. Just be careful of pits or other hazards, or she’ll be leaping into trouble.

  via the Mr. X Nightmare DLC, and like Floyd, he’s as slow as a tectonic plate. However, like Estel, he’s got lunging attacks that make him more mobile. His Power Slide and Thunder Tackle close the distance well, with the Tackle being invincible against nearly every other strike in the game.

 <p>
  Max is great at handling crowds, has a lot of throws, and even a few aerial attacks for taking care of midair foes. It makes up for his lack of combo potential and short punching range. He’s not so great with weapons either, so it’s best to make the most of his tackles and lunges.

  still isn’t any better with his jab reach than the other Axels, and he lacks the cancelable Grand Upper that his sequel counterpart has. So, why is he this high over the rest of the cast? For one, his running and rolling abilities make him much more mobile and able to escape danger more easily.

 <p>
  Then, while he can’t cancel the Grand Upper into special moves, he can use it to end any combo or throw he does via buffering. His Scissors Kick can cancel into his specials, and his Dragon Smash has enough I-frames to attack through errant strikes. He’s a strong character, and certainly the best Axel in the game.

  isn’t quite as OP as he was in the Genesis game. His basic strikes don’t do as much damage, and his special moves aren’t very safe. If they didn't hit their mark, they’d leave Shina open for punishment. Yet they wouldn’t be this high on the list if they couldn’t make up for that.

  Their Dashing Moon Kick is fast, powerful, hits in all directions, and works great as a combo ender. His jabs have great range too, so players will be able to get those combos started soon enough. Their Star Moves are strong and versatile too, from the crowd-punishing Ultimate Final Crash to the boss-smashing Asura Ranbu.

  Skate couldn’t make it back as a canon character, but he came back in spirit with two retro characters.
  <strong>
   <em>
    SOR2
   </em>
   Skate
  </strong>
  is the weaker of the two, though only just. His Flying Headbutt is harder to connect with and leaves him weak to anti-air attacks. He doesn’t deal much damage, making it harder for him to handle crowds.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":21,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":21,"nbrPlacementsScanned":21,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":980} -->

 <p>
  Still, he’s one of the fastest characters in the game, being able to run all around the screen. His Back Attack does a lot of damage and is good for evading errant strikes. He’s got some good throws, and his Flying Headbutt Blitz can tear through armor and bosses quite well. If he's used well,
  <em>
   SOR2
  </em>
  Skate can be a powerful character.

  That said,
  <strong>
   <em>
    SOR3
   </em>
   Skate
  </strong>
  has more advantages than his predecessor. His Flying Headbutt was made weaker than the
  <em>
   SOR2
  </em>
  version, but it hits as he comes down as well, making it a safer move.
  <em>
   SOR3
  </em>
  Skate’s throws aren’t as strong as
  <em>
   SOR2
  </em>
  ’s individually, but his Grab Combo is stronger overall.

 <p>
  He’s great at chaining Blitz attacks together into nasty combos, be they his standard attacks or weapon blitzes, making him a good choice for expert players. His Ground Roll is particularly deadly once an enemy is cornered against a wall. It can’t quite juggle them indefinitely (not anymore anyway), but it’ll form a close enough space for every hit within it to count.

  Interest in the 60-year-old franchise has received a surge in popularity in recent years, due in no small part to Dennis Villeneuve’s wildly successful
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  films and actor Timothee Chalamet’s striking performance as hero turned tyrant Paul Atreides. For those wondering how
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  's take on the iconic sci-fi protagonist will differ from how Chalamet portrayed him, the latest trailer makes a lot clear.

 <p>
  There is no Paul Atriedes in the world of
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  . In a recent reveal from developers at Funcom, the game takes place in an alternate timeline for the
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  universe, one where Lady Jessica obeyed the Bene Gesserit's generations-long eugenics program and gave birth to a daughter instead of a son. Without Paul existing, there’s really no telling what will happen to Arrakis, as the canon events of the series cannot take place without Paul fulfilling his prophesied role as Kwisatz Haderach. Jessica and Leto’s daughter, a totally new character for the franchise, is an unknown quantity as of now, but it’s safe to assume she’ll provide a fascinating new look at the Bene Gesserit faction, as they will likely be raising her as one of their own.

  Who Is The New Atreides in Dune: Awakening?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Though it has revealed a number of gameplay features in
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  , Funcom has released very few details about the narrative beats of the game, particularly any information related to Paul’s alternate timeline sister. Because she is going to be a completely original character, it’s hard to say for certain what direction she’ll go in, but to make the most out of this alternate history, this new Atreides character should be nothing like Paul’s book or film adaptations.
 </p>

 <p>
  Whereas Paul Atreides eventually becomes a warmongering tyrant, Leto and Jessica’s daughter may take a more reserved, less violent approach. Her involvement with the Bene Gesserit undoubtedly means she’ll still have some level of ruthlessness in her (it is still
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  after all), but it would be a refreshing change of pace for her to idealize her father’s kind heart and noble intentions. Making this new character a female version of Paul would be a huge misstep and a wasted chance at an exciting new character.

  How Dune: Awakening’s Alternate Timeline Makes Arrakis the Ultimate Sandbox
 </h3>
 <p>
  Series purists may be sharpening their pitchforks at the news that
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  will be breaking established canon, but the decision Funcom has made here is probably for the best. The truth is there’s a very limited scope of what can be done narratively within an existing story. Herbert’s magnum opus is so masterfully crafted and well-thought-out that Funcom’s only real decision is to explore a speculative history of the setting he put together. And in an open world survival MMO, the real star of
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  is Arrakis itself and how players interact with it.

 <p>
  Freeing
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  from the main timeline means that players will be able to shape the world in ways not possible if the team at Funcom was strictly adhering to canon. In a way, Paul’s absence from the game opens the door for players to step into his shoes as the protagonist, free to take Arrakis in any direction they wish.

 <p>
  Paul’s actions in the story of
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  fundamentally change the course of that universe, for better or worse. With him absent and his pseudo-sister’s role yet unclear, the player is free to make whatever decisions they like that will ultimately change the course of this new take on
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  . When the
  <em>
   Dune: Awakening
  </em>
  closed beta drops later this year, gamers can try their hand at being a savior, a conqueror, or maybe something in between.

  There are many characters on
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals'
  </em>
  growing roster, from the blazing Human Torch to the mighty God of Thunder, Thor. One of the most popular types of characters to play are 'dive' heroes. Dive heroes are unique in that they typically have high mobility to move around the map, yet rely on close-range combat to achieve any eliminations.
 </p>
 <p>
  These characters are a great pick against 'poke' enemies, yet have a harder time against 'rush' heroes. Dive characters like Psylocke or Spider-Man work best at flanking the enemy team and taking out enemy Strategists or other lower-HP foes in the back line.

  Venom is one of
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals'
  </em>
  most fearsome Vanguards, as he constantly aggravates the enemy's back line and its supports. Venom, like Spider-Man, can swing around the map, as well as crawl and run on the walls to navigate terrain with ease. With his dive bomb ability, Venom excels in surprise attacks on groups of 'squishy' enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  After diving onto a team, launching his tendril ability allows him to dish out good amounts of damage to multiple enemies while focusing his primary fire onto the most prominent target. Venom is also the best hero when it comes to solo survivability, as his regeneration ability grants him more shield the lower his health is.

  Captain America can utilize his unlimited sprint and shield dive abilities to quickly bombard enemy Strategists and poke heroes. His survivability and reflective shield allow him to continue fighting without healing for a while as well. Captain America can throw his shield, which will ricochet off a surface and track enemy targets nearby for a small amount of damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Combining this with his dive, primary melee attacks, and primary ranged attack, Cap can either achieve an easy elimination or disrupt Strategists from their healing. Captain America is also the best at holding objectives, as his mobility and ultimate ability allow him to stay alive long enough for his team to take back point.

 <p>
  Though infamously known as the "tickle monster" in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , Black Panther can be excruciatingly disruptive to an entire enemy team when played correctly and not countered. Black Panther's playstyle revolved around his attacks leaving vibranium marks on an enemy, and then using his dash on the same enemy to 'spend' the mark and regain a dash.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without missing, Black Panther constantly resets cooldowns and moves at such a speed that it becomes almost impossible to nail him down until he misses a vibranium mark or dash. Using his ultimate, which deals a fair amount of damage to those in front of him and leaves vibranium marks on enemies, and combining his abilities, Black Panther can wipe out a team by himself.

  Though his damage was nerfed in Season 1, Iron Fist gained a buff in survivability that allowed him to stay alive longer when diving the enemy team. His primary melee attack, Jeet Kune Do, locks onto an enemy and pulls Iron Fist toward them while attacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  When he uses Dragon Defense to counter enemy attacks, Iron Fist will use Yat Jee Chung Kuen as his primary attack, which unleashes a flurry of punches onto the enemy and melts health bars fairly quickly. Iron Fist can also heal 150hp for himself with Harmony Recovery, allowing him to stay in the fight longer and attack Strategists or melt Vanguards' health down.

  Psylocke is devastating when it comes to eliminating an enemy by surprise. She can use her Psychic Stealth ability to turn invisible and move much faster for 3 seconds, which is enough time to flank her target or get away from an enemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  When she's ready to take out a target, she can utilize her abilities to erase a Strategist's or Duelist's health bar entirely. When she's not flanking, her abilities are on cooldown, or can't locate a viable target, Psylocke uses her Psionic Crossbow to essentially poke at the team when needed and can use her ultimate ability to take out an entire group of enemies.

  As the most difficult Duelist to master in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , Spider-Man's skill ceiling is exceptionally high. Spider-Man has the best mobility in the game, as he can swing multiple times around the map, crawl and run on walls, and use specific techniques to combo his abilities and move around even faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Spider-Man is a menace when diving onto a single enemy. Shooting a target with a web will place a Spider-Tracer onto them, allowing him to trigger the tracer with an uppercut or normal melee attack to deal bonus damage. This allows him to combo an enemy to elimination in seconds and is done in the blink of an eye when he's teamed up with Venom.

  Magik is often regarded as one of the best Duelists in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , and for good reason. Magik's sword and her various abilities do massive amounts of damage to a target.
 </p>
 <p>
  When she deals damage to an enemy, Magik generates shield for herself, which allows her to dive the enemy team and stay alive for longer periods of time. Like Spider-Man, she can combo her abilities, such as using Magik Slash from afar, running in with Umbral Incursion, and then finishing the combo off with a primary sword slash and quick melee attack.

  Finding the Abalone Shell Fragment in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  is rather simple, as all you have to do is go to Rhodes and enter a specific abandoned house north of the main street. Rhodes is a rather small town, so locating the right house should not take you a long time. Once you enter, you'll see a long workbench and at the end of it, between all the clutter, you'll find the Abalone Shell Fragment, which has a bluish color. Like other items in the game, the Abalone Shell Fragment can respawn indefinitely. However, since it cannot be sold and is practically worth nothing, you can't exploit it for an infinite money glitch.

  The Abalone Shell Fragment is necessary to craft the Bison Horn Talisman, which permanently decreases the speed at which Arthur’s Stamina Core drains by 10%. This might not seem like a lot, but in situations where Arthur must flee without his horse, this extra Stamina can go a long way and be the difference between escaping successfully and being killed by the law. Once you have the Abalone Shell Fragment, you'll also have to ensure that you have the other ingredients required to craft the Bison Horn Talisman at a nearby Fence location.
 </p>
 <p>
  To craft the Bison Horn Talisman, you will also need a Legendary Bison Horn, which can be obtained by killing and skinning the Legendary White Bison, and a silver earring, which can be looted and also found inside drawers and chests around the map. The Bison Horn Talisman has a base price of $38.50, which isn't a fortune, but is also not the cheapest item out there. If you’re having trouble hunting, using the right ingredients for bait, such as Wintergreen Berries, can go a long way in making this a simpler task.

      <title>Why The Elder Scrolls' Take on Elves Stands Out in the Fantasy Genre</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/elder-scrolls-elves-fantasy-genre-unique-cultures-variety/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Elves have been a staple of the folklore and mythology of many cultures for centuries. Over time, they developed into the version that audiences are familiar with today. As a staple in fantasy video games, elves show up a lot in many video game franchises, and often with different types of elves within the same video game world, such as high elves and wood elves.
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls
   </em>
  </strong>
  is no different in this respect, but it takes this a step further and has far more kinds of elves than most other franchises.

 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  While many of these elven cultures may seem interchangeable,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  ' elves are all geographically and culturally isolated. Four playable elven races exist alongside many more elven races that are extinct and are referenced through ancient ruins, artifacts, magic, and books. This creates the story of a world that's been continuously inhabited by many different people in different places.

  Rather than just two or three at most,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  has four elf variants who are playable, as well as the Bretons, who are elf-blooded. In addition to the playable elf variants, there are several other kinds of elves who are either non-playable, such as the Falmer, or extinct, such as the Ayleids or the Dwemer. Each elf race in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  has an incredibly distinctive culture and history that sets them apart from the other elves, moreso than in other fantasy games where elves may only have some tenuous differences, such as living in cities versus living in the wilderness.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ruins of the different extinct cultures of elves can be found across Tamriel, most notably the Ayleid ruins in Cyrodiil and Dwemer ruins across the continent. The extinction of the Ayleids plays a role in the
  <em>
   Oblivion
  </em>
  expansion pack
  <em>
   Knights of the Nine
  </em>
  , which explores the Ayleid warlord Umaril, while
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind
  </em>
  hints at the fate of the Dwemer. Morrowind also expounded on the history of the Chimer, the ancestors of the Dunmer.
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  provided insight into the fate and culture of the Snow Elves, giving players the chance to actually meet one in
  <em>

  One of the most creative interpretations of the elves is of the Dunmer, or the Dark Elves of Morrowind. Descended from the Chimer, the Dunmer are essentially
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  ' take on the drow from
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons,
  </em>
  but to call them identical would be misleading, as their culture is completely different. Set against the volcanic landscape of Tamriel's Morrowind, the Dunmer's history, religion, and way of life are incredibly creative. The Bosmer of Valenwood are another twist on a classic elven archetype as the "wood elves" of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  , but their home province of Valenwood is notoriously inaccessible, and the Bosmer themselves are known to practice cannibalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  One race that's not often regarded as elven are the Orsimer, or orcs. According to
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  lore, orcs are considered to be elves. Their patron deity, the Daedric Prince Malacath, is largely responsible for their smithing and warrior culture, as well as their current appearance. The orcs of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  exist as a subversion of what both elves and orcs are expected to be in fantasy narratives, but they're considered to be elven just as much as Altmer in Tamriel.

  </strong>
  players have recently shared a few grievances concerning the game's handling of rain. Their complaints mark one of the first instances of concentrated
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  fan criticism that has been voiced since the game's release.
 </p>
 <p>
  Released on February 4, Warhorse Studios' latest RPG has been largely well-received by reviewers and players alike. Over on OpenCritic, the game presently boasts a "Mighty" rating, based on an average score of 89 and a near-flawless 97% recommendation rate. Many reviewers praised
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  for its immersive gameplay mechanics, open-ended quest design, and rewarding exploration, among other qualities. The RPG's fan reception has been just as encouraging, as underlined by its "Very Positive" Steam reviews and its 4.2- and 4.6-star ratings on the Xbox and PlayStation Stores, respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a rare instance of loud early adopter complaints, some
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  players have recently taken to social media to highlight several flaws with the game's implementation of rain. The wave of criticism was started by Reddit user Hawk-Environmental, who labeled the RPG's rain as "by far the biggest let down [sic]" in a February 21 post on the r/KingdomCome subreddit. The fan argued that the game's rendition of rainfall looks dated and lacks ambiance, in addition to being buggy, as underlined by scenarios where it rains indoors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hawk-Environmental's post amassed thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments within 24 hours of going live, suggesting numerous
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  fans agree with their grievances. Chiming in on the ensuing discussion, some players have pointed out other issues with the game's rain, like the NPCs' tendency to complain about bad weather during perfectly sunny days, as well as instances of the rainfall effect being rendered on the inventory screen.

  More Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Bug Fixes Are Coming
 </h2>
 <p>
  Warhorse recently rolled out the first
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  post-launch patch, which resolves a number of issues with its hit RPG. The developer suggested even more bug fixes are in the works and will be rolled out in the near future. As a result, there's a chance that some of these recently voiced fan grievances about rain will eventually be addressed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite sporadic complaints of this sort, the overall public consensus on
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  has been overwhelmingly positive. The game's commercial momentum is in line with this positive buzz, with publisher Plaion recently revealing that the RPG had surpassed 2 million sales as of February 17, less than two weeks following its debut. The game should be able to retain player interest for a while yet, not least because Warhorse is currently planning to release one free content drop and three paid DLC packs between now and next winter.

      <title>Marvel Rivals: How To Get Ruined Idol Achievement</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/marvel-rivals-guide-ruined-idol-achievement/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Getting the Ruined Idol achievement in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  is quite easy, and will take almost no time at all if you are on defense. It may take some effort if you’re pushing Ratatoskr, but certain heroes can help make things easier.
 </p>

 <p>
  Here’s what the Ruined Idol achievement's description says:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "Shatter the Bloodstorm One statue when Eternal Night falls on New York."
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Now, trophy hunters may be confused about how to get it, as the description paints only half the picture. While the “what to do” part is straightforward, the Bloodstorm One statue’s location is hidden away. To start things off, it should be noted that the Ruined Idol trophy is exclusive to the Central Park map. This is the latest addition to the game, brought in via the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  Season 1.5 update on February 21, 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since things can get a tad tricky, here’s an in-depth guide on how to get said trophy in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals

  Before jumping into a random match for the Ruined Idol achievement in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , here are a few important things to know:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   It is exclusive to the Central Park Map.
  </li>
  <li>
   The trophy can be obtained in Quick Match, Competitive Match, or the Central Park Quick Match (limited-time mode available through February 26, 2025).
  </li>
  <li>
   The key location is Dracula’s Castle, the major junction (not counting the convoy's start location).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If you start on the defensive side, getting the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals’
  </em>
  Ruined Idol trophy is a piece of cake. Here are the necessary steps:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Head out of spawn and follow the graveyard on the left till you reach the doors of Dracula’s Castle.
  </li>
  <li>
   Look to the left for a hole in the wall. Go through it and into the darkened room on the right.
  </li>
  <li>
   Destroy the Bloodstorm One statue at the end.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  If you're on the offense with Ratatoskr, you can choose to play the match like normal and head into the room once you're at Dracula's Castle. If you don't want to take a chance, equip speedy
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  characters like Spider-Man, Venom, and Rocket Raccoon, or sneak around as Loki or Invisible Woman to get past the fight and to the Bloodstorm One statue.

  Some players have noted that breaking the Bloodstorm Statue didn't net them the achievement. In such cases, it's important to fully destroy said sculpture. Since
  <em>

  features scaling environmental destruction, damaging the statue may seem like the end point. However, there’s no secret animation or hidden task involved. Hence, you should completely destroy it, so there's no trace of it left.

  Some players have also noted that destroying the Bloodstorm Statue before the starting 30s timer ran out did not net them the achievement. While this is not confirmed, players on either side would have to really rush to get there within that time limit. For a standard run, this should not be an issue. In case you see some random error codes in

  , it's best to try again in another match.

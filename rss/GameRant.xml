 <p>
  Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has recently reinforced the company’s decision not to release its games on day one on
  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  , calling the idea irrational. While Take-Two Interactive has added popular games such as
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  to Xbox Game Pass before, the publisher never did the same with its major games during releases.

 <p>
  Earlier this year, Microsoft confirmed that
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  would be on Game Pass on day one. This was seen as a controversial move, considering that
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is one of the most profitable franchises in gaming, and Microsoft risks losing money by offering it on its subscription service.

 <p>
  Now, Take-Two Interactive's Strauss Zelnick told GamesIndustry.biz that the publisher’s stance on releasing major titles on subscription services at launch has not changed. According to Zelnick,
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  ’s addition to Game Pass is likely to push more consumers to the service “for at least a period of time.” However, he also clarified that "No, it won't affect our decisions. Because our decisions are rational."

 <p>
  Zelnick not seeing the rationality behind the decision to put major releases on subscription services makes sense when considering that Take-Two Interactive does not have any product remotely similar to Game Pass. Take-Two’s revenue is directly dependent on selling games, while Microsoft is currently betting hard on Game Pass, believing in its future growth. Also, it’s unlikely that Microsoft would pay as much money as Take-Two would lose by putting eagerly anticipated titles such as
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  on Game Pass, for example.

 <p>
  Even Microsoft had to make huge changes to Xbox Game Pass recently due to the addition of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  to the service in the future. With the introduction of the new Game Pass Standard tier, price increases, and day one releases being only available on Game Pass Ultimate on consoles, it’s clear that Microsoft wants to cash in on
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  ’s popularity to offset Game Pass’ slow growth in subscribers.
 </p>

 <p>
  This was a fairly controversial move, however, as critics have pointed out that Microsoft’s new tiers can be confusing to consumers. Xbox Game Pass Standard will get first-party games after an undisclosed amount of time, which may range from six months to “sometimes longer,” and this lack of clarity could potentially affect trust in Microsoft’s service. In any case, time will tell how successful Microsoft’s changes to its subscription service will be.

 <p>
  Wednesday, August 14 is the day that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  fans will get to see everything that Season 12 has to offer. Currently,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is in the midst of Season 11, which introduced a Sentai-themed battle pass and a new Push map along with significant hero balance changes.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 12 is on the horizon, and is set to be even bigger than Season 11.

 <p>
  That's because
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 12 will feature the debut of new Support hero Juno.
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players had the chance to try Juno for a limited time during Season 11, but Season 12 will mark her proper introduction to the hero-shooter. Many
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  players seem optimistic about Juno and think that she will make for a solid addition to the game's roster of Support heroes.

 <p>
  Besides the fact that
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is adding Juno in Season 12, there's not much fans know about what next season has in store for the game. Luckily,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  enthusiasts won't be left in the dark for all that much longer. Blizzard has confirmed that a new trailer for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 12 will drop on Wednesday, August 14, at which point fans should get a look at everything else Season 12 has in store.

  Season 12 will launch on August 20 with the theme "New Frontiers." The trailer coming on August 14 will likely reveal what fans can expect from the Season 12 battle pass skins, as well as the new Mythic. The latest
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  season introduced the concept of Mythic Weapons, so it will be interesting to see if Season 12 has its own Mythic Weapon in store.
  <em>
   OW2
  </em>
  Season 11 also featured a
  <em>
   Transformers
  </em>
  collab, so one has to wonder if another crossover is in the cards for Season 12.

 <p>
  There's a lot riding on
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 12. The popular hero-shooter has found itself in a strange place as of late, as some fans are demanding the return of 6v6 and Blizzard has struggled to balance the game to make the experience fun for all roles. New competitors like
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Concord
  </em>
  are poised to hit the scene soon as well, so hopefully Blizzard comes out guns blazing with its
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 12 content to keep longtime fans engaged. We'll get a much better idea of what Blizzard is planning for Season 12 when the trailer drops on August 14.

  was lacking new, substantial content for a while since its Viper Commando Premium Warbond, and a lack of content can be almost certain death for a live-service game. Indeed, many Helldivers had apparently abandoned ship as
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ’s Steam player count had plummeted, but that tide may turn for Arrowhead now that a massive content update dropped on August 6, titled Escalation of Freedom.

Arrowhead was more coy about its upcoming Automaton additions than its new Terminids, however, and previously divulged that impalers are being reprised from the original

  —but that wasn’t
  <em>

  ’s Terminids may not provide the same offensive onslaught that Automatons pose, but they sure possess a number of aggravating enemy types that make missions more grueling than they ought to be. Hunters and stalkers leap great distances toward players and Wombo Combo them across the map with unrelenting aggression; shriekers swoop in from above and have arguably egregious hitboxes; and bile spitters initiate a bug breach if players don’t deal with them swiftly, for instance.

  Players can dodge chargers rather easily by diving sideways at the right moment, though this strategy loses its viability when chargers are accompanied by any number of smaller, faster bugs that can exploit players’ prone, defenseless positions. Now, this irritating nuisance has yet another, more obfuscating variant.

  Even stalkers are mildly visible in their translucency and many maps have environments and climates where a hulking mist would surely be seen rampaging, especially during the daytime on a bright map. Still, it is tremendously intimidating if somehow players are unable to see them barreling toward them until it’s too late. There are some mission types where chargers are less of a problem, such as defense campaigns in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2

  <em>
  </em>
  where players can see nearly every bug or bot coming from a mile away depending on how prepared they and their squad are.

  But even on open-region missions chargers can close the distance in a pinch and upend any strategies or goals players were busy executing, almost like how Mr. X continues to pursue players relentlessly in the
  <em>

  remake. Because Escalation of Freedom’s spore chargers make all enemies around them stealthy, chargers have become an even greater enemy and will likely take full priority beyond even foes as imposing as titans or impalers.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Hogwarts Legacy
   </em>
  </strong>
  brought a brand-new wizard-focused RPG to life that allowed players to experience life in the titular school from the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  franchise. Avalanche Software's venture into the world of
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  wasn't perfect, but
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  still managed to be the highest-selling title of 2023. Despite a few issues, the game excelled at making the grounds and building of Hogwarts feel alive, which has ignited a lot of speculation about a potential sequel in the future.

 <p>
  So far, neither Warner Bros. nor Avalanche Software have officially confirmed the existence of a
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  sequel, but the impressive sales numbers make it seem highly likely. From the four Houses to magical creatures, like Hippogriffs,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  features a lot of the aspects that make the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  franchise so unique. However, there are still things missing from the game that could have made Hogwarts feel more realized overall. The absence of Quidditch was a big downside of the game, but the lack of a well-written gamekeeper also leaves a hole in the fabric of Hogwarts.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  takes place around 100 years before the events of
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  , the lack of a gamekeeper can really be felt within the game. Hagrid is one of the most notable characters and confidants to Harry throughout his journey, and the wide array of creatures that he cares for make him a fan favorite in the story.

 <p>
  To Hagrid, his pets are more than just animals. Each pet is treated like a family member, and it's a charming aspect of how Hogwarts works as a school. Having someone on the grounds to take care of the various magical animals that inhabit the land ultimately makes the school feel like a safer place. Whether it's Fluffy, a giant three-headed dog or a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon named Norbert, Hagrid's reverence for animals is a great quality that a
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  follow-up should embrace.

  There are plenty of features from
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  that
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  uses as inspiration, but the game dropped the ball in terms of a character as charming and warm as Hagrid. Of course, there are plenty of magical creatures that players can run into while exploring, but a sequel showcasing someone on the grounds to serve as a guardian would serve as a meaningful nod to the original franchise.

 <p>
  To be fair,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  isn't completely missing a gamekeeper. However, he is barely ever seen and lacks any meaningful role in the story. He can be seen tending to Hogwarts' grounds, but that is the extent of his place in the narrative. Pretty much all that is known about the character is that he was clearly the gamekeeper at Hogwarts in the 1890s. Not even his name is mentioned. This is an unfortunate choice from Avalanche Software, as it robs players of getting the chance to have a bond with the gamekeeper that is similar to Harry and Hagrid's friendship.

 <p>
  If a sequel is eventually announced, the next
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  will hopefully expand on this gamekeeper and his role at the school, or even introduce a new one. Hagrid was part of the beating heart of
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  , and the absence of a character similar to him is quickly felt when playing the game. Of course,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  is set in its own period at the school, so the story is going to be different in some aspects. However, adding a few characters that create compelling parallels to the source material could help both worlds feel more connected.

  The original
  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy
   </strong>
  </em>
  games are getting another re-release, as Square Enix recently revealed the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 1-6 Collection Edition,
  </em>
  which complies the first six games in the series with various extra goodies. Releasing later this year on October 8 for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, the title collects every
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  Pixel Remaster in one single package and is currently available for pre-order on the Square Enix website at a cost of $74.99.

 <p>
  For a long time, the iconic
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  series was only playable through a series of disjointed ports, remasters and past releases on older consoles, so fans rejoiced when Square Enix released the Pixel Remaster series in 2022 on Steam. The remasters later received ports to the PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch as digital-only titles until they eventually received a limited physical run with the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  on the Switch.

  Square Enix announced the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 1-6 Collection Edition
  </em>
  on Twitter with a post sharing a few screenshots from the games alongside images of the physical game case and a free sticker sheet that comes bundled in. The announcement led to a fairly sizable response from fans, many of whom were excited to get another shot at buying a physical version of the series, while others were upset at the continued lack of an Xbox port for the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  Pixel Remasters

  When the Pixel Remasters were originally released in 2022, they brought some major upgrades to the first six

The soundtracks in every game saw a significant overhaul, with an option to cycle between the new and old versions, and players are able to turn off random encounters and enable an auto-battle mechanic, as well as view a series of unlockable character models in a gallery.

  The
  <em>
  </em>
  Pixel Remasters marked the first time most of these games have been available on a home console since they originally debuted between the 80s and 90s, coming even closer to having every mainline
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  game playable on one platform. While a port of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 11
  </em>
  is unlikely due to its nature as an MMORPG, many fans have clamored for a re-release of the divisive
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 13
  </em>
  trilogy, which is currently only available on Steam for anyone who doesn't own it on the Xbox 360 or PS3.

 <p>
  Still, for die-hard fans or those who hope to collect the series physically, the
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 1-6 Collection Edition
  </em>
  is shaping up to be a valuable option. It is still unclear whether plans for an Xbox port are in the works, however, though given the success of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  on the Xbox Series X/S, only time will tell if this ever happens.

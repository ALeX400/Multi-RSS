      <title>The Best Nintendo Switch Games That Don't Require An Internet Connection</title>

  The
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  is a handy and innovative little system that allows players to take their games with them everywhere they go. As such, many of the games that have been released for the Switch have been specifically designed so that they don't require an internet connection in order to be enjoyed.

  While video games have become largely focused on internet connectivity in the past decade, offline, single-player games are just as important to have available on a console's library. Not everyone has access to high-speed internet, but that should not be an issue when it comes to the
  <strong>
   best offline Switch games
  </strong>

  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  might represent
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  's modern era, but the franchise has not forgotten its roots either.
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  is very much a throwback to the license's classic formula, albeit one that takes a few big risks. The most obvious is the protagonist: Zelda. Yes, for the first time in what feels like forever, the iconic Princess takes center stage, finding herself needing to protect Hyrule after a portal to another realm removes Link from the equation. While usually presented as a capable warrior in her own right, Zelda's skills are naturally very different from Link's, and her mage-style background is emphasized throughout
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Aided by a fairy, Zelda gains access to the Tri Rod, which allows her to create copies (or echoes) of items and enemies. The entire game is built around this mechanic, with combat encounters revolving around Zelda's ability to summon creatures and exploration heavily using echoes. Despite the change in protagonist,
  <em>
   Echoes of Wisdom
  </em>
  nevertheless feels like classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  , including a structure that manages to be both liberating like a sandbox and also fairly linear. Each dungeon offers a good mix of action and environmental puzzles, while also ending with generally fun boss fights.

  In 2023, the Switch had long stretches were not a lot was really happening. That said, a decent release was never too far away
  <em>
   Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Advance Wars 1 + 2: Re-Boot Camp
  </em>
  were both good-to-great remakes, while
  <em>
   Fire Emblem Engage
  </em>
  was another confident strategy RPG in a franchise packed to the brim with them. At this point in its life, the Switch does not need system sellers, and these titles suffice as solid additions to an already vast library.

  However,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  is another beast entirely.
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  's sequel somehow does the impossible and arguably improves upon what many consider to be the
  <strong>
   best single-player Switch game
  </strong>
  , even though it cannot hope to feel as groundbreaking as its predecessor.
  <em>
   TOTK
  </em>
  finds Link going on another expansive journey across Hyrule, this time in search of the missing Zelda. Furthermore, he also needs to explore floating islands and a massive underground world. Gameplay-wise, the 2023 release fundamentally feels the same as
  <em>
   BOTW
  </em>
  , just with a few new mechanics such as a fuse system that rewards creativity.

  Like many of the other all-time greats of gaming, the
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  series has suffered long spells on the sidelines since first breaking onto the scene more than three and a half decades ago. When it does rear its helmet-covered head though, fans can generally expect a fantastic experience, whether that be in two dimensions or three.
  <em>
   Metroid Dread
  </em>
  is an example of the former, and, depending on who one asks, possibly the best 2D
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  game of all time.

 <p>
  Other than the ill-fated spin-off game,
  <em>
   Metroid Prime: Federation Force
  </em>
  , the franchise has always been geared towards a single-player experience, and that is once again the case with
  <em>
   Dread
  </em>
  . Players couldn't play the game with a friend or loved one even if they wanted to, which actually plays into some of its core themes quite nicely. At its core,
  <em>
   Dread
  </em>
  is a game that seeks to invoke feelings of isolation, and the single-player setting works incredibly well in that respect.

  While not devoid of representation, the Switch does not have all that many traditional
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  projects. Consequently,
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  filled a genuine void that had been present for most of the console's lifespan, and the side-scrolling platformer is far from a retread of former glories. Boasting a gorgeous visual style and an array of new power-ups and gimmicks,
  <em>
   Wonder
  </em>
  lives up to its name by radiating creativity and imagination throughout most stages. It is arguably the best 2D
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  outing in decades.

 <p>
  Now, the game's marketing emphasizes its multiplayer quite a bit, and playing with friends certainly brings a unique charm to the campaign. However,
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  works flawlessly as a single-player package, as do most mainline entries in Nintendo's legendary franchise.

  Though there are a few online functions attached to
  <em>
   Super Mario Odyssey
  </em>
  - most notably the time trial-inspired, Luigi's Balloon World - the crux of the experience is centered around classic single-player action. It is technically possible to play with a second person controlling Cappy, although this is more of a gimmick than anything else.

  The game itself features an array of vibrant sandbox kingdoms for Mario to explore with his brand-new capture ability, which allows him to take control of enemies and other characters that would usually be NPCs. There's a ton to do in every single kingdom, players can easily spend well over 100 hours in the game.

  Nintendo took its time with
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  , and that patience paid off. The sequel builds beautifully on its predecessors' brilliant foundations, crafting arguably the most enjoyable entry in the series so far. As always, players must navigate an alien planet while leading Pikmin, small entities that come in a wide range of colors signaling their unique powers and uses.

 <p>
  While the core experience is not far removed from
  <em>
   Pikmin 3
  </em>
  , the 2023 release fine-tunes enough elements to feel like its own beast, all the while adding a few neat mechanics that largely complement the central gameplay loop. Visually,
  <em>
   Pikmin 4
  </em>
  is among the best looking games on the Switch.

  <em>
   Metroid Prime
  </em>
  was a masterpiece when it debuted in 2002, and age has done nothing to change this fact. Randomly released in early 2023,
  <em>
   Metroid Prime Remastered
  </em>
  gives the GameCube classic a predictable graphical makeover, which largely serves to reinforce the original's brilliant and timeless visual design. More importantly, the Switch version incorporates modern dual-analog controls that are a better fit for a first-person shooter, although fans who prefer the old ways can pick the classic setup.

 <p>
  The new controls change the gameplay's feel quite a bit, so veterans who have played
  <em>
   Metroid Prime
  </em>
  to death can enjoy a somewhat fresh experience. Meanwhile, newcomers can just jump into one of the greatest Nintendo games of all time without having to deal with a learning curve.

  The story-based game is an RPG with some massive twists that completely change how players think about the genre. While

  isn't one of the 100-hour experiences like some other RPGs, it doesn't have to be. The game is incredibly powerful in a small, 10-15 hour package.

  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11 S
  </em>
  is considered by many to be one of the best JRPGs of all time and with very good reason. Thanks to its great story and gameplay - the latter of which features numerous quality-of-life improvements over other JRPGs - there's little reason to doubt that conclusion.

 <p>
  The Switch version of the game features many enhancements over the original title. The main story alone should keep players busy for at least forty hours, with endgame content taking total playtime up towards the 100-hour mark. It's a fantastic game to try out, and the Switch is hands down the best place to play it.

  In recent years, Nintendo has shown renewed interest in Mario's RPG career. In 2023,
  <em>
   Super Mario RPG
  </em>
  received a pretty good remaster/remake that brought the SNES classic to the Switch, and it is still among the best entry-level JRPGs of all time. The next year, an even more sought-after remake hit store shelves:
  <em>
   Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
  </em>
  . While not making sweeping changes to the GameCube classic, the Switch version incorporates several QOL adjustments to make for a slightly smoother experience than the original. There are also a range of more exciting alternations, including the introduction of two new bosses.

 <p>
  Ultimately, none of the changes or new additions matter all that much as
  <em>
   Paper Mario: TTYD
  </em>
  is and will always be fantastic. The turn-based combat, dialogue, story, and environments are as good as they get in the RPG genre or even the Mario franchise.

  A few months after a successful PC launch,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  made its way to the Nintendo Switch, and the imaginative indie game is a natural fit for the hybrid console. Taking notes from multiple genres, Mintrocket crafted an adventure that feels wholly unique, despite sharing similarities with various projects.
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  puts players in charge of managing a sushi restaurant, which means doing things like hiring employees and ensuring the clients' needs are met. Compared to some other management sims, the 2023 release is not particularly deep, although it makes up for this fact through its memorable characters and story. However, this element is only one-half of
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  's routine.

  During the day, players must explore a transformative ocean to catch fish that can be served at the restaurant at night. These hunting sections make up the bulk of the campaign, and they are a blast to play through. They are also strategic since players can only carry one weapon, and their options all have pros and cons.

  <em>
   Kirby and the Forgotten Land
  </em>
  drops HAL's iconic mascot in his first proper 3D adventure, and it was worth the wait. Living the isekai dream, Kirby is sent flying to another world, one filled with the broken remnants of a bygone civilization. Naturally, Kirby goes on a wild and colorful adventure as he tries to make his way back home, all the while taking on some impressive threats.

  Those who have yet to play through
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  are missing out on one of the best action platformers we've seen in the last decade. The talented Team Cherry put a lot of work into this visually beautiful title and its hard-as-nails gameplay fits well with its dark and doom-stricken aesthetic. People who enjoy the lore of it all can consume an underlying story that's actually quite interesting, while all the characters are a treat to interact with.

  Another fantastic indie release,
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  is one of the best roguelikes to enter the genre. Like Hollow Knight, it has its moments of difficulty, but dedicated players will find themselves progressing further and further through the game with each subsequent run.
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  has an incredibly addictive combat system going for it, but where it truly shines is in its story and character design.

  Aside from the fun of finding new weapons, upgrading skills, and trying to escape the underworld, Zagreus will meet a colorful cast of godly characters that make the world of

  Larian's
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  has taken the RPG world by storm, but the 2023 game is not coming to the Nintendo Switch. Fortunately for owners of the latter console, the developer's previous masterpiece,
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
  </em>
  , is available on the hardware, and it is a fantastic overall experience. Even though it might not seem like the best fit for a controller, the game is a surprisingly smooth ride on consoles, and the Switch version runs pretty well for the most part.

 <p>
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  is the complete package, although its challenging combat might put off newcomers to turn-based tactical RPGs. Larian emphasizes player choice, and while someone's decisions might not impact the central questline all that greatly, they have wide ramifications in other parts of the campaign.

  Although there are a lot of exciting games featured on this list, sometimes players simply want to relax. Thankfully, there are a lot of great games available for the Nintendo Switch that are relaxing and pretty therapeutic.
  <em>
   Stardew Valley

  is a fantastic example, and it's filled to the brim with content, allowing players to sink hours upon hours into the unique farming simulator.

  There is so much to see and do in
  <em>

  Players who enjoy the Metroidvania style of game will definitely want to check out
  <em>
   Ori and the Blind Forest
  </em>
  . Perhaps one of the most visually stunning releases of the last decade,
  <em>
   Ori
  </em>
  is a challenging platformer that features a gorgeous visual style that is an absolute treat for the eyes. A touching and heart-wrenching story, the gameplay adds an immense sense of danger to Ori's quest and will keep players enthralled as they try to solve platforming puzzles to progress through each zone.

  Sunbathing is the first quest mini-game that most players will encounter as they start playing. You can get this quest from Squidward, who you'll find in different locations across Conch Street, Downtown Bikini Bottom, and Jellyfish Fields.

 <p>
  The quest is simple - Squidward wants to sunbathe, but he can't because other NPCs are hogging his spot. It's your job to clear the area of other NPCs. There's even a Rake nearby that you can use to push the other Bikini Bottom citizens out of the area.

  The Boatmobile Safety Courses mini-game is given by Mrs. Puff, the driving instructor in Bikini Bottom. This is a simple, straightforward mini-game where you'll have to win a race against other boatmobiles. You'll have to complete three laps, and getting the first spot gives you the Gold Trophy for the quest and Sand Dollars as a bonus.

  Make your way to the Krusty Krab in Bikini Bottom and talk to Mr. Krabs to get the Krabby Cook-Off mini-game. This one will likely remind players of
  <em>
   Overcooked
  </em>
  or other similar games where you run your own restaurant. In this mini-game, you’ll have to add ingredients in the kitchen to make the infamous Krabby Patty burger for hungry customers.

  Just across the street from Krusty Krabs, you'll find Chum Bucket, where Plankton is waiting to give players the Chum is Fum Mini-game. This overall idea is the same as Krusty Cook-Off, but instead of combining ingredients, you'll fill buckets with Chums of matching colors that the customers order. Completing the quest gives you Sand Dollars.

  The Coconut Chaos Mini Game is given by none other than SpongeBob SquarePants, the main character of the TV show. It's a fun little mini-game where you'll have to destroy crates stacked on floating platforms all around you. You'll be using a Coconut Launcher to shoot at the crates, earning points for each crate you break.

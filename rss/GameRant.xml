  Shaggy is one of the headline characters for the popular platform fighter
  <strong>
   <em>
    Multiversus
   </em>
  </strong>
  , essentially functioning as one of the 'baseline' or 'foundational' characters for the game. He's very simple to pick up, he has a high ceiling for anyone who wants to master him, and he's a powerful fighter all around. Between the original open beta of
  <em>
   Multiversus
  </em>
  and now, Shaggy hasn't even been changed very much at all, which means that those who haven't touched the game since this open beta period can come right back to playing Shaggy and still feel pretty comfortable.

 <p>
  All that said, Perk choices still matter on Shaggy, just like they do for most of the fighters in the roster. With the right Perks selected, Shaggy becomes even more of a menace than he is by default, especially when it comes to his Signature Perk. Taking that into consideration, let's take a look at the Signature, Team, Strong, and Standard Perk options for the Bruiser known as Shaggy and talk about what his best options are.

 <p>
  Shaggy is one of the rare examples of a character in
  <em>
   Multiversus
  </em>
  whose Signature Perks are all pretty good. Granted, he only has two, but they're both useful. One Last Zoinks is the other option here,
  <strong>
   but the reason we're picking Hangry Man is simply because of the fact that you can control it.
  </strong>
 </p>

 <p>
  With One Last Zoinks, you're dependent on the damage taken for the Signature Perk to be useful, while with Hangry Man you can choose when it's useful by taking out a sandwich at the right time. Plus, Hangry Man basically instantly charges your Rage Mode when you have a sandwich out while triggering it. So, because of this, Hangry Man is the de-facto option for his Signature Perk, but if you constantly forget to use the sandwich, then One Last Zoinks is also worth using over Well Rounded.

 <p>
  This next Perk recommendation honestly all comes down to your preferences.
  <strong>
   If you find you have a difficult time KO'ing opponents as Shaggy at least until they reach 100+ percent damage, then Press the Advantage is the obvious choice.
  </strong>
  However, if you'd rather just deal more damage overall and not worry about it, Snowball Effect is the right choice.

 <p>
  For our purposes, we find Press the Advantage to be the more useful recommendation simply because it allows you to KO enemies faster, giving them less time to deal damage to you. And, a lot of
  <em>
   Multiversus
  </em>
  players often forget that Weakened can also be stacked, so applying it with every knockback is even more beneficial than you probably think it is.

 <p>
  <strong>
   As a Bruiser, there's really no better option when it comes to Strong Perks than Last Stand.
  </strong>
  While Shaggy isn't quite as heavy or as tanky as a Tank character, Bruisers almost always are able to live past 100+ damage, which means Last Stand will activate on just about every one of your lives as Shaggy.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  When combined with Press the Advantage, that's a lot of time that your opponent is spending Weakened over the course of a single match. And, since Shaggy has so many relatively safe approach options with his Chiller Instinct Kick being the most obvious one, it's incredibly easy for him to take advantage of both Last Stand and Press the Advantage in one life.

  Shaggy really only has one projectile, his sandwich, and other than that he's entirely based around melee attacks.

  So, it's obvious that the Pugilist Perk is the best Standard Perk choice out of the bunch. You can basically just treat it as a passive buff, as this Perk will trigger on just about every single one of Shaggy's attacks.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Animal Crossing
   </strong>
  </em>
  has continued to establish itself as a staple of Nintendo's library.
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  is one of the best-selling titles on the Nintendo Switch, with the series continuing its longstanding appeal as a cozy getaway to town management. One of the most powerful tools in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  's arsenal is customization, and this feature has only gained more depth over time.

 <p>
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  features arguably more customization than ever before, and the next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  game is likely to continue this trend. However, despite each game adding more and more features to customize the player character and the world they inhabit, there's still one major boundary the series has yet to cross. The next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  game may have the perfect opportunity to finally bridge that gap by introducing custom-made villagers.

  Animal Crossing: New Horizons Prioritized Customization
 </h3>
 <p>
  One primary
  <em>
   AC
  </em>
  feature that has diversified the experience of players is character customization. Players are allowed to design their unique appearance, and have gained more and more ways to change how they dress as well. This has allowed
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  to fully adopt self-expression as one of its primary focuses.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  However, players are able to customize much more than their own appearance.
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  continued series trends of broadening a player's ability to mold their own experience.
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  introduced terraforming to
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  , which allowed players to customize the town they were managing more than ever before.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":870} -->

 <p>
  While players had previously been made to focus on decorating the town they had inhabited, now they could change the very shape of the island itself. Of course, character customization was as big of a priority as ever, with players allowed to create and adorn custom designs. In general,
  <em>
   Animal Crossing: New Horizons
  </em>
  was designed to bust plenty of doors wide open, but one major step has yet to be taken.

 <h3 id="custom-villagers-would-be-a-huge-step-for-animal-crossing">
  Custom Villagers Would be a Huge Step for Animal Crossing
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  players have been primarily led to focus on customizing their own player character. As much as recent titles have improved a player's ability to customize their environment, the player isn't the only person inhabiting the town they manage. In fact,
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  's villagers are as synonymous with the series as paying off debt.

 <p>
  Villagers are the charming NPCs that serve as the civilians of the player's town. They come with all sorts of characteristics that make each one unique: style, species, and personality.
  <em>
   New Horizons
  </em>
  allows the player to let their villagers wear custom clothing styles. However, the other two aspects are just as important to a villager's identity, and are currently impossible to change.

 <p>
  Players already have all the power they need to customize their own characters. Allowing players to customize their very own villagers would be the next big step in making every player's experience entirely unique. Not only would they be able to create custom character designs, they could also apply one of the game's existing personality types, and make these custom NPCs come to life.

 <h3 id="the-case-for-and-against-custom-villagers-in-animal-crossing">
  The Case For and Against Custom Villagers in Animal Crossing
 </h3>
 <p>
  One could argue that the existing villagers in
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  are a huge part of the series' appeal, and this is a fairly solid argument. After all, players have a much greater ability to get to know a character they didn't create themselves. Likewise, some players may simply not want to be in full control of all aspects of creation.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":977} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":0} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Not only may some players not want to have to craft characters from scratch, it would be disappointing to miss out on the return of fan-favorite villagers. For this reason, any experiment with customizable villagers should be implemented with a decent amount of caution. If a new
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  were to take the step towards players creating their own villagers, it should retain the villagers of previous games. This would be the greatest compromise that would ultimately lead to the greatest amount of player choice.

 <p>
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  has made multiple advancements in character customization throughout previous entries, and the series shows no signs of stopping at the moment. The next
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  game could be the perfect time to expand character customization even further by allowing players to create their own villagers. While there may be reason to tread carefully on such a feature, the character concepts invented by
  <em>
   Animal Crossing
  </em>
  's community show there is plenty of demand for such a feature.

  Square Enix has announced that their partnership with Twitch will last almost the entire month of July, meaning there will be plenty of time to obtain these items before they go away forever. Players will need to watch a certain number of hours of a participating
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  Twitch streamer who has the "View Rewards" tag on their video. Depending on how long players watch Twitch streamers, they will obtain the following items:

  <li>
   Log into your Twitch Account or create a new one.
  </li>
  <li>
   Click on your profile picture at the top right-hand side of the screen.
  </li>
  <li>
   Go down to "Drops &amp; Rewards."
  </li>
  <li>
   Select the "All Campaigns" option.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select one of the
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </em>
   options under "Open Reward Campaigns."
  </li>
  <li>
   Then select the link to the
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14 Online
   </em>
   category.
  </li>
  <li>
   From there, just ensure that whatever video you click has the "Viewer Rewards" tag.
  </li>
 </ol>

  Alternatively, players can just search the game's title, but doing it this way ensures that you reach the official category for the game, where you will have way more options on who to watch. Once you are watching, you can check the "Drops &amp; Rewards" section again to see how close you are to your next reward.

  <em>
   Anime Strike Simulator
  </em>
  is an RPG based on various popular anime, such as
  <em>
   Naruto
  </em>
  . In it, you have to fight enemies to earn Power and Stars. But at first, you will be quite weak. To fix this, you should use
  <em>
   Anime Strike Simulator
  </em>
  codes.

  </strong>
  codes can provide players with various rewards, including Potions that significantly speed up progression. But you shouldn't put off using them for long. Each code expires after a certain amount of time and becomes useless.

   We've added as many as 6 new codes, which offer you as many as 800 Magic Crystals. What's more, you will get 6 of each potion if you redeem all the new codes. As you can see, the developers are releasing very generous codes, and the best way to not miss any of them is to check this article periodically.

  As befits the genre, the gameplay of
  <em>
   Anime Strike Simulator
  </em>
  is quite simple. All you need to do is fight enemies and roll pets to become stronger. However, for this, you will need a lot of Power and Stars, which are earned too slowly in the early stages of the game.

 <p>
  Each such code can contain several rewards, including Potions or even Magic Crystals. The first ones are especially important, as they temporarily boost Power and Stars earnings, and can also increase Damage and even your Luck. In addition, when you receive rewards, the Potions will go into your inventory and will not be activated immediately. Therefore, you should redeem them as soon as possible while they are still active.

 <p>
  The new Prismatic subclasses introduced with
  <em>
   <strong>
    Destiny 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Final Shape expansion have been nothing short of game-changing, though Bungie has announced a variety of new nerfs aimed at the Prismatic Hunter subclass as it continues to try and bring each class' Prismatic ability sets into balance.
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Hunter class has continued to excel even further in PvP activities thanks partly to some of the new ability combinations that Prismatic makes possible, but thankfully, Bungie seems dedicated to addressing some of the related balance issues without affecting the subclass' viability in PvE environments.

  players who don't own the latest expansion for the game don't need to worry too much about their playstyles being affected, as Prismatic is only unlockable through The Final Shape campaign. With
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Final Shape expansion having been released almost two months ago now, the game's developers have had some time to observe how Prismatic performs in the wild, with earlier patches already making some adjustments to the new power. Overall, Prismatic remains an overwhelmingly popular subclass among players regardless of activity, with many excited to see how it could be further expanded on later down the line.

 <p>
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's upcoming version 8.0.5 will see a small handful of adjustments made to the Hunter class' Prismatic subclass in PvP activities though, as was recently confirmed by Bungie itself in the latest This Week in Destiny blog post. These relatively minor changes include a 50% reduction in player aim assist strength on enemy Threaded Specter decoys, while also introducing a brief delay before aim assist against a decoy takes effect. This ensures that targeting against an enemy player won't be thrown off artificially if the opponent spawns a Threaded Specter near them. Perhaps more notably, Hunters using the Prismatic Subclass in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  will have their swarm grenades nerfed, with the grenade's projectiles suffering a 20% reduction in total travel distance.

  All Upcoming Changes to Destiny 2's Prismatic Hunter Subclass

 <ul>
  <li>
   Reduced aim-assist strength on Threaded Specter by ~50% vs. players and added a short delay before the aim-assist takes effect.
  </li>
  <li>
   Reduced Threaded Specter detonation damage vs. players by ~45%.

 <p>
  This means that swarm grenades used by Prismatic Hunters won't be able to track enemy players as effectively, reducing the effectiveness of certain strong Hunter ability combos such as swarm and smoke grenades used together.

 <p>
  Blizzard has been rolling out plenty of changes to
  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft
   </strong>
  </em>
  in preparation for its latest expansion,
  <em>
   The War Within
  </em>
  , set for release in August. Many of these changes include quality-of-life improvements and features, like the account-wide Warband system. Players with a fear of arachnids will be happy to learn that a major accessibility feature for them has also been added to the game: Arachnophobia Mode.

 <p>
  Arachnophobia, a fear of spiders and other arachnids, is one of the most common phobias in the world, reportedly affecting around 3.5 to 6.1 percent of the population. Due to World of Warcraft's fantasy setting, arachnids can be found in many forms throughout the game, including enemies, mounts, and Battle Pets. The new Arachnophobia Mode setting, which came with the expansion Pre-Patch (Patch 11.0), allows players to replace most of the arachnid-like models in the game.

 <p>
  While Arachnophobia Mode is certainly a very useful option, Blizzard warns that the setting does not extend to every aspect of the game currently. Features such as cinematics, loading screen art, icons, and Dungeon Journal entries will still retain spiders and other arachnids. Furthermore, some models that contain spider-like or bug-like features won't be covered by this mode. Some examples include Nerubian Priests, Nerubian Swarmers, Cryptlords, Queen Ansurek, and Flightmaster Roost. Although this is unfortunate, Blizzard does state that this is a work in progress and may continue adjusting additional models in the future. Hopefully, Blizzard has more in store for the players, including further improvements to player experience and accessibility.

  One of the most endearing aspects of the
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  games could be made into something much bigger in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Red Dead Redemption 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  . At this point, it's a tradition for Rockstar games to be loaded with side activities for players to entertain themselves with. This was also true for the first two
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  games, as Arthur and John could spend hours away from the main story. It's only natural for
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  to include some new diversions of its own. In one case, a whole new mechanic could come from one particularly lovable feature.

 <p>
  The amount of side content in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  played a big role in the game's overall charm. Arthur's interesting character and dramatic story were a natural selling point, but it helped that the world has so much for him to do. Players could have Arthur head to bars for a drink or meal, or sit down to play a few rounds of cards. That's not even getting into the incredible amount of side quests that revealed themselves over the course of the game.
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  provided arguably the best sandbox yet to come from a Rockstar Games title.

  Horses Are Vital to the Red Dead Redemption Games
 </h3>
 <p>
  As a game about cowboys, it's inevitable that there will be horses in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  . In addition to being the equivalent of cars from the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  games, players also had a role in the care of their horses. They were tasked with brushing their horse every once in a while to keep them from getting dirty, as well as calming them when they got scared. In fact, bonding with their horse actually raised its performance, so players were encouraged to stick with one horse throughout the game. Thanks to this, the player's horse was easily their most valuable ally in-game.

  Red Dead Redemption 3's Horse Care Could Translate To a Full Ranch
 </h3>
 <p>
  The way that players care for their horses could be expanded into a new feature in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  . In addition to their horse, perhaps the protagonist could have a farm or ranch where they raise other animals as well. Maybe they run a farm as a cover, or they were a rancher before the events of the story. Whatever the reason is, running a ranch would offer a lot of extra content for
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  , from mini-games to bonus jobs. If done right, farming and ranching could end up nearly as enthralling as
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  's main campaign.

  A Rancher in Red Dead Redemption 3 Wouldn't Be Unusual
 </h3>
 <p>
  A
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  protagonist taking up life as a rancher wouldn't even require a major departure. After all, in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's epilogue, John attempted to become a homesteader, which he kept up with leading into
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  . It might be interesting to see a character balance a rancher's life as well as the life of an outlaw that
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  's previous leads have lived. If nothing else, it would be a good way to introduce a new dynamic to the series. Adding ranch life to
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  could add plenty to its next protagonist.

  <em>

  could find its best side content yet if it incorporates a ranching mechanic. After all, one of the major reasons why

  's Arthur is such a beloved protagonist is not simply because he's a tough cowboy, but because of how dynamic and interesting he is. In addition to providing players with a potential outlet to make money in-game, taking care of animals on a ranch could provide several character moments. Taking care of horses in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  could be the springboard for a whole new side game.

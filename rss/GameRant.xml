      <title>Why Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns' Lackluster Story May Be a Blessing in Disguise</title>

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  series has always been celebrated for its inventive, often complex lore that interweaves characters and realms with cinematic flair. So, when
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns
   </em>
  </strong>
  unveiled a story that felt underwhelming to many fans, there was a rippling disappointment throughout the community. But now that there’s a conclusion to
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns
  </em>
  , the underwhelming storyline could actually serve as a foundation for a more open, nuanced, and layered plot in future installments, especially when it comes to developing the villain arc.

  A villain plays a central role, especially in a fighting title such as
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  . It’s required to provide the story with a clear, exhilarating momentum.
  <em>
  </em>
  Not to mention that
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  has itself delivered complex antagonists like Shao Kahn, Quan Chi, and even Shinnok in the past. Yet, in
  <em>
   Khaos Reigns
  </em>
  , Havik, while theoretically isn’t a bad villain and is enjoyed for his enigmatic undertones, just doesn't carry the same complex gravitas. But with the story's open-ended conclusion, this chapter is now over, potentially paving the way for a more complex villain moving forward.

 <p>
  Havik’s role as the main antagonist in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns
  </em>
  is centered around chaos, a theme that, while powerful, isn’t fully developed to create a lasting impact. Unlike previous villains like Shao Kahn and Quan Chi, who carried personal motivations and deep-rooted conflicts, Havik’s character leans heavily on chaos for just chaos’ sake. For example, when it comes to Shao Kahn, he isn’t simply a tyrant, and Quan Chi’s character is layered with intrigue, manipulation, and deception.

 <p>
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  's Quan Chi’s involvement with characters like Scorpion showcases his cunning, as he uses Scorpion’s desire for revenge to further his own dark schemes. Havik, by contrast, operates on a more one-dimensional basis of chaos without strategic manipulation or personal vendettas that might deepen his role. It’s almost like he is a mysterious big bad but without a plan.

  Leaving Havik With His Indefinite Conclusion Invites Broader Options
 </h3>
 <p>
  After the bloody, game-changing conclusion, the villain arc could now be made stronger. Havik’s ending is exactly what helps make it possible. The next expansion needs to focus on a villain arc that touches base with chaos not only through physical prowess or relentless pursuit that Havik utilized, but also by sowing discord through manipulation, deception, and perhaps even psychological warfare. This would help force both the story and Earthrealm’s heroes to grapple with moral dilemmas. Plus, it would be justified and unveil a storyline that goes beyond just the typical good versus evil trope.

 <p>
  Unlike characters like Quan Chi, Shao Kahn, or even Onaga and Shinnok, Havik’s backstory remains vague and less explored. For instance, Shinnok’s origins as a fallen Elder God give his quest for domination a personal vendetta against Raiden, grounded in his resentment for being cast out. Similarly, Onaga, the Dragon King, was once the ruler of Outworld with ambitions to reclaim his throne and harness the Kamidogu to bring all realms under his control. So although Havik’s charm lies in his mysterious appeal, there are more compelling characters worthy of the slot.

 <p>
  Plus,
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  's Havik’s backstory and origins remain unexplored and when that is combined with his relentless pursuit of chaos, things end up relatively mundane. For instance, he was originally introduced as a supporting character in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat: Deception
  </em>
  and hailed from Chaosrealm. This allegiance aligns him with principles of anarchy and unrestrained chaos, a philosophy he relentlessly pursues in the current title. Yet, little detail has been provided about the forces that truly shaped him into the unpredictable cleric of chaos seen in
  <em>
   Khaos Reigns.
  </em>
  The same stakes could end up feeling somewhat personal and more involved moving forward if another multidimensional threat is introduced and the villain has a proper, multi-faceted purpose.

  <strong>
   EA
  </strong>
  has updated its list of games shutting down in 2025, with seven more titles added to the chopping block. EA keeps a running list of games it plans on shutting down, with a total of nine games already confirmed to be ceasing operations in January 2025.

 <p>
  First, EA confirmed that
  <em>
   The Simpsons: Tapped Out

  would be shutting down on January 24, with the game delisted on October 31. Then, it was confirmed that
  <em>
   Rory McIlroy PGA Tour

  <em>
   Rory McIlroy PGA Tour

  The list of EA games shutting down in 2025 will only grow as time goes on. In the meantime, there are EA games shutting down in 2024 that fans need to be aware of as well.
  <em>

  is shutting down on November 4, while
  <em>
   Battlefield 3

  A new leak from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  is hinting at a new character coming after the release of the sci-fi RPG's next world, potentially featuring connections to
  <em>
   Honkai Impact 3rd
  </em>
  . Throughout the first two cycles of the game's life, the HoYoverse RPG following the crew of the Astral Express has seen plenty of highly-anticipated characters join the roster. Characters like Fu Xuan, Firefly, and Ruan Mei have quickly become fan-favorites while HoYoverse continues to release exciting characters like Sunday. However, one subset of characters tends to garner some extra excitement from fans.

 <p>
  Serving as a spinoff of
  <em>
   Honkai Impact 3rd
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  features plenty of characters that are direct references to previous cast members. HoYoverse has introduced roster members like Seele, Bronya, and Acheron as alternate-universe versions of some of
  <em>
   Honkai Impact 3rd
  </em>
  's most popular characters. One of the main crew members of the Astral Express, Welt, was even confirmed to be the same Welt Yang that originally debuted in
  <em>
   Honkai Impact 3rd
  </em>
  . Now, new leaks are potentially hinting at another connection between the two games.

  Honkai: Star Rail Leak Teases Notable Character
 </h2>
 <p>
  A recent update shared by prominent
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  leakers Cleo and Seele is teasing the addition of a new character in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's next world. The leak features an image of
  <em>
   Honkai Impact 3rd
  </em>
  's Kevin Kaslana, confirming that the appearance will be similar, though not exact, to the
  <em>
   Honkai Impact 3rd
  </em>
  character. The leak goes on to suggest that the new character may go by "Bayer" as their name, referring to German astronomer Johann Bayer and the "Bayer designation" for naming stars. Cleo and Seele do not confirm when Bayer will release, only suggesting it will be after the launch of
  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  's next world.

  Bayer's potential connection to Kevin Kaslana would bring another major

  </em>
  callback to

  <em>
   Star Rail
  </em>
  has even made reference to
  <em>

  </em>
  's Herrschers within the lore for Welt, though the game's main story has not made reference to the

  antagonists.

  While
  <em>

  has seen plenty of connections to HoYoverse's past games,
  <em>

  recently received its own connection to the newer game. A special
  <em>

  collaboration saw Sparkle introduced to
  <em>
   Honkai Impact 3rd
  </em>
  as a playable character, complete with a new re-design.

  has also frequently seen rumors about new

  tie-ins, including a speculated
  <em>

      Don't rely on small islands for your base in

   <strong>
    The Forest

  is an amazingly fun horror-survival game where the player crash lands on an island, finds their son taken from them, and discovers the entire island is infested with cannibals and mutant horrors.

  While
  <em>
   Sons of the Forest
  </em>
  had released on February 22, 2024 to very positive reviews, fans of the survival horror title might want to take a step back from the sequel’s updated graphics and building system and go back to the quirky old days of
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  - especially when it comes to trying to find ways to “break” the game using its physics engine and going wild with structures and settlements. However, for players who are just trying
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  for the first time, they might feel as though the game is too difficult to play - especially once they’ve tried making their base and end up being bombarded with mutant attacks. Thankfully, certain areas in the Peninsula may end up being some of the best base locations in the title - like the shipping container, the location north of the Yacht, and even a location close to the sinkhole.

  When first trying the game, it will be tempting to run to one of the nearby small islands just off from the main one. Is this a good idea? Well, it certainly does provide an escape from the cannibals, which will be the first thought of many coming into
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  . No cannibals will spawn on the smaller islands, and they can’t get across the stretch of ocean required to attack the base.

 <p>
  However, while water collectors can be placed to catch rain and gardens planted to provide some food, it won’t be enough long-term, and players will be required to go far afield for most of the materials needed to progress in the game.
  <strong>
   While the islands are safe, they are barren, and the trek back and forth to even reach the base will be painful
  </strong>
  , not to mention unnecessary, since other options provide better measures of safety as well as supplies.

  As with any great base spot, players have to choose between having resources and being in the middle of potential enemy attacks or escaping it all and living on a remote beach. If players, particularly newer ones, are looking for the latter, then they should consider checking out this remote spot on the far south of the map in
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  While this spot isn't the most packed with resources and can be difficult to reach walking around the coast, it allows players complete freedom from attack, and will likely not need many resources for a base, since the position requires few traps or walls to defend it. The beached boat cove is a picturesque and pleasing location, for players willing to go off the beaten track enough to find it at the very most Southeast tip of the map.

  How about a calming base down by a lovely lake, where players can eat the many local geese and drink from the water? Goose Lake is a hugely popular spot for players because of the access it provides to a cave within the lake and also to others nearby. There are lookout posts on the lake, and it is a beautiful location.

 <p>
  But more than that, there is a cliff near the lake that is impassable for cannibals and other enemies. If a base is built up against this side, there are fewer directions that one can be attacked from. It offers
  <strong>
   safety and resources, both of which are found in a centralized location near many of the significant cave systems that players must explore to complete the game
  </strong>
  . This is a great place to start in a multiplayer server with people who haven't played the game before.

  The Snow Biome is an almost entirely impractical place to build a base, which is part of what makes doing so ingenious. The northern part of the island, near the mountain, is covered in eternal snow, which makes it uninhabitable for any player not wearing a warm suit unless there is a lot of fire around all the time.

 <p>
  Nevertheless, the Snow Biome can be a smart place to try and put a base down.
  <strong>
   Normally, it’ll be easier to accomplish this later in the game, but that is precisely when players will need a place away from cannibal attacks
  </strong>
  . The attacks intensify as the game goes on, and it will be difficult at times, but if players build in the western part of the snowy biome, they will avoid a lot of cannibal presence and find an abundance of mushrooms as food to forage in the area.

  It might initially seem like an unusual idea, but a tree house is completely possible for a build in-game and is an interesting and potentially beautiful build for a base. It should be noted that updates to
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  made it possible for certain types of mutants to attack the tree if they see the player enter the base.

 <p>
  However, while this means a tree house isn’t a foolproof escape plan, it is a useful base to have.
  <strong>
   It can make dangerous but resourceful areas much safer, as long as players remember not to put a fire inside at night
  </strong>
  . This would make the base visible for an extremely large area.

  Another space with natural defenses on multiple fronts is the south beach up against the ocean, where players can run if they are surrounded. It is also near an early-game cave with resources, the yacht is close at hand, and a camp is left behind. This, combined with plenty of nearby trees with the space between to see attackers coming, makes for a strong defensive position that's easy to hold later in the game with stronger weapons.

  While dead sharks on the beach don’t make for the best company,
  <strong>
   the site is extremely useful and easy to mark and remember on the map

  Aside from the Airplane, it’s the Shipping Containers located west of the peninsula that provides players with the closest resemblance to the outside world beyond the mutant-riddled land of
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  . This area is located just north of the yacht and is located a bit to the west of Goose Lake. The location is easily recognizable for the cluster of shipping containers scattered on the shore, with an abundance of interactive suitcases, but with a lack of trees all around.

 <p>
  The closest sources of clean water and food that players can get after establishing a base in the Shipping Containers would be along the other directions as they are already located on the western edge of the map. Despite the lack of immediate resources, this locations relative proximity to manageable mutant villages and the rest of the peninsula beyond its shores make it a manageable location. The flatness of the area makes it easy to build structures and defenses, while also making it easy to spot mutants from afar.

  <strong>

  just before the small cliff that divides the forest and the Beach - makes for an attractive base location.

  Compared to the Beach, this northern area places players smack dab in the middle of some of the game’s most vital locations: the Yacht to the south, as well as Goose Lake and the Sinkhole to the north. While the location does have a cluster if mutant villages along its northwestern and eastern edges, the area has more than enough resources to fortify a base for adequate defenses.

  The Sinkhole is among the most dangerous locations in
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  gameplay, especially when one wrong click is enough to spiral players into their demise in the caves below. Moreover, the relatively open nature of the Sinkhole left slight plains around the area that leave players visible to mutants. However, the plains directly
  <strong>
   East of the Sinkhole
  </strong>
  may be the location players need for a base.

  At its core, the relative openness of the area makes it fitting for cliffside bases that players can easily locate wherever they are. The base makes for a decent resupply station between cave expeditions, while the lack of resources is easily compensated by traversing the nearby landmarks like Goose Lake and even the river that divides the southern half of the peninsula to the north which has the snowy mountain ranges.

 <p>
  The Valley remains one of the most pristine locations for a base in
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  gameplay due to its proximity to the eastern edge of the map. The lack of activity in the region means players have all the time to spend foraging and creating their base, while most mutant activities are relegated to the far south. However, players who want a more decent alternative starting area for their base might want to head
  <strong>
   West of the Valley
  </strong>
  instead. Although this location only takes a light walk to reach, its general proximity to the rest of the game makes it a practical area to build a base out of.

 <p>
  For starters, the presence of the river in between makes a natural barrier against most mutants. However, compared to the Valley proper, going west gives players a lot of flexibility in terms of transport. For starters, the location allows players to make a zipline that can traverse much closer to the southern half of the map. It’s also much closer to the small creek that leads to a cave entrance and cluster of mutant villages to the north. Resource-wise, this part of the map is made largely of plains, allowing players to create farms and a more accessible shelter. Being much closer to the middle of the main river can give players a better view of their surroundings from the riverside compared to the limiting Valley.

  This area doesn’t have as firm a name as some other well-known base spots on the map in
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  . However,
  <strong>
   it is distinct and easily found because there is a cliff on either side of this beach area
  </strong>
  . This not only makes it incredibly easy to defend but gives it an appealing look to boot.

 <p>
  Players can gather materials, build a single wall on one side to keep away the local patrols of cannibals and get it all in a lovely location.
  <strong>
   The Valley is also a central, excellent location on the map and provides a lot of resources, so players building here will never have any difficulty gathering or defending
  </strong>
  , a difficult thing to find for such a brutal game. While all of these choices make for interesting gameplay, The Valley may be the best choice of them all for a gamer's next run-through of
  <em>
   The Forest

  .

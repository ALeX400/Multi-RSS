  As a four-star meal, Shovel Bird Eggs Benedict requires four ingredients. In addition to the expansion, players will need:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   1 x Shovel Bird Eggs
  </li>
  <li>
   1 x Elysian Grain
  </li>
  <li>
   1 x Spiral Strawberries

  As the recipe's name suggests, Shovel Bird Eggs are the key ingredient. You can buy them from Goofy’s Stall in The Bind biome, but only after upgrading the stall twice. If you haven’t done that yet, it might take some time to unlock. Once upgraded, you’ll be able to grab the eggs for 160 Star Coins.

 <p>
  Players can find Salt Crystals in Everafter by fishing in still water (anywhere without ripples). They are one of the most common materials in
  <em>
   DDV
  </em>
  , so you won’t have trouble getting them. Salt Crystals are also used in plenty of other recipes like A Very Unusual Tea Time, Arcane Garlic Crab, and Caprese Salad.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you’ve got all the ingredients, head over to a stove and toss them in to make Shovel Bird Eggs Benedict. It doesn’t sell for much (only
  <strong>
   420 Star Coins
  </strong>
  ), but it’s a great meal for those who need a quick energy boost. You’ll get
  <strong>
   1,522 energy
  </strong>
  , which is not bad since the ingredients are pretty easy to find. You can also share it with Mickey, Flynn, or any of your buddies to build up your friendship.

   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  Zombies features its own version of Scorestreaks, dubbed Support. Support items can be found by defeating Manglers and other mini-bosses, completing S.A.M. Trials, or using Salvage to craft them. Players might want to best prepare for what scorestreak they have equipped in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies to ensure they don’t get a foul surprise that will cost them their lives.

  <em>

  Zombies features great scorestreaks, with some being completely focused on the Zombies theme. Whether it’s relishing in the powers of a Mangler, or embarking on an explosive quest, many Support items in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Zombies provide players with the resources they need to survive.

   <strong>
    Updated on February 11, 2025, by Jake Fillery:
   </strong>
   BO6 Zombies Scorestreaks unlock further ways to kill the undead hordes and further push the inevitability of death just a round longer by providing players with the tools that they need for maximum devastation, so long as they have the Salvage. There are 10 Scorestreaks to use in Zombies as of Black Ops 6 Season 2, and knowing the best Scorestreak in BO6 Zombies may just save a life from an early-round demise, especially on those easter egg runs.

  The ARC-XD might be fun to drive around as a small remote-controlled vehicle, but it’s one that won’t last long. The moment the ARC-XD even taps a zombie, it will explode, and the explosion unleashed will barely even kill one zombie, let alone a horde.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ARC-XD suffers from a low damage output, so while it might be nice to drive a toy, it doesn’t have any advantage other than that. The purpose of the ARC-XD is to distract hordes, and the Aether blasts will kill zombies from behind, but it's a very fragile toy car.

  The Sentry Turret is a fairly competent scorestreak thanks to its ability to stand on its own. The Sentry Turret is completely automated, and once players place it down, it will scan for hostiles and send them back to their graves thanks to the spinning rotor of death that fires like a minigun.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Sentry Turret is quite weak and doesn’t last all that long, so players looking to use it to increase their firepower in late rounds might have a harder time than some of the better scorestreaks available on every map, even if the Sentry Turret isn't targeted by zombies, basically providing an extra gun amidst the undead mayhem.

  The LDBR is a missile bombardment system that will focus its dangerous fire wherever players aim the targeting laser. The destruction unleashed is utterly deadly to zombies and mini-bosses due to the bombardment. However, it’s also deadly to players in the vicinity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even with PhD Flopper, the LDBR will still damage players within its area of effect, so try to stay safe and clear from its blast zone. However, this can be a tad troublesome when players are going to want to lead the zombie hordes directly into the blasts.

  Sometimes a target just won’t go down, so what better way to ensure their destruction than with the Hellstorm drone stroke, which sends a fierce missile hurtling toward the ground to take out a target, or several. The Hellstorm is fast and violent, and even mini-bosses will suffer its wrath.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Hellstorm can be fired without worry of players being injured from it due to their invulnerability, so feel free to open up this scorestreak when there is an overwhelming horde to truly send them back to the depths of their rotting graves.

 <p>
  The Hand Cannon is a lot of fun to wield in Zombies, but it's not going to be something to bring into the late game when other Scorestreaks excel. The Hand Cannon comes with 10 bullets in a magazine, and while it fires fast and has a hard kick, the stopping power doesn't melt through hordes like one would hope for a Scorestreak.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's still pretty good, but in most cases, it's not penetrating past 3 zombies, and it's not really going to put much of a dent in Elite zombies like Amalgams, especially when it comes to timing a shot against a sprinting monster, so this might be a weapon left holstered for another time.

  The Mangler Cannon is an exciting entry that can be acquired by shooting the cannon of the Mangler or by building it with Salvage. The Mangler Cannon has around 3 shots that can be charged up and fired into a crowd of zombies, melting through them like butter.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mangler Cannon can also auto-target specific enemies, and the damage might not be brilliant against mini-bosses, but it’s nice to have a third weapon that can knock zombies down like dominos for sweet XP.

  The latest Scorestreak to grace the Zombies mode comes from the
  <em>
   Terminator
  </em>
  event, where players can unlock the War Machine with 100 skulls. The War Machine deserves its name, for it holds 30 shots with a capacity for a 3-round burst. With so many bullets, players might want to invest in PhD Flopper so they do not blow themselves up.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a fun Scorestreak, and while it can quickly dispatch hordes thanks to its explosions, and even 12-shot Amalgams, it's still hard to compete with the superior explosive potential of the GS45s when they are Pack-a-Punnched, and the fact that it costs so much Salvage will certainly put a dent in a player's pockets.

  There’s no scorestreak quite like the Self-Revive Kit. While players in solo can only craft 3 of them in total, they are just as essential as the standard Perk-a-Colas, and the Self-Revive kit replaces the classic Quick Revive potential.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a Self-Revive Kit, players might not have the firepower necessary to deal with larger threats, but they are still going to give themselves another life to fight another day. Even in co-op, the Self-Revive Kit will ensure that players can get back up without having to risk their teammates coming to aid.

  The Chopper Gunner has always been an incredible scoresteak to use in Multiplayer, so why not feel that same rush in Zombies? The Chopper Gunner has an incredible update for
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , where the person behind the gunner seat listens to some heavy metal to truly immerse in the thrill of being immortal with a Chopper Gunner that annihilates zombies and mini-bosses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can sit in the Chopper Gunner for just under a minute, and it’s essential to clear Exfil zones due to the fact that it doesn’t use the timer and will provide players with invulnerability while they stay in the chopper to shred everything in sight.

  If players have ever wanted to become the dreaded Mangler in Zombies, then the Mutant Injection is a must-have. Transforming into the Mangler provides players with about 60 seconds or more as this hulking monster, with a cannon attached to the arm, and a run that can explode zombies on sheer speed and impact.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mutant Injection also provides players with immortality, allowing them to withstand the evils of the zombie hordes like Manglers and Abominations. Getting hit means nothing and the power of the player-controlled Mangler is something to love.

      <title>How to Play with Friends in Civ 7 (Civilization VII Crossplay Guide)</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/civilization-vii-civ-7-crossplay-play-with-friends/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Like most modern multiplatform games with multiplayer mechanics,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Civilization VII
   </em>
  </strong>
  boasts full crossplay support. This means that whether you're playing
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch, you'll be able to square off against your friends on other platforms for a spot of multiplayer madness.
 </p>

 <p>
  Thankfully, the process for playing
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  with friends is remarkably easy, although there may be one or two extra steps involved if any of those friends happen to be playing on a different platform. The following guide will explain how crossplay works in
  <em>
   Civilization VII
  </em>
  , as well as how to play with friends.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Civ 7
   </em>
   crossplay is enabled by default
  </strong>
  , although players can toggle it on and off by visiting the "Game" section of the options menu, where they'll find the option for crossplay under the "Advanced" heading. As PC players are able to use
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  cheats to gain an unfair advantage, console players may wish to disable crossplay when they're not using it to play with people they know. In a similar vein, PC players may wish to disable
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  crossplay when they're not actively using it to avoid having to deal with limitations imposed on certain platforms like the Nintendo Switch.

     <em>
      Civ 7
     </em>
     updates and patches will be rolled out earlier on PC than on other platforms. As a result,
     <strong>
      crossplay between PC and console players will occasionally be temporarily disabled

     until everybody is playing on the same version of the game. It's important to note that

      crossplay between console players will still be enabled during these periods

  In order to play
  <em>
   Civ 7
  </em>
  with friends, players will need to go to the Multiplayer menu. There, they'll either need to
  <strong>
   create a new game or join an existing one
  </strong>
  . For the former, they should press the button or key displayed to the left of "Create Game" at the bottom of the screen. For the latter, they should press the button displayed next to "JOIN CODE" and then type in the code provided to them by their friend.

  If players create their own lobby, they'll need to fill out a few details to setup the game, after which, they can either share their
  <strong>
   Join Code
  </strong>
  with friends or invite them directly to the lobby. To find their Join Code, they can press the button next to "SHOW JOIN CODE", which is in the top left-hand corner of the screen. To

  </strong>

     Due to platform limitations, those playing Civ 7 on Switch will only be able to use the Duel, Tiny, and Small map sizes. As such, these restrictions will also be in place for multiplayer lobbies in which a Switch player is present. Conversely,
     <strong>
      Switch players may be unable to join a lobby if the map size is anything other than Duel, Tiny, or Small
     </strong>

  The Bye-Bye Dust Outfit is described as 'aromatic foam and splashing droplets' and is a floaty, dreamy, and angelic early look for Nikki. There are seven pieces that combine to produce Bye-Bye Dust, a Sweet and Elegant outfit with under shades of Fresh. After players have found the connected Bye Bye Dust Sketch, all they need to do is head to the Crafting Tab in the Resonance Banner.
 </p>
 <p>
  When evolved, the Bye-Bye Dust outfit becomes the Bye-Bye Dust: Kitty ensemble, which is a truly striking esthetic. The new variation has a black-and-white theme, with bobbles and black feathers across the hat, sleeves, and collar.

  The Afternoon Shine outfit is described as the culmination of a 'bright sunlit afternoon in a grassy field'. This ensemble's base is a sunflower yellow playsuit with a blonde pig-tailed hairstyle and brown boots that finish around the order. The Afternoon Shine ensemble consists of eight items and the completed outfit is Sweet, with hints of Cool and slither of Elegant. To add the Afternoon Shine ensemble to the inventory, players need to unlock the Accident at the Clothing Store quest.

 <p>
  After the evolution, Afternoon Shine becomes Afternoon Shine: Rain. Rain is an altogether darker overall look, both in terms of the contrast in color, but also the overall style, with black as the base and accents of red and teal.

  The Fully Charged outfit is by far the most practical of all Nikki's outfits but as players know, in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  even the simplest outfits have sass and style. The Fully Charged outfit is designed to 'keep electrical maintenance knowledge in mind' at all times. With eight separate pieces, this ensemble has a base of orange, with forest green stripes down the center of the jumpsuit, orange sunglasses, and green and orange boots. Players will be able to add Fully Charged to their inventory after finishing Chapter 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  The evolution of Fully Charged is one of the most inspired outfit combinations of any in the entire game. The jumpsuit turns from orange into iridescent silver and white, with turquoise paneling across the front, light blue hair, and black and turquoise gloves.

  The Guard's Resolve ensemble is described as automatically giving the wearer 'accompanying responsibilities'. Unlike the vast majority of other outfits for Nikki, the Guard's Resolve is simply gifted to her, during the beginning of Chapter 2, by Captain Hiya. Guard's Resolve is unabashedly Cool in style, with splashes of Fresh and a hint of Elegant and there are six separate elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the official and professional nature of the Guard's Resolve outfit, it makes perfect sense that this ensemble has no evolutionary variant. The entire look is dark in color, with lighter gray over-the-knee boots and finished with a tight hair bun.

  It's always a risk choosing a melee-focused character in a match of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  . After all, it's very easy to rush in with the hopes of dishing out some serious damage, only to get obliterated by the enemy team when they all focus fire on the same target. Thankfully, many of the melee heroes and villains in this game possess other unique elements to their kits which make them much more effective than the rest.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there are currently no Strategists in the game who rely on melee attacks, there are a fair few Duelists, and even Vanguards, whose game plans revolve around roughing the enemy up with deadly punches and kicks. However, when looking at both their reliability and fun factor, here is how these specific

  Black Panther may not be very reliable when taking on multiple enemies at once, but he's a true force to be reckoned with in one-on-one encounters. With that being said, the king of Wakanda largely relies on his Vibranium Marks to deal maximum damage, which can be attached to enemies by using his Spear Toss and Spinning Kick.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Black Panther unleashes his Spirit Rend melee ability on an enemy who is marked, the ability will instantly refresh, turning him into a relentless killing machine who loves nothing more than getting up close and personal. His passive ability, which allows him to deal extra damage when at low health, can be difficult to balance, but any bonus damage is always going to be appreciated regardless.

  Though Groot's basic attack does have a lot more range than most melee heroes, it is still the humanoid tree himself who deals the damage, as he simply extends his arms to pummel anyone in range. Groot can deal a moderate amount of damage with his attacks, but what really makes him so special is his walls, which can block an enemy from escaping when they're low on health, or from being healed by enemy Strategists.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Groot does need to get himself into the thick of the action to be effective, his Spore Bombs give him an easy way to catch the enemy off guard if they get a little too close for comfort. He might require some strategy and quick thinking, but Groot is still a very formidable hero who possesses a pretty powerful basic attack to go along with his abilities.

  Captain America's game plan revolves around leaping into the backlines, distracting the healers and Duelists for as long as possible, and maybe even picking up a few kills along the way, before escaping to safety. However, there's a little more to him than just that. When Cap scores a second hit on an enemy, his melee attack will turn into a ranged one for the next few hits, allowing him to steadily retreat back to his healers while still throwing out damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cap also has a plethora of escape abilities that make him one of the best melee heroes in the game when it comes to survivability. Liberty Rush and Leading Dash can be used to either enter or leave combat and while he can be a little vulnerable when these abilities aren't up, he still has his trusty shield as a last resort to keep him safe.

  Mjolnir, the mighty hammer that Thor wields in-game, can be used for more than just whacking enemies. With the Storm Surge ability, Thor can get into a fight, deal as much damage as possible, and then get back out with the same ability, making him a real annoyance for the enemy team to deal with.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another very useful ability is his Awakening Rune, which makes Thor even more durable in close quarters by buffing him up with bonus health while also enhancing the damage of his basic attack. Though there are heroes in the game who are still more mobile than Thor, considering how much health he possesses, paired with his melee damage output, it's staggering just how easily this guy can get in and out of combat thanks to his abilities.

  Admittedly, Magik's basic attack is pretty slow and cumbersome, but it's when using her abilities in tandem that this character really shines. If players use Magik's Stepping Disc to teleport themselves over to the enemy, they will then have a split second to unleash the Eldritch Wall; a massive AOE melee attack that can shred the health bars of any nearby Strategists and Duelists.
 </p>
 <p>
  She also possesses a dash in the form of Umbral Incursion, which allows Magik to close the gap on an enemy before launching them up in the air, which is useful for turning enemy healers into sitting ducks. Magik may not be dealing consistent damage throughout an entire match, but she can utterly obliterate foes in small bursts when her abilities are all off cooldown.

  Iron Fist is far from an easy character to use, but with a little practice, players can turn this lethal warrior into an absolute monster, especially when making good use of his abilities. While most melee heroes can struggle to stay on-target due to how much the enemy will jump and move around the arena, Iron Fist has a little bit of auto-aim baked into his basic attack, along with a dash that automatically activates upon attacking.
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn't even mentioning K'un-Lun Kick, which allows Iron Fist to perform a giant sweeping kick that can push the enemy team apart and force them to reorganize themselves in the middle of a fight. Iron Fist can feel a bit squishy, but his wall run and Harmony Recovery help to make up for this shortcoming.

  Wolverine is quickly becoming recognized as one of the hardest heroes in the game to play, let alone master, but when used in the right hands, this X-Men member can be the bane of a tank's existence. Wolverine heavily relies on his Undying Animal ability to deal damage, since it drastically speeds up his attack speed and enables him to tear apart Vanguards easier than any other character in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  He also stands out due to his Berserker Rage passive ability, which grants Wolverine extra damage the more damage he takes, making him ideal for hit-and-run tactics. The only drawback to Wolverine is he usually needs to wait around for his abilities to come back, but when they're up and running, this Duelist can feel more or less unstoppable on the battlefield.

  Players may only be equipped with a small laser blaster when playing as Bruce Banner, but when turning into the Hulk, the scientist ditches the gun to instead focus on beating the enemy down with brute force. Hulk's basic attacks deal a staggering amount of damage, so it's surprising that he also possesses an incredibly fast leap that allows him to enter and flee combat instantly.
 </p>
 <p>
  What's more, Hulk's Incredible Leap doesn't have a cool down, meaning players can either jump onto the frontlines or launch themselves over to the backline to obliterate the team's Strategists in an instant. Hulk's Indestructible Guard also means the big guy can easily protect himself against incoming fire, making him a very reliable and effective melee-based hero who can cause plenty of chaos when jumping onto the battlefield.

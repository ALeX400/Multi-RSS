  The Emerald Dice skin practically radiates good fortune, with its crisp white surface adorned with vibrant green pips. The real charm of this dice skin lies in the lucky four-leaf clover that replaces the traditional "one". The clover is a symbol of Irish luck and prosperity. As bright and cheerful as the Emerald Dice looks, it’s perfect for players who want to bring a touch of luck to their
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  boards and get into the spirit of St. Patrick’s Day.
 </p>
 <p>
  To get the Emerald Dice, simply reach the required milestone in the latest Peg-E Deluxe Drop minigame in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  . It can be found on page one of the Deluxe Drop milestone bar.

  The Golden Roller dice skin is a celebration of luxury. This skin covers your dice in a rich, golden metallic finish with elegant, dark green accents. Interestingly, this dice skin has raised, gem-like pips, adding an overall luxury feel to it. Just like the Emerald skin, it features a lucky clover on one side. All in all, the Golden Roller dice skin is a statement piece and a luxurious upgrade from the standard dice.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also get the Golden Roller dice as a milestone reward in the current Deluxe Drop minigame. Unlike the Emerald Dice, this skin is found on page two of the Deluxe Drop rewards.

  While the developers at Ivy Road estimate that players will complete
  <em>
   Wanderstop
  </em>
  in 12–15 hours, it is likely that
  <strong>
   most will take between 15 and 20 hours to complete the game's story
  </strong>
  .
  <em>
   Wanderstop
  </em>
  is a relatively small game with not a lot of replayability, but encourages players to take their time in crafting customer tea requests, decorating the shop and surrounding clearing, and completing any gardening or miscellaneous tasks that need doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike some of the cozy open-world games out there,
  <em>
   Wanderstop
  </em>
  's map is relatively compact and the story is quite linear. You won't be required to partake in any side quests or additional content, unless you would like to explore using a variety of flowers and even Trinkets and plants to create a plethora of different tea combinations. One of the main characters of the game, Boro, even goes on to talk about how sometimes it's good to just do nothing, and encourages players to make themselves a tea and sit on a bench to be with their thoughts.

 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_7">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     The completion time is an estimate based on an approach that is quite story-centered. If you decide to spend more time on decorating and exploring tea and plant combinations, you could easily double the length of your
     <em>

     experience.

  <em>
   Wanderstop
  </em>
  includes a story that is
  <strong>
   split into five chapters
  </strong>
  , which are differentiated by the change in the clearing's color scheme. Each time Alta's customers stop talking, she will be encouraged to join Boro at the shrine under the big tree to reset the clearing. It is worth noting that
  <strong>
   each time you sit at the shrine to complete a chapter, all of your plants and decorations will be wiped.
  </strong>
  So, if you've taken the time to move some plants around and decorate your surroundings, expect that they will be gone in the next chapter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each chapter has a number of new and unique characters, all of which will have their own story and tea orders for you to fulfill. Should you wish to revisit a particular part in the story and spend more time with certain personalities in the game, the option to select a specific chapter will become available from the main menu once you finish the story.

   <strong>
    Splatoon 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  players have received a brand-new update that brings a number of adjustments to the multiplayer mode's weapons and in-game events, along with fixes for certain technical issues. It is the first major update that developer Nintendo has shipped to
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  since November 2024.
 </p>
 <p>
  After rolling out in 2022,
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  marked another successful entry in the third-person shooter franchise, making it three-in-three for Nintendo. Over time, the Switch-exclusive title has received a plethora of updates aimed at enhancing the player experience and at smoothening any rough edges. Owing to the remarkable work of Nintendo devs, the action game also moved almost 12 million copies, as revealed by the company in March 2024. Most recently, the Japanese gaming giant delivered
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  's first update in nearly four months, giving it a useful refresh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nintendo EPD, the console maker's in-house team that leads development of the
  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  series, released update version 9.3.0 on March 12, 2025. This particular patch introduces several changes to the standard and special weapons available in
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  's multiplayer matches. Some of these improved weapons are Sploosh-o-matic, Splattershot Jr., and Aerospray MG, whose shot speed and flight distance have been increased. The special weapons that have been tweaked include Ultra Stamp, Triple Splashdown, and Trizooka, each of which now comes with changes incorporated to its damage and range stats. Moreover, the points needed to get access to Octobrush Orderbrush Replica, Enperry Splat Dualies, Douser Dualies FF, Recycled Brella 24 Mk II, S-Blast '91, and Snipewriter 5H have been reduced by ten.

 <p>
  In the latest update, the devs have also tinkered with
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  's special in-game events called Splatfests. From terrain changes in the Tricolor Turf War mode to balancing changes in the Hammerhead Bridge stage, a host of key changes have been made to the game's multiplayer aspect. On top of these adjustments, there are plenty of bug fixes related to
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  's controls and issues across PvP matches. In its announcement, Nintendo EPD also shared that the next update would focus on balancing the game's battles according to the findings of a long-term analysis of the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the meantime, Nintendo is gearing up for the release of its next major console, Switch 2, which was revealed in January 2025. With its arrival expected to take place later this year, it would be interesting to see which of Nintendo's IPs, like
  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  , are announced as launch titles for the Switch successor.

  This update focuses on making changes to multiplayer balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon analyzing the battle data since releasing the last update and considering weapons’ relationships to the weapons for which we improved performance last time, we have slightly extended the flight distance of shots for some weapons with shorter shot flight distances than those we improved last time, and made changes to strengthen the traits of or compensate for the weaknesses of some weapons with shot flight distances similar to those we previously improved.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding the Snipewriter 5H, Snipewriter 5B, Mint Decavitator, and Charcoal Decavitator, we made changes to slightly reduce the ability to maintain ink from a distance to give opponents wielding weapons with shorter shot flight distances more time to counter.
 </p>
 <p>
  For the Trizooka, we have maintained its trait as a special weapon capable of turning the tables if used well, while simultaneously making it easier to counter by shortening the time that players on the opposing team must be wary of the Trizooka and reducing cases where such players are defeated due to accumulated damage despite taking evasive actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, for Tricolor Turf War, we have adjusted the arrangement of certain stages that have significant statistical leaning in the win ratio for the attacking teams or defending team.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next update will focus on changes to the balance of battles based on long-term analysis of battle data.
 </p>

   Bug Fixes
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Made it so that, when a player uses Super Jump immediately after Squid Spawn, the phenomenon where sometimes an opponent’s attack was blocked immediately after landing will no longer occur.
   <ul>
    <li>
     With this fix, when players do a Super Jump, the armor state from Squid Spawn will always end before landing.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue where the controller rumbled when shots from the Luna Blaster, Luna Blaster Neo, and Order Blaster Replica hit terrain.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue where, when shots from a Bloblobber or Bloblobber Deco touched a barricade and bounced off, the shots would not display properly on other players’ screens.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue where, when a player with a splatling capable of storing a charge shot performed certain actions to use their sub weapon while storing a charged shot, the charged shot would not end.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue where sometimes, when repeatedly performing dualie Dodge Rolls or splatana lunges while standing on the edge of an elevation difference, the player’s position would become greatly misaligned on other players’ screens and stay that way.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue where sometimes, when the player touched the Rainmaker shield while charging using Reefslider, the Reefslider’s position would display as misaligned to other players.
   <ul>
    <li>
     With this fix, players will not be knocked back when charging using Reefslider, even if they touch the Rainmaker shield.
    </li>
    <p>
    </p>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue where sometimes, when a player made continuous stamp attacks with the Ultra Stamp, the interval between attacks would appear irregular to other players.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue where sometimes, when a player in a bad wireless environment did a Super Jump immediately after using Triple Splashdown, their position would not display properly to other players.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue in Undertow Spillway on Rainmaker mode where sometimes, when a player acquired the Rainmaker at the bottom of an elevation difference while dropping from the top of that elevation difference, the count would progress unintentionally.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue in Mahi-Mahi Resort where sometimes, when the counterattack shot of the Ink Vac landed at the boundary between certain walls and the ground, it would disappear without exploding.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue in Bluefin Depot where, from certain walls, it was possible to get into the opponents’ base using unintended methods.
  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed an issue in Lemuria Hub in Rainmaker mode where sometimes, when a player acquired the Rainmaker at the bottom of an elevation difference while dropping from the top of that elevation difference, the count would progress unintentionally.

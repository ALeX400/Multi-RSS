  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  has various game packs, such as Get to Work and Dine Out, that allowed players to create their own business. However, Businesses and Hobbies takes it to a whole new level, allowing players to pretty much run any type of business that they want.

 <p>
  With such extensive customization options, it is only natural that gamers will want to run more than a business venue at a time, but that means they have to get more lots. Alternatively, understanding how to acquire a Small Business Lot also makes it so Sims don't have to use their own homes to open a business.

  When players try to register their first Small Business from the Business Panel in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , it will select their home by default. However, it is not uncommon for gamers to want to keep their homes private and run a business from another lot instead. If that is the case, then
  <strong>
   players must open their Sim's Phone, select the Business App, and then click on Buy a Small Business Venue Lot
  </strong>
  . However, if gamers have already opened a Small Business, they can do this from the Business App or directly in the Small Business Panel; here, they can click on their Small Business's title, which will open a dropdown menu, and they will quickly spot the option to Buy a Small Business Venue Lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will then be taken to the Worlds screen, where they must select the lot that they would like to purchase for their new Small Business. There are several lot types that can be used as Small Business Venues, such as: empty lots, unoccupied community lots, unoccupied residental lots, and unowned Small Business Venue Lots.
  <strong>
   It is not possible to purchase inhabited residental lots, owned Small Business lots, and Retail Store lots.
  </strong>
  Players can work around this by evicting Sims, bulldozing lots, and changing lot types.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once gamers have purchase a new Small Business Venue Lot, they only have to put down a Business Sign and a Ticket Kiosk, and it'll be considered a new lot for their growing business.

  <strong>
   Unfortunately, even though gamers can own more than one Small Business Venue Lot, they can only register one Small Business in
   <em>
    The Sims 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This means that every Small Business customization option will remain the same for each business venue. Essentially, the best gamers can with Businesses and Hobbies is create a franchise in their favorite
  <em>
   Sims 4
  </em>
  Worlds.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it's not possible to own more than a Small Business, it is possible to own way more Business Venue Lots than many would expect. As long as Sims have enough Simoleons in their household funds, they can continue to purchase Business Lots.

  Some
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  players believe the hero shooter is doing a better job of making lesser-known characters popular with fans than recent MCU films and shows.
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has proven to be a big success for NetEase Games, as it has managed to attract over 40 million people since launch.
 </p>
 <p>
  As of writing, there are quite a few MCU skins in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , but they haven't always been well-received by fans. Some players were initially taken aback by the price of MCU cosmetics, with some costing as much as $26. The issue wasn't just with the overall price tag, but the fact that original designs with the same rarity were closer to $22. This caused many fans to criticize NetEase Games, accusing it of charging more for skins simply because they came with the MCU tie-in. Since receiving feedback, the cost of new MCU skins seems to have come down, but the price of existing bundles remained the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a recent post on Reddit, Vanderlyley suggested that NetEase Games' popular hero shooter is doing a better job of making lesser-known heroes a household name than recent MCU movies and shows. While there's a lot of collaboration between
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  and the MCU in the way of cosmetics, they both operate independently. The game could have strictly drawn from the wide pool of MCU characters, but the developers opted to bring in heroes like Jeff the Land Shark, Galacta, Luna Snow, and others who haven't been given any representation in live action films.

 </h2>
 <p>
  Furthermore, the game has chosen to highlight its comic book roots by including team-ups in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  that haven't even been possible in the MCU, like The Thing's ability to throw Wolverine across the battlefield. Many fans agreed with Vanderlyley, sharing their own experiences. Several gamers said they were purchasing comics for heroes they'd previously never heard of. Some even claimed it got them to watch MCU movies they'd previously skipped, with one fan exclaiming that they finally understood the love the community has for Iron Man.

  Numerous people said they would love to see even more connections between the game and the MCU, suggesting that the movies should capitalize on the success of characters like Jeff the Land Shark and bring them into the films. Many fans are also eager to see more MCU skins in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  , but a large portion of the community seems just as happy with original designs for characters like Squirrel Girl and Luna Snow, further showing how much the fandom has embraced such heroes. With Season 1 halfway over and more content on the way, many fans are feeling optimistic about the future of

  The main gameplay of
  <em>
   Cursed Tank Simulator
  </em>
  is to fight other players. And your tank is your main weapon, which you can customize with various parts. Each part affects the stats of your weapon. So, you have to choose them wisely. However, there are quite a few parts available to players in the first stages. Therefore, you should pay attention to the
  <em>
   Cursed Tank Simulator
  </em>
  codes.
 </p>
 <p>
  These codes will allow you to get a lot of resources and currencies needed to buy new parts in just a couple of clicks. But it is worth noting that they have an expiration date. And after it expires, each code along with the rewards becomes unavailable.

  A new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak reveals several changes that will arrive in the upcoming update 3.2. Like most of HoYoverse's other titles,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  follows a tight update schedule, allowing the game to make adjustments every 6–7 weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  was officially released in April 2023, meaning the game's second anniversary is slowly approaching and will likely be part of update 3.2. As usual, players can look forward to exciting events that will grant them sizable amounts of Stellar Jade for free.
 </p>
 <p>
  While HoYoverse has yet to officially reveal details about
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's anniversary celebrations, multiple leaks have already unveiled most of the upcoming content in Version 3.2. A credible leaker named sakurahaven has shared more details about the rewards and major changes expected in the next update. The most exciting change will likely affect the game's Limited Character Banner, allowing players to select specific characters when they lose a 50/50 on the limited banner.
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's 50/50 mechanic means there is a 50% chance that a five-star pull from the limited banner will result in a standard character. Leaks suggest that both standard characters and a selection of limited playable units will be available.

  Previous
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  leaks have revealed that the art book will be obtainable through an in-game giveaway. The art book will reportedly showcase artwork of locations and characters from the
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  universe. Overall, fans were somewhat disappointed with last year's anniversary event and hope that HoYoverse will step up its game this year. While players should not expect a significantly larger influx of Stellar Jade compared to last year, the changes to the banner system seem promising for many.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many fans still want HoYoverse to address one of
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  's biggest issues, which is power creep. The game's fast-paced meta shifts make older characters feel significantly weaker compared to newer roster additions. Some comments have pointed out that allowing 50/50 drops to include older limited characters might not be as impactful, considering that many of these units have not been meta-relevant for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding roster additions in 3.2, HoYoverse has already announced two new five-star characters: Castorice and Anaxa. Castorice is expected to arrive in the first banner cycle, which should drop around April 8. This means Anaxa's banner will most likely arrive in the second banner cycle of
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 3.2, expected around April 30.

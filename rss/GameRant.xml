 <p>
  Hack and slash games have evolved considerably since the genre's inception. It's easy to label these games as button-mashing extravaganzas full of elaborate set pieces, but there's more to these games than meets the eye. A combination of great level design, enemy variety, numerous abilities, and excellent presentation go a long way in making most hack-and-slash games more engaging.

 <p>
  It's easy to blast certain games for not living up to critical or fan expectations, but these titles can pleasantly surprise players by showing how competent they are — even if they don't fully stick the landing. Some of the most polarizing hack-and-slash games have a ton of things working for them that fans can still enjoy as long as they manage to look past certain rough elements in each title.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  series features some of the greatest hack-and-slash games of all time, but not all of these titles hit the ground running.
  <em>
   Devil May Cry 2
  </em>
  is a great example of the same, with this game being hated by the masses for dumbing down the gameplay and destroying a lot of what made Dante such an iconic protagonist. So, it's easy to see why fans were less than enthused to see the announcement of a
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  reboot that looked like it was changing too many things for most fans' liking.

 <p>
  The lack of challenging combat and major changes to Dante's character were frowned upon by most fans, leading to
  <em>
   <strong>
    DmC: Devil May Cry
   </strong>
  </em>
  being lambasted for forsaking a lot of what made the series so special in the first place. It's easy to draw this conclusion, but fans willing to give this reboot a chance will love the stylish combat, invigorating visuals, and a surprisingly great story that gives every character their moment in the spotlight.

 <p>
  The switch to character action and hack-and-slash combat was worrying for many
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  fans. The series had struggled to redefine its identity, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 16
   </em>
  </strong>
  needed to nail its core gameplay loop while doing justice to this historic JRPG series to satiate fans. Unfortunately, in the eyes of some fans, the easy combat and a focus on quick-time events were frowned upon by many players who felt that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  was all style and no substance.

 <p>
  It can be challenging to ignore the poor side quest design and lack of enemy variety, but
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 16
  </em>
  deserves way more credit than it gets. Some of the hunts are a joy to undertake, and the game's cinematic qualities are through the roof. The game's story is rife with political intrigue, while the Eikon battles are spectacular affairs with crescendoing music and high stakes that never fail to deliver. The combat itself may be easy at points, but there are ways to combine Clive's abilities and techniques to decimate most enemies in style.

  To this day, it's hard to believe that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Lollipop Chainsaw
   </em>
  </strong>
  was written by none other than James Gunn himself. With the legendary Suda51 serving as the game's director, the potential for this game to succeed was immense. Unfortunately, the incredible presentation and fun story couldn't make up for a combat system that wore out its welcome and became a chore to interact with by the time players reached the end of this game.

  doesn't overstay its welcome and lets players enjoy a tight, action-packed romp with a zany premise, colorful visuals, and violence out the wazoo. The

  edition of the game spruces up the visuals to make them more remarkable, giving players an excuse to check out a game that is highly entertaining despite its flaws.

  A PS3 exclusive that isn't talked about all that often,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Heavenly Sword
   </strong>
  </em>
  brought a ton more to the table than most people give it credit for. The game looked positively breathtaking at the time and can still wow players with its impressive visuals. Ninja Theory are masters of the hack-and-slash genre, and
  <em>
   Heavenly Sword
  </em>
  features engaging gameplay that makes every sword slash as satisfying as can be.

  Unfortunately, the bulk of the main story is forgettable to the point where players can't be bothered with Nariko's motivations. Even with Andy Serkis serving as the game's antagonist, cliché writing and a short runtime turn
  <em>
   Heavenly Sword
  </em>
  into a one-and-done experience. Still, it's a good one-and-done experience instead of simply a tolerable one, which makes this polarizing title worth checking out for fans of underappreciated hack-and-slash games.

 <p>
  The hype for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  was through the roof before its release. The previous mainline entry was a must-play on the PS2, with its fun blend of JRPG systems &amp; hack-and-slash combat making for a winning combination that was perfected from the first game. While the story was convoluted in many ways, seeing familiar Disney characters interact with original and established Square Enix characters was novel.

 <p>
  However, the combat of
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  coupled with a disappointing story left many fans with a bitter taste in their mouths. Expectations were perhaps unrealistically high for this highly anticipated title, and players who approach the game with a more balanced mindset are likely to enjoy a colorful and engaging hack-and-slash game that serves up an explosion of colors with each stage. It's far from the best game in the series, but it's definitely the most playable. Fans looking for a charming action game with an interesting story will love what
  <em>
   Kingdom Hearts 3
  </em>
  brings to the table.

  You should make it a habit to explore every corner of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fields of Mistria
   </em>
  </strong>
  at the start of a new season. Forageable items will change each month, and with this, you'll be able to complete more side quests. Rose Hip is a type of forageable flower that only appears in winter. Not only will you need the Rose Hip for the Museum, you'll also need it to complete a request from Valen. Rose Hips are a bit odd, as they only spawn in one area in
  <em>
   Mistria
  </em>
  , and it's not an area you're likely to consider.

  Before you go searching for the Rose Hip flower, make sure it's winter. It won't bloom in any other season. You can get Rose Hips from the
  <strong>
   four bushes near Adeline and Eiland's manor
  </strong>
  (right side) in Mistria. Each bush has three flowers each, meaning you'll have plenty for the Rose Hips side quest and for cooking.

  In winter, you can accept a request called "Request for Rose Hips" from Valen. The only hint she gives is that the flower grows on rose bushes when "the weather gets cold." Valen requests
  <strong>
   3 Rose Hips
  </strong>
  , so make sure you have the right amount when you speak to her. As a reward for the request, she'll give you the recipe for Rosehip Jam. This will restore 34 HP and 34 Energy. To make it, you'll need:

 <p>
  Rosehip Jam is a 1-star recipe that requires a
  <strong>
   level 1 Kitchen
  </strong>
  , but you'll need to be
  <strong>
   level 4
  </strong>
  in
  <strong>
   Cooking Skill
  </strong>
  in order to make it. Without Cooking Perks from Caldarus' statue, cooking Rosehip Jam will take up 20 minutes of your in-game time. It's far from the best recipe, but it's arguably one of the easiest to make because of how few ingredients it requires. You can stock up on Rosehip Jam before diving into the Mines; 34 HP/Energy can help you in a pinch.

  Rosehip Jam and Rose Hips are a Liked Gift for Elsie and Valen. However, before you start giving them away, you'll want to check if you've donated a Rose Hip to the Museum in The Narrows. It's part of the Winter Forage bundle along with Burdock Root, Holly, Oyster Mushroom, and Pineshroom.

 <p>
  By itself, Rose Hips will sell for 20 Tesserae. If consumed, they restore 5 HP/Energy. Thus, it's better to just cook them or give them out as gifts. If you cook a Rosehip Jam, you can sell it for 130 Tesserae.

  September seems like a month for creativity in the fall gaming release schedule.
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  brought forth a lot of imagination in its levels and power-ups, and now,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Plucky Squire
   </em>
  </strong>
  is seemingly changing how games can be made by incorporating a heavy meta-textual narrative and gameplay gimmick.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  may look like a
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game combined with a
  <em>
   Paper Mario
  </em>
  game, but it is so much more than that. It’s a relatively short adventure, but it's certain to be one indie game fans won’t soon forget. After players are done, they may be hankering for their next jolly adventure. Luckily, there are many
  <strong>
   games like
   <em>
    The Plucky Squire
   </em>
  </strong>
  for them to check out.

   <em>
    Eastward
   </em>
  </strong>
  is more of a recommendation for starving
  <em>
   EarthBound
  </em>
  fans waiting for Nintendo to release
  <em>
   Mother 3
  </em>
  in the West officially. Since that has yet to happen, indie developers have been making fan-like tributes to
  <em>
   EarthBound
  </em>
  for years now.
  <em>
   Eastward
  </em>
  will fit into the needs of fans of
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  also, as it is a top-down action RPG.

 <p>
  It follows a quiet man who finds a girl while exploring some ruins one day, and a malevolent force is trying to get her back. The game is filled with quirky characters, inventive puzzles, brilliant visuals, and a decent combat system. The graphic style alone should appease fans of
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  , but it is so much more than a simple visual treat for the eyes.

  <strong>
   <em>
    The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the best
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game to recommend to fans of
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  . It re-invented the series on a small scale before
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  re-invented things on a bigger one. It’s also the sequel to one of the best games on the SNES,
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Every
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game has a gimmick, and this one happens to have two. First, instead of earning equipment through dungeons, players can choose to rent items, which makes the game less-linear than normal. The bigger gimmick is that Link can turn into paintings on walls and walk around in a new dimension. It’s not quite as fourth-wall-breaking as
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  , but it certainly comes close.

   <em>
    Nobody Saves the World
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a bizarre indie game about a white husk of a human with no name. They somehow wind up with the magical ability to transform into different beings and animals, and now they must save the kingdom in place of the true hero. The setup is bizarre, but the weird characters help sell the world.

 <p>
  Also, the transformation gameplay loop of
  <em>
   Nobody Saves the World
  </em>
  should have players hooked from minute one, whether they are inhabiting the body of a giant knight or becoming a tiny mouse. Each form can get past certain barriers, and there is a branching skill tree that dictates what players can turn into next. It’s a meaty game, offering gamers tons of reasons to stick around and come back to it for a second go. The game even features co-op.

   <em>
    Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door

  is the second game in the series, but it’s the newest game players can get on the Switch. It was originally released on the GameCube before
  <em>
   Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
  </em>
  got remastered in 2024 and is often heralded as the best entry in the series. Upon coming to a new town, Mario discovers Princess Peach has been kidnapped.

 <p>
  Gaining new allies, Mario embarks on an epic quest across this new land to find her. Battles are turn-based but also active, as players can power up their attacks or boost their defenses with well-timed button prompts. Mario and all other characters are made of paper, while the rest of the world is made from other materials, including more paper, cardboard, bricks, and so on. The game has a DIY feel to it, which would fit in perfectly with
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  world.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Retro Game Challenge

  </em>
  was a unique DS game that was like a celebration of gamers who grew up in the 80s and 90s. Players assume the role of a young kid who keeps getting new games for their new NES-like console. There are platformers, shooters, an RPG, and more available to check out.

 <p>
  If players get stuck, they can look at magazines in their room. Also, there’s a fourth-wall-breaking polygonal head that is challenging this kid to games. There was a sequel as well for the DS, followed by a final 3DS game and a Switch remaster of the first two titles. Sadly, none of these sequels ever left Japan, and it may be hard to track down
  <em>
   Retro Game Challenge
  </em>
  , too, but it’s well worth the hunt.

  <em>
   <strong>
    RPG TIME: The Legend of Wright
   </strong>
  </em>
  is the number one game that
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  fans should jump into first. It’s not that it’s better than the other examples as much as it is a 1:1 example of what
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  is doing. The framing device is that a little kid wrote his own RPG in a notebook, resulting in everything having a rough pencil quality.

 <p>
  Each area is minimal, giving players a task to accomplish, like trying to move a boulder in a cave. This can lead to different gameplay styles, from a side-scroller action level to a top-down tank mission to a game of whack-a-mole. The changes to the gameplay help keep everything fresh, and the visual style, which utilizes things from the desk, too, is just too good.
  <em>
   RPG TIME: The Legend of Wright
  </em>
  is, without a doubt, a companion piece to
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  , and it would be cool to see the two indie studios collaborate on something from DLC to a brand-new experience.

   <em>
    The Plucky Squire
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes place in a storybook wherein a hero, Jot, has been tasked with taking down an evil wizard named Humgrump. On the way, he is joined by his friends, but once Jot reaches Humgrump, things change. Humgrump has gotten ahold of the very book they are inhabiting and can manipulate it by sending Jot out into the real world to his monsters.

  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  is a very meta-heavy game that breaks reality and traditional gameplay boundaries alike. It’s a lot to take in initially, even though the game could be described as
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  meets
  <em>
   Paper Mario
  </em>
  . For those struggling to get the hang of
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire

  , here are some
  <strong>
   useful beginner tips

  that can help make the process easier.

  Those new to top-down action games like this are in for a treat in the assist features department. Players can choose from two different difficulties at the start: Adventure Mode and Story Mode. It’s recommended to begin on Adventure Mode because the combat is not too challenging. Players can also change difficulties in the options at any time.

 <p>
  Better yet, the assist options can truly turn Jot into a godlike hero. Players can increase how high he jumps during platforming segments and stop certain platforms from falling apart. There’s also an option to make Jot invulnerable to damage and make his sword powerful enough to kill enemies in one hit. If players are having trouble with
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  , these options are certain to make things easier.

 <p>
  There is another assist-like option in
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  that some may not realize is there. The game will routinely switch up gameplay with what it calls mini-games. For example, the first one players will encounter is a boxing match in the style of
  <em>
   Punch-Out!!
  </em>

 <p>
  There’s also a fish-catching game, a turn-based RPG, an on-rails shooter with arrows, and the list goes on. Players can opt out of any mini-game in the menu with a single click, and they should exercise their right to do so if they ever feel stuck.

  There is one primary source of income in
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  via light bulbs. Since the game thrives on ideas, these light bulbs could be perceived as the personification of said ideas. Light bulbs can be obtained from slaying monsters or cutting down bushes, and players should be avid about doing this.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Trees can also be whacked, not chopped down, but sometimes they will produce more than a light bulb. The other big non-currency-based collectible in the game is art scrolls. While they do not add to the gameplay like upgrading Jot’s power, they are fun to collect and will offer some behind-the-scenes information. Thrash, Jot’s friend, for example, started as a human before he was turned into a mountainous troll.

 <p>
  The biggest reason to collect lightbulbs as soon as possible is because that’s how players can upgrade Jot. There is a traveling vendor in
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  who will update her inventory depending on where players are at in the game and what they have previously purchased. For example, the first thing players should buy is called the Sword Throw Badge, which allows Jot to throw his sword.
 </p>

 <p>
  After that is unlocked, an upgrade will appear. This upgrade will allow players to throw the sword through enemies. The upgrades after that get even more complex, which is also true for the game’s other Badges. Thankfully, these Badges don’t have to be equipped, unlike accessories in other RPGs.

 <p>
  Most progression in
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  will be through turning pages in the book. Sometimes, Jot will be stopped on his journey to retrieve an item from the desk in the real world, like a glove that can tilt the book. When story beats like this get introduced, something will change on the desk beyond the normal mission.
 </p>

 <p>
  Players would be wise to check back with the desk often for secrets or just bushes that regrow, which can be cut down again. Again, gathering lightbulbs is important, and sometimes, the supply can be limiting depending on where players are at in the story. Players need to use every trick in the book to gather resources whenever possible.

  As great as the difficulty modes, assist options, and the skippable mini-game button are, there is something that can’t be toned down at all: the puzzles. That said, they shouldn’t be too challenging if players think critically. Between using stone blocks to hold bridges down or using words to open gates,
  <em>
   The Plucky Squire
  </em>
  gets creative as a puzzle game. If players do get stumped, Minibeard will typically be nearby to give some cryptic advice.

 <p>
  Players should resist asking him for clues, though. This simply comes down to the satisfaction that comes with solving a puzzle on one's own. Also, if players get stuck with a puzzle because of a glitch, they should know how the save system works. There are only auto-saves, but players can revert to earlier saves in the menu if they wish. If a glitch becomes an issue, players should back out to the menu, rewind to an old save, and then try a new approach.

      <title>Baldur's Gate 3: Best Armor In Act 3 &amp; How To Get Them</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  When players reach the third and final Act of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </strong>
  </em>
  , they can expect to explore a sprawling city, interact with scores of interesting characters, and engage in the toughest fights they have yet encountered. Thankfully, to help them in combat, they will also find the best gear in Act 3, including weapons and armor.
 </p>

 <p>
  While there is some great armor in Act 2 that can be used at first in Act 3, players will typically want to find upgrades for the closing stages of the game. The best armor has unique effects on top of a high Armor Class (AC), which means enemies will have to get incredibly lucky with their rolls to hit. Players will also want to know where they can find the
  <strong>
   best armor in Act 3
  </strong>
  , and for some items, certain decisions must be taken.

  The best Medium Armor in Act 3 of
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  is arguably the
  <strong>
   Flame Enamelled Armor
  </strong>
  set which comes with a slew of bonuses. With increased Initiative, players are more likely to have their turn earlier, an aspect of combat that should not be overlooked. With Fire Resistance and help with Saving Throws, players will also be more durable.

 <p>
  Best of all is the Fire Shield spell, which reduces incoming Cold damage, but more importantly, can deal a high amount of Fire damage to melee attackers. To find Flame Enamelled Armor, players will need to loot a chest in the corner of the Wyrm's Rock Fortress armory. This is the room southeast of the waypoint in Wyrm's Rock.

   Robe of the Weave

  is naturally the best in Act 3 for most players. With an extra 2 AC and heals on Saving Throws, it is great for any character to wear, but naturally best for spellcasters who can make use of Arcane Enchantment.

 <p>
  In terms of visuals, which are more important when strutting around the streets of Baldur's Gate, this robe may look bland at first, but with the right dye it can be completely transformed. To find the Robe of the Weave, head to Ramazith's Tower, and locate it behind a Globe of Invulnerability. A See Invisibility spell can be used to reveal a lever which will open up this Globe.

 <p>
  If players have an assassin build or anything similar that deals melee Piercing damage, then the
  <strong>
   Bhaalist Armor
  </strong>
  set is an absolute must. This is due to the Aura of Murder, which will make nearby enemies take twice as much Piercing damage. Combined with some of the best One-Handed weapons in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  ​​​​​​, such as Daggers or Shortswords, serious damage can be dealt.

 <p>
  The only downside to Bhaalist Armor is that those aiming for an honorable playthrough won't be able to acquire it, as players must accept Bhaal and become an Unholy Assassin at the Murder Tribunal. If they do so, the armor will then be sold by Echo of Abazigal.

   Helldusk Armour
  </span>
  is widely considered one of the best endgame Armor pieces for
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  , and despite being Heavy Armor, any character can wear it. It has the best AC of any Armor in the game, whilst also granting Fire Resistance, immunity to Burning, and reducing all incoming damage by 3.

 <p>
  Enemies will also end up Burning if they cast a spell that the wearer saves against. Last of all, players are also able to fly wherever they like while wearing this Heavy Armor. To obtain Helldusk Armor, players will need to defeat Raphael in the House of Hope. This location is only reached by performing a ritual in the Devil's Fee shop.

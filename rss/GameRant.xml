   <strong>
    Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord
   </strong>
  </em>
  has 18 skill trees for players to level up and choose skills within. As you reach certain level thresholds, you'll get one skill point to use between two skills. Most skills have two parts, one that buffs the player and one that buffs your party or the settlements you own.

  All skills have multiple benefits, making it difficult to pick which is best. As in-game years go by, priorities will change, and you'll need different benefits than the ones your current skills offer; that's where respecing comes in.

Once talking to the Tournament Master, exhaust all his dialogue options to get new ones that will always appear when coming back.

  <strong>
   Respecing doesn't refund any Focus Points
  </strong>
  put into a skill, and gives players back the full amount of skill points for that tree. After paying the gold, players can go back to the skill tree to see all points refunded and can spend them however they want on that tree. Aside from the cost in gold, there is no downside to respecing, so players should do so often to make the most of the benefits based on what they are currently trying to achieve in the game.

  Just like your character, you can respec the skills of any skill tree for your companions. The only catch is that your
  <strong>
   companions will need to be in your party
  </strong>
  , which can be difficult to recall them if they are leading their own party or caravan. Respecing for a companion follows the same process, you'll just select that the teaching is going to a member of your clan instead, then select which companion you want to respec.

  Companion skills are a great way to make up for the skills you had to skip over with your own character. While companion skills aren't always the exact same as the player, there are many opportunities to get the benefits of two skills for your party that you'd normally need to choose between. Using respecing, you can pick the opposite skills for a companion to maximize the benefits to your overall party.

      <title>Grand Theft Auto 6 Ever Being Delayed Would Be Troubling for One Big Reason</title>

 <p>
  The widespread anticipation surrounding
  <em>
   <strong>
    Grand Theft Auto 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  is unlike anything the gaming industry has seen for a very long time, with the title finally feeling within reaching distance for fans. After a wait for the project that has lasted over a decade, the confirmation of the game's 2025 release window has caused the surrounding excitement to skyrocket, with fans counting down the days for the next trailer or update from Rockstar.

 <p>
  Despite the buzz and positivity surrounding
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  , it is no secret that the game has already faced a lot of high-profile setbacks, and the concept of a delay to
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's release date is something that is not completely outside the realm of possibility. Of course, this would be devastating and would stand as one of the most high-profile delays in gaming history, and the ramifications for Rockstar and fans would go beyond the initial disappointment of the news. The modern landscape of the AAA gaming industry has seen massive releases take extremely long times to release, and a delay to
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  could have a direct impact on the future of other influential Rockstar IPs like
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  .

  Thankfully, there is no current indication that
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  will face a delay to its current 2025 release window, but it is not that uncommon for games as expansive and ambitious as
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  to go through some major hiccups in their development process. Many were worried about how the high-profile leaks for
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  that occurred in September 2022 might impact the development of the game, but it seems likely that Rockstar has already factored this into its aims for a 2025 release.

 <p>
  While the excitement around
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  is still something to be enjoyed, the 12-year wait that fans will have experienced when the game launches is a worrying testament to the future of AAA gaming. Fans only had to wait five years between
  <em>
   GTA 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  , for example, and the growing scale of Rockstar sequels is seeing this downtime between releases increase at a worrying pace.

 <p>
  It is not foolish to imagine that the wait between
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  and the next franchise title could be close to 15 years or beyond, and any delays that might impact
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's release would have a domino effect that would only increase the probability of these massive wait times. Following the usual pattern of Rockstar releases, it is likely that the studio will turn its attention to another franchise following the release of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , meaning that a delay to the project would also have an impact on the likes of a potential
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  With Rockstar firmly focused on
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  as things stand, there are no other projects that are confirmed to be in development at the studio, but a delay to
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  would absolutely impact the start and eventual release of any future games. While a lot of fans debate whether Rockstar will even pursue
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 3
  </em>
  , the studio could easily branch out to new IPs like it has in the past, and a slower roll-out of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  will only hurt the chances of these projects getting the resources they need any time soon.

  If
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5
  </em>
  is anything to go by, then
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  will also be the subject of extensive and lengthy post-launch support in the way of updates, multiplayer content, and, unlike its predecessor, potentially even
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  story
  <em>
  </em>
  DLC. A delay to the release of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  will only slow the implementation of any post-launch plans that Rockstar might have for the title, taking resources away from future Rockstar titles for an even longer time. As things stand,
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  seems on track to meet its 2025 release window, but a potential delay would impact all of Rockstar's future endeavors, while worsening the worrying wait times that fans face with modern AAA releases.

      <title>6 Games With Great Final Bosses That Are Also Very Easy</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  There are certain conventions that are a given in most video games: levels to complete, puzzles to solve, and bosses to defeat. With the latter, players that push through to the final act are usually greeted with
  <strong>
   a climatic clash against the big bad
  </strong>

  There's no feeling quite like overcoming an all-powerful evil and saving the world, knowing that it's taken everything to reach this point, and finally seeing the end credits. However, there are some final bosses that, while epic in their own right, are also fairly easy to best. Whether this is by design or by accident, here's a rundown of some great final bosses that are a little bit of a pushover.

  After having Link run all across Hyrule (or Termina) gathering countless MacGuffins, solving puzzles, and conquering dungeons, players usually face Ganon (or some incarnation thereof) at the end of their adventure. And while this final clash echoes through the countless ages of Hyrule's convoluted history, it's rarely as challenging as it should be. A prime example is the fight against the green-skinned Gerudo king at the top of Hyrule Castle towards the end of
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  The first phase is essentially a rematch against Phantom Ganon from the end of the Forest Temple (which does make sense). After playing the world's most dangerous game of tennis for a while, Ganondorf transforms into the duel-wielding pig demon monster fans know and love. But even then, the fight is as simple as lobbing Light Arrows at him until players can retrieve the Master Sword to finish the job. The music, however, is phenomenal.

  When it first released for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube back in 2005,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  was met with critical acclaim right out of the gate. Players guided special agent Leon S. Kennedy and his impeccable hair through a spooky Spanish village on a mission to rescue the main reason everyone hates escort quests: Ashley Graham, the President's daughter. Standard action hero stuff, with mutating parasites thrown in for good measure.

 <p>
  At the end of this horrifying journey through the backwoods, Leon comes face-to-face with the mastermind of the Los Plagas plot: Saddler. While his design is fittingly grotesque, the fight itself is a little underwhelming. There's lots of space to move around and avoid attacks, while the version of Saddler Leon faces doesn't really live up to the hype of his cutscenes. Nevertheless, players who conquered this mass of razor-sharp flesh were rewarded with a Jet Ski escape sequence that puts James Bond to shame.

  "Would you kindly?" Those three words echo in the minds of every player who's ever ventured beneath the waves to the underwater city of Rapture. These rusted and crumbling tubes filled with monstrosities and mutagenic sea slug juice harbor plenty of twists and turns, but none more so than the final reveal. The man behind all the events is not in fact the misguided visionary Andrew Ryan, but his nemesis, Frank Fontaine.

 <p>
  Posing at first as a "kindly" Irish chap guiding the player through the submerged art deco labyrinth, Fontaine shows his true colors towards the end of the game's final act — and they aren't pretty. The primary one is the bright blue of his now plasmid-infused godlike form. The final fight, however, is decidedly less Biblical. Avoid his attacks and shoot him with the Chemical Thrower loaded up with Electric Gel. That's all there is to it.

  Creator of all things bright and beautiful, as her henchman Lars puts it, Natla is the smug, self-satisfied mastermind behind the events of the original
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  . With the remastered trilogy now available, revisiting the crumbling ruins as a fresh-faced Lara Croft feels exactly like it did the first time players picked up the twin pistols back in 1996. That includes the final boss fight against Atlantis' erstwhile queen.

 <p>
  After reaching the Scion at the top of the final act's massive golden pyramid, Natla appears and does the standard villain thing of revealing all — before plummeting to her supposed death and leaving Lara at the mercy of a terrifying mutant with no legs. After that horrific encounter, all that's left to do now is escape, right? Wrong. Natla is in fact alive, now sporting bat wings in her true Atlantean form. While putting her down is a satisfying end to this first romp, the fight mainly consists of jumping around to avoid her attacks. That said, it brings the story full circle, and seeing Natla finally match the monstrosities she's been creating makes this a poignant encounter.

  At the end of a long journey, where love, loss, betrayal and revelation have dogged every step, the melancholy twinkle of "To Zanarkand" plays across the ruins of an ancient city. Reaching the end of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  is an emotional roller coaster, especially considering the challenges Tidus and his band of morose misfits (except Rikku) had to conquer to get here. Now, at the end of the story, players come face-to-face with Sin, humanity's eternal punishment for their hubris and misuse of Machina technology. Upon Sin's defeat, the party ventures deeper inside the colossal magical whale monster to discover the truth.

 <p>
  Sin is basically just a suit of armor protecting the real antagonist, Yu Yevon. Players might have expected this final battle to be against a master Summoner in his prime, but instead they fight a weird beetle thing accompanied by two statues. To make things even easier, the party has a constant Auto-Life effect courtesy of the Fayth that prevents wiping, and Yu Yevon's only attack is Gravija, which can't KO anyone. Story-wise, it all makes sense. In terms of gameplay though, this climatic encounter pales in comparison to the threat originally posed by Sin itself. All the player needs to do is cast Zombie, and Yu Yevon will kill himself with Curaga.

  The Chosen Undead's long and arduous struggle against the horrors of Lordran culminates in one last duel with the big guy himself: Gwyn, Lord of Cinder. In the story, this lightning-imbued god was the impetus for all the events leading up to this point, and the fight serves as a poignant clash light, dark, and the inevitability of change. Humanity will prevail, and the Abyss of Man will swallow the world — unless players choose to link the Fire and start the whole cycle over again.

 <p>
  Stepping into the final boss arena feels epic. It's an enormous, burnt-out kiln covered in ash, and the deranged Hollow form of Gwyn immediately charges forward. And then, here at the end of all things, it comes down to simply parrying him to death. His attacks are slow, well telegraphed, and predictable, making him one of the easiest bosses to counter. But this design choice serves a purpose in the story: it's supposed to be easy. The Lord of Sunlight is no more, his power is spent, and all that's left is to put this shell of a god out of his misery.

  is teasing a brand-new area players will be able to explore in Natlan, showing off an underground location filled with magma and burnt trees.

  The addition of Natlan is set to bring a plethora of unique environments for players to explore following its launch. Leaks have already begun to show off some of the major settlements in Natlan, with the first character teaser trailer giving an early idea of Natlan's in-game map. The region is also expected to receive multiple expansions throughout the updates following its release, with map updates leaked for both Versions 5.1 and 5.2. Natlan has also been teased to boast a plethora of hot springs through previous dialogue from
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  's NPCs.

 <p>
  New locations to explore are expected to be joined by plenty of new characters added to

  's roster during Version 5.0. HoYoverse recently revealed the first three characters from Natlan to join the game's playable roster, with Mualani and Kinich set to be added as five-star units while Kachina will be a four-star character. Natlan will also feature another member of the Fatui Harbingers playing a major role, with Il Capitano teased to be a major antagonist within the region's main story. Only a few weeks remain before
  <em>
   Genshin Impact

  players can finally take their first steps into Natlan.

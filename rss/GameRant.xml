  Hideo Kojima shared some interesting insights regarding the development of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
   </strong>
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
  </em>
  was a PlayStation Portable title that launched way back in 2010. Following in the footsteps of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops
  </em>
  , the classic
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  title continued Big Boss' journey as he set out running his own mercenary unit in Colombia. It was believed that the game was originally intended to be the fifth main line entry in the series, and though that was not the case when it was released, Kojima has stated that it was once the plan.

 <p>
  Hideo Kojima has shared many tales regarding the development of the portable title. A news report told a story of one thing Kojima regretted about
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
  </em>
  , which aturned out to be a song that he originally wanted to use in the game. It seems that the highly-regarded video game designer had more interesting anecdotes regarding the development of
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  On Twitter, Hideo Kojima shared a story of how
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
  </em>
  was supposed to be the fifth mainline entry in the franchise. Envisioning the game as
  <em>
   MGS5: Peace Walker
  </em>
  , Kojima mentioned that his vision was to introduce a proprietary engine into the game. While the Fox Engine has since been dropped by Konami, it did become part of a few games made by the company.

 <p>
  Kojima continued by saying that
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  was intended as a transitional evolution for the
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  franchise until the engine was completed. However, the proposed
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5: Peace Walker
  </em>
  title faced strong opposition from overseas marketing. This is why the team decided to drop the numbered title, while also lowering the target age range of possible players.
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5
  </em>
  eventually came out as
  <em>
   MGS5: The Phantom Pain,
  </em>
  complete with the envisioned Fox Engine. And while there have been differing opinions regarding the reception of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
  </em>
  , many consider the fifth entry to be a solid game.

  Kojima had previously hinted via Twitter that
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
  </em>
  was meant to be read as
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid V
  </em>
  instead, so it's possible that there really hasn't been a fifth entry in the series. With
  <em>
   Phantom Pain
  </em>
  completely reinventing the
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  formula, it's possible that Kojima still considers
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  the fifth mainline game personally. And with
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  rumored to be part of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 2
  </em>
  , it's clear just how much value the game holds in
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  's mainline continuity.

  A dedicated level 50
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  player recently caught an incredibly rare Sewaddle. The
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  player's Sewaddle is not only the shiny version of the Pokemon, but also manages to have perfect stats, increasing its rarity and making it what the community calls a 'shundo'.

 <p>
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has garnered a large following since its release in 2016, with many players becoming incredibly dedicated to the Pokemon catching mobile game. With many updates through the years,
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  has a wealth of content available to its community alongside several milestones that are only available to the most dedicated players. One of these includes reaching level 50, something that takes an insane amount of hours and requires players to earn a ton of XP. Although
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  players that reach Level 50 have often caught nearly every type of Pokemon the game has to offer, the aspect of luck and RNG in the game causes some players to go a long time before catching rare Pokemon.

 <p>
  This is exactly the case for Reddit user Fantastic-Street-954 and one of their more recent
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  catches. The level 50 player caught a shundo Sewaddle, which is already rare to find in the game. However, this was the first shundo that this player had ever encountered, despite catching over 203,000 Pokemon within their game. The Pokemon was made even rarer, as the Sewaddle was also a lucky Pokemon that had been obtained from a trade with a friend, something that is relatively uncommon for players to encounter due to RNG and requirements for lucky trades.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  player's shiny Sewaddle also comes with another layer of rarity to it. The player appears to have caught this Sewaddle during the game's recent Community Day on October 5th. This Community Day was the first time that Pokemon GO players could get shiny Sewaddle or any of its evolutions within the game. This makes the player's shundo Pokemon even more rare, as this was the first time that this type of catch could even happen for Sewaddle.

  Although Sewaddle's Community Day has passed and the chances of finding a shiny Pokemon like this are slimmer, there are still ways that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon GO
   </strong>
  </em>
  players can find rare Pokemon within the game. With the current Max Out season in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , players still have a ton of future events to participate in, several of which offer featured Pokemon and increase their encounters in the wild alongside their chances of being shiny.

      <title>Survey Shows Single-Player Games Are Still Extremely Popular</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/single-player-games-popular-more-live-service-less/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Midia Research conducted a survey showing that 53% of people prefer single-player titles. Although this might seem obvious to gamers, there are plenty of factors that suggest games that a focus on multiplayer aspects might be even more popular. Apart from the social aspect that makes those types of experiences look like they've drawn larger followings, the potential commercial viability of live-service multiplayer gaming has allured many companies.

  It's been increasingly difficult for companies to remain supportive of endeavors that lack some sort of multiplayer experience. This is because of the way that live-service and multiplayer titles have been dominating the space and because they serve as a consistent source of revenue. Games like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  are massive successes, after all, pulling in unprecedented amounts of profit. However, just because some kinds of titles make more money doesn't necessarily mean that everyone prefers to play them.

 <p>
  A survey by data analytics company Midia Research shows that 53% of gamers prefer single-player video games compared to live-service titles. Midia Research has not made clear the exact sample size of its study. However, it is known that the company conducted Q1 2023 and Q1 2024 surveys for groups in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Poland, Turkey, and South Africa. Midia has asked a diverse range of people about their gaming habits and attitudes, and a majority of them prefer single-player titles, with examples being
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom
  </em>
  and more recent popular releases like the instant-hit
  <em>
   Black Myth Wukong
  </em>

 <p>
  Midia's study notes that games like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  are exceptions to the rule of the live-service games gold rush. Referring to the situation as "a zero-sum game," it's clear that many companies want to chase the success that those games seem to have set a standard for. Despite this, there are plenty of examples of why that chase is not always worth the trouble.

   Concord
  </em>
  is a notable failure because of how many resources were pumped into the game in contrast to how small of an audience it attracted, but Midia specifically points to titles like
  <em>
   Anthem
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Babylon's Fall
  </em>
  , which some have already forgotten.

  Midia Research's report emphasizes the consequences of companies partaking in trend-chasing as an attempt to replicate impressive sales, calling it an "opportunity cost." It points out that gaming is a volatile market, and taking risks in an "oversaturated space" can prove reckless. Still, not all single-player games are sure to be hits either.
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  failed to meet sales expectations, and they're single-player games with devoted followings. Even if companies choose to make singleplayer games that a slight majority of consumers would rather play, those games will also be met with tough competition.

  Though the heyday of survival games may be behind us, there are still many great games out there worth trying. Luckily, these games are usually fed updates long after they first release, with some becoming truly great in the meantime.

  Whether it's games that have enjoyed a rare but well earned redemption story, or games that came out solid and only got better with the years, these are some survival games that are well worth trying today.

  As a relative latecomer to the boom of survival games in the early 2010s,
  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  had a lot to prove to stand up to its mighty competitors. It excelled in almost every way with a genuinely unique combination of naturalistic horror of the elements mixed with brutal survival needs due to the freezing temperatures.

  Add to that an impressive wildlife system with deadly wolves that have a bad habit of striking down good runs quick if the player isn't ready to fend them off and a distinct art style,
  <em>
   The Long Dark
  </em>
  is well worth playing today with a host of new updates and brilliant expansions boasting quality of life improvements and ever more variety in the maps and gameplay.

  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  has had a long and rocky road to the top of the survival pile. Starting originally as an
  <em>
   ARMA 2
  </em>
  mod,
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  could be credited alongside
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  as being one of the major reasons why the survival genre got so popular in the first place with incredible organic multiplayer experiences and brutal difficulty that never holds the player's hand (though there's plenty of great tips to help a new player get started).

  In 2018,
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  finally released from early access and into a fully fledged game of its own. Despite a somewhat rugged reputation based on its buggy early access version,
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  has persevered into being the premiere zombie survival experience with new maps that continue to prove the developer's skill at crafting realistic and engaging theatres for firefights with humans and zombies alike.

  Where
  <em>
   DayZ
  </em>
  popularised the zombie genre, it's probably fair to say that
  <em>
   Rust
  </em>
  focused much more on the human side of the equation, developing a reputation for some of the funniest and most toxic players in gaming.
  <em>
   Rust
  </em>
  is a survival game in the typical style, but it has a heavy PvP focus as players compete for resources and space using all the expert knowledge they've accrued over the game's life.

  What results is servers full to the brim with interesting social dynamics. Some servers have generated entire towns where non-aggression pacts are in place, where other servers are complete manic free for alls where anything goes and blood is always being spilled. These days, it's reached maturity, and if a player is able to find a server and community that fits them, there's few better pleasures than a good game of

  While
  <em>
   The Forest

  made a big splash as one of the best horror survival games when it first released,
  <em>
   Sons of the Forest

  iterated on everything that came before and created an experience almost unanimously beter in every way. Taking place on a strange island filled with cannibals and mutants informed by in-depth AI systems, the player must find shelter and gather up the best items in the game to survive the forest-born creatures.

  For some, this sounds too similar to
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  , and that much is true. Not a lot has changed about the fundamental formula at all. However, if a player bounced off

   The Forest

  back when it first released and hasn't tried out the sequel yet, they really should.

  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  was pioneering in a lot of ways, but perhaps none so meaningfully than developing the video game redemption story that has single-handedly turned its reputation around. Once considered a total disaster upon its release, the development team has toiled away on the game nonstop since release and are still releasing updates that improve the game with every patch.

  No one would blame a player for staying away from

  because of the justifiably negative press on its release, but if they're ever looking for a new survival experience but unsure where to go, now is the time to give

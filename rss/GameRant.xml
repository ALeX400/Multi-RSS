      <title>How to Perform Every Animality in Mortal Kombat 1 (Video Guide)</title>

  Although many are looking forward to sinking their teeth into the new story expansion, the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </em>
  </strong>
  player base is seemingly a lot more excited about the return of Animalities. These fan-favorite finishers have become a staple of the series over the years and are now available to all
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  players regardless of whether or not they purchase the Khaos Reigns DLC.

  As the name might suggest, Animalities see
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  kombatants transform into an animal or insect to finish off their foe. Every playable character has their own Animality, meaning that as of the time of writing, there are 32
  <em>
   MK1
  </em>
  Animalities for players to learn. The following guide has button inputs for every single one of them as well as a video showing what they all look like.

   The fourth Kombat Pack 2 Kombatant is finally upon us, and with it comes a brand-new finisher. To celebrate the occasion, this guide has been updated to include Ghostface's Animality, which sees the iconic Scream killer transform into a vulture and peck his opponent to death. In addition to the button inputs needed to perform the Animality, players can also find a link to a video showing what it looks like in action.

  It has been a long time coming (and it's still not here), but it has finally been confirmed that
  <strong>
   <em>
    World of Warcraft
   </em>
  </strong>
  will be receiving player housing in its
  <em>
   Midnight
  </em>
  expansion. During
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  's recent 30th Anniversary Direct, Blizzard teased the feature, as well as the
  <em>
   Midnight
  </em>
  expansion itself, but somehow managed to give very little information about it otherwise. Nevertheless, it's possible to speculate on what
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  's highly requested player housing feature will bring to the table, especially given what Blizzard has revealed about it.

 <p>
  There is currently not very much info to go on when it comes to
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  's player housing, save for what can be assumed based on the trailer's footage. That being said,
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  fans are likely in for a treat once the feature finally launches, which will presumably be next year with the release of the
  <em>
   Midnight
  </em>
  expansion.

  Blizzard Wants Players Involved in the Development of Player Housing

 <p>
  Blizzard was rather coy with its
  <em>
   World of Warcraft: Midnight
  </em>
  player housing tease during
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  's 30th Anniversary Direct, but there was a reason for that. Specifically, the developer intended to be as cryptic as possible in order to pull players into the development process for the feature by encouraging them to talk about what they would like to see from it. While Blizzard clearly already has some thoughts of its own, it plans to use player feedback as a well of thoughts for it to pull from while it continues developing the feature.

 <h3 id="wow-midnight-39-s-player-housing-will-be-a-central-feature">
  WoW: Midnight's Player Housing Will Be a Central Feature
 </h3>
 <p>
  What Blizzard has made clear about
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  's upcoming player housing in the same interview is that it will be a central feature of the
  <em>
   Midnight
  </em>
  expansion. While it's currently impossible to know just how "central" player housing will be to the expansion, there are several implications that can be drawn from that statement. Namely, it's likely player housing will be directly involved in the main quest line for
  <em>
   World of Warcraft: Midnight
  </em>
  , and it's possible the expansion's player housing feature could serve as a base of sorts for players to work from.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":468} -->
 <p>
  It could be possible that
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  's player housing will function similarly to garrisons in the
  <em>
   Warlords of Draenor
  </em>
  expansion, which were essentially player-built and managed bases located in Draenor, intended to serve as a personal hub. Within their garrisons, players could arrange their layout with a variety of buildings, each of which provided unique benefits, such as crafting bonuses and follower missions. Player housing in
  <em>
   World of Warcraft: Midnight
  </em>
  could function the same way, although that would likely receive backlash from fans for being too similar. It's assumed that Blizzard knows this, however, and that player housing will go in a direction more akin to the same feature in other MMOs like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  .

  Players Should Be Able to Decorate Their Homes in WoW: Midnight's Player Housing
 </h3>
 <p>
  Whilt it hasn't been outright confirmed, players will presumably be able to decorate their homes using
  <em>
   World of Warcraft: Midnight
  </em>
  's player housing feature. The teaser trailer for
  <em>
   WoW: Midnight
  </em>
  showed a character walking into his home, which had walls adorned with trophies and ornaments to display his achievements. As such, players will likely be able to decorate their homes as they see fit with the prizes they've obtained on their adventures. It's unclear whether
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  's player housing will feature homes of different sizes and shapes, or whether players will be able to change the color and/or material of the house. However, given the player housing in many other MMOs,
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  players can expect the same.

      <title>Pokemon Sleep Reveals New Year 2025 Event Plans</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Sleep
   </em>
  </strong>
  is ringing in the new year with a special event that offers increased encounter rates with almost all Pokemon that have appeared in the game throughout 2024. The developers of
  <em>
   Pokemon Sleep
  </em>
  acknowledge that the start of a new year can be a difficult time to maintain a regular sleep schedule, and they're hoping this special event encourages its users to get plenty of rest.

  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fans have been playing
  <em>
   Pokemon Sleep
  </em>
  since the middle of July 2023, with a staggered release schedule that saw it launch in different regions around the world over four separate days. The mobile-only title uses a phone's microphone and other internal workings to determine the length, quality, and type of a player's sleep, offering a daily report showing different rewards based on a player's sleep experiences.
 </p>
 <p>
  With 2025 just days away, the
  <em>
   Pokemon Sleep
  </em>
  official website has unveiled plans for its two-week-long New Year 2025 Event, which is scheduled to kick off on December 30, 2024. This event will be split into two weeks, with the second half running from January 6-13, 2025. There will be plenty of bonuses for players using the mobile app during the event, with greater appearance rates for almost all Pokemon introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon Sleep
  </em>
  during 2024 being chief among them. The roster additions from 2024 will be split into two groups corresponding to the two weeks of the event, so players who have missed out on a specific Pokemon will want to watch the schedule to see when their elusive encounters will show up.

  Players will find all these Pokemon scattered across the games' regions regardless of the sleep type they experience, but their numbers will only appear in increased numbers in the regions that they typically occupy. While players are free to explore any region in the game during the event, six Pokemon — Dratini, Ralts, Stufful, Aron, Shinx, and Grubbin — will only appear on Greengrass Isle, so players hoping for an encounter with those Pokemon should keep an eye on that region.

  Unfortunately for the players who have missed out on them, the Legendary Pokemon introduced in
  <em>
   Pokemon Sleep
  </em>
  during 2024 are the only ones exempt from boosted encounter rates during this special event, so anyone hoping to run across Entei, Raikou, or Suicune will still only have about a one in 500 chance of seeing them in their report. Still, the event promises other rewards, like a 50 percent boost to candies gained during week one, a 25 percent increase to a Pokemon's main skill triggering during week one, and a 50 percent Dream Shard increase in week two.

      <title>MultiVersus Has a Ton of DC Character Opportunities Coming Up in 2025</title>

 <p>
  Although it's already composed of Warner Bros.' vast roster of characters from its multitude of properties,
  <strong>
   <em>
    MultiVersus
   </em>
  </strong>
  has some excellent character addition opportunities ahead in 2025. With a few hot releases on the way this coming year,
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  simply has to look at the studio’s upcoming pictures for inspiration.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  Of course,
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  should look at established franchises when considering character addition. After all, the game has historically done this for both new characters and maps. Therefore, the most likely character additions from 2025 projects are characters from established franchises like the DC Universe.

  The recent trailer for James Gunn’s
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  has received a rapturous reception from fans and critics alike. While the trailer displayed beloved characters like the Man of Steel himself, Lois Lane, and Lex Luthor, the sneak peek also showed off characters that the average viewer might not know, like Guy Gardner.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  is arguably one of the highest anticipated blockbusters of 2025. With its marketing campaign already trickling into the public consciousness, it’s clear that
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  will likely receive a big advertising push as the film’s release date approaches. Because of this ramped-up anticipation and marketing, it would be unsurprising to see new
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  content, specifically themed to the new Gunn-led DCU, in video games. This means that
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  could use the new 2025
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  film to its advantage, by adding new content through the game based upon the movie.

 <p>
  As part of
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  ’s promotion, maybe David Corenswet’s portrayal of the character will become available as a skin in
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  , but more interestingly, Superman could be accompanied by character additions. Due to the variety of variants that the DC universe has, adding any characters from DC automatically gives most of these characters the opportunity for skins in
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  . For example, Lex Luthor could be introduced to
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  because of Gunn’s Superman film, featuring a
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  (2025) variant specifically as further justification.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lex Luthor would be one of the better character additions from
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  (2025) because of his status as Superman’s main nemesis. While Lois Lane is an iconic character, Lex Luthor has a stronger skill set for
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  ’ fighting game content. Because of his importance in the DC universe and his immense power, he would be the best character addition to market the upcoming blockbuster.
 </p>
 <h3 id="the-superman-movie-could-be-good-news-for-green-lantern">
  The Superman Movie Could Be Good News for Green Lantern
 </h3>
 <p>
  Warner Bros. could also use
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  as an opportunity to introduce Guy Gardner to a larger audience. Guy Gardner is one of many Green Lanterns and a member of the Green Lantern Corps. The average movie-goer likely correlates Hal Jordan with Green Lantern, as he’s the Lantern with the most depictions in pop culture, so
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  might want to split the difference between the two characters. Alongside a proper induction of Hal Jordan’s Green Lantern as a character in
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  , Guy Gardner could be included as a variant skin in the game to market
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  (2025).
 </p>
 <p>
  These are just a few examples of characters that could be introduced to
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  thanks to James Gunn’s upcoming
  <em>
   Superman
  </em>
  . The film won’t just establish a new era for DC films and Warner Bros. Studios, but could usher in a new era of character additions and variants for
  <strong>
   <em>
    MultiVersus
   </em>
  </strong>

      <title>Battlefield’s Commander Feature Was Ahead of Its Time, and BF6 Should Prove It</title>

  Each
  <em>
   <strong>
    Battlefield
   </strong>
  </em>
  entry has tried to add at least one major new feature to the series, often to mixed success.
  <em>
   Battlefield 2142
  </em>
  took players into the future,
  <em>
   Battlefield: Bad Company
  </em>
  introduced realistic environmental destruction,
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  doubled down on that with its Levolution system,
  <em>
   Battlefield 1
  </em>
  added Operations mode, and
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  added Specialists.
 </p>

 <p>
  These new features have often been a good way to refresh a familiar formula, but they can sometimes change that formula a bit too much. After
  <em>
   Battlefield 2042
  </em>
  's identity-altering changes, many fans want
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  to feel like a return to basics. But that doesn't mean it should completely forget some of the franchise's best additions over the years, and there's one past
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  mechanic that deserves a revival.

  Battlefield's Commander Mechanic Explained
 </h3>
 <p>
  2005's
  <em>
   Battlefield 2
  </em>
  was the first entry in the franchise to include the "Commander" mechanic. In this first iteration, one player on each team would take on the role of Commander. As a Commander, players could access a unique overhead map, issue specific orders to teammates, deploy powerful Commander Assets like artillery strikes, and start voice chats with squad leaders to better direct them in battle.
 </p>
 <p>
  To become a Commander, players would need to apply for the position at the start of the match. The player with the highest experience would be picked. Players could also exit the Commander's overhead map at any time and join the action themselves. The Commander feature returned in
  <em>
   Battlefield 2142
  </em>
  , where it was virtually unchanged aside from a few Commander Asset changes to reflect the futuristic setting.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Commander feature then disappeared for seven years, before finally returning in 2013's
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  's Commander mechanic carried forward many of the same gameplay features as its previous iterations, though players who took on the role of Commander were no longer able to participate in the battle themselves. Another major change in
  <em>
   Battlefield 4
  </em>
  's Commander mode was that players could use a mobile companion app to control the game, using touch-screen controls to issue orders and deploy Assets.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-battlefield-6-could-revive-commander-mode">
  How Battlefield 6 Could Revive Commander Mode
 </h3>
 <p>
  Generally speaking,
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  's Commander mechanic was a nice inclusion, offering experienced players a brief change of pace that still felt impactful. It would be nice to see this Commander mechanic return in
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  , though it might need a few tweaks to feel properly rewarding.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important change
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  's Commander mechanic would need to make is to allow players to participate in the battle themselves rather than view the action via an overhead map, similar to
  <em>
   Battlefield 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2142
  </em>
  's version of the mechanic. This is where a new mobile companion app could come into play, letting Commanders quickly issue orders and deploy powerful Assets via a tablet or phone, then get back into the action straight away on the TV screen or monitor.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some improved incentives would also be nice to see if
  <em>
   Battlefield 6
  </em>
  resurrected the series' Commander mechanic. For instance, players could be encouraged to take on the demanding leadership role if it offered exclusive cosmetic rewards such as a unique skin, dog tag, or emblem. Similarly, Commanders could be given an in-game bonus, such as increased health, thus giving them a slight advantage and encouraging them to continue being an efficient leader.

If you've visited some campfires in the game and seen NPCs playing soothing tones on a guitar, the game lets you do that too. Players can find a guitar of their own quite early on, which can be used either while sitting at campfires or simply when out in the world.

  Picking up the guitar will add it to your items, but won't take any space or add any additional weight to your character.

  Once you've acquired the guitar in
  <em>
   Stalker 2
  </em>
  , playing it is quite simple. Open up your weapon radial by pressing "
  <strong>
   Tab
  </strong>
  " on the keyboard or "
  <strong>
   LB/L1
  </strong>
  " on your controller, then press the "
  <strong>
   G
  </strong>
  " key or the "
  <strong>
   RS/R3
  </strong>
  ." Pressing the guitar prompt will start an animation where Skif will sit down and hold the guitar in his hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  A new wheel will appear towards the right with different notes that you can play on the guitar. You'll have to select one note at a time from the wheel to allow Skif to play that note on the guitar. You can also press the "
  <strong>
   LB/L1
  </strong>
  " or "
  <strong>
   Tab
  </strong>
  " key to swap scales, which will allow you to play additional notes on the guitar.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of playing the guitar wherever you like, you can also choose to visit a campfire in the world. Once you've found one, simply sitting down in it will show up as an option for you to play the guitar. This way, you'll be able to play the guitar for your fellow stalkers who've joined you around the campfire in

  In this section, you’ll find yourself on the other side of the ocean. The aim is to rescue a child and get past another giant door. Here’s what to do:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Turn the boat to the south and dock at a
   <strong>
    submerged building
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Rotate the gear to the right, stand on the movable block with two red circles, drag it to the right, step forward, and wait until the child reaches the other side of the landmark.
  </li>
  <li>
   Once done, move the gear back to its original position and enter the
   <strong>
    dark door
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   On the other side, climb the stairs and activate the floor button. Once the child enters the top door, a big submerged gate will spawn.
  </li>
  <li>
   Head back to the Boatem and ride it through the gate.

  In the third part, Noor needs to unite the child and her sister and lead them out of the dangerous area. Here’s how to do it:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Dock the boat at the
   <strong>
    southern building
   </strong>
   where the child is standing.
  </li>
  <li>
   Drag the movable wall downward, then pull up the other wall with the floor button. Stand on the movable ledge and pull it up. This will make the child press the
   <strong>
    first-floor button
   </strong>
   on the right, blocking her way back.
  </li>
  <li>
   Take the second movable wall down to align it with the lower platform. Stand on the
   <strong>
    second floor button
   </strong>
   , move the wall up, and activate the
   <strong>
    third button
   </strong>
   at the top.
  </li>
  <li>
   This will clear the way for the child’s sister. Return to the Boatem, dive to where the sister is, and take her to the starting building.

  After Noor saves the town’s citizens and passes through the doorway, a cutscene plays. It shows Noor and the two citizens traveling across the ocean on the Boatem. The boat begins to crumble, and the environment grows darker. Suddenly, a massive fish leaps out of the water and swallows them whole.

  In this last puzzle of level seven, you’ll need to make your way out of the fish’s stomach. Here’s how to do it:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Rotate the gear to the right until the ledge passes through the portal and aligns with the platform where you and the two sisters are standing on the right side. Step onto it together.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pull the block with
   <strong>
    tiny circles
   </strong>
   upward and turn the gear to create a path to the structure above. Step onto the new path and
   <strong>
    activate all three buttons
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   A door will open on the left side — get inside with the sisters.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finally, you’ll spot a
   <strong>
    movable cube-shaped block
   </strong>
   in the center. Adjust it until it forms a complete path. Hop onto the boat with the citizens to end The Torrential Parting puzzle in
   <em>
    Monument Valley 3
   </em>
   .

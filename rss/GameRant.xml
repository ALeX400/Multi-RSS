  An
  <em>
   <strong>
    InZOI
   </strong>
  </em>
  player online has been dealt a massive surprise by the game after going away from their keyboard for just five minutes. This hilarious
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  moment raises big questions, and could have big implications for their character's personal storyline.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  is fresh out the gate and has already proven to be massively popular on Steam. With obvious comparisons drawn to
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , players are really starting to dive deep to see exactly what is possible in
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  . This level of freedom could determine how much staying power the game has once the initial hype dies down. While some players might be confused about what to do first in
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  , it's the depth beyond these early moments that will help the game really challenge
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  in the life simulator genre.
 </p>
 <p>
  Redditor celestinemuse shared an image of their
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  character in jail, after having left them to their own devices for just five minutes. According to the player, their Zoi was asleep when they left them, leaving them to wonder about what mischief they got up to in their absence. This was celestinemuse's first experience finding out that
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  actually has a jail feature, which only added to the confusion. However, this allowed them to learn a little more about the game, also figuring out that there's a way to break out of jail in
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  .

  InZOI Player Goes AFK, Gets Taken to Jail
 </h2>
 <p>
  Other players in the thread also shared similar stories of their Zois getting themselves jailed without player intervention, with one specific gamer telling the tale of how their character took it upon themselves to shoplift in the game. It's not clear if this preference for crime is an
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  glitch, but it's hilarious to think about, nonetheless. In games like
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  , players take their characters' storylines seriously, so something like a stint in jail is something that could affect this massively.

  It will be very exciting to follow how
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  develops throughout the rest of the year. The game's Early Access tag earns it some leeway for what some are describing as a lack of depth, with the expectation that plenty more features will be added in future updates.
  <em>
   InZOI
  </em>
  's post-launch roadmap suggests big things to come in 2025, with all DLC confirmed by Krafton to be free until the end of Early Access.

      <title>Helldivers 2’s Gunslinger Armor Passive is a Godsend for Secondary Weapons</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-gunslinger-armor-passive-secondary-weapons-sidearms-good/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  As new weapons and items are introduced to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  via Premium Warbonds, it has become increasingly clear how paramount armor passives are.
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  infamously does not feature transmog, and allowing players to see what armor each teammate is wearing can be great intel for particularly keen Super Earth citizens who wish to know what loadouts and passive buffs others may have equipped.
 </p>

 <p>
  For example, the FS-55 Devastator heavy armor features the Fortified passive, which reduces recoil when crouching or prone by 30% and provides 50% resistance to explosive damage, while the AC-2 Obedient light armor features the Acclimated passive, which provides 50% resistance to fire, gas, acid, and electrical damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ’s gear is still almost wholly centered around fashion rather than stats and yet, with new and phenomenal armor passives debuting, it may be hard to overlook how overpowered they can be. That’s doubly true regarding the Borderline Justice Premium Warbond as its exclusive armor features a passive that will prove to be highly inspiring for anyone who is quick on the draw with a preferred secondary weapon.

  If any players have been partial to a secondary weapon rather than their primary or throwable,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ’s Borderline Justice Warbond is more than a mere tribute to popular gun-toting cowboy/outlaw motifs. Indeed, Borderline Justice’s GS-17 Frontier Marshal medium armor and GS-66 Lawmaker heavy armor feature the Gunslinger passive with the description as follows:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Increases sidearms reload speed by 40%.
  </li>
  <li>
   Sidearm draw/holster speed increased by 50%.
  </li>
  <li>
   Sidearm recoil reduced by 70%.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="helldivers-2-rsquo-s-gunslinger-passive-makes-good-sidearms-even-better">
  Helldivers 2’s Gunslinger Passive Makes Good Sidearms Even Better
 </h3>
 <p>
  Borderline Justice’s LAS-58 Talon is quite a phenomenal way to introduce this passive as it resembles a traditional break-action revolver, albeit with heat/lasers instead of bullets, as it falls beneath the ‘special’ category of secondaries. The
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="640128" style="color: #9242ff; ;">
   <img loading="lazy" src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/05/helldivers-2-p-4-senator-2.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22"/>
   P-4 Senator
  </span>
  , however, is a heavy armor-penetrating ‘pistol’ revolver with manually reloaded individual rounds.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either way, secondaries have a tremendous amount of potential with the Gunslinger passive, whether players are taking advantage of a greater reload and draw/holster speed or a reduced recoil. This could logically be a game-changer for anyone who has had the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink" data-id="653927" style="color: #9242ff; ;">
   <img loading="lazy" src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/05/helldivers-2-gp-31-grenade-pistol-2.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22"/>
   GP-31 Grenade Pistol
  </span>
  equipped since the Democratic Detonation Warbond as firing grenades at bug holes can be challenging amid a chaotic swarm of Terminids, for instance, and even though the Talon doesn’t need to be reloaded as long as players are mindful of their heat sink rate it is still incredibly valuable being able to draw it instantaneously from a prone state when primary weapon ammunition has recently been exhausted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the Gunslinger passive won’t affect players who deprioritize secondary weapons in their loadout, let alone players who prefer how another armor looks. Likewise, the fact that the Frontier Marshal and Lawmaker armors are medium and heavy may be too unacceptable for light armor enjoyers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  perpetually asks players to consider what is fun or optimal against different enemies and on different planets, and with a superb buff for sidearms it won’t be surprising if players elect to wear the Frontier Marshal or Lawmaker armor when they plan to lean heavily on a secondary weapon. Meanwhile, helmets and capes are free to be worn purely for their cosmetic aesthetic with no passives associated with them. It’s ironic, too, because Borderline Justice’s booster, Sample Extricator, is awfully underpowered in comparison.
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  has abundant build diversity, and it’ll be interesting to see how future sidearms may be complemented further by the Gunslinger armor passive.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has shared a brilliant way to keep one's entire wardrobe on-hand. This idea could prevent
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  players from missing out on equipment bonuses and showing up for cutscenes in a less-than-ideal outfit.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  has a surprising number of outfit pieces for players to put together, with some requiring complex steps to acquire the ingredients and craft the clothing. The game also features a number of accessories and gear that can help to boost a
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  player's stats, making it easier for them to find useful items in the mines, survive onslaughts of enemy attacks, or simply cast illumination around them so they don't get lost after nightfall.
 </p>
 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's limited inventory system, carrying many pieces of clothing and accessories, whether to quickly change one's appearance or to improve situational stats, simply isn't very practical. Enter longtailedmouse, who shared their idea on how players can work around this. They explained that rather than carrying individual items, they instead stowed everything that they needed in one of the game's dressers, and then put that into their inventory. The dresser only takes up one slot no matter how much is stored in it, and if it's set down, players can access it just like they can at home, pulling out or storing anything the dresser can ordinarily hold.

 <h2 id="stardew-valley-players-are-impressed-by-storage-idea">
  Stardew Valley Players Are Impressed By Storage Idea
 </h2>
 <p>
  Numerous gamers have shared how impressed they are with this idea, and several are planning on using it themselves. Even with all of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  's backpack upgrades, managing storage space can be difficult, so anything that helps with that aspect will likely be smiled upon by the community at large. However, there is a caveat. Players pointed out that gamers who use this technique should be careful, as NPCs that collide with solid objects while walking around generally destroy them. If the dresser were destroyed, everything within it would be lost, so players should exercise caution when using it and not leave it out of their sight in the game's world.

  Another player built upon this idea even further, explaining that they also use the dresser for this purpose, but stow the dresser away in a

   Junimo Chest

  when not in use. Junimo Chests have a shared storage system, allowing farmers to place one, fill it, and then access it from almost anywhere by placing a second Junimo Chest at the player's location. However, acquiring Junimo Chests requires Qi Gems, so this particular solution may be better for players that have already progressed further into the game.

 <p>
  Falling in love and getting married is one of the best features in
  <strong>
   <em>
    InZOI
   </em>
  </strong>
  , as it will add some elements of realism to the game. Falling in love requires interactions between two Zois where you build their relationship until, eventually, one of them proposes. It doesn't have to be a household member since any random Zoi will do.

  Like most other simulation games, players can plan a wedding in

  and take care of all the small details to have the perfect event. However, there are a few steps you need to complete before even beginning to think about the wedding, like building a friendship with the Zoi, falling in love, and dating.

  Upon meeting the Zoi you wish to date, the first step is to build a steady relationship with them. Try to chat frequently using positive interactions under certain categories like Humor, Affection, Chitchat, etc. Once the friendship bar is half full, you can start using some actions under the Romance category. Things will be slow at the beginning, but players should unlock more actions the more they interact with the desired Zoi.

  Once any of the relationship meters are full, you will get special dialogue options to progress the relationship either positively or negatively.

Choose the desired Zoi, the place, the recommended and prohibited actions to complete the planning.

It might not go smoothly at first, and the Zoi may get rejected, so try to increase the romantic and friendship relationship further before proposing again.

  Once the wedding begins, there are some scripted actions you need to do to have the perfect wedding. The other list of actions is optional, and it includes both the newlyweds and other guests to make the event feel more realistic. It is highly advised to
  <strong>
   go through the scripted actions in the given order
  </strong>
  , otherwise, the Zois might get stuck, and you will have to use the Emergency Rescue cheat. You can press on each action or choose to let them play in sequence. The order is:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Thank Guests for Attending Wedding.
  </li>
  <li>
   Prepare Officiant Speech.
  </li>
  <li>
   Walk Together Down Wedding Isle.

  Godlike beings are intimidating to encounter in any video game, with their divine power either aiding or abetting the player during their journey. Thankfully, there are times when players are allowed to control certain gods to make things easier for themselves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gaming has its fair share of male gods that have become mainstream in their own right. These deities are standout characters in their respective games, with players loving any interaction they have with these imposing figures.

  Garland's evil knew no bounds, to the point where he traveled back in time after his loss at the hands of the Warriors of Light. The darkness in him manifested to give him the form of Chaos, an evil god hell-bent on ruining humanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  After eradicating the four elemental fiends, the Warriors of Light must travel back in time for one final encounter against Chaos. It's a cinematic and engaging battle that makes for a bombastic finale to the original game.

  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  surpassed expectations to become a worthy entry in the series, featuring its fair share of memorable companions. This includes Solas, an elven mage with a mysterious past who reveals his identity at the very end of the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  He turns out to be the trickster god Fen'Harel, making him perfect as an antagonist for the sequel. So, it's a shame that his role was diminished greatly in
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  since that took away from the impact he could've had after this reveal.

  The mad jester Kefka is one of the greatest
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  villains of all time, revelling in his chaos and having no qualms about disturbing the balance of the Warring Triad. After the world was thrown into a state of ruin, Kefka decided to absorb the power of this divine trio to ascend to godhood.
 </p>
 <p>
  He might be a pseudo-god, but that should take nothing away from his power. The Light of Judgment he uses to oppress his rebellious subjects displays the sheer power he wields. Players must ascend to the heavens in an epic final battle before finally taking on this heartless angel and beating him once and for all.

  The lore of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  is fascinating and a huge reason why fans love this series to bits. The series features its fair share of divine deities, with Vivec being perhaps the most notable god in the series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fans of
  <em>
   Morrowind
  </em>
  who reached the city named after this deity could unlock a high-level locked door to seek an audience with this god. While he played a role in the story, fans loved how rewarding it felt to come face-to-face with this divine being who wowed players with his overbearing presence.

  Ever since the final scene of 2018's
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  , fans couldn't wait for Kratos and Thor to duke it out. Their first encounter is a riveting one where Kratos is whittled down, showing the gulf of power between the duo.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the course of
  <em>
   Ragnarok
  </em>
  , Thor is painted in a somewhat sympathetic light, making fans resonate with his struggles. This is what adds a ton of depth to his eventual rematch with Kratos, which culminates in a tragic finale after Thor angers his father and refuses to obey his command.

  The protagonist of
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  is a rebellious kid who wants to escape the Underworld and meet his mother by any means necessary. This prompts a daring escape that is repeated numerous times as Zagreus strives to meet Persephone and convince her to come to the Underworld.
 </p>
 <p>
  Zagreus takes a while to grow on players, who love his determined attitude and the interactions he has with the denizens of the Underworld. Watching him get strong enough to beat his father makes for an amazing achievement after seeing the many struggles he had to overcome beforehand.

  Raiden is one of the most iconic video game characters of all time from the very moment he was introduced in the first
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  game. This god of thunder boasted powerful moves and could decimate most enemies with ease.
 </p>
 <p>
  He serves as the protector of Earthrealm and guides the heroes in their battles against fearsome foes. While he does get corrupted in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 11
  </em>
  , it doesn't take long for the thunder god to regain his senses and join the side of good once again.

  Kratos is a legendary video game character who needs no introduction. The cheers that accompanied his return made it clear that this
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  is a beloved deity whom fans love to control as he slices and dices his way through his foes.
 </p>
 <p>
  While his character was a bit one-dimensional in the original
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  trilogy, the reboot and its sequel did a great job of humanizing Kratos' character. Watching him realize that he could become a benevolent god makes for a beautiful way to end his adventures in Norse mythology.

  Since the optional bosses can be skipped, they are a bit weaker than those who are included in the main story. Naturally,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  players will have a tougher time dealing with them. In Chapter 2, they will face
  <strong>
   Tiger Vanguard
  </strong>
  , one of the hardest bosses in the game. Beating this Yaoguai King is certainly a challenge, but it's one that players have to overcome at all costs.

  The
  <strong>
   Tiger Vanguard
  </strong>
  is located in the
  <strong>
   Crouching Tiger Temple
  </strong>
  . Players can reach it after
  <strong>
   defeating the King of the Flowing Sands and the Second Prince of the Flowing Sands
  </strong>
  . After beating the duo, take a left and keep going until you reach the
  <strong>
   Valley of Despair

  . From here, the path is fairly straightforward, and players should be at the
  <strong>
   Crouching Tiger Temple's Keeper's Shrine

  The Tiger Vanguard is extremely agile and can easily obstruct any long combos. So, it is better to keep your attacks short, as it will allow you to get out of the way of any dangerous strikes.

 <p>
  The Tiger Vanguard uses a four-attack combo that can be annoying to deal with. It may seem that it ends at the kick, but as players draw closer, the Yaoguai King will jump in the air and throw his body at them. It is better to keep some distance and dodge whenever he falls. As he lies on the ground, attack him repeatedly, and just as he is about to get up, use Immobilize. Keep hitting him until the spell's effects wear off.

 <p>
  Another thing to remember while fighting the Tiger Vanguard is that he can use his sword as well. He performs a combo with it, which ends with him taking a massive swing that sweeps anything nearby. It is better to dodge these attacks and create some distance between the Destined One and the Tiger Vanguard.

 <p>
  Sometimes, the Tiger Vanguard will charge with his sword. Whenever he tries to execute this attack, dodge towards the enemy, and it should keep you safe from any damage.

  The biggest problem that players will have while fighting the
  <strong>
   Tiger Vanguard
  </strong>
  is his ability to turn his body hard like a rock. Whenever he uses this ability, he will not take any damage. Additionally, if players hit him during this time, they will be stunned, allowing the Tiger Vanguard to counterattack. As long as players avoid any critical hits and adhere to the steps, they should be able to beat the Tiger Vanguard. Subsequently, they will obtain the Rock Solid spell.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Visions of Mana
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the first non-remake entry in the
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  franchise since
  <em>
   Heroes of Mana
  </em>
  in 2007, and thus it shoulders the responsibility of the myriad games that came before it, and the series' ensuing period of slumber.
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  fans can rest easy knowing that the IP has been faithfully modernized with this new release, and those unfamiliar with the games may find that
  <em>
   Visions
  </em>
  holds its own against other August releases.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  series has always stood out against its JRPG contemporaries, and
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  is no exception. Everything from its art design and music to its narrative suggests a far more quaint, almost fairy tale-esque experience, starkly contrasting the often edgy or dark stories in IP like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  . This more restrained and simple approach to both storytelling and gameplay may divide JRPG fans, as
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  sometimes struggles to find the perfect balance between wholesome and bland, especially in its opening hours.

 <p>
  But
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  is more than its narrative: it has a strong combat framework for players to dig into, though even this aspect isn't revolutionary. For the most part, the gameplay resembles that of the well-received
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  remake in 2019, centering on real-time combat that feels like a solid evolution of the series' SNES roots, for better or worse.
  <em>
  </em>
  Simply put,
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  is a
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  game, through and through, and it's this fact, coupled with a few miscellaneous quirks here and there, that will determine whether a player connects with it or not.

  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  follows Val, a 17-year-old boy endowed with the title of Soul Guard. Soul Guards are tasked with ushering Alms chosen by elemental spirits to the Tree of Mana, where they will ultimately sacrifice themselves to keep calamity from befalling their respective homelands. While this sort of compulsory human sacrifice will probably seem horrific to most players, the characters of
  <em>
   Visions
  </em>
  ' world don't view it as such: being an Alm is a sacred and prestigious duty, and many of the game's characters are actually excited by the prospect of laying down their lives for their compatriots.

 <p>
  It's this contradiction between
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  's cheerful tone and its undercurrent of darkness that makes the story intriguing. There's a constant sense of longing hiding beneath the surface of the game's saccharine presentation, with Alms and their loved ones casually speaking about plans for the future - plans that they know they will never have the chance to realize. Naturally, the plot thickens as time goes on, with events from previous
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  games being incorporated in unexpected, satisfying ways.

 <p>
  The concept behind
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  's narrative is unique, but its execution is lacking. For one thing, it's an incredibly slow burn, with there being virtually no stakes for the first several hours; there's no real 'hook' to the narrative, in other words. The
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  franchise is known for being somewhat quaint in nature, but
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  borders on boring at times.

 <p>
  This speaks to a broader issue of pacing. As previously mentioned, the story gets off to an extremely slow start, but rather than mounting its tension over time, it is sprinkled with occasional twists which, while often satisfying on their own, are followed by the story once again grinding to a halt. There's a real lack of momentum to the plot that can be disappointing, especially when the story shows glimpses of greatness.

 <p>
  Still,
  <em>

  's slow pace can make it a pleasant experience and a breath of fresh air for anyone burnt out on epic, high-stakes thrill rides. It helps that the game features a compelling and charming cast of characters, all of whom help flesh out

 <p>
  Like its story,
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  's gameplay is somewhat conservative when compared to other AAA RPGs. It's the most expansive game in the
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  series, though it is still linear for the most part. A good way to think about its map is as a dramatically pared-down version of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  's, where the world is broken up into several large, open-ended biomes, with controlled backtracking locked behind story beats.

 <p>
  Special credit has to be paid to
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  's environment design. Although its various zones are far from complex or inventive from an exploration or traversal standpoint, they are gorgeously realized. Each area has a distinct visual identity, and clever use of lighting and particle effects make for striking landscapes that are always a pleasure to immerse yourself in. Indeed,
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  is regularly stunning.

 <p>
  While the game's individual biomes are aesthetically spectacular, the same cannot be said for the gameplay opportunities they provide. The
  <em>
   Mana
  </em>
  franchise isn't known for its side content, but
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  makes an attempt to expand the series' formula with a greater number of side quests. In some ways, it perhaps would have been better if the game didn't feature such distractions at all.

 <p>
  Side content in
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  feels like an afterthought. Nearly all the side quests are some variation of a fetch quest, or they simply have a "go here, defeat this enemy" structure. Proper quest chains are few and far between, and the narrative premises for all of them are so mundane and inconsequential that they are easily forgotten. Rather than fleshing out the game's world with colorful characters or interesting lore, side quests are closed circuits, tasking the player with retrieving some unimportant resource in exchange for resources that are never in short supply otherwise. Put simply, there's no real reason to engage with
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  's side content, and completionists are likely to find these offerings trite and repetitive.

  The game has a few miscellaneous oddities that should be pointed out as well. Small quirks like being unable to double-jump in towns, or how walking will inconsistently cancel special actions in combat, can be frustrating and confusing. Even smaller warts, like being barred from pausing the game and interacting with objects for several sections after combat encounters, or the prevalence of invisible walls in open-world zones, pile up to make
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  feel somewhat unpolished at times. These shortcomings are far from deal-breakers, but some players may have a lower tolerance for them than others.

  It can take a while to get going, but once

  demo often remark on how sluggish its combat feels, and while this holds true in the final product, it's not too hard to get used to the slower pace. Combat is less about lightning-fast reaction times and more about clever use of abilities and, perhaps most crucially, build-crafting.

  's class system manages to do something incredible: present JRPG veterans with a truly unique progression model. Instead of choosing a single archetype at the start of the game, each playable character has access to a grand total of nine different classes, unlocked throughout the story as the player collects Elemental Vessels, which each grant access to new classes adhering to the following elements:

 <p>
  While each of these elements, alongside each character's starting form, is technically tied to individual classes, the variation between them isn't extremely noticeable most of the time. All characters have three different playstyles/weapon types, which are each connected to three of the elemental classes and offer the most significant mechanical distinction. From there, each class has its own progression tree, with the equipped class simply changing what stats and perks the player has access to.

 <p>
  Like with many things in
  <em>
   Visions of Mana
  </em>
  , it sometimes feels like this class system doesn't reach its full potential. It offers some room for player expression, but the changes in stats and perks are too small and simple to encourage experimenting with different elemental combinations or party compositions. Perhaps fewer elemental classes, with more variety between them, would have made for a more exciting gear and upgrade pipeline. That said, this approach to classes isn't bad by any means, and it's nothing if not original.

 <p>
  As far as crime-focused games go, few are more influential or visible than Rockstar's
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  franchise. The series has had the category in a chokehold since its first release in the late 90s, and its status as the top dog in the industry is set to receive another boost with the highly anticipated
  <strong>
   <em>
    GTA 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  scheduled for arrival late next year. Along its path to becoming a household name in gaming, many components have become synonymous with the franchise. From the story of the purple-coded Ballas gang to the vast offering of vehicles on land, sea, or air, the focus in
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  games has long rested in the power of its narrative and vehicles. However, with the wait for
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  marking the longest stretch without a new title, other mechanics like combat might be under scrutiny.

 <p>
  As the
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  reveal trailer underscored,
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  is mired in crime, a lens that shines through in its historical missions in
  <em>
   Vice City
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   San Andreas
  </em>
  , sending players to rob influential characters and even invade heavily guarded military installments. These feats are achieved with the help of an assortment of weaponry ranging from RPGs and bazookas to more traditional tools. Where some franchises tend to err on the side of realism, Rockstar doesn't emphasize this in
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  , as can be evidenced in the many epic shootouts where the protagonist survives the assault of an entire police department. With
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's Bonnie and Clyde-esque narrative coming into play, the developer faces the question of rocking the apple cart of combat.

 <p>
  It's been 11 years since
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  made its earth-shattering debut, and in that long stretch, the status quo for shooters has gone through many changes. While
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  isn't primarily described as a shooter franchise, guns go hand in hand with virtually every mission, so it stands to reason that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  should be subject to the same rules as the likes of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  . With that in mind, logically,
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's first order of business should be to shore up its combat options.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  However, that contrasts with the
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  fans have gotten used to over the years. Hand-to-hand combat, for instance, hasn't posed much of a challenge to any of the franchise's protagonists. Few -- if any -- NPCs are capable of resisting and returning the player character's blows with equal capacity, making for brutal and largely uninteresting beatdowns. From the example of heavily guarded military bases, it's unclear whether
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  would feature a similar location, but it makes sense for trained troops like police or soldiers to pose more of a challenge combat-wise.

  A Revamped Combat System Could Be All GTA 6 Needs to Thrive
 </h3>
 <p>
  Likewise, gunfire might need some sprucing up in the face of higher-quality competition from shooters.
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  have dominated the space so far this year, and their shooting mechanics (especially that of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  ) are a blueprint for newer games to follow because of the realistic aim focus. By contrast, the most memorable
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  games don't require much thought or deliberate action in aiming. That stance has served the franchise well in the past, since many other fun components make up for the lack of realism.

 <p>
  The question Rockstar has to answer in
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is whether it places its stock in the "fun" unrealistic status quo and goes harder into its vehicular offerings, akin to
  <em>
   GTA 5 Online
  </em>
  , or takes the route of modern games and updates its gun and combat physics. Given
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's rumored Bonnie and Clyde premise, who, according to legend, were quite adept at handling guns, adopting more realism in its shooting mechanics wouldn't be out of place. Going down this new route would help provide a measurable amount of shock factor that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  needs to stick its landing, so it might be worth Rockstar heavily investing in this component to bring it up to speed.

  Earning the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  Endowment Bowl rewards is a straightforward process that doesn't involve loading into any
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  matches. All viewers need to do is tune into the broadcast on
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's official Twitch channel (taking place on
  <strong>
   August 28
  </strong>
  ) and watch for the specified time that corresponds to each reward.

 <p>
  After watching the broadcast for at least two hours, players must
  <strong>
   claim the rewards within 48 hours
  </strong>
  after the action comes to an end. Once redeemed, all of the rewards will be available to use in
  <em>

 <p>
  It can be incredibly fun to download movie stars into a Sims game, as they can show up as neighbors or be added to a household for players to include them in their families. Dinner with Brad Pitt or a day out with Scarlett Johansson can become a reality when playing around with movie stars in
  <em>
   The Sims
  </em>
  , making for some cute and sometimes hysterical situations.

  The internet’s favorite actor Keanu Reeves has various Sim recreations in the
  <em>
   Sims 4
  </em>
  gallery, but this version of him by Simmer EmmzGee is one of the best.

 <p>
  This Keanu is based on his most recent look, complete with a beard and shaggy dark hair. Fans of the video game
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  are sure to enjoy this Sim, as this Keanu has his Johnny Silverhand style going on.
  <em>
   John Wick
  </em>
  fans will enjoy him for the same reason. All they need to do is pair him with a canine companion, and he’ll make for the perfect John Wick recreation.

 <p>
  Much like Keanu Reeves, Ryan Gosling also has various Sims based on him in the gallery. This version from SirSIM is scarily accurate, perfectly recreating the actor's facial features, such as his sharp nose, blue eyes, and even his stubble.

  Playing Ken in the movie
  <em>
   Barbie
  </em>
  is one of Gosling’s most ridiculous and fun roles, so it could make for some interesting

  games to pair him with a Margot Robbie Barbie Sim, some other Ken Sims, and a Barbie Dreamhouse house (and a horse, of course).

  Tom Holland stole the hearts of Marvel fans around the world when he became the latest actor to portray the cinematic version of Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so it’s no surprise that there are more than a few Tom Holland Sims in the gallery.

 <p>
  This Sim version of the British actor- made by Simmer Katrina9T9T- is one of the best, excellently re-creating Holland’s facial features and quaffed Peter Parker hairstyle. He wears a red shirt, too, which is a nice nod to the Spider-Man/Peter Parker role that made him such an iconic actor.

 <p>
  Disney actress turned A-lister Zendaya has so many different Sims available in the gallery, but most of them require quite a few packs to download them completely. For players looking for an accurate Zendaya Sim without buying multiple packs, this version by shadean1382 is the perfect choice.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  This Zendaya Sim only needs the free
  <em>
   Holiday Celebration
  </em>
  pack to download entirely, which is probably why she is such a popular choice, with over 10,000 downloads. Despite not needing any packs, the Sim still looks exactly like the actress, which is a testament to the talent of Simmer shadean1382 who made her.

 <p>
  This would be a great Sim to pair with the aforementioned Tom Holland Sim, as the two actors are in a relationship in real life and Zendaya played MJ to Tom’s Peter Parker. There is plenty of Spider-Man role-play to be had when teaming her up with the Tom Sim.

  Emma Watson has lots of Sims in the gallery as both her and her infamous
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  character Hermione Granger, so players have plenty of choice. This version of her was made by Simmer spirirock, and it has been fantastically made. Emma’s features are so well-made here. Even the littlest details are finely crafted, such as her freckles and her thick eyebrows.

  Players could use the character purely as an Emma Watson Sim, or they could transform her into Hermione by pairing her up with some other Harry Potter characters or actors if they prefer this version of her to the other Hermione or Emma Sims currently available in the gallery. Although there are plenty of well-made Emma Watson Sims in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  gallery, this version is certainly at the top end of the scale.

  Much like Tom Holland and Zendaya, Chris Evans is another actor best known for his role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chris played Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America for eight years in the MCU, though he also played Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in the 2000s
  <em>
   Fantastic Four
  </em>
  movies. As is to be expected after playing such iconic roles, there are tons of versions of Chris in the gallery, but this take on him from Darth_Geno is by far one of the best.

 <p>
  This Sim of Chris captures his facial features perfectly, taking inspiration from his beard years during the
  <em>
   Avengers: Infinity War
  </em>
  era. Not only does the Sim look just like Chris, but it also captures his cool and casual fashion with a burgundy leather jacket, blue jeans, and brown leather boots. Chris Evans fans and Captain America fans alike are sure to want to add this Sim to their gallery.

  Veteran actor Morgan Freeman has starred in an array of classic movies, and now he can be added to a Sims game thanks to the aforementioned Darth_Geno. Morgan Freeman is a beloved American icon, whose infamous voice has become part of history, and he has been finely crafted with this Sim in great detail.

  From his freckles to his wrinkled forehead, crow's feet, and gray beard and mustache combo, this Sim is undoubtedly impressive. The idea of having Morgan Freeman wandering around

  Actress and philanthropist Angelina Jolie has an iconic look that has led many to consider her one of the most beautiful women in the world. It seems like it would be a difficult task to recreate such a stunning face, but Simmer gatorhum has managed to do so with this Sim version of Angelina.

 <p>
  The attention to detail and excellent recreation of Jolie’s striking features are highly impressive here, such as her large lips and small, narrow nose. However, gatorhum has also recreated her tattoos and given her some accurate accessories to make her all the more realistic. Fans of the actress are sure to want to download her in their
  <em>
   Sims

  file, but she is also a great choice in general for players looking to add some particularly pretty Sims to their game.

  The beloved American actress Emma Stone has been recreated perfectly with this Sim made by hellskyalone, making for one of the most impressive movie stars in the entire gallery.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Emma is known for often switching her hair color between red and blonde, but this version of her maintains her blonde hairdo. Some fans might have preferred her with her red hair, but that’s the only criticism that Simmers can possibly have with this recreation of her, as she has been so perfectly recreated.

 <p>
  The shape of the eyes, nose, lips, and even the eyebrow shape and freckles are all amazingly accurate to the real Emma Stone. It’s so well-made that it’s almost frighteningly realistic, so kudos to hellskyalone for truly capturing the essence of Emma.

  Narrowly beating out the Emma Stone Sim has to be this beautiful and crazily realistic take on one of Hollywood’s most iconic superstars: Marilyn Monroe.

  Marilyn was not only a movie star, but she was- and still is- a cultural phenomenon who has gone down in history as a spectacular and tragic icon. There are unsurprisingly plenty of Marilyn Sims in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  gallery, but this version of her by TheSimBoutique is absolutely phenomenal.

  Marilyn Monroe had particularly striking eyes due to their hooded nature, and this Sim is the only one that recreates her piercing gaze so perfectly. The Sim also has Marilyn’s infamous mole above her lip and recreates her makeup style and famous platinum blonde bob fantastically. The only inaccuracy is that her eyes are brown when in reality they were blue, but as she began her career in the time of black and white pictures, this isn’t too surprising as her eye color has always been a cause of speculation.

  For those looking to add a classic Hollywood starlet to their
  <em>
   Sims
  </em>
  game, this Marilyn Monroe Sim is the best choice, as well as the best movie star Sim currently in the gallery.

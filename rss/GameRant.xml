  First,
  <em>
   DDV

  fans will need to grab an onion. Onions aren’t in Storybook Vale, so you’ll need to head back to the original Dreamlight Valley. Go to the Forest of Valor, and buy onion seeds from Goofy’s stall for 50 Star Coins.

  You can use any spice you like for Spanakopita, so you have lots of choices. Some options in Storybook Vale include Lightning Spice, Ambrosia, Nutmeg, and Salt Crystals. Players can find Lightning Spice, Ambrosia, and Nutmeg in Mythopia, and Salt Crystals are found in Everafter.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-get-garlic">
  How to Get Garlic
 </h3>
 <p>
  Garlic can be found growing in a few biomes, such as Everafter, Forest of Valor, The Lagoon, and The Grove. Look for its nodes on the ground, and simply collect them to get garlic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you have collected all five ingredients, go to the nearest cooking station and toss them into the pot to make your Spanakopita. It can go for
  <strong>
   561 Star Coins
  </strong>
  at Goofy’s Stalls or you can eat it to get
  <strong>
   982 energy
  </strong>
  . In addition, if you're working on the Your Own Personal Hades friendship quest, this five-star dish is required to complete it.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon TCG Pocket
   </em>
  </strong>
  leak has revealed two new trading currencies. The feature is finally on its way to
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  , allowing players to trade cards with each other to complete their collections with the missing copies.
 </p>
 <p>
  The announcement of how the
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  trades will work finally came earlier this month, confirming previous leaks saying this feature will be restricted to cards of specific rarities. However, those leaks raised the possibility that the trades will have another related feature to allow players to exchange their cards. While it has long been speculated that shinedust would finally have some use beyond unlocking flairs and could be used in trades, the community now has information that points in a different direction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Twitter user PokeGirlLauren has revealed two new
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  currencies related to trading. One of them is a green hourglass, which, according to her, will be spent one unit every time the player makes a trade, working similarly to
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  's Wonder Pick. She adds that to make more trades, players will have to wait, with an hourglass being replenished every 12 hours. The other item, she says, is called “feature artwork tokens,” and the card rarity will determine how many players will need to make trades. However, it is not known how they will work, or how they can be acquired.

 <p>
  As with the limitations imposed by the official announcement of the details on trading, the leak of the current currencies has generated divided reactions. One concern in the community is that
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  's monetization will heavily limit players' access to these tokens. Other comments expressed surprise that Shinedust isn't the item used in trades, similar to how Stardust works in
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  . One particular Redditor speculates that, for them, the developers' idea is to make trading free while maintaining the incentive for players to keep opening packs, keeping both features engaging.
 </p>
 <p>
  For some time, players only knew that trades would arrive at the end of January, and now it has been confirmed by the devs that the feature will debut next Tuesday, January 28. The update comes in anticipation of the long-awaited second
  <em>
   Pokemon TCG Pocket
  </em>
  set that was recently revealed and will arrive on January 29. While the first set focuses on Pokemon from Kanto, the new set, "Space-Time Smackdown," will feature the monsters from Sinnoh, marking the debut of cards such as ex variants of the legendaries Palkia and Dialga.

      <title>PlayStation All-Stars 2 Could Thrive If It Follows in the Footsteps of One Massively Successful Release</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/playstation-all-stars-2-marvel-rivals-live-service-add-characters/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Thanks to the success of Nintendo's
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros
  </em>
  . series, many studios have been trying to get their own crossover fighting game.
  <em>
   Jump Force
  </em>
  tried to bring together anime characters,
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  is pitting iconic Warner Bros. IPs against each other, and the
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl

  series has put players in the shoes of all sorts of iconic Nickelodeon mascots. Back in 2012, PlayStation even tried one of its own with
  <strong>
   <em>
    PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale
   </em>
   .
  </strong>
  While nothing has been revealed yet, some fans have been clamoring for its return for years.

  ,
  <em>
   Sly Cooper

  , and
  <em>

  against each other across a variety of stages. What ensued was classic fighting game fun, but many critics also found it to be a bit lacking in content. There were not enough fighters or stages to choose from, and new content was not coming fast enough. If Bluepoint Games and Sony wanted to try the concept again, it would need to rectify that, and one of the best ways would be by following in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' footsteps.

 <h3 id="playstation-all-stars-2-has-countless-characters-it-could-tap-into">
  PlayStation All-Stars 2 Has Countless Characters it Could Tap Into
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has committed to releasing a brand-new hero every month and a half, which sounds very promising. The game already launched with over 30 heroes to choose from, so adding new ones at this rate means players have a lot of content to look forward to. If
  <em>
   PlayStation All-Stars 2
  </em>
  were to come out and want to keep its audience's attention, then it may need to do the exact same thing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sony has a massive library of IPs that it could pull characters from, giving the game the potential for so much exciting post-launch content. The original
  <em>
   PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale
  </em>
  already included iconic series such as
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Infamous
  </em>
  , and the studio could expand that with the likes of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , and even
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  . Additionally, it could branch out into the wider gaming world and give players access to even more iconic characters. As long as the game launched with a strong roster and the studio added to it on a pretty regular basis, it would have a shot at maintaining a consistent playerbase.
 </p>
 <h3 id="there-are-even-more-stages-waiting-to-shine">
  There Are Even More Stages Waiting to Shine
 </h3>
 <p>
  New playable fighters are great, but these types of games also need exciting stages for players to fight in. Luckily, all the franchises
  <em>
   PlayStation All-Stars 2
  </em>
  could pull characters from also have a plethora of unique locales that could make for fantastic stages. Players could fight through the streets of
  <em>
   Marvel's Spider-Man
  </em>
  's New York, compete inside a
  <em>
   Horizon Zero Dawn
  </em>
  Cauldron, and explore the massive galaxy of planets from
  <em>
   Astro Bot
  </em>
  . Just like with the characters, the studio could also expand its stages to dozens of non-Sony franchises, making for the ultimate video game-themed fighting game.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as the studio kept the content free,
  <em>
   PlayStation All-Stars 2
  </em>
  could become a massive success. Not only would it give players so much content to experience, but it would also be uncommon for a fighting game.
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
  </em>
  may have had purchasable DLC, but those fighters and stages were not released every month and a half. Alongside that,
  <em>
   MultiVersus
  </em>
  does not offer its new characters for free and games such as
  <em>
   Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl
  </em>
  had too few character additions.
 </p>

  If the studio was able to keep up the content stream and keep it free, then
  <em>
   PlayStation All-Stars 2

  could be a game-changer in the fighting genre. Of course, nothing has been announced yet, so a sequel may not even be on the horizon, but any shot at a sequel will definitely want to take some cues from
  <em>

  </em>
  going forward.

  Treyarch released a new
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  trailer with all-new gameplay of the new Zombies map "The Tomb," which is set directly after the main quest for the Citadelle des Morts map. The Tomb will be available at the launch of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 2, along with new weapons and gear.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the new Zombies map, the team of Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey must take their newly secured amulet to the cursed dig site and into the ancient catacombs, where the elusive Sentinel Artifact is believed to be hiding. Reports from The Tomb suggest that its depths are home to paranormal phenomena going back centuries, and deep in the depths of the Zombies map lies the Dark Aether Nexus, which is where Samantha Maxis is imprisoned. At the start of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  Season 2 on Tuesday, January 28, players will be able to explore The Tomb and progress the Zombies storyline.
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly released
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  trailer reiterates the team's mission to head toward the very bottom of The Tomb to retrieve the Sentinel Artifact. Along the way, players will fend off many waves of zombies that lurk in The Tomb map's many intricate areas. All players start at the Dig Site area and head into The Tomb, which has many traces of ancient cultures and civilizations in its depths. As shown in the trailer, The Tomb has a network of catacombs, known as the Neolithic Catacombs, that head down into the Ossuary and the Shrine of the Hierophants. Despite being centuries old and now overrun with zombies, The Tomb's shrines and treasures are in pristine condition. Perk-A-Cola machines can also be found throughout the many areas of The Tomb, with one being the returning Death Perception Perk-A-Cola from

  Players running down the dreary pathways of The Tomb will also notice traps along the walls, which can activate and damage zombies. Before long, players will fend off zombies in a massive cave containing the Subterranean Temple and Deep Excavation areas. These areas are very spacious and allow zombies to horde together, which is especially dangerous if they're led by a Shock Mimic. The Shock Mimic is one of The Tomb's new enemy types, and its razor-sharp claws can electrify unlucky players. It can also disguise itself as useful items or disorient players with its distortion camouflage. Fortunately,
  <em>

  </em>
  Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon makes a return in The Tomb, and it could prove useful against the Shock Mimic.

  The main quest for The Tomb will have players open the "Doorway to Nowhere," which leads into the Dark Aether Nexus. Only a few seconds of the area was shown in the latest trailer, but the few glimpses reveal a massive area full of spires and overgrown mushrooms. The Dark Aether Nexus likely serves as the final stop for the main quest, and players who have trouble getting there may want to try out Directed Mode in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , which helps guide newcomers through objectives.

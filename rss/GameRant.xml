  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet

  With the addition of the Teal Mask and Indigo Disk DLC, even more of these exclusive Pokemon were added into the game, giving Trainers an opportunity to encounter and capture them, as long as they meet certain requirements. If players are wondering how to encounter and capture Rayquaza in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet or Violet
  </em>
  , then the guide below can provide you with all of the information you'll need to successfully do so.

  When it comes to encountering and capturing Rayquaza in
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet
  </em>
  , there are a couple of prerequisites that Trainers must complete first. Most significantly, Rayquaza will not be available as a wild spawn until you obtain the Rayquaza Treat, which can only be acquired after defeating Terapagos.

 <p>
  Once you have beaten this Pokemon in battle or captured it, then you can speak to Snacksworth at Blueberry Academy and complete Burberry Quests to obtain the Rayquaza Treat. However, before being able to get to this step, you will need to have completed both the entire base game for
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet/Violet
  </em>
  as well as the
  <em>
   Teal Mask
  </em>
  DLC, as the Indigo Disk and encounter with Terapagos are locked behind these requirements.

 <p>
  After obtaining the Rayquaza Treat, Rayquaza will now spawn in the wild of the Paldea Region. At this point, if you haven't already done so, then now is the time to ensure you are fully prepared with a team for this battle, as well as stock up on extra Poke Balls if needed. After this, you can set out to find Rayquaza.

 <p>
  As seen in the map screenshot above, Rayquaza's spawn location is on top of the mountains that border Area Zero. To reach this location quickly and easily, fly to the Pokemon Center at South Province Area Three, and then use Miraidon or Koraidon to travel north, up the mountains. It may take a bit of searching, but if you mark the spawn point in the screenshot on your own map and then follow the marker, you should have no problems locating Rayquaza.

  <em>
   <strong>
    World of Warcraft: The War Within
   </strong>
  </em>
  is just around the corner, bringing with it exciting new zones. Each of these is full of new and familiar creatures, but most notable is the secret kingdom of Azj-Kahet and its featured raid. This area is full of nerubians, a race of spider-like creatures who have long haunted the minds of bug-wary players.

 <p>
  While it’s fair to say that most people find spiders and their ilk a little unsettling or creepy, some people are deeply affected by the mere sight of them. Arachnophobia is characterized by a serious and debilitating fear of spiders and other eight-legged creepy crawlies, one which can cause severe psychological discomfort and even lasting trauma. Luckily for these players,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  has provided an out.

 <p>
  It’s estimated that around one in twenty people suffer from arachnophobia, so immersing
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  ’s entire player base in a raid full of spiders could become a problem. Nerub’ar Palace, along with its surrounding zone, features arachnoid bosses and countless other spider NPCs, but The War Within’s new Arachnophobia Mode can change all that in a moment. It’s a seamless transition that works the same way many of the game’s toys do, but instead of changing everyone into corgis or gnolls for a giggle, this feature has a noble purpose.

 <p>
  Coming with the new expansion, this change is a simple setting that players can toggle to make most spider and nerubian models appear as crabs and similar crustaceans instead. This way, the NPCs can still keep their respective crawling animations but with ten legs instead of eight. It also applies to other players' arachnids in the game, namely spider mounts and pets, but this will likely become the case soon enough. Even spiders in old zones like Azjol-Nerub and Naxxramas have been serviced for this mode, since these areas are only meant to be creepy, not terrifying.

 <p>
  It might seem counter-intuitive to replace spiders with crabs, which are basically aquatic creepy crawlies, but there might be method to this apparent madness. In fact, kabouraphobia, or the fear of crabs, is far less common than a phobia of spiders, and exposure to crabs has been used to successfully desensitize arachnophobes and help them control their fears. So, not only is
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  not hurting arachnophobia sufferers, but it could even help them.

 <p>
  It’s not clear why crabs just aren’t considered as scary as spiders, but it could be for several reasons. Crabs only have two eyes, they move much slower, and they’re scavengers instead of hunters. Most of all, they don’t hide under people’s beds, behaving themselves by staying in and around bodies of water. Regardless of why, arachnophobes who play
  <em>
   WoW
  </em>
  can rest easy knowing that instead of facing freaky fangs, they’ll just have to deal with clicky claws instead.

 <p>
  Much like
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  ’s color-blind filters, Arachnophobia Mode is meant as a helping hand to a minority of players who could hugely benefit from just a few small changes to the game. Another example of this being implemented in Dragonflight was the addition of dynamic flight settings that help reduce motion sickness or disorientation in players. It shows how the game has tried to make itself more accessible to everyone, which can only be a good thing.

  The limited-time trial period for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  's newest support hero has ended, though the player base can expect to see her officially join the roster at the start of Season 12. From July 19-21, players had the chance to explore Juno's kit in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , which includes Martian Overboots, a Mediblaster, and Pulsar Torpedoes. As a highly mobile character who hails from a Martian colony, her backstory and utility have been garnering a significant amount of attention from the community.

  Despite being available for only three days, there's already been plenty of discussion about the forthcoming hero. As such, with Juno set to become
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  's twelfth support character, she's already shown great potential to shake up the support meta. Of course, while opinions on individual elements of Juno's kit may differ, as a whole, the community seems to appreciate the balanced nature of her abilities.

  Juno Is a Solid Addition to Overwatch 2's Support Roster
 </h3>
 <p>
  Many have described Juno as a blend of Echo, Lucio, and Ana, which makes her compelling for many reasons. She lacks CC or immortality abilities, but her unique movement, Hyper Ring, and ultimate, Orbital Ray, are valuable additions. It's worth noting that certain abilities, such as Suzu and Immortality Field, have sparked controversy for potentially being overpowered. Some players have labeled them as "bail-out" tools because they can often counter ultimate abilities, despite having shorter cooldowns, which might make them feel unfair. With ongoing debates about "power creeping" in the tank and support roles in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , Juno may be a breath of fresh air to some.

  Although it seems the Martian support hero could benefit from some quality-of-life improvements, her kit has been praised for its high skill ceiling and rewarding gameplay. Additionally, she offers a solid balance of healing and damage while simultaneously contributing utility to her team with Hyper Ring. The ability has a 16-second cooldown, but it offers several valuable advantages:

  With Juno's hitscan Mediblaster, she is far from defenseless, yet she remains highly effective at supporting her teammates. While it's still early to make any definitive claims, her healing output appears to be on par with Ana, Baptiste, and Kiriko. The latter are characters known for their ability to both deal significant damage and maintain their teammates' health.

 <p>
  Juno's defining weapon feature is its ability to seamlessly switch between healing allies and damaging enemies, eliminating the need for separate firing modes. This versatility is a unique trait that was previously only seen with Ana's Biotic Rifle. Notably, much like Ana, Juno can't headshot; however, unlike Ana, she does have falloff damage.

 <p>
  Despite having 11 support heroes by Season 11,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  lacks many supports that can heal allies through direct shots. Baptiste and Ana stand out for this reason, and their hitscan healing mechanics not only reward precise aim but also add versatility to the support role. With Ana and Baptiste at the forefront of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Season 11's hero tier list, it seems Juno appears to be following in their footsteps.

 <p>
  Although Blizzard aims to create diverse heroes with unique abilities, some overlap is inevitable. For example, Hyper Ring seems to be a new take on Lucio's Speed Boost, while Orbital Ray bears similarities to Lifeweaver's Tree of Life and Orisa's original ultimate, Supercharger. Given the generally positive reception to Juno's kit, Team 4 might see her ability to heal teammates through direct shots as a promising trend for future support heroes.

  In a universe with so many characters, it's common for players to discuss the diverse traits of the champions, going beyond their utility within Summoner’s Rift. Although there is a lack of official information regarding each champion's size, players often infer these details based on other Riot data, such as cinematics and official artwork.

  Maokai, one of the largest champions in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , is an imposing figure inspired by the grandeur of a fir tree, which can grow to be quite large. Originally from the Shadow Isles, he was a peaceful tree until corruption transformed his homeland into a desolate place. Determined to restore purity and life to his land, Maokai now carries the vital essence of the Shadow Isles, fighting against the evil forces that threaten to consume everything he once loved.

  His appearance reflects his connection to nature: a body of sturdy wood, radiant foliage, and roots forming natural armor. Maokai is a dedicated guardian whose mission is to see the Shadow Isles reborn, free from corruption and malevolent creatures. His immense size and formidable presence are a testament to his role as a protector, highlighting the significant impact he has within the game.

 <p>
  Vel'Koz, the Eye of the Void, is a champion in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  whose size often varies dramatically in official artwork. In some representations, he is a massive and towering creature, dominating the scene with his formidable presence. This variation can be attributed to his malleable nature and artistic interpretation, emphasizing different aspects of his alien essence. Regardless of the exact size, his appearance always exudes an aura of danger and mystery, reflecting his role as a Void entity.

 <p>
  Even when his size is depicted as smaller, Vel'Koz can still maintain an intimidating presence against enemies, being portrayed in some Riot arts as 4 or 5 times larger than the humans around him. Despite the inconsistencies present in his size, this lack of information helps to contribute to the enigmatic nature of this Void creature.

 <p>
  There are no explanations yet about where Nautilus' size originated in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , but since the cinematic
  <em>
   A New Dawn
  </em>
  , the Titan of the Depths has been depicted as a creature of massive proportions. This can be observed in some of his splash arts, especially those made for
  <em>
   Legends of Runeterra
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Using Riot's card game based on the
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  universe as an example, players can observe that some sharks diving around the champion do not approach the character's fist. Considering also that Nautilus carries an anchor, which he uses as a weapon in the game, it is possible to assume that he is one of the largest creatures inhabiting the seas of Runeterra.

  Nasus and Renekton, siblings with a common history in Shurima, had normal human heights in their past lives. After ascending as mythological creatures in the Sun Disc, they became massive champions. Their abilities are amplified by ancient power, and when they activate their ultimate abilities, they become titans in battle. This size increase reflects the divine power of ascension they received in ancient times, when they were considered demigods. This transformation is visible in some
  <em>
   Legends of Runeterra
  </em>
  arts, where the two are depicted as towering over buildings.

  Nasus, the Curator of the Sands, channels the essence of the desert to enhance his strength and resilience, while Renekton, the Butcher of the Sands, uses his fury to devastate enemies. Their ultimate abilities amplify their destructive capacities, making them even more formidable. Endowed with extraordinary strength and power, they are living reminders of a lost empire, elevating them above mere mortals in Runeterra.

  Ornn and Volibear, brothers and gods of Freljord, are massive creatures, making it challenging to determine their exact size. Ornn, the demigod of fire and forge, is described in lore as being as large as three pine trees. Therefore, it is possible to imagine that his brother, Volibear, with whom he has fought several battles, is equally impressive.

  The rivalry between the two is legendary in Freljord. In one of their most famous battles, they fought for eight days, causing tremors that shook the mountain's base. The battles were so fierce that molten rocks exploded from the peak of Hearth-Home, lightning struck the slopes, and geysers of flames erupted from the cliffs, leaving the site in ruins as a testament to the brothers' fury.

  , Riot envisioned Galio to be a colossal character, protecting Demacia from forbidden magic. In his Splash Art, it is possible to see that he is taller than a huge tower in the background, and the surrounding houses are small in comparison.

   Warriors

  , a cinematic released to celebrate the launch of the 2020 season of
  <em>
   League of Legends

  <em>
   enormous

  Malphite is another
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  champion with a colossal size, considered by many players to be one of the largest characters in the game. Despite the art in
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  not doing justice to his size, in
  <em>
   Legends of Runeterra,
  </em>
  it is possible to observe his size — practically one of the largest living mountains.

 <p>
  Furthermore, Riot tried to translate Malphite's colossal size into
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  , where the more armor he has, the larger he becomes, expanding his area and bringing some of his colossal presence to Summoner's Rift.

 <p>
  Skarner's rework brought several changes to the champion, including a new ability kit and lore, making him a part of Ixtal's mythology. This update also introduced players to a champion who can be considered among the largest in the game, judging by the art and biographies.

 <p>
  For example, in the champion's base splash art, it is possible to see that he has some colossal dimensions, with a small city positioned in the background and forest trees that appear tiny in comparison to him. So, even though Riot has not detailed these official measurements, it is safe to assume that Skarner is among the largest champions in the lore of
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Cho’Gath is a unique case in the lore of League of Legends, being a gigantic and scalable creature whose size is constantly expanding. This creature from the Void possesses an insatiable appetite that drives him to devour everything in his path, converting the consumed matter into body growth, making it impossible to determine just how large he can become.

 <p>
  Reflecting the Void's desire to consume all life, Cho'Gath is driven by this insatiable hunger. His unique biology allows him to transform what he consumes into increased strength or an almost indestructible carapace. This enables him to grow larger than almost any other living creature in the universe of Runeterra.

 <p>
  The universe of
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  is filled with unique champions of different sizes, but none can match the measurements and grandeur of Aurelion Sol. The Celestial Dragon is a cosmic entity of immeasurable proportions, capable of creating and destroying stars with a simple thought, making his majestic presence and incomprehensible power place him far above any other creature in Runeterra.

 <p>
  Known as the Star Forger, Aurelion Sol can hold galaxies in his hands, setting him apart from any other champion in terms of size and power. Deceived and imprisoned by the Aspects of Targon, his desire for freedom and to reclaim his divine status makes him a force to be feared. Thanks to his 2023 rework, players can witness more of this unparalleled power, solidifying his dominance over celestial bodies and his imposing presence in the game's lore.

  Twitch recently hosted a very high-profile charity event on July 19, with popular content creator and voice actor CDawgVA organizing and presenting an auction that raised over $500,000 in support of the Immune Deficiency Foundation. The auction was attended in person by a wide range of popular streamers like Jerma985, Ludwig, and Pokimane, with content creators from across the internet putting personal items and memorabilia up for auction. These items ranged from gaming sessions to extremely rare collectors' items, and it is clear to see how so much money was raised from the event.

 <h3 id="gaming-session-with-pokimane---30-700">
  Gaming Session with Pokimane - $30,700
 </h3>
 <p>
  The most expensive and high-profile item sold at CDawgVA's charity auction was a gaming session with Pokimane, an extremely popular Twitch streamer with over 9 million followers on the platform. This particular auction offering was the source of headlines when a fake donation placed a $500,000 bid on the Pokimane gaming session, although it did end up selling for a very respectable $30,700 once this fake bid was rooted out.

 <h3 id="a-trip-through-tokyo-with-premier-two---25-000">
  A Trip Through Tokyo with Premier Two - $25,000
 </h3>
 <p>
  The second highest-selling item at CDawgVA's auction was another event with a content creator, this time being a Tokyo tour with Twitch streamer Premier Two. Having lived in Tokyo for close to 15 years, Premier Two's tour of the iconic Japanese city promised to be an unforgettable one, with the winning bidder having full control over the activities and direction of the trip. Premier Two hyped up the tour with promises of bar crawls and guides of hidden jewels of the city, and the final bid for the day out in Tokyo speaks for itself.

 <h3 id="hangout-game-session-with-ironmouse-and-cdawg---23-500">
  Hangout/Game Session with Ironmouse and CDawg - $23,500
 </h3>
 <p>
  Following the trend of the top two highest-selling items at the auction, third place went to another collaboration involving steamers, this time being a hangout or gaming session with Ironmouse and CDawg himself. Ironmouse is a popular VTuber streamer and singer with over 2 million followers on Twitch, and has had a close working relationship with CDawg for quite some time. The prospect of spending time with both Ironmouse and CDawg would be deeply exciting for any long-time fan of either streamer, and this particular item was tipped to be one of the highest-selling even before the auction began.

 <h3 id="miyazaki-signed-elden-ring-poster---21-000">
  Miyazaki-Signed Elden Ring Poster - $21,000
 </h3>
 <p>
  The first physical item to make the highest-selling list for CDawgVA's auction is an
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  poster hand-signed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sekiro,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  itself. Of course,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is one of the most successful games of recent years, with its recent
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  DLC bringing similar acclaim, and a poster signed by the creator of the Soulslike genre was always going to be a hot commodity for the charity auction. This was reflected in the bidding war for the poster, which saw Jacksepticeye and Ludwig go head-to-head, with Ludwig eventually making the winning $21,000 bid.

 <h3 id="10-million-subscriber-diamond-play-button---20-200">
  10 Million Subscriber Diamond Play Button - $20,200
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another show-stopping item at CDawgVA's charity auction was the Diamond Play Button of YouTuber JaidenAnimations, with this being one of the few other items from the event to have a final bid in excess of $20,000. Diamond Play Buttons are a rare reward given to YouTubers who reach over 10 million channel subscribers, with there being less than 2000 channels in the world that meet the criteria for such a reward. Jaiden's Diamond Play Button is a piece of internet history that justifiably reached a very high final bid, in an auction that ended up raising a significant overall amount for charity.

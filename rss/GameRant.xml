 <p>
  The SPECIAL stat system is an iconic hallmark of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout
   </em>
  </strong>
  universe. Players love spreading their stats between the seven main attributes of Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck, ensuring that their protagonist is molded in their image.

 <p>
  Some games do a great job of reflecting these stats by altering everything from the approach players can take for a given conversation to the many skill checks they can make the most of. Not all
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games place equal importance on the SPECIAL stats, with more forgiving games feeling rather lacking from the role-playing side of things as a result.

  An action RPG that isn't remembered by many,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel
   </strong>
  </em>
  places itself as a hack-and-slash first and an RPG second. As a result, the SPECIAL system doesn't hold a ton of importance.

  This, coupled with a linear design and repetitive combat, means that
  <em>
   Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel
  </em>
  wasn't all that great. The title stands in the eyes of many as the worst game in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series with a surface-level implementation of the SPECIAL system.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  has undergone a quiet renaissance of sorts, turning into a surprisingly engaging experience if players decide to give this title a second shot. However, the focus on a multiplayer experience means that the SPECIAL system was bound to take a hit.

 <p>
  Players can level up their SPECIAL stats with each level up instead of choosing an allocation from the get-go, which makes the system a bit too forgiving. This, coupled with the many perk cards players can use, means that a player's SPECIAL stats don't influence gameplay all that much in the grand scheme of things.

 <p>
  With the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series stagnating in the early 2000s, the IP was subject to certain experiments that prioritized other aspects of the franchise instead of focusing on pure role-playing. This meant that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout Tactics
   </em>
  </strong>
  was bound to disappoint fans seeking a great implementation of the SPECIAL system, even if it excelled in other aspects.

 <p>
  Players who loved the tense nature of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's gameplay loved how
  <em>
   Fallout Tactics
  </em>
  enhanced the options available to them in combat. However, role-playing itself wasn't a huge focus, which meant that players didn't have to worry too much about how the SPECIAL system influenced their character.

  has its fair share of detractors, with the lack of emphasis placed on the SPECIAL system being a huge pain point for many. Players couldn't fathom the idea of a mainline

  game where role-playing took a backseat to other facets of gameplay.

 <p>
  The SPECIAL system may seem relevant early on, but players can allocate points after leveling up, which makes the game more forgiving. Improving the Sole Survivor's stats involves unlocking and investing in perks that help them enjoy a bevy of advantages both in and out of combat, which is more forgiving but less satisfying for RPG fans who fell in love with

  's earlier iterations.

   <strong>
    Fallout
   </strong>
  </em>
  did benefit from players investing in combat-heavy stats as opposed to other ones, which could make things disappointing for players who wanted to focus less on battles and try to explore other avenues to make progress. This can still be forgiven given that this is the first game in the series, with the SPECIAL system being largely effective in making these stat allocations quite meaningful from the get-go.

  It's a shame that
  <em>
   <strong>
    New Vegas
   </strong>
  </em>
  launched in a poor technical state, but modern
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  fans can agree that this game is possibly the best title in the series. The combination of the series' staples coupled with modern advancements ensured that controlling the Courier was a rewarding experience for players who wanted to immerse themselves in the game's role-playing systems.

  The SPECIAL system is fleshed out, with the Courier's stat allocations playing a major role in how they react to the dynamic world of

  ' complex role-playing systems.

  Most people love
  <strong>
   <em>

 <p>
  A person selling
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Sun
   </strong>
  </em>
  hacked saves has been arrested by the police in Japan. The move may surprise some fans of the series, but
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun
  </em>
  is far from the first game that's been hacked, and it's not even the first to have arrests connected to illegally modifying the games, either.

 <p>
  Modding game data has been around for nearly as long as gaming itself, with varying levels of scrutiny from developers and publishers. Some games readily encourage their fanbases to modify their titles, like Bethesda, while others are much more stringent and don't want any changes made to their games outside of official releases. However, it's when people start trying to sell modified game data that things become particularly problematic.

 <p>
  Such is the case for a 32-year-old in Japan who was recently arrested for selling modified copies of
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun
  </em>
  for the 3DS. According to TBS News, via Automaton-Media, the seller had put offers up online for save data for the game, offering "over 800 Pokemon" in the listings. The investigators found that numerous limited Pokemon were included in the offer, like those that could have only been acquired by attending events in-person, which created suspicion. After tracking down the seller, the investigators confirmed with Nintendo that the ROMs had indeed been tampered with.

  What's Next for the Alleged Poke-Criminal?
 </h2>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun
  </em>
  hacker in question could be held guilty in contempt of Japan’s Unfair Competition Prevention Act, which carries with it a potential five year prison sentence and up to a $33,000 USD fine. While it might seem shocking in the west, modified
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  game save sellers have been arrested in the past, with the same potential for jail time. The same situation happened earlier in 2024, when a
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  save seller was arrested.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1010} -->

 <p>
  At the moment, it looks like an open-and-shut case, as the perpetrator has allegedly admitted to the crime. However, the police are still investigating additional charges, so they may end up spending more time behind bars or have a higher fee to face when everything is said and done. While there's no way to know how many - if any - sales were completed, the unnamed offender was reportedly selling the
  <em>
   Pokemon Sun
  </em>
  hacked saves for just $35 USD. Needless to say, any profit generated from the sales is surely not worth the time and money that this person is now likely to lose behind bars.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Darkest Dungeon
   </strong>
  </em>
  is not for the faint-hearted. The acclaimed roguelike turn-based game pivots around an eerie town called Halmet, which serves as a base of operations from where gamers must make their way to the shadowy estate. Along the way, though, one's party of heroes will face all manner of Lovecraftian horrors.

  Death is all but guaranteed. Players will lose many heroes during their runs, but each loss will only make them stronger. While the game is not designed to hold the player's hand, making note of certain tips and tricks can make the journey to the titular
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  a bit easier.

   </strong>
   Darkest Dungeon continues to cater to a large fan base. While its sequel brings to life a whole new range of horrors, the feeling of dread and despair of the original can hardly be forgotten. Hence, we have added more tips and tricks to help new (or returning) players navigate the dark and gloom of the Darkest Dungeon.

  Something most newcomers have a hard time digesting is that death is a permanent feature in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  . Heroes are meant to be killed while exploring dungeons. When they die (and they will),
  <strong>
   there is no way to revive or bring them back from the dead
  </strong>
  . New heroes will arrive every week in the Stage Coach, and players can replace their fallen adventurers and create new parties to try again.

     "From Beyond" is a rare Town Event that allows players to resurrect a random hero from the graveyard. If it triggers, it is recommended to choose the hero with the highest level and best quirks.

  Hence, there is no traditional "game over" in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  . Even if a player loses all of their heroes and upgrades, sees their town destroyed, and becomes bankrupt,
  <strong>
   they still cannot lose the game
  </strong>
  . There is always room to recover and start again with a new party of adventurers. Those playing the Stygian mode, however, will need to beat the final boss of the base game within 86 weeks. The failure condition also limits players to 12 deaths, after which they need to complete the game within the same aforementioned number of weeks.

  There is a limit to how many heroes players can have in their roster at a given time. It is important not to be afraid to cut them out at the first sign of weakness, especially during the early game. If there are heroes with high stress levels and several negative quirks, players should
  <strong>
   dismiss them instead of spending precious gold on treating them
  </strong>
  . There will always be new heroes to take their place.

  players do not have much gold at the start of the game, so they should refrain from spending any on upgrading heroes. There is no need to treat their afflictions or quirks. Farming gold in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  takes a lot of time, so it is recommended that gamers save what they have to improve their early game.

     It's best to only spend gold on upgrading weapons for heroes. Improving armor is not as cost-effective, since bad RNG can still result in death. In the late game, players can start locking in the best quirks in

  Similarly, players should save their heirlooms until they have a good understanding of what buildings to upgrade, which means they should not throw them on everything they come across. Completely upgrading Hamlet is how gamers get access to valuable facilities and services. However, there is a certain order to what buildings need to be upgraded first in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon

  .

  Upgrading the Stage Coach increases the number of heroes arriving every week. One's aim should be to get at least four new heroes with each run to create a full party. Following that, players should spend heirlooms on the Guild and Blacksmith to upgrade their
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  heroes. Reducing their upgrade costs will save a lot of money in the long run.

 <p>
  If dungeon runs are going fine, players may want to upgrade the Abbey as well. It allows them to remove stress from heroes at a greatly reduced cost.

  The Blacksmith and Guild are used to upgrade the heroes' combat capabilities. They are expensive though, so do not waste money on maxing out everything. In fact, players should
  <strong>
   only improve weapon damage at the Blacksmith
  </strong>
  , and ignore the armor upgrades. In
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  , increased damage always triumphs over everything. Being able to close out fights quicker helps better than staying alive for multiple rounds.

 <p>
  As for the Guild, only upgrade the main abilities of each hero. For example, if players are using the Highway Robber's pistols, upgrade them instead of his knife. Keeping the Vestal for heals? Invest in her healing skills only. This also means that players should unlock their core abilities from the Guild in case they are using new heroes straight off the Stage Coach.

  Then, there are sub-roles or hybrids depending on what skills players want to use in their builds. The Abomination, for example, can be used as a tank, damage dealer, or both.

  Once players are familiar with what each hero is capable of, it is time to start experimenting to find the best party compositions in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  . Gamers will want heroes that synergize with each other in a team and are also suited for the unique challenges each dungeon offers.

  For example, the Plague Doctor will be of little use in Weald since she does Blight damage, and most enemies in Weald are highly resistant to it. Players shouldn't be afraid to experiment with different heroes in different dungeons as the Stage Coach will always bring in a fresh supply of heroes to reinforce the roster.

  Within the same domain of finding the right party composition is another important gameplay aspect for new players to understand in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  . Every hero plays best in certain ranks (4-3-2-1) based on their skills. Some attacks forcefully move heroes, so players must keep that in check while positioning their heroes.

  Jester, for example, moves forward by one rank every time he uses Dirk Stab. Hence, positioning him in the front ranks would be a mistake. Grave Robber moves forward by two ranks with Lunge, making it important for her to be in the back.

  Make it a habit to open the heroes' character sheets from the Hamlet screen to confirm how their abilities work. The yellow button-like dots show the most appropriate position for each hero, while each skill's description tells players whether the hero will move or not. Also, note which enemy ranks each skill can reach.

  It is important to keep in mind that
  <strong>
   some provisions are needed in more quantities for certain dungeons
  </strong>
  , while others can be completely ignored. Knowing the best provisions for each location in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  will save players a lot of gold. For example, Antivenom is important for Weald, where enemies do Blight damage, and Bandages for Warrens, since enemies there do Bleed damage. Players will need more Shovels in Cove due to the increased number of obstacles.

  The lower the light levels, the harder a dungeon run can become. Enemies might ambush the player, and they hit a lot harder in the dark. However, players will find more loot as a result of this, which is important to keep in mind.

   <strong>
    Jester's Inspiring Tune
   </strong>
   is the strongest stress heal in
   <em>
    Darkest Dungeon
   </em>
   . It affects the entire party and heals for the most points.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Crusader's Inspiring Cry
   </strong>
   and
   <strong>
    Houndmaster's Cry Havoc
   </strong>
   can stress heal a single hero on any rank.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Abomination's Absolution
   </strong>
   can only be used on himself. It restores health and heals stress.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Leper's Solemnity
   </strong>
   is another strong self-healing skill in the game. It restores health and stress points by a significant amount.

  There are two ways a hero can die in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  . Firstly, draining their health bar pits them against Death's Door. Secondly, filling their stress bar twice will give them a heart attack. It is harder to remove stress than heal in the game, so players should try to kill enemies quickly before they can come into contact.

  There is no shame in retreating from fights and abandoning dungeons. If heroes are about to max out their stress levels or are caught in a losing battle against the hardest bosses in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  , there is no point in sticking around.

  Players can get back to Hamlet at any point by hitting the little flag with a cross in the top-left corner of the screen. This way,
  <strong>
   gamers get to keep all the loot
  </strong>
  (gold, heirlooms, trinkets, and provisions) in their inventory while also keeping their heroes alive. However, retreating will give heroes high stress. Players can then decide on whether to dismiss or cure them.

  <em>

  players should aim to
  <strong>
   kill the weakest enemies first
  </strong>
  within the first couple of rounds. Their attacks might do less damage, but that damage keeps piling up until the end of the fight. The enemies listed above should always be killed as quickly as possible.

 <p>
  Also,
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  players should
  <strong>
   always focus all heroes on a single target
  </strong>
  and not spread attacks. The key to winning fights is reducing the number of enemies on the board. The enemy backlines (ranks 3 and 4) will always do the most damage. These ranks usually also have stress damage dealers. When choosing between the squishy frontlines and bulky backlines,
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  players should target the former before switching to the latter. Even healers have offensive abilities, and they can be used to debuff enemies instead of restoring a few points of health.

  <strong>
   Do not underestimate stuns
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  . Most new players might ignore using/taking stun abilities because their damage output is negligible at best. This is a rookie mistake. Stunned enemies lose a turn in the next round, giving players more time to consider their options. They can pile up on the remaining enemies, use the turn to heal, etc. Stunning is the equivalent of removing enemies from the board. However, make sure to check their resistance stats first because not all enemies can be stunned that easily.

  Heals should only be used in two cases: when a hero is about to die, or the enemy ranks are too thin/weak to land any significant damage in the next round. Using a healing skill in any other situation is the same as wasting a round in
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Even if the hero, such as Vestal, is only in the party for heals, using any other skill such as buffing up another hero, will always be more helpful. Do not take long though. Trying to heal an entire party back to full health with one or two enemies remaining is a common strategy. However,
  <strong>
   more enemies will arrive
  </strong>
  if players take too many rounds to close the fight.

  Curios are found randomly lying around in a dungeon. Interacting with them will bring up a prompt to use an item from one's inventory. Using the correct item will either give players loot or a valuable buff. Use the wrong item, and

  players will either take stress damage or be affected by an affliction, among other negative effects.

  There are dozens of different curios, some unique to each dungeon. What players need is a cheat sheet that mentions how to interact with all the curios in

    <ul>
     <li>
      Many introverted characters in Resident Evil universe value isolation over human interaction.

     <li>
      Some introverted villains like Alfred and Moreau focus on their personal obsessions in solitude.
     </li>
     <li>
      Introverted characters like Ada and Sherry often exhibit reserved behavior due to their traumatic experiences.

 <p>
  In the universe of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil
   </em>
  </strong>
  , where outbreaks are a regular occurrence, staying inside and as far away from people as possible can actually be a pretty good character trait. Then again, when zombies and B.O.W.s begin prowling the streets, trying to survive without any assistance can end up making things a little trickier than they need to be. Being an introverted
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  character therefore comes with its own set of pros and cons, but it does also help to add a lot of reliability to these individuals too.

 <p>
  On the other hand, there have even been some villains in the series who have also demonstrated introverted characteristics that see them avoiding human interaction altogether while they cook up their own devious schemes behind the scenes. All of this is to say there have been numerous introverted characters, heroes and villains alike, in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil universe
  </em>
  , with these individuals below being among the most well-known and recognizable.

  When Claire breaks out from the Rockfort Island prison at the beginning of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Code Veronica
   </em>
  </strong>
  , she gradually stumbles across several documents that begin to paint an eerie picture of Alfred, one of the game's major villains. Alfred had a close, albeit quite disturbing, relationship with his sister Alexia, but after she left him to enter cryo-sleep, Alfred's mind simply couldn't accept the person he loved so dearly was gone. As a result, he cooped himself up in his palace and would regularly dress up in Alexia's clothes as a way to pretend she was still there with him.

 <p>
  When Claire first meets Alfred, he seems to be rather loud and brash, desperate for Claire to leave him alone as he waves his sniper rifle around in the air. He also prefers speaking to Claire through the use of his radios, rarely ever approaching her face to face, which makes him feel even more distant as an individual.

  Jake Muller may be the son of series icon Albert Wesker, but he didn't actually ever get a chance to meet his father, who seemingly abandoned him at a young age. As a result, Jake was raised by a single mother and was forced to use his superhuman abilities to act as a mercenary to collect money, turning him into an introverted and rather cold-hearted individual who always prefers doing things his own way.

 <p>
  Even when Sherry meets him in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  and eventually starts helping him, Jake seems largely dismissive of her, constantly trying to break ties so he can go back to beating people up for money. Another example of Jake's more uninterested personality is when Chris Redfield and the BSAA arrive in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6 —
  </em>
  only for Jake to hide away in the background to avoid garnering any unwanted attention.

 <p>
  Though Hunk doesn't actually receive too much screentime over the course of the series, he definitely has displayed more introverted traits than extroverted. For one, despite being one of the most legendary soldiers in the
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  universe, even earning the nickname "Grim Reapers," HUNK never feels the need to brag about this or even mention it, instead hiding away in obscurity, leaving others to talk about his incredible feats.

 <p>
  Considering most of HUNK's missions end with only him making it out alive, it does make sense why he would adopt such a closed-off personality, since he probably feels he can only rely on himself. He also never leaves the house without his iconic gas mask, which he wears to keep his true identity a mystery, ensuring he doesn't get any adoring fans asking him for an autograph.

 <p>
  It's made clear right from the get-go in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil 7
   </strong>
  </em>
  that something is a little off about Lucas. Unlike the rest of the Baker family, he seems less than inclined to spend time with his parents and prefers to hide away in his own makeshift base of operations Ethan navigates through not long after leaving the estate.

 <p>
  The truth is, while Lucas is infected just the same as his family, he's not under the influence of Eveline, which explains why he would feel so absent, since he doesn't subscribe to being a member of Evie's "New" family. It's also explained in files found in Lucas' room that he was severely bullied as a child, which caused him to distance himself from others for much of his life out of fear of being rejected again.

  In stark contrast to his fellow lords, Dimitrescu and Heisenberg, who always make a scene whenever they show up on screen, Moreau is a shy, passive, and ultimately very isolated member of Mother Miranda's crew in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil Village
   </strong>
  </em>
  . Since he is utterly obsessed with gaining validation from his master, Moreau hides away in his swamp, conducting sick and twisted experiments in the hopes of one day being noticed by Miranda.

 <p>
  Not long after Ethan enters Moreau's swamp, he sees the grotesque creature staring blankly at a TV screen before lashing out at Ethan for disturbing his personal space. Moreau's appearance also signifies he's a lot more introverted than his allies, especially the long dark rag which can often be seen covering his face before he reveals his true form to Ethan.

  Ada isn't exactly a people person. In fact, any time she can be seen interacting with others throughout the series, it's usually for the sake of using them for her own gain or extracting information from them, rather than simply checking up on how they are. Ada's loyalties in the series have always been put into question, with it being implied that she primarily works for herself rather than any major companies, which explains why she embarks on so many solo missions.

 <p>
  As was demonstrated in the Separate Ways DLC when she pushes Luis to one side, Ada tries to avoid getting chummy with others who could end up getting in the way of her mission. While she has still developed a close bond with Leon, even then she still prefers to remain distant from him, only showing up when absolutely necessary.

  Sherry comes across as fairly timid and shy when Claire finds her hiding away in the RPD station during
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , but her introverted nature does make a lot of sense considering the ordeal she's been put through. As a child dropped right in the middle of a zombie outbreak, and abandoned by her own parents, Sherry was forced to fend for herself until she met Claire, causing her to run away from anyone who tried to get close.

 <p>
  Admittedly, this does work in Sherry's favor at some points when she's able to evade the zombies and Lickers that lurk in the shadows, but it can also become an irritation for Claire, who is forced to run after her on more than a few occasions. Being around Leon and Claire, and thereby learning that she can depend on other people, does make Sherry come out of her shell a little, though even in
  <em>
   Resident Evil 6,
  </em>
  she still appears to be fairly isolated as a character.

  Outside the Beneviento house in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Resident Evil Village
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players can find a few notes that shed light on Beneviento, or more specifically, the woman who was behind the murderous doll that hunts down Ethan. It turns out, from a very young age, Donna Beneviento had always been quiet and reserved, which caused her to become obsessed with the art of dollmaking as a way to keep herself occupied.

 <p>
  However, once Mother Miranda found the Beneviento family, she killed and experimented on Donna's parents, leaving her even more alone. Eventually, Donna was gifted by Mother Miranda with the ability to bring her dolls to life, which encouraged her to use them as stand-ins for herself. While the Angie doll might therefore come across as a loud and pretty rude enemy for Ethan to face in the story, it's all a front for the woman behind the creation who simply tries to avoid interacting with others by any means possible.

  To celebrate the
  <em>
   Warcraft Rumble
  </em>
  PC soft launch, Blizzard is giving away some Twitch Drops to help players get started on the new client. Until the end of the year, fans who watch two hours of
  <em>
   Warcraft Rumble
  </em>
  on Twitch can earn a Major XP Tome, a Rare Core, a Star Tome, and 500 coins. This care package can help new players get their teams up to speed, while giving veterans a nice boost to help their existing armies.

  This isn’t the only free stuff available in
  <em>
   Warcraft Rumble
  </em>
  right now. Players can claim the new PC F.R.E.E. Gift bundle via the in-game store to get another Rare Core, five Big Red Buttons to reset the G.R.I.D., 250 Coins, and a massive Mega XP Tome. What’s more, fans have until 9:59 PST on December 11 to get the
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  Direct Twitch Drops, which include a special
  <em>
   Warcraft
  </em>
  anniversary portrait, as well as Sylvanas Stars and another Rare Core, by watching 20 minutes of
  <em>
   Warcraft Rumble
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  , or
  <em>
   Hearthstone
  </em>
  on the streaming platform. This bundle can be obtained individually for each game, meaning multiple Sylvanas Stars and Rare Cores can be earned by claiming all three.

  also recently began both its PC login and Winter Veil events. From now through December 13, players can complete in-game challenges to earn Malfurion Stormrage, a new Alliance/Cenarion Split Leader in
  <em>
   Warcraft Rumble
  </em>
  . On December 14, the event will rotate over to offer Anub’arak, a Beast/Undead Split Leader, and again on December 24 for Orgrim Doomhammer, a Horde/Blackrock Split Leader. Fans will get all of these limited-time Leaders for free simply by logging in during the event – but they can earn and buy more Stars for these heroes until both events end on January 3.

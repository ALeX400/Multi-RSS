  With 2025's Lantern Rite event in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  kicking off, the event brings exciting news for players in the form of Lan Yan, a 4-star
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="101975">
   Anemo character
  </span>
  who hails from the Liyue region. Unlike previous Lantern Rite events, which have typically featured new 5-star characters alongside some 4-star options, Lan Yan is the only Liyue addition in this patch. As a versatile unit, she has the ability to serve multiple roles in a team. While she can function as a DPS, her true strength lies in her support capabilities, especially her robust shielding potential, which can be vital for teams that require extra survivability. Beyond this, Lan Yan also excels in crowd control, helping group enemies for easier attacks and reactions. Additionally, she can make good use of the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2037948">
   Viridescent Venerer set,
  </span>
  allowing her to shred elemental resistance and further boost the team's overall damage output.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  The fact that players can acquire Lan Yan relatively easily compared to more exclusive 5-star characters makes her even more worth considering, especially with the added bonus that she can be obtained for free during the Lantern Rite event by selecting her from the Liyue character pool. This accessibility means that many players might wonder if she requires further investment to maximize her potential. Specifically, players may be asking whether constellations are necessary for Lan Yan to perform well in endgame content or if she is strong enough at her base level. Here's all players should know about Lan Yan's constellations in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact.

 <p>
  Lan Yan's constellations are somewhat similar in utility to those of many other
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="119703">
   support-oriented 4-star characters
  </span>
  . While they can be useful, they don't significantly boost her DPS output or provide substantial additional support for the team. In her case, most of her constellations are focused on enhancing her shield strength, though there are some that also offer additional support or DPS-oriented benefits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generally speaking, Lan Yan is perfectly fine at C0, and players don't need to focus too much on constellations unless they really want to significantly increase her shield capabilities (in which case,
  <strong>
   C2
  </strong>
  is a good stopping point). Since players can gradually obtain Lan Yan's constellations through both limited and standard banners, it's best not to pull solely for her during her debut
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2164446">
   banner with Arlecchino
  </span>
  or Clorinde, unless they are specifically aiming for one of these two characters as well.

 <p>
  Lan Yan's first constellation provides a modest DMG increase by allowing her to summon an additional Feathermoon Ring, which results in slightly higher self DMG output. However, considering that Lan Yan's Elemental Skill has a relatively long cooldown of 16 seconds, and the Feathermoon Ring's DMG multiplier is not as significant as her Elemental Burst (which has a similar cooldown duration), the difference in DMG is not substantial. While this constellation offers a slight boost, it's not a game-changing enhancement, especially when compared to other potential improvements in her kit.

  Lan Yan possesses one of the
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="2000288">
   strongest shields
  </span>
  in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , and her second constellation enhances it to potentially rival Zhongli's shield—at least on paper. However, its effectiveness is far more conditional, as this constellation does not directly increase the shield's absorption cap. Instead, it allows the shield's absorption value to gradually refresh every 2 seconds, provided the rotation consistently includes Normal Attacks (which means with a character like Neuvillette, it may not be as significant).
 </p>
 <p>
  In practice, during a typical Lan Yan rotation, the shield refresh effect is likely to activate only 1–2 times per rotation, assuming the shield isn't entirely broken by a heavy attack. While this refresh mechanic offers significant durability, it doesn’t quite match the reliability or consistency of Zhongli’s shield. Nevertheless, this constellation remains Lan Yan’s most impactful one, as it significantly improves her shielding potential, making it an excellent choice for players prioritizing her defensive utility.

  Lan Yan's fourth constellation provides a valuable team-wide buff in the form of Elemental Mastery, which can be particularly useful for increasing DMG output or buff values in reaction-heavy teams. However, the amount of Elemental Mastery granted is not substantial enough to be game-changing, especially for teams that focus on
  <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="108645">
   mono-Element damage
  </span>
  rather than reactions.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it is a nice bonus to have, this constellation is far from essential. Players running teams with characters that don’t rely heavily on Elemental Reactions may find this constellation less impactful.

  Rather than outright enhancing Lan Yan's shield strength, her last constellation introduces flexibility regarding the timing of her Elemental Skill. If the shield is broken, players gain the ability to swap back to Lan Yan and quickly reapply it, offering some adaptability in managing shield uptime. This can be particularly helpful in team compositions where the main carry is not a selfish DPS—one that requires uninterrupted on-field presence. In such cases, the ability to reapply the shield mid-rotation can be a practical advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, this constellation's value is diminished by Lan Yan's long Elemental Skill cooldown. Unlike characters like Yelan, whose additional skill charge can be fully utilized due to a shorter cooldown, Lan Yan's skill doesn't allow for such efficient usage. Even with this added flexibility, players may find limited opportunities to reapply her shield effectively within a single rotation. As a result, while this constellation has niche uses in certain team setups, it’s not as impactful or game-changing as other comparable constellations from different characters.

  <strong>
   Folklore
  </strong>
  is the basis of some of the most brilliant storytelling that games have to offer. Writers and developers take what makes these stories so enduring and allow the player to become immersed in that world. Nowhere is this truer than in the historical RPG.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, unlike games that try to be historically accurate, folklore can delve into magic, monsters, and mythology. There is freedom in exploring the distant—and not-so-distant— past filtered through the stories passed down through generations and whispered in fearfull tones. This list has a mix of RPGs based on folklore from around the world and various eras of folklore, up to the modern folklore of urban legends.

   <em>
    Where the Water Tastes Like Wine
   </em>
  </strong>
  is an adventure game in which folklore itself is the currency. It is set in an ambiguous time around the Great Depression in North America and has a darkly Dust Bowl canival-esque aesthetic. A wanderer has stumbled into the wrong card game and becomes the undead thrall of a devilish wolf who demands stories from across the U.S.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wanderer must talk to people to uncover their stories or witness peculiar events to collect folklore that might be interesting to other itinerant characters or the wolf himself. Using a tarot card-style system, the player must tell the right type of story to appease their audience. It is a game about the value of oral tradition and the connections made through storytelling.

   <strong>
    Sekiro
   </strong>
  </em>
  has limited character attributes and skill tree functions for players to experiment with, hence the degree to which it is an RPG compared to other Soulslike games is contested. That is why it is not higher up on this list. However, there is no doubt that
  <em>
   Sekiro
  </em>
  engages with a blend of mythology, folklore, and modern cinematic representations of 1500s Sengoku-era Japan. The game blurs historical inspiration and fantasy esthetics to fantastic effect, and there are allusions to Buddhist philosophy throughout.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is a brutally hard but astonishingly beautiful game that rewards persistence and adaptive, aggressive play. Basically, be prepared to sink about 50 dedicated hours at least into the game to get the most out of its stunning historical fantasy world. There is a lot of wonderful optional gameplay and story connected to folklore that is easy to miss if players are too focused on finishing the core game as quickly as possible.

    Black Book
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a surprisingly accessible deckbuilding RPG in which a young sorceress named Vasilisa seeks to reunite with her dead husband. To do so, she must open the seals in the titular Black Book. This involves the use of dark magic and the building of a demonic army. Vasilisa discovers cards through events like conversational encounters, and then she can use those cards in combat against monsters and mythical beings.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are quite a few moral and strategic choices to make along the way that significantly impact available options and cards. It is set in 19th-century Russia and explores Slavic folklore primarily through Russian and Komi traditions. The developers consulted Russian ethnographers to ensure the authenticity of their depiction of the folkloric traditions of the area.

   <em>
    Ghost of Tsushima
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a fantastic third-person RPG with dynamic sword combat set in feudal Japan. It is the story of Jin, who is one of only a few survivors of a bloody battle between samurai and the invading Mongols in 1274. He goes on a quest to rescue his uncle who was taken prisoner during the battle and uncovers mythic stories, told through ink-painted vignettes, along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jin’s companion, Una, creates and builds up folklore around Jin himself, spreading the word that he is a vengeful spirit (or "ghost") seeking revenge for the deaths in the Battle of Tsushima. As he travels through the land, the legend surrounding him begins to build, and he becomes a mythic figure in his own right.

   <em>
    Pentiment
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a 2D role-playing mystery game that takes place in 16th-century Bavaria. The art style of
  <em>
   Pentiment
  </em>
  is inspired by illuminated manuscripts, and ornate books that were a mainstay of literature reproduction before the invention of the printing press. There are narrative choices that inform the player character’s backstory, personality, and skill set.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is heavy engagement with the folklore of the area through conversations about the history of Bavaria and the religious traditions of the time. These folkloric accounts demonstrate the conflict between Christian ideology and Pagan history. It is a murder mystery that hinges on subjective interpretations—and misrepresentations—of history.

      <title>Bend Studio Dev Comments on Studio's Future Plans After Game Cancelation</title>

  <strong>
   Bend Studio
  </strong>
  has provided a promising affirmation to fans about its future projects. The PlayStation first-party team recently had its current AAA live-service project canceled as part of a portfolio review, but it appears this hasn't done much to shake Bend Studio's confidence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the purported internal turmoil at Bend Studio over a sequel to 2019's
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  , the studio announced in June 2022 that it was working on a brand-new IP. Details on this original project were mostly kept under wraps, but Bend Studio specified that it would build on
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  's open-world systems and feature multiplayer elements. Some recent leaks did show off a few early concept screens for Bend Studio's unannounced game, possibly revealing it to be a live-service open-world military shooter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, this project won't see the light of day now that PlayStation has canceled Bend Studio's live-service game. The news came as a major shock to Bend Studio fans who had been waiting for a new game from the studio for nearly six years. However, it seems
  <strong>
   Bend Studio is not that beleaguered over the cancelation
  </strong>
  . Over on Twitter, Bend Studio community manager Kevin McAllister thanked fans for their good wishes and support in a recent post, and capped it off by stating that the team still plans on "creating cool sh*t."

     </div>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  When the cancelation of Bend Studio's live-service game was first reported, it was additionally revealed that PlayStation was working closely with the studio to determine the next project it should take on. Bend Studio spent several years developing its now-canceled live-service title, and should its next game be of a similar scope, fans will most likely learn about it well after the PS5's lifecycle ends. Thankfully, Bend Studio remains confident in its ability to deliver a great experience, and with PlayStation seemingly slowing down its live-service plans, it might very well be that the studio's next game is single-player.
 </p>
 <p>
  This has led to a resurgence in requests for a
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  sequel, and even though Bend Studio ended all hopes of the prospect last year, it could succumb to the demand and give the
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  IP another shot. Interestingly, many rumors in recent months have claimed that a
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  remaster is on the way for PS5 and likely PC. Although
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  sold millions of copies on PS4, the commercial performance of the remaster may end up being the determining factor for whether a
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  sequel gets the green light.

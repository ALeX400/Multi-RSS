  The March incident occurred during an altercation in Florida, where he allegedly resisted arrest and caused minor injuries to the officer involved. According to Dexerto, as part of the plea deal, the 35-year-old YouTuber avoided jail time but agreed to 12 months of probation. In addition to probation, Julianelle is required to write an apology letter to the officer he assaulted, donate $1,000 to the Police Memorial Fund, and complete 100 hours of community service while adhering to all other probationary terms.

  Julianelle, a Jacksonville, Florida resident, has faced legal troubles before. In May 2021, he was reportedly arrested on allegations of domestic battery and causing bodily harm. Following the incident, Julianelle urged fans to approach online rumors with skepticism following allegations of his arrest for domestic abuse. Initially pleading not guilty, Julianelle ultimately changed his plea in what court documents describe as a decision made in his “best interest.”

  Patrick Julianelle isn’t the only content creator to face legal troubles recently. Johnny Somali, a controversial live streamer, has drawn attention in South Korea after referencing the North Korean national anthem during a live broadcast earlier this month. This act has sparked a legal investigation, with authorities imposing a travel ban preventing him from leaving the country until the matter is fully resolved. Potential charges against him include obstruction of business and drug use, both of which carry severe penalties. Despite his apparent confidence in avoiding jail time, Seoul prosecutors are keeping a close watch on his actions.

  Additionally, Squeeze Benz was arrested earlier this year for the second time following a hit-and-run livestream incident in May 2024. In April 2024, his notorious hit-and-run was captured live on the controversial streaming platform Kick by streamer N3on, who was in the passenger seat at the time. Shortly after the incident, N3on's stream was shut down, and authorities arrested Ginestri in May 2024. The arrest also included assault charges related to a February 2024 incident at the Steinway Deli in Long Island City, where he allegedly struck a man in the head. In March 2024, Ginestri paid $3,000 in restitution after pleading guilty to possessing a stolen motorcycle.

  Authenticity is key to capturing the spirit of the original material when it comes to video game adaptations of beloved franchises. This sentiment is at the heart of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
   </em>
  </strong>
  , the upcoming first-person action-adventure game by MachineGames, and it goes all the way down to which weapons are available to players as they make their way through its immersive story.

  Game Rant recently spoke with MachineGames about the development of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  , during which design director Jens Andersson disclosed some interesting details about how the game subtly encourages players to use melee weapons in combat instead of a gun. While this is the way
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  is meant to be played, Andersson reported still being surprised during moments where he had seen that design organically play out when playtesters enjoyed some time with the game ahead of its launch.

  The Indiana Jones IP Requires an Authentic Video Game Adaptation
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  franchise has been around for over 40 years now, which means it has had plenty of time to pick up a significant following, and dedicated fans who have kept up with it since the beginning are now more than familiar with its world and its characters. While that is all well and good, it also means that MachineGames has had a tall order ahead of it with developing
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  , as it can't afford to be too liberal with an IP that is now as well-established as
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  . However, the developer has seemingly pulled out all the stops when crafting an authentic
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  experience, including its combat.

 <p>
  When attempting to conceptualize
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  as a video game, combat is likely not the first thing one would think of, as the iconic archaeologist conjures thoughts of delving into ancient history, solving elaborate puzzles, and exploring dark tombs. Even so, not an
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  film has been made that doesn't show Indy fending off bad guys at some point to either protect or retrieve a valuable artifact of some kind that "belongs in a museum." As such,
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  would need to feature combat to some extent, but it would need to do so in a way that reflects what viewers might witness in a film, lest it stray too far from being a genuine representation of the IP.

 <p>
  Ahead of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  's release, MachineGames spent plenty of time evaluating the game over the shoulders of playtesters to ensure it stayed true to the blueprint that was laid out for it during its initial phases of development. During that time, the studio was happy to see that one of the most fundamental principles of
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  's combat was present in the game, which ultimately resulted in it being a more authentic

  experience.

   I’ve spent a ton of time in the playtest room for this project, but there are a lot of things that I still really love seeing. One of them is when the tester comes up to a spot with both a frying pan and a rifle; in 99% of the cases, the player will pick the frying pan – because that’s just more fun and the Indy thing to do. I’m still fascinated that we managed to make a game where this happens.

 <p>
  Based on Andersson's observations in the playtest room for
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  , it seems the developer's goal to create an authentic
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  experience has been accomplished. Rather than forcing players to use a melee weapon like a frying pan in combat,
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  often gives players a choice between something like that and a gun. The very fact that Andersson has seen playtesters pick up the frying pan more often in those cases, rather than the gun, implies an experience that makes players feel so much like Indiana Jones himself that they go for the frying pan out of pure instinct and respect for the character.

  In past interviews with Game Rant, MachineGames disclosed that using a gun in
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  is a surefire way to make the game harder, as it will only either blow Indy's cover or cause enemies to start fighting back with guns too. And since Indiana Jones is no superhero who can fend off a dozen enemies with guns by himself, it makes sense why this would be the route players would want to avoid. Instead,
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  prefers its players to either rely on Indiana's fists to get the job done, the nearest melee weapon they can find, or to simply avoid engaging in combat altogether. That doesn't mean guns aren't viable, but they're not the problem solvers they are in other games.

  <strong>
   PlayStation Plus
  </strong>
  subscribers can now claim the December 2024 free games for their digital libraries. The first Tuesday of every month is always an exciting day for PlayStation Plus subscribers. It's on that day that PS Plus subscribers across all tiers of the service are able to claim the latest free games.

 <p>
  The monthly free PS Plus games are a main selling point of the PS Plus Essential tier. PS Plus Essential guarantees subscribers a fresh batch of free games to claim at the beginning of each month, plus it also gives subscribers access to exclusive discounts and online multiplayer. PlayStation gamers that want to get the most bang for their buck will definitely want to consider signing up for PS Plus Extra or even PS Plus Premium, but PS Plus Essential still offers plenty of value.

 <p>
  Indeed, PS Plus subscribers were treated to all kinds of high-quality free games throughout 2024, and now the last free games of the year have been released. The free PS Plus games for December 2024 are
  <em>
   Aliens: Dark Descent
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Temtem
  </em>
  . There's been somewhat of a mixed response to the free PS Plus games for December 2024, but subscribers should still give them a shot.

  <em>
   Aliens: Dark Descent
  </em>
  is a strategy game based on the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  franchise that received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release last year. While it's part of a niche genre, hardcore fans of the
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  films will definitely want to give it a shot, especially since they can claim it for free through their PS Plus subscription.
  <em>
   Temtem
  </em>
  , meanwhile, is a
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  -like MMO game that earned similar reviews to
  <em>
   Aliens: Dark Descent
  </em>
  . One's enjoyment of the game will likely depend on how much they enjoy the monster-catching genre, but it's certainly one of the more well-regarded
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  clones out there.

  The headlining new addition to the PS Plus December 2024 lineup is certainly
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  , the 2021 Game of the Year winner from Josef Fares and Hazelight Studios.
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  earned widespread critical acclaim at the time of its launch and is generally considered one of the best co-op games ever made. The catch is that co-op is a requirement, meaning players have to find a partner if they want to play through the game themselves. Needless to say, that should be much easier now that
  <em>
   It Takes Two
  </em>
  is free through PS Plus and a lot more people will have access to it.

  The
  <em>
   <strong>
    Red Dead Redemption
   </strong>
  </em>
  saga first began when Rockstar acquired Angel Studios, who was working on a title called
  <em>
   Red Dead Revolver
  </em>
  for Capcom at the time, as well as the rights to the IP. And while Rockstar's other franchises like
  <em>
   Bully
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  often focused entirely on the exploits of male characters,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  has been a series where Rockstar has shown an ability to craft truly fascinating and memorable female characters. The criticism of Rockstar's female characters in other franchises has been well-earned, but the women of
  <em>
   Red Dead
  </em>
  have proven to be some true standouts in their long history.

 <p>
  In this expansive, cinematic exploration of the final days of the American Frontier,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  has seen some of the most intricate and well-developed stories in both the open-world genre and the entire industry. Despite how male-centric the cast is, the women of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  often play some very important roles, and some of them are even more interesting than the leading men. They have played pivotal roles in the journeys of the leads, either through assisting them in their criminal escapades or becoming crucial to the redemption that the series title alludes to. They have been heroes, villains, and everything in between.

   <strong>
    Updated on December 3rd, 2024, by Maddie Fisher:
   </strong>
   The women of Red Dead Redemption are just as multi-faceted and compelling as their male counterparts, as this epic franchise has chronicled the rise and fall of Old West. This list of the
   <strong>
    best Red Dead Redemption female characters
   </strong>
   has been updated to include new galleries, showcasing these characters in full force. They are rich, flawed women who are just as deserving of praise as the men of Red Dead. As a result of Red Dead taking place across multiple different generations, it's able to explore the women of the Old West in numerous different ways and these are the ones that have stood out the most.

 <p>
  Many of
  <em>
   Red Dead's
  </em>
  best female characters can be seen as being stronger than the males, as in some ways they had to work twice as hard during a time of inequality between men and women. And one way women could take advantage was by using their femininity, something that Mary-Beth Gaskill does quite well in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  It's exactly what makes Mary-Beth so intriguing, as she doesn't quite seem to fit into the darker, more violent activities that Arthur and the Van der Linde gang get into. Her quiet, softer demeanor is a fairly sharp contrast between the atrocities of the Old West and her unique role in the story.

  Not only is
  <em>

  home to some of Rockstar's best female characters, but Susan also bucks a few trends in that she's an older lady. This demographic is somewhat underrepresented across the entire industry, so Susan Grimshaw is a welcome addition. This matriarchal outlaw is one of the Van der Linde gang's most charming members, adding some grit to an already grizzled crew.

  Mary Linton has courted a bit of a reputation with the
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  fan base, as her role in the 2018 sequel is hotly debated. But while one may dislike Mary for her actions throughout
  <em>
   RDR2
  </em>
  and her interactions with Arthur, it's hard to argue that she's one of the franchise's most compelling female characters. Like many of Red Dead's most interesting and fascinating characters, Mary Linton isn't regarded as a hero. She is a selfish person, a woman who carries a heavy burden in a lawless time, but that's all a part of what makes her such a unique character to watch.

 <p>
  Mary and Arthur's doomed relationship is just one part of what makes her such a fascinating character. Caught between her love for an outlaw and the desire to help her family, Mary is given time to be shown as a woman who has a lot of plates spinning. Her complex journey and relationship with Arthur form some of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's most poignant scenes.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption
   </em>
  </strong>
  was one of the best games of the seventh generation of consoles, as the open-world cowboy game placed players in the boots of John Marston for the first time. Along the way, Marston meets a huge roster of fascinating heroes and villains, but perhaps none of them are as undervalued as much as Luisa Fortuna, a young revolutionary who is a part of some of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption's
  </em>
  most interesting missions.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Her loyalty to Mexico and desire to create a better world for her sister Miranda plays a vital role. Her clashes with John and what the cowboy is willing to do become paramount to these missions, featuring some marvelous performances from both actors. She is a character driven by a multitude of different factors, as all of her interpersonal relationships with her sister and her problematic relationship with a freedom fighter named Reyes are what make Luisa as endlessly complicated as she is. She isn't just one of
  <em>
   Red Dead's
  </em>
  most interesting women; the missions she gives John make up some of the game's most exciting sequences.

  Abigail Marston is more than just John Marston's wife, as evidenced by her roles in both
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  . This hard-luck woman has a long, storied history that is all her own. As a result of her harsh life, some of which is chronicled in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  as the result of it being a prequel, she becomes fully formed into the fabulous character she is in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  She isn't a woman waiting for her husband to come home with open arms, but rather someone who has her own problems to deal with in the harsh realities of the Old West. The husband she lost to the outlaw life is secondary, as she is left to raise her son Jack in tough times and does so admirably. When John returns home during the events of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  , she is allowed to act as any normal person would instead of a stereotype. Abigail isn't a submissive wife but rather a courageous woman who showcases exactly how tough women have to be in order to survive these brutal and unforgiving times.

  In a world as male-dominated as the Old West, Bonnie is something of a game changer in that she runs the MacFarlane Ranch. This fiercely independent and charming lady introduces players to the world of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  , saving John Marston from certain death and helping him get back on his feet. From there, Bonnie becomes one of John's closest and loyal friends throughout the game.

 <p>
  She has since become one of
  <em>
   Red Dead's
  </em>
  most popular characters, as she exemplified exactly what it means to survive the time period and did so with unlimited charm and wit. The close bond and friendship between Bonnie and John is truly one of the highlights of the original game, as their undeniable chemistry and somewhat awkward introduction to each other is absolutely delightful. Bonnie has remained one of the franchise's best characters, even being briefly mentioned in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2

  It's safe to say that there was no supporting character in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  as popular as Sadie Adler. The desire for a single-player story DLC with her in the leading role hasn't ceased. Driven by revenge and retribution for the death of her husband Jake at the hands of O'Driscolls, Sadie is one of the Van der Linde gang's most intriguing and compelling members.

  The performance of Alex McKenna truly gives Sadie so much life and spirit as she takes her on a journey of discovery and an effort to find peace of mind after Jake's death. Her journey from a broken woman to a strong, confident warrior is absolutely one of the game's most fantastic elements. It's a wonderful character to watch grow alongside both Arthur Morgan and then later John Marston. Sadie broke the barriers of what it meant to be a woman in the gang, showing she truly belonged in its operations and is one of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2's
  </em>
  finest-written and performed characters.

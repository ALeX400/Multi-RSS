  Few mediums are filled with titles as broad and compelling as
  <strong>
   anime
  </strong>
  . Just like with any other form of TV, movies, novels, or video games, some titles hit and some miss, but regardless of what genres and styles viewers are a fan of, there will be an anime out there to meet that need. This style of animation hasn't just punctuated TV and film from Japan for decades but has also crossed over a fair bit into video games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many anime series get some incredibly high-quality adaptions into video game format. Much like the adaptation of movies into video games, this is a practice that isn't as common anymore, but there are still plenty of video games that exist as interactive parallels to arcs and narratives from prolific anime series. Just going back a few console generations, however, reveals a plethora of anime series that found new stories to tell in the video game medium. T
  <strong>
   hese PS2-exclusive titles
  </strong>
  <strong>
   are some of the best anime adaptions around
  </strong>
  , and still hold up as excellent games today.

  An excellent 3D third-person title with some fairly advanced open-world capabilities considering its 2004 release date,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Astro Boy
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a title in line with video game giants like
  <em>
   Spyro
  </em>
  , though it blends 3D platforming with a greater emphasis on exploration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some incredibly intense boss battles punctuate plot beats throughout the game, and it featured a day/night cycle that was once again ahead of its time for 3D games of the era. This title plays like a classic episode of
  <em>
   Astro Boy
  </em>
  and controls as fluidly and gracefully as one could hope for.

    Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey To Jaburo
   </strong>
  </em>
  is an incredibly expansive game based on the anime
  <em>
   Mobile Suit Gundam,

  is about.

 <p>
  After players complete the wonderfully dense story mode, a missions-based mode is unlocked, which allows players to experience a small bout of quests from the perspective of the Federation or Zeon.

  A slightly altered parallel to one of the earlier arcs in the anime,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shaman King: Power of Spirits
   </em>
  </strong>
  fuses two genres that wouldn't share much space together for a very long time. Even then, no game has truly melded fighting and strategic gameplay in the way that this one did.
 </p>
 <p>
  While operating at first on a top-down level like a strategy RPG, when the player ends their turn next to an enemy, it prompts a new battle mode that operates very much like a fighting game, where players clash against AI opponents.

  For the most part,
  <em>
   Fullmetal Alchemist
  </em>
  is not a series known for its video games. They never really made much of an impact and were often seen as little more than facsimiles of the proper anime and manga series, never fully capturing the depth of either original version.
 </p>
 <p>
  An exception to this rule, however, was the extremely compelling
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir
   </strong>
   .
  </em>
  This beat-'em-up is a strong title with plenty of interesting combos to pull off and some fantastic handling. It's a shorter game mostly geared towards existing
  <em>
  </em>
  <em>
   Fullmetal Alchemist

  fans, but thanks to a quality combat system, even series newbies will get something out of this title.

  Just as the name implies,
  <strong>
   Hero-Shooters
  </strong>
  are games where players can choose from a wide range of heroes, operators, or champions before entering the battlefield, all of whom will suit specific roles and possess unique abilities. While hero shooters have been around for many years, it was really Valve's immensely popular
  <em>
   Team Fortress 2
  </em>
  that ushered the sub-genre into the mainstream. Nowadays, the market is flooded with these kinds of titles, all of which range significantly in their quality, gunplay, and most importantly for this list, the number of heroes they offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding a new hero to a game can be risky for developers, as they can end up being too strong for their own good, but on the other hand, more characters mean a greater variety of playstyles to choose from. With that being said, anyone itching to get into a hero shooter that gives them plenty of heroes to play around with should check out these tiles below, which contain the greatest variety of heroes in the entire genre.

  The
  <em>
   Quake
  </em>
  games have always been loved by fans for their fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping gunplay, and it's fair to say
  <em>
   Quake Champions
  </em>
  continues this tradition, while also adding a touch of strategy to the frantic gameplay. This is achieved through the introduction of Champions, who all possess an active ability, which can be thrown out to catch an enemy off guard and deal damage, alongside a passive ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  While many longtime fans were skeptical whether these abilities would disrupt the fairness of matches, considering Quake has always been largely based around skilled gunplay, they have been toned down over time to help maintain an even playing field. However, while these techniques may be a lot weaker, they are still strong enough to ensure each and every Champion feels more than capable of holding their own in a fight.

  Despite developers Splash Damage discontinuing their support for
  <em>
   Dirty Bomb
  </em>
  in 2018, they still managed to pack in a decent number of Mercs into this chaotic hero shooter. All the Mercs carry their own weapons and equipment into battle, allowing players to decide whether they want to go for a sneaky, tactical, or all-guns-blazing approach when trying to reach the objective.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking of objectives, some Mercs are more designed for hunkering down and fortifying key positions, while others do better at roaming the map, so being able to have a diverse team of characters is a must for having a chance of winning a game. Though no more Mercs will be added to
  <em>
   Dirty Bomb
  </em>
  in the future, the game still has a decent player base even to this day, so it's still well worth trying out for anyone interested in seeing what these Mercs are all about.

 <p>
  In most hero-shooter games, players are encouraged to dive head-first into the heat of battle to throw out attacks and abilities as soon as possible, but
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  plays a little differently. Many people have called
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  a hero-shooter rendition of
  <em>
   Counter-Strike
  </em>
  , and it's an apt comparison considering the game takes a much slower and more tactical approach than many other hero shooters out there right now. While each of the Agents comes with unique sets of abilities that can help them out when bullets start to fly, these can only be acquired with cash at the beginning of each round.
 </p>
 <p>
  This ensures players aren't just relying on their abilities for an entire match, encouraging them to focus more on their gunplay, especially since this is a game where most guns are one-shot headshot, meaning a good aim is pretty much a necessity for scoring wins. Considering the massive popularity of
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  , and now that it's available on all systems, Riot will continue adding in more Agents at a steady pace to keep the experience fresh and fun.

 <p>
  Speaking of experimental hero-shooters,
  <em>
   Apex Legends
  </em>
  is another game that decided to take a rather unique path by diving into the battle royale genre, while still retaining the hero mechanic. With players being inserted into teams of three with up to 60 players in total on a map at one time, the games needed to have a plentiful selection of Legends to prevent the same faces from popping up too often, and it's fair to say that there's a healthy selection to choose from.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since launching in 2019, Respawn has committed itself to updating the game, not just with balance changes and new cosmetics, but also through adding in extra Legends that are suited to one of the game's five roles. Separating the Legends this way makes it very easy for newcomers to get an idea of what each character brings to the table, and with this being a team game, all of them harbor abilities that can bolster their comrades in some way or another, making for some pretty creative character kits.

  Considering
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  is a free-to-play game that only dropped a few months after its announcement, many people assumed it would be pretty light in terms of characters and gameplay. It was therefore a pleasant surprise when players booted up the game and scrolled over to see more than 30 characters up for grabs, all of which separated into either the Duelists, Vanguard, or Strategist role.
 </p>
 <p>
  One reason
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  has managed to retain much of its player base since launch is the unique ways these heroes can be used in battle. For example, having two specific characters on the same team can activate specific buffs, such as Captain America gaining a lightning shield from Thor, or Bucky receiving infinite ammo when Rocket Raccoon is around. Of course, being Marvel, there's an endless pool of heroes and villains that developers NetEase can pull from, and with their promise of supporting the game for many years to come, fans all have their own wishlists for who else they want to be added to the already massive roster.

  When
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  was first released back in 2016, it received a lot of praise from fans and critics, not just for its rock-solid and satisfying gameplay, but also the dazzling character designs. At the end of the day, nothing less would be expected from Blizzard, but even after so many years, the developers are still continuing to pump out new characters with flashy designs to gawk at, along with a ton of skins that can be bought for each one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of how long
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  has been around, most players have become well-accustomed to the traditional gameplay loop, which is why the introduction of a new Hero is always such a big occasion since they can have a pretty sizable impact when they enter the battlefield. Whether it's Brigitte merging the Tank and Support classes into one, or Kiriko being able to instantly teleport to her comrades, these are just some examples of how new Heroes can spice up matches in their own special ways.

  Hi-Rez has proven that, when it comes to creating a colorful and compelling cast of playable characters, they are one of the very best in the industry. While they had already showcased this variety with their MOBA game,
  <em>
   Smite
  </em>
  , they would really begin to flex their creative muscles with
  <em>
   Paladins
  </em>
  . With over 50 Paladins to choose from, players are certainly spoiled for choice, but thankfully, all of these unique characters differ in how complex they are to play.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, while Jenos and Seris are easy beginner-friendly Champions who can contribute to the team through their healing powers, someone like Nyx, who requires more strategy and quick thinking, can take a little getting used to. This is far from a bad thing though, as it means players can gradually work their way up the skill ladder, testing out trickier Champions as they go.

  Not long after
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  's
  <em>
  </em>
  release in 2015, Ubisoft claimed their goal was to eventually get 100 unique Operators in the game. Back then, it seemed more like a joke than something they truly believed in, but this tactical shooter has grown so popular and is updated so frequently, that this number now actually seems pretty believable. Operators in
  <em>
   Siege
  </em>
  are classed as either Attackers or Defenders, and each one comes with their own set of weapons, equipment, and gadgets to use during a round.
 </p>
 <p>
  The gadgets are the real game changers, as these quirky tools are what make the game so strategic. Some Operators, for example, can use cameras to snoop out incoming enemies, while others can throw out explosive drones to cause some carnage and disorganize the opposing team. There are also Operators known as Breachers, whose job is to blow a hole into the bomb site to provide an easy access point for the rest of their team. This is only the tip of the iceberg concerning what these Operators have to offer, and with the brand-new
  <em>
   Siege X
  </em>
  giving the game a much-needed overhaul, there's never been a better time to dive into the hero shooter which includes the most characters of them all.

  Board games and strategy video games share a deep connection. Both emphasize critical thinking, tactical decision-making, and long-term planning. This connection is even evident in mechanics, where turn-based gameplay, resource management, and board placement serve as common ground. The crossover is so natural that many beloved tabletop games have inspired video adaptations, and vice versa. However, what truly draws board game fans to strategy video games is the genre's ability to balance complexity and accessibility, providing layers of depth without overwhelming players.
 </p>
 <p>
  For lovers of classic tabletop experiences that require thoughtful pacing, or deck-battling adventures filled with competitive tension, there's a digital counterpart ready to scratch that same strategic itch. From turn-based tactics to resource-driven campaigns, these strategy games can immerse fans of board games in the same kind of satisfying, strategic gameplay found on a game night with friends.

   Slipways
  </em>
  simplifies the complexities of the 4X strategy genre, transforming it into a puzzle-like journey of galactic expansion. Rather than grappling with convoluted micromanagement or juggling numerous tasks, as seen in many similar spacefaring civilization games, this game focuses on a more straightforward premise: establishing trade routes between planets. It's a relatively simple task that requires meeting the resource demands of new planets to integrate them into a growing trade network. The endgame is to fine-tune the galaxy's economy and maximize prosperity, culminating in a total score based on performance at the end of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  What will attract board game enthusiasts to
  <em>
   Slipways
  </em>
  is its strong resemblance to various optimization puzzles found in many board games. In these puzzles, success is achieved by creating the most efficient and interconnected systems. Furthermore, it offers an accessible experience that is quick to play — games usually last just a couple of hours. It also encourages multiple playthroughs thanks to the wide array of satisfying strategies available.

  A tactical roguelike that evokes the essence of a narrative-rich strategy board game,
  <em>
   Crying Suns
  </em>
  places players in command of a battleship as they explore a dying galaxy, making space jumps to various sectors. Along the way, they'll encounter random events and engage in tactical space battles on a compact hex-based grid. The combat system is a standout feature and a significant strength of the game. It unfolds in pausable real-time, allowing players to issue orders and maneuver squadrons to unleash fire on the enemy. The emphasis is on strategic positioning and fleet management.
 </p>
 <p>
  With its turn-based combat and randomized events, the gameplay is strikingly similar to
  <em>
   Faster Than Light (FTL)
  </em>
  . However, this game features a much grittier aesthetic and a substantial narrative that provides a rich experience of world-building combined with an equally engaging strategic adventure. For fans of sci-fi board games,
  <em>
   Crying Suns
  </em>
  is worth a look.

  is perhaps the game on this list that most closely resembles a physical board game, because it essentially is one. Using a tabletop environment on a hexagonal board, players traverse a fantasy kingdom as adorable, occasionally maniacal animal characters, engaging in battles and leveling up, all while employing various strategies in an attempt to secure victory. The game features turn-based mechanics for movement, decision-making, and combat. Combat revolves around a combination of card battling and dice rolling, where stats are influenced by collected cards, gear, and special effects, which are then converted into dice for attacking and defending.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Armello
  </em>
  boils down to a charming strategy game with a nice mix of skill, chance, and tactics to create a pleasurable experience. By taking full advantage of its digital format, it eliminates the need for tracking damage numbers or dealing with the setup often required by physical board games. The game also offers options for both competitive and private matches with up to three friends, turning a traditional tabletop game night into a seamless digital affair.

   <em>
    Castle Crashers
   </em>
  </strong>
  has firmly entered nostalgia territory in recent years. The medieval hack-and-slash from The Behemoth was originally released on Xbox 360 in 2008 and has seen ports for PlayStation, PC, and the Nintendo Switch. Helmed by developers Dan Paladin and Tom Fulp, the game incorporates graphics and humor reminiscent of old Newgrounds.com cartoons.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the ability to play as four characters at once, there are a plethora of unlockable heroes to choose from, giving the game endless replayability. While it might take quite a bit to unlock each one of them, these are
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  characters that the best of the best players tend to prefer in their playthroughs.

  <em>
   : In a surprise to many Castle Crashers fans, the iconic indie beat-em-up is getting its first DLC in over a decade. Titled "Painter Boss Paradise," the DLC will introduce new levels, playable characters, and adventures for those who were addicted to the game after it originally released in 2008. For now, fans have to wait until summer of 2025 to access Painter Boss Paradise, but if they're naturally feeling the inclination to do another playthrough of Castle Crashers, we thought we'd remind you which characters are the best.

 </p>
 <p>
  And for those who have somehow never played the game who want to experience it before the DLC drops later this year, have no fear! This is your ultimate guide to the best characters in Castle Crashers... for now!

  Despite being one of the four main characters playable from the start of the game, Green Knight is sadly the worst of the bunch. It's a shame, because Green Knight is the only character in
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  who can use the Poison element, which is especially useful in some instances due to its ability to inflict enemies with poison damage over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, where Green Knight suffers is in his inability to pull off combos as well as the other main characters. Even though his poison-coated specials are very good, falling short of plain ol' DPS in a hack-and-slash like
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  is kind of a non-starter. Still, if you're starting the game new with a party of four, only one of you will get to play around with poison magic.

  As one of the easiest characters to unlock in
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  , there might be a lot of players who underestimate just how good the Grey Knight can be in the right hands. Players just need to complete some of the earliest levels to unlock this element-less knight, who is often seen fighting alongside players as an NPC ally throughout the story, though he's far from a unique fighter.
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of his magic and specials, Grey Knight shares a lot of its glory with the Conehead, thanks to the incredibly useful Bomb projectile. Though he doesn't deal as much damage per second as those other, much harder to unlock characters, the simple fact that you can unlock Grey Knight early in the game makes it a great addition to any playthrough.

  Killer Beekeeper is one of the most unique characters in
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  , especially since they only sparsely appear as enemies in the Flowery Field level and no others. To unlock this character, players only need to complete the entire game with the Barbarian, who's one of the starting characters in all versions of
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of the Beekeeper's magic attacks incorporate summoning bees, which can be very devastating for enemies that fly in mid-air. While the bees themselves aren't exactly the best sidekicks, as they're very frail, their massive hitboxes and convenient use make Beekeeper not just a strong character, but a very useful one at that.

  The Brute is practically a carbon copy of another playable character, Snakey, albeit they differ in their projectiles. Snakey utilizes a simple Dagger projectile, while Brutes have the more unique Acorn, which is comparable in power. However, where the Brute truly excels over its counterpart is its starting weapon: the Dual Prong Sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Snakey's signature mace powers up a user's magic and agility, the Dual Prong Sword boosts strength and defense. It's also typically a weapon that only level 20 users can wield, but Brutes can use one right from the get-go. The extra strength from an early stage definitely makes this iteration of the character the superior one to venture through the game with.

  It may seem surprising that the Orange Knight ranks lower than the Fire Demon, another Fire user. However, Orange Knight isn't as strong as the character he unlocks, particularly concerning his magic attacks. The one thing Orange Knight boasts over the Fire Demon is having better range with his magic, as well as the simple fact that he's available from the very start of the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  What makes the Orange Knight's higher-ranged Splash Attack especially preferable to Fire Demon's is that it also costs less to use. This can be especially helpful during boss fights, as players can take advantage of the farther range to deal massive damage with its rapid attacks. Fire in general is also a beloved element for how many common minions it's super-effective against.

  Like how the Orange Knight is a lesser version of the Fire Demon, Iceskimo is a lesser version of the Blue Knight. Among the Iceskimo's worst qualities is the fact that its ice attacks, unlike the Blue Knight, don't freeze enemies. As a result, it's hard to gain the same benefits from a character who players start the game with, but perhaps it's a good alternate if Blue Knight is already taken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Iceskimo especially becomes powerful when paired with a weapon that boosts both magic and strength, like the NG Golden Sword, though the Fishing Spear it starts with isn't terrible with those stats, either. Sadly, while the Orange Knight had a cheaper cost to its Splash Attack, Iceskimo's only increases in cost the more players upgrade the character.

  fans will recognize this character in the Tall Grass Field level, as the henchman of the Catfish boss. They're unlocked once players complete the entire main story with the Skeleton character, offering some neat perks of their own. For starters, the characters' "Splash Attack" creates a tornado that can last for up to 15 seconds and can devastate enemies.
 </p>
 <p>
  A lot of the Bear's other attacks involve wind-based projectiles and high jumps, allowing for a character with a lot of movement to their attacks. They're best paired with a Strength class weapon, given that they can deal massive amounts of damage while keeping enemies on their toes, though some players might just keep the default Club for its decent damage output.

  Though this character was a DLC-exclusive in the console versions of
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  , players can use Blacksmith right from the get-go in
  <em>
   Castle Crashers: Remastered Edition
  </em>
  . This NPC runs the Blacksmith shop throughout the main game, but when chosen as a playable character, offers some interesting benefits, including the use of its sidekick, the Weapons Frog.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of the Blacksmith's attacks involve a small copy of the Weapons Frog, using its tongue to damage foes from far away. The Blacksmith also has a Flaming Hammer projectile, which will deal fire damage over time to enemies who are hit by it. He might not be the best character in the entire game, but he has enough originality to make some players prefer the challenge of using him.

  Like the Blacksmith, Pink Knight was another DLC-exclusive starter character. While each of the knights utilizes their own elemental attacks, Pink Knight's attacks are non-elemental but completely unique, summoning rainbows, plush animals, and other cute and cuddly creatures. Their default weapon is even a Lollipop, considered one of the best starting weapons in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Pink Knight may seem like a very friendly character, but their attacks can pack a punch. Their Splash Attack, Rainbow Chain, shoots a rainbow that stuns enemies into giving a peace sign, leaving them open for combo attacks. Its jump attack also summons a cute pink weasel to launch them into the air, making this character both practical as well as fun to show off.

  Of all the playable characters in
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  , the Ninja is the most self-explanatory. Their choice of weapon is a Sai, and their attacks are all reminiscent of iconic ninja tropes, from creating smokescreens that hold off hordes of enemies or throwing shurikens as their projectile. But where the Ninja shines is in boss battles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of the Ninja's magic attacks, this character is the perfect choice against massive enemies or bosses, such as its Elemental Infusion attack "Armor Pierce," which deals double damage. Plus, its projectile helps deal decent damage against bosses from a distance, while the smokescreen Splash Attack has a high DPS.

  Although Coneheads appear like regular knights with pointy helmets, they have one special quirk that puts them above the rest of the enemies-turned-playable: the Light Saber. But that's not all; the Conehead also comes with an extremely useful projectile in Bombs, which can not only deal massive amounts of damage to enemies but can reveal secret passageways and hidden areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Conehead shares this projectile, as well as its raining arrows Splash Attack, with the Royal Guard, making them pretty equivalent characters to use. However, what sets the Conehead apart from the Royal Guard is the Light Saber itself, which boosts agility, with an increased chance of having attacks be embued with the electricity element.

  For characters that heavily utilize the fire element, some
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  players might go for the standard Orange Knight. However, the Fire Demon is an improvement on the Orange Knight on practically all fronts, from how it can handle boss battles to even its Splash Attack. With its Splash Attack, the Fire Demon summons pillars of fire from the ground, up to seven at a higher level.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Orange Knight's Splash Attack has a better range than the Fire Demon, the Fire Demon's closer range is better for dealing with hordes of enemies at once. Plus, its use of fire in its attacks will leave enemies with an afterburn that's much higher than the Orange Knight's, making it a true fire demon in every sense of the word.

  There aren't many Ice-centric characters in
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  , especially ones that have the edge over the standard Blue Knight. The Iceskimo character shares a lot of similar combo attacks but can't freeze enemies as the Blue Knight does. This is integral to many of the Blue Knight's attacks, like its Splash Attack that freezes enemies with a high magic cost.
 </p>
 <p>
  It also helps that even the Blue Knight's projectile attack, a powerful icy shard, deals a great amount of damage with the potential to freeze as well. However, players will likely want to find a stronger weapon than the Blue Knight's default sword, and they should be aware of how much magic some of these attacks cost, as they can become depleted very fast even at high levels.

  It might seem confusing that the Red Knight utilizes electricity element attacks, but thankfully it's part of what makes the Red Knight such a great character. Its electrical moves, such as its lightning bolt-summoning Splash Attack, freeze enemies in place while they're being hit. This can be especially helpful for co-op play, allowing teammates to string combos with ease.
 </p>
 <p>
  The one downside of the Red Knight is its projectile, with both its grounded and airborne iterations quite lackluster in reach and power. Thankfully, the usefulness of the Splash Attack as well as its raw power, being able to one-shot most enemies aside from bosses, makes Red Knight the go-to choice for players just starting their
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  adventure.

  Industrialists are encountered as enemies in the aptly named Industrial Castle, with their attacks incorporating heavy machinery. Their starting weapon, the Ugly Mace, gives a solid defensive boost at the cost of some magic power, which can come at a detriment to the Industrialist's magic attacks, which have ridiculous range and are fast enough to boost DPS.
 </p>
 <p>
  Its Splash Attack is also a certified boss-killer, summoning a buzzsaw trap that hits fast albeit with weaker damage output than most other Splash Attacks. As a bonus, the Industrialist's Splash Attack also lasts for a long time, allowing them to set one off to deal constant damage to bosses or rid hordes of enemies with ease.

  Easily the best character in
  <em>
   Castle Crashers
  </em>
  is the Fencer, who prioritizes speed over all else, a necessary quality for a hack-and-slash game. Their default weapon, the Foil, offers minor boosts in strength, magic, and agility, and the character shares all its Splash Attacks and projectiles with the Industrialist, with the added benefit of being incredibly speedy.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, unlocking the Fencer requires players to complete the entire main game with the Industrialist, so those players will likely find themselves upgrading when they switch over to the Fencer. That being said, there's no wrong character for players to pick as long as they're having fun exploring and kicking butt with their friends in

  Tuxedo Labs has announced that its game
  <strong>
   <em>
    Teardown
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set to add multiplayer support this spring.
  <em>
   Teardown
  </em>
  was released back in 2022, bringing with it a number of heists set in a fully destructible voxel-based world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since its launch,
  <em>
   Teardown
  </em>
  has received a variety of updates, adding new maps, characters, and a creative mode. All of these updates have added new content for fans to use
  <em>

  </em>
  's extensive destructive tools in a number of different ways. Updates for
  <em>
   Teardown
  </em>
  have been both paid and free, with the most recent free addition introducing a variety of characters to play as. The paid updates have brought new maps for players to explore. Now, an upcoming update this spring will bring one of the most requested features to the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a new announcement video, the
  <em>
   Teardown
  </em>
  developers revealed that multiplayer is the next big update coming to the game this spring. The video showcases the game's destructive nature, as well as the recently added characters. Beyond this, no other additional details were revealed about the new multiplayer update. This announcement marks the first major update for one of gaming's best immersive sims this year. While not much is known about the future beyond this update, an available roadmap sheds some light on what’s to come.

 <p>
  Looking past the multiplayer update,
  <em>
   Teardown
  </em>
  's roadmap lists three additional updates to look forward to. As of now, these DLCs are only listed as DLC 3, DLC 4, and "QUILEZ R0113R ROBOT," which will include a spawnable robot in the game. It is currently unclear if DLC 3 will be the multiplayer update, though this seems unlikely since paid
  <em>
   Teardown
  </em>
  updates have involved new maps. The roadmap has already seen two releases, including the Time Campers and Folkrace DLCs. Despite the base game having "Very Positive" reviews on Steam, each DLC currently sits at "Mixed," with fans finding the DLCs a bit too expensive compared to the base game. Among the updates to come, developers are sure to add to

  has continued to get better as time has gone on. While new content is always great, new features such as multiplayer will only improve the game's experience. Even though the reception to DLC's has been more critical, many still consider

  to be one of the best heist games available.

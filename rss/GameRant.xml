	Being a melee fighter in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Enshrouded
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is risky. Enemies are deadly, and if you fluke your parries or mismanage your stamina, you'll be in for some heavy punishment. However, if built properly, melee characters can withstand everything the Shroud throws at them.

	The following is an
	<em>
	 Enshrouded
	</em>
	tank build that's capable of absorbing damage while healing the player back up to full health. You don't need to get to
	<em>
	 Enshrouded's
	</em>
	max level to reach the very core of the build, but having at least 50 skill points is recommended to truly make the setup shine.

		Updated June 7, 2024 by Marc Santos:
	 </em>
	</strong>
	<em>
	 Enshrouded's Melodies of the Mire update brought a number of big changes to combat balancing, including major improvements to melee playstyles. Apart from making two-handed weapons much more viable in the late game, players can now expect parrying to be a much more effective and rewarding tactic following buffs to the parrying power of shields as well as some core skills meant to take advantage of stunned opponents. This guide has been updated to include two parry-focused skills to serve as alternatives for players who want a more reactive playstyle.

	This build makes use of major and minor nodes in two of the four melee-oriented skill tree branches, namely the Warrior and Tank skill lines. A few points are sprinkled into the green skill branches only for the sake of getting Double Jump and some of the other best skills to get first in
	<em>
	 Enshrouded.

 <p>
	The two most important parts of this
	<em>
	 Enshrouded
	</em>
	tank build are
	<strong>
	 Thick Skin
	</strong>
	and
	<strong>
	 Battle Heal
	</strong>
	. The former increases your Constitution based on your Flame level, while the latter restores 5% of your maximum HP every time you critically strike. Combined, these two skills contribute the most to your self-sustain, allowing you to stay in the fight for longer. Every other point spent in this build are self-explanatory boosts to your offensive and defensive stats.

 <p>
	If you have spare skill points, get the
	<strong>
	 Well-Rested
	</strong>
	and
	<strong>
	 Inner Fires
	</strong>
	passives so you can get free increases to your Rested buff and Shroud timers.
	<strong>
	 Dessert Stomach
	</strong>
	in the
	<strong>
	 Survivor
	</strong>
	tree is also a great QoL skill to have.

	Following the Melodies of the Mire update, players can expect melee builds to be stronger across the board. This build remains as-is, though players might want to try experimenting with the following skills:

 <ul>
	<li>
	 <strong>
		Merciless Strike:
	 </strong>
	 Perform a power attack against an overpowered (stunned) enemy.
	</li>
	<li>
	 <strong>
		Opportunity:

 <p>
	The original build focuses on directly attacking enemies to deal damage and sustain health via lifesteal. These two skills, however, skew the playstyle more toward parrying and overpowering enemies to trigger Merciless Strike, which got significantly buffed from the Melodies of the Mire patch. Shields have also received changes: some now have stronger blocking or parrying power. Keep this in mind when gearing up, and pick the playstyle you prefer.

	As for weapons,
	<strong>
	 one-handed
	</strong>
	<strong>
	 swords
	</strong>
	are preferred for this build. They're effective against the majority of enemies in the game, and they mostly deal Cutting damage by default, which will get boosted by the Slasher and Butcher passives from the skill tree. If you prefer using other types of one-handed weapon, respec your skills and get the passives for Blunt and Piercing damage types instead. The
	<strong>
	 most ideal sword
	</strong>
	for this build is one with
	<strong>
	 additional crit chance
	</strong>
	and
	<strong>
	 bonus Cutting damage
	</strong>
	. Pair it with the strongest shield you have.

	<em>
	 Monopoly
	</em>
	experience with cool additional features and a city-building element. In the game, players can move their pieces to earn money and then use that money to build new buildings, upgrade their houses, and much more. The ultimate goal is to drive other players into bankruptcy by acquiring all pieces of property, essentially creating a “monopoly.”

Luckily, there have been tons of new dice links popping up online. To help you score free dice, we’ve updated this guide to include the most recent and active links. Remember, Dice Links have expiration dates, so make sure to redeem them quickly before they disappear.

 <p>
	One fan of Bethesda's post-apocalyptic
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Fallout
	 </strong>
	</em>
	franchise has learned that the effects of the radiation-preventative drug Rad-X can be stacked to temporarily increase immunity.
	<em>
	 Fallout 3, Fallout 4
	</em>
	,
	<em>
	 New Vegas
	</em>
	, and even the online live service
	<em>
	 Fallout: 76
	</em>
	have all seen an enormous jump in player numbers since the release of Amazon's eight-episode
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	series in April. Due to the success of the show, more players have been roaming the wastes of
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	than ever before.

 <p>
	While exploring one of the many
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	wastelands, players will inevitably come across areas that are drenched in residual radiation from the atomic bombs. Players unequipped to handle such radiation may become poisoned, which can lead to death if not cured in a timely manner. Luckily, the wastelands also provide players ways to protect themselves against radiation in the form of drugs, otherwise known as "chems." Some of the most notable are Rad-X and RadAway. The former is most effectively used before heading into an irradiated area to temporarily mitigate radiation poisoning, while the latter can be used to wash away any gained radiation.

 <p>
	One
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	player has made an important discovery having to do with
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	's Rad-X chem. Reddit user Obethur posted a screenshot from the
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	Wiki which explained that the effects of Rad-X can be stacked by taking multiple doses at once. It's unclear which game the
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	Wiki screenshot is from, though Obethur posted in a
	<em>
	 Fallout 4
	</em>
	subreddit. Rad-X works differently from game to game. In
	<em>
	 New Vegas
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Fallout 3
	</em>
	, stacking Rad-X increases the duration of resistance, while in
	<em>
	 Fallout 4
	</em>
	it increases the resistance itself.

	Many players under the post expressed that the best way to avoid becoming irradiated in the

	wastelands is to find a hazmat suit or power armor, which almost fully negates radiation. Perks like Rad Resistance and Ghoulish can also be a big help. Other players shared their concern about relying on chems like Rad-X and RadAway for fear of becoming addicted to them. One fan shared that Addictol can help cure addictions in

	as can Refreshing Beverages, which cost a lot of valuable resources.

	Although the

	games have been out for a long time, it's interesting to see fans discovering new things about the franchise, especially after how massive
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	has become in the weeks and months following the acclaimed Amazon series. As the show draws more and more new players into
	<em>
	 Fallout 3, 4, 76,
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 New Vegas
	</em>
	, demand for
	<em>
	 Fallout 5
	</em>
	will likely skyrocket. Perhaps this may lead to Xbox and Bethesda pursuing a smaller
	<em>
	 Fallout
	</em>
	title with a different studio in the meantime to hold players over during the excruciatingly long wait for the fifth mainline installment, though nothing has been confirmed thus far.

	<strong>
	 <em>
		Destiny 2
	 </em>
	</strong>
	's The Final Shape expansion launched amid server stability issues that marred the experience for some players on day one, but between its story, gameplay, and design, it's rightfully sitting among the best releases for the game so far. Prismatic subclasses in
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	are as interesting as they can be powerful, with a mix of various Aspects, Fragments, and abilities from the Light and Darkness subclasses that can unlock new playstyles and combinations. This is a massive boon for buildcrafting, with a good example being how Hunters can now use Combination Blow with Stylish Executioner for great melee damage and constant invisibility, all while having Golden Gun as a Super.

 <p>
	Prismatic is not without flaws, however, and some new combinations have to rely on classic Exotic items that have been used for years, whereas some of the old meta staples are finding new life with The Final Shape Exotics. This is thanks to a few factors, such as
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	's sandbox changing with the expansion, as well as new tools being offered to Guardians. The prime example of this is the way Titan builds have changed with The Final Shape, but not all of it is necessarily a good or a bad change.

 <p>
	A problematic Exotic for a long time, Synthoceps are once again rising in usage for Prismatic Titan builds because they are a reliable way of getting more melee damage for the new hot combo of Knockout and Consecration, and they go well with Bladefury as well for extra Super damage.
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	's Synthoceps Titan Exotic has been one of the best for years because, on the one hand, Titan builds typically rely on some form of melee damage due to their melee focus in terms of design, and on the other hand, it's easy to proc the extra damage. It can stack with other sources like Banner of War, too, which drove Bungie to nerf this specific interaction in The Final Shape due to how dominant it was in Season of the Wish.

 <p>
	The fact that Synthoceps are still prevalent in the current meta highlights another problem, which is the lack of other solid options for Titan builds - be it in the core design of the class focusing too much on melee, or be it in terms of powerful Exotics. Prismatic Titan builds in
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	can make use of multiple Exotics and still provide players with fun loops, but in terms of raw damage, Synthoceps may be just too strong at the moment to leave behind.

		 It's worth noting that the new Exotic Class Items in Destiny 2's The Final Shape have yet to come out, but they might shake up the meta. Not only do they have Spirit of Synthoceps as one of their perks, but this will be available for all three classes.

	While Synthoceps are still a core part of many builds in The Final Shape, including Prismatic,
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	's new Hazardous Propulsion is set to become a must-have for DPS and general play in PvE as well as a great Exotic for PvP when combined with Drengr's Lash. What Hazardous Propulsion does is grant stacks of Exodus Rockets, up to six, which are then consumed when players use a class ability - including Thruster from Arc. The missiles then track and damage targets by a hefty amount, which is useful in and of itself.

 <p>
	However, the biggest factor that makes Hazardous Propulsion a great Exotic is that it increases the damage dealt by rocket launchers in
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	, as well as that of rocket-assisted sidearms and even the missiles from the Grand Overture Exotic machine gun. This is critical for DPS in PvE activities like Raids, as rocket launchers are already great for damage, and 6 stacks of Exodus Rockets provide 35% extra damage for 10 seconds. What follows is that old combinations like the trusted and true Apex Predator god roll with Reconstruction and Bait and Switch will still be meta, but this time with a dedicated, powerful Exotic that's fresh from The Final Shape.

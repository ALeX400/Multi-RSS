 <p>
  Just like their namesake, the protagonists of Rockstar games tend not to make the sort of thoughtful decisions that would ensure a long life. Larger-than-life, action-prone, and occasionally nihilistic, the stars of excessively violent games like
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  tend to be young guns who shoot first and ask questions later.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, as the studio aged, their storytelling aspirations also matured, as did their player's in-game avatars. Grizzled and world-weary, these protagonists are starting to feel the weight of the world after so many bank robberies and carjackings. Beware a few aged spoilers for games in the
  <em>
   Max Payne, Grand Theft Auto
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption
  </em>
  series.

  Johnny Klebitz, acting VP of the Lost Motorcycle Club, appears as a minor story in
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto

  but appears as the protagonist of the "The Lost and Damned" episode. As he appears in the episode, he is 34 years old.

 <p>
  With the player's help, Johnny survives the events of "The Lost and Damned" and rides on, all the way to his 39th birthday in 2013, where, as a non-playable character, he meets a grizzly fate when he is mercilessly killed by another protagonist, Trevor, in the desert during one of his temper tantrums in

  As a former hitman who survived a deadly ambush before rising to become Vice City's most powerful crime boss with a sweet mansion, it is a miracle that Tommy managed to outlive most of his peers (and even a few of his former superiors).
 </p>
 <p>
  Tommy Vercetti was born in 1951, and the story of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto: Vice City
  </em>
  takes place in 1986, which makes Tommy around 35 years old. Tommy survives at least until the time of
  <em>
   San Andreas
  </em>
  , which would put him at 41 years of age. If he managed to survive until 2025, he would be 74.

  Arthur Morgan spent his whole life as an outlaw but began questioning the cost of that lifestyle all too late. Born in 1863, Arthur is 36 years old in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  's story. By the standards of the late 1800s, Arthur is already approaching an old age.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most people in the olden days never reached their twenties, but Arthur's longevity cut short should hardly be a surprise given his violent and nomadic existence. Unfortunately, his hard life catches up to him when he contracts tuberculosis, leading to his inevitable and tragic demise before ever reaching his forties.

  Since his birth in 1873, John Marston hardly had an easy moment in his life. By 11, he had already killed a man, and around a year later, found himself inducted into a gang after narrowly avoiding a lynching.

 <p>

  Mentally disturbed and terrifyingly violent, it is scary to think what this guy would have been capable of in his "spring chicken" years. Trevor's exact age is never explicitly stated in GTA, but it is mentioned that he was around 20 years old at the end of the 80s.
 </p>
 <p>
  This would put him in his mid-40s by the time of
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  . Nothing that comes out of Trevor's mouth can be trusted given his demonstrable insanity, but his sun-damaged and time-haunted appearance does seem to back this up.

  Poor Max is living up to his name by the time his 50s come into view. Born in November of 1965, Max has endured a life of tragedy, action, and addiction. All that crazy bullet time starts to catch up with him by 2011 when he finds himself needing a regular dose of painkillers and a chaser of the hard stuff just to get out of bed.

 <p>
  The last the world sees of Max Payne is in 2012, making him 47 years old, seemingly willing to embrace healing and rest after years of revenge and brutality.

  According to Michael's tombstone (which he narcissistically visits during his funeral after faking his death), he was born in 1965. This would make Michael De Santa (known as Michael Townley in his past life) 48 by the time of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 5

  's story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus far, Michael is the oldest Rockstar protagonist to feature in his own story. Michael was last heard of in 2021, with confirmation that he was still working at Richard Majestic Studios as a movie producer, making him 56. However, he is never playable or actually seen in-game.

  <em>
   Curse of Osiris
  </em>
  was the first expansion for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  and many fans had high hopes for it prior to its release. Unfortunately, those hopes came crashing down to earth, falling flat like the expansion itself. It was somewhat reminiscent of the earlier expansions for the original game: rich in quantity but lacking in quality.
 </p>
 <p>
  The expansion added a few new locations and some story missions, but it felt more like a developer papering over the cracks than a real effort to improve or innovate. Worse still, it did little to enrich the endgame loop, which at the time was sorely needed. What made
  <em>
   Curse of Osiris
  </em>
  so disappointing though was not so much its meager offering, but that Bungie had seemingly learned nothing from their experiences with the first
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  game.

 <p>
  <em>
   The Dark Below
  </em>
  was the very first
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  expansion, and, at the time, nobody quite knew what to expect. The game had overcome some of its earlier teething problems and was starting to build up a head of steam. Sadly,
  <em>
   The Dark Below
  </em>
  offered little to help maintain the game's momentum. Perhaps that was to be expected though given its relatively low price.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Dark Below
  </em>
  expands upon many of the game's worst elements rather than introducing new ideas or building on the things that really worked. What little story development provided falls far too short and much of the length comes not from additional content but instead meaningless grinding.
  <em>
   The Dark Below
  </em>
  offers something new to do for those who have already reached the endgame, but very little else.

 <p>
  <em>
   Warmind
  </em>
  is the follow-up to
  <em>
   The Curse of Osiris
  </em>
  and thankfully avoids many of the mistakes that its predecessor made. It isn't perfect, but it was definitely a step in the right direction. It actually adds less to the game than
  <em>
   The Curse of Osiris
  </em>
  , but, as the old saying goes, less is sometimes more. The new story content feels meaningful and coherent – even if it is a little lacking in both ambition and length.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like many of the expansions that preceded it, much of the new content encourages grinding. Thankfully, the new weapons and the Masterworks update at least provide players with a decent reward for their hard work. As is often the case, busywork feels a lot less like busywork when there's a meaningful end goal to motivate players.

  Prior to the release of The Witch Queen and The Final Shape, the bar was set pretty low for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  expansions. Most players were happy just to be getting some new content and the occasional quality-of-life update, yet, with it coming right off the back of Shadowkeep, it was hard not to be disappointed with Beyond Light.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like a lot of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  expansions, Beyond Light boasts a fairly mediocre campaign, but the biggest complaint players had was with the way that it handled the sunsetting of older
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  content. With its release, players lost access to locations, weapons, and even entire campaigns, including The Red War and Warmind.

  After the disappointment of
  <em>
   The Dark Below
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   House of Wolves
  </em>
  provided Bungie with some much-needed redemption. It's everything that the earlier expansion should have been and felt like the moment that the developer started to really listen to what players were asking for rather than trying to shove unwanted content down their throats. Even for those who didn't enjoy the expansion, it was infinitely more palatable.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Vestian Outpost provided a nice change of scenery and the Prison of Elders arena activity offered a new experience at a time when much of the game's offerings were starting to become a little stale. It was by no means the perfect expansion and did little to draw new players into the game. It did, however, give existing ones a reason to stick around a little longer.

  After the success of The Witch Queen, Lightfall felt like a bit of a backward step to many
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players. It certainly has its positives, but these are largely overshadowed by the expansion's lackluster campaign and the fact that a lot of the content that it offers retreads old ground; clumsily, in most instances.
 </p>
 <p>
  All that said, exploring Neptune can be interesting, with the advanced man-made city of Neomuna offering something very different from most of the other in-game locations. The Strand subclass still holds up pretty well too, as do the many quality-of-life improvements that were introduced as part of the expansion.

  <em>
   Rise of Iron
  </em>
  was the final expansion for the first
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  game. While it was by no means a bad addition, it felt like a bit of an anticlimax. By this point, Bungie knew exactly what they were doing and which areas they needed to focus on, but it was a bare minimum type of effort rather than an attempt to go out with an emphatic bang.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story content was engaging and introduced some interesting ideas and characters, and the plethora of quest lines provided players with more than enough to keep them busy. Arriving two years after the game's release, though, many players had started to grow a little tired of the grind and were ready to move on to something new. Thankfully, with
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  looming large on the horizon, they wouldn't have to wait too much longer.

  <em>
   Shadowkeep
  </em>
  is the fourth major expansion for
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  and is up there with the very best. It's a little rough around the edges, but that doesn't detract too much from the refinement of some of the game's mechanics, nor the massive improvements it makes to the endgame. More than anything, it eased concerns over what the post-Activision era of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  would look like.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moon remains as cold and uninviting as ever, but in spite of the bleak scenery,
  <em>
   Shadowkeep
  </em>
  provides a colorful story. The new story content is rich in lore and does a great job of pulling players in. Unlike some of the earlier expansions, the disappointment of its short length comes more from players wanting more of a good thing than them feeling like they've been short-changed.

 <p>
  <em>
   Forsaken
  </em>
  ensured that Activision bowed out with a bang. The expansion provides many of the things that players had been hoping for and more than makes up for the mediocre offerings of the two expansions that came before it. It may have taken a year to achieve, but
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  finally felt like a worthy successor to the original game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The expansion brings with it a host of updates and new content that rewards those who stuck with the game while it was treading water during its infancy. The Gambit game mode is probably the best thing on offer, but there are plenty of other positives to be found in
  <em>
   Forsaken
  </em>
  . The new storyline has a lot of potential, although at times is held back by the game's substandard storytelling. It's not the worst out there, but is perhaps the only missed opportunity in an otherwise fantastic
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  expansion.

  <em>
   The Taken King
  </em>
  had a hefty price tag when it was first released. What's more, it also required the first two expansion packs in order to play it. Thankfully, it was worth every penny. It included a new story campaign, new enemies, and new locations. Pretty much new everything.
  <em>
   The Taken King
  </em>
  was almost like an entirely new game and couldn't have arrived at a better time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The new storyline was definitely the highlight of the expansion and helped to breathe life into the game just as it looked to be on its last legs. The update also brought with it a host of quality-of-life improvements that helped to streamline the
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  experience. In many ways, it felt like
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's coming of age and marked the moment that the game finally realized its full potential.

 <p>
  Arriving around half a decade on from the base game's initial release, The Witch Queen was to
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  what The Taken King was to
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  : the realization of a vision. In addition to offering an incredible story campaign, it introduces the Become Legend mode, which can make the game significantly more challenging for even the most battle-hardened
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether or not crafting was a worthwhile addition is perhaps debatable, but other than that, pretty much all of the new content manages to hit its mark. Had The Witch Queen been the final
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  expansion, it seems fair to say that most fans would have left satisfied, but the developers still had a lot more to offer.

  The Final Shape is not only the best
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  expansion, but also one of the best video game expansions of all time. Released in June of 2024, it provides players with a satisfying conclusion to the decade-long Light and Darkness saga through its thrilling and at times challenging story campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
  It feels like an expansion that was made for the fans and a fitting way to wave farewell to a narrative experience that has meant so much to so many over the years. Whether or not Bungie goes on to release more
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  expansions or instead opts to focus on smaller content updates from here on out, the 2017 title now has nothing left to prove.

  Returning to Thirdborn means witnessing the Dreamscourge slowly spreading through Shatterscarp and infecting people left and right. Even Temerti seems to be affected and is starting to mix reality with dreams, hinting she's infected by the plague.

   Party Camps

  are a hub area where the Envoy can take care of several important tasks. Every major region in the game has multiple Party Camps spread throughout the map, but players will have to locate them before they become available to use. And while it's true that the Envoy simply unlocking one Party Camp will grant you access to the most important functions, like upgrading and enchanting weapons, the fact that Party Camps double as bonus fast-travel points is just one reason why players should unlock them all. In this guide, we'll show you
  <strong>
   where to find every Party Camp in

      <title>The Best Action-RPGs To Play If You Love Diablo</title>

 <p>
  Despite going through its share of ups and downs over the last 15 years, Blizzard's
  <em>
   <strong>
    Diablo
   </strong>
  </em>
  is still arguably the definitive action RPG franchise, at least within its subgenre. 1997's
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  and 2000's
  <em>
   Diablo 2
  </em>
  helped define isometric dungeon-crawlers, and they are still impressive as long as somebody goes in with realistic expectations since they are over 20 years old by this point. Their success inspired many developers to try their hands at crafting
  <strong>
   action RPGs like
   <em>
    Diablo
   </em>
  </strong>
  , to mixed results.
 </p>

 <p>
  Nowadays, 2021's
  <em>
   Diablo 2: Resurrected
  </em>
  serves as a good entry point into the franchise for newcomers who want to start with the older releases rather than the more modern sequels. Alternatively, they can jump into
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , the latest project in Blizzard's franchise. Positive reviews aside, the game garnered quite a bit of criticism during its first year, but
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  's Loot Reborn helped steady the ship, setting the stage for the upcoming Vessel of Hatred expansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the main entries and
  <em>
   Diablo Immortal
  </em>
  , the franchise is not exactly lacking in content; however, a change of pace can be preferred at times. Therefore, let's highlight some of the
  <strong>
   best games like
   <em>
    Diablo
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Updated on February 22, 2025 by Mark Sammut:
   </strong>
   2025 is only starting to pick up steam, and it has yet to produce any notable
   <strong>
    games like Diablo
   </strong>
   . That said, Avowed is a fun action RPG with great magic-based combat. Obsidian's game is not that similar to Blizzard's franchise, but it is worth checking out if somebody wants something new to play.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Alternatively, they can check out Fate, a cult classic action RPG series that is set to receive a compilation in March 2025.

  Here is a bit of a weird one. 2023's
  <em>
   Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  is more similar to
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  than 2025's
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  , a roguelite game created by the same studio. However, overall, the latter is currently a better experience than the former, so it deserves to be highlighted. That said,
  <em>
   Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  (and even the older games in the franchise) is worth looking into for anyone craving a traditional action RPG.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Heroes of Hammerwatch 2
  </em>
  has a fun and addictive formula that is relatively typical for a roguelite, albeit executed well. After picking a class (which are not all available at the start), players venture into a procedurally generated dungeon where they engage in isometric combat, unlock loot, and power up. Once done, they return to their hub tone where they can engage with the NPC community. Then, repeat the formula. The structure works well and can satisfy cravings for both action RPG and roguelite content.

  While the first two entries are quite difficult,
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  reduced its barrier of entry after that point, at least for the main campaigns.
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  are both fairly easy action RPGs that enable players to curb-stomp most enemies, carving a path of destruction toward the endgame. The latter include notable spikes in difficulty, but things mellow out once players get into the endless loot grind (which tends to happen with most of these types of games, not just
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  ). Although this shift could be seen as a criticism, a power fantasy run that provides some challenge but not too much frustration can be fun in the right mood.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning
  </em>
  offers something similar, albeit presented from a 3D angle. In 2012, Big Huge's title had one of the best combat systems in Western RPGs, opting for a hack and slash formula akin to something like
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  and, to a lesser extent,
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  . While showing its age at this point,
  <em>
   Kingdoms of Amalur
  </em>
  is still a blast to play, especially thanks to a weapon system with a decent range of variety (and combos that can be enjoyably broken).
 </p>
 <p>
  Visually,
  <em>
   Kingdoms of Amalur
  </em>
  opts for a colorful fantasy aesthetic, somewhat similar to
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  . The story is not particularly great, but the open-world is lovely and filled with well-designed locations.

 <p>
  OK, this recommendation might seem like a stretch.
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is, obviously, a very different experience from
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  . For one, Soulslike combat is considerably slower than
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   4
  </em>
  's hack and slash gameplay, although it is somewhat closer to the original games' pace.
 </p>
 <p>
  While packed to the brim with optional content,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  does not really have an endgame that is meant to keep people playing indefinitely; once the final boss is defeated, the next step would be to start NG+. Loot is certainly a big part of the experience, but the game does not constantly push players to change their loadouts. In most playthroughs, players will likely stick to a handful of weapons, opting to upgrade and master those rather than frequently swap for a shiny new item.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even though
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  are directly opposed in most key areas, there is still a good chance that fans of the latter will enjoy the former. Both properties bring to life fully-realized dark fantasy worlds that are rich in lore, if not necessarily story. Customization is also a central part of both experiences, with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  allowing for quite a wide range of build types. Even though NG+ is far from the same thing as
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's endgame, it does effectively serve a similar purpose by offering an opportunity to take on the same threats at a higher difficulty level.

  Before proceeding any further, it needs to be made clear that
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  are nothing alike in most areas. Their gameplay, settings, and campaign structures are completely different, and their loot systems prioritize different elements. Consequently, if someone is searching for a traditional action RPG experience that replicates
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's flow, they should look elsewhere as their requirements will not be satisfied by Capcom's franchise. Even in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Rise
  </em>
  , the most accessible entry in the franchise, the combat is slow-paced, with encounters descending into battles of attrition.
 </p>
 <p>
  For all their differences,
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  shares
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's philosophy in its endgame, as both properties' longevity revolves around grinding dungeons (or hunts, in
  <em>
   MH
  </em>
  's case) in search of drops that can be used to unlock better armor and weapons. These franchises know how to craft games that can keep someone playing indefinitely, even if their methods are widely different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  's grind is done in service of acquiring the required materials to craft specific weapons and armor; consequently, it is not quite as instantly gratifying as
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's endless cycle of stats. Once players acquire a good selection of high-end weapons and armor, they will also need to swap them depending on the monster they will be hunting, and preparing for a fight is far more important in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter
  </em>
  than in
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Building beautifully on its predecessor's ideas,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  is one of the better and more unique Soulslikes on the market. While the genre typically prioritizes melee weapons, Gunfire Games' franchise revolves around ranged action, with close-quarter combat being secondary. The games utilize procedural generation to enhance their replayability. In the case of
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  , each world's dungeons are formed at random, meaning two playthroughs will encounter different enemies and level layouts.
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  does the same thing with its dungeons, and the 2023 sequel was hardly the first entry in the action RPG series to implement this sort of concept.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's combat are not that similar, although they share enough elements in common to be worth a mention. The former focuses quite a lot on crowd control, and the action is fairly fast-paced and consistently intense. The Soulslike has quite a lot of loot as well; however, unlike
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  does not emphasize weapons in this area. Generally, drops come in the form of rings and relics, while most armor pieces and weapons need to be purchased. While initially this might seem restrictive, the game offers quite a bit of build variety, particularly once players unlock more Archetypes (classes). Similar to
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Remnant 2
  </em>
  also supports online co-op.

  <em>
   Minecraft Dungeons
  </em>
  is essentially a
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  alternative for children. The hack and slash game simplifies most of the central mechanics associated with action RPGs, including completely removing a class system, all the while offering the minute-by-minute thrills associated with the genre.
 </p>
 <p>
  Veterans fans of these sorts of projects might find this title a bit too unchallenging, even though they might still appreciate its charming visuals and decent level design. However,
  <em>
   Minecraft Dungeons
  </em>
  is designed for younger players who are taking their first steps into this world; from that point of view, it gets the job done.

  Inspired by Eastern mythology,
  <em>
   Ghostlore
  </em>
  takes the
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  formula and gives it a thematic makeover, crafting a gameplay loop that is similar but still has a unique identity. The story mostly boils down to a student taking over their master's monster-fighting responsibilities, which means taking on all sorts of quests that amount to "kill everything in this map." That might sound overly straightforward, but
  <em>
   Ghostlore
  </em>
  complements its narrative with a visually impressive world dripping in real-life culture. Even the enemies are inspired by Southern Asian mythology, and it is fun just learning about these beings.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Ghostlore
  </em>
  has a few other things that might hit the mark with
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  fans. Loot is plentiful, with players constantly having to update their builds. Class customization is important, and players will be mixing and matching skills from multiple classes to create their ideal fighter. Procedural generation is used for the map layouts, heightening replayability in the process.

  Ever since its debut,
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  has been described as FPS
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  , and that descriptor has stuck around for a reason. Gearbox's franchise lives and dies on the strength of its loot system, which is designed to keep players coming back long after they complete a playthrough. Each game has a few Vault Hunters who act as separate classes, each of which comes with a couple of skill trees that alter their playstyles. While not as endgame-driven as
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  is intended to be replayed over and over again, and the games emphasize co-op.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderlands
  </em>
  is a spin-off that flings
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  ' core gameplay loop into a traditional fantasy setting. While dungeons stick to the first-person rhythm synonymous with the license, the overworld shifts to a top-down perspective, which lends the title a classic role-playing feel that is often missing in the mainline entries.

  In recent years, Riot Games has slowly expanded
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  into other genres via spin-off games revolving around specific Champions.
  <em>
   The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story
  </em>
  pushes Sylas to the forefront, and the mage proves to be a fantastic pick for an action RPG.
  <em>
   The Mageseeker
  </em>
  's combat is cut from the cloth that spawned
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Torchlight
  </em>
  , and other similar games, although it comes with a few quirks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Along with fisticuffs, Sylas has access to his chain and a wide selection of magic spells, which is not that unusual at face value. However, along with spells that use mana, the mage can also steal abilities from enemies, granting him a one-time use. Balancing these mechanics is a core part of
  <em>
   The Mageseeker
  </em>
  experience, and it produces thrills and the occasional bout of frustration.

  OK,
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  's tone is the direct opposite of
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  . While the latter is drenched in dark fantasy goodness, The Gentlebros' action RPG is colorful, cute, and filled with cat puns. Still, those things are not that crucial in the grand scheme of things, and the games have more in common than might initially seem to be the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  Set in a lovely open-world and played from an isometric perspective,
  <em>
   Cat Quest
  </em>
  features dungeon crawling, simple but satisfying combat, loot, and a well-done upgrade system. Sure, the game is fairly "small" compared to any of the
  <em>

  releases, but sometimes nothing hits the mark like a 10-hour adventure that never threatens to overstay its welcome.

  <em>
   Sacred
  </em>
  was a respectable action RPG when it launched in 2004, and nearly two decades later, the game holds up fairly well. Unsurprisingly, the visuals and combat are dated, but the core gameplay loop is strong enough to survive the test of time. Ascaron took a fair amount of inspiration from
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  when crafting
  <em>
   Sacred
  </em>
  , almost to the point that the latter could be described as a high-fantasy alternative to the former's dark fantasy.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the time of its release, the openness of
  <em>
   Sacred
  </em>
  's world was impressive since it gave players far more freedom to explore than the typical action RPG. Even though these types of maps are more common nowadays, Ancaria is still an impressive work of art. 2008's
  <em>
   Sacred 2
  </em>
  is also a decent action RPG, while the less said about
  <em>
   Sacred 3
  </em>
  , the better.

  Released in 2020,
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  is a rogue-like action RPG with enough hack-and-slash mechanics that will appeal to fans of the
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  series.
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  is set in the Ancient Greek underworld and features an excellent art style.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Rogue-like nature sets
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  apart from action RPGs like
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  in terms of progression but the top-down hack-and-slash nature at the very core of the game will still appeal to fans. Furthermore, fighting one’s way through randomly generated dungeons and trying to get out of hell is the entire basis for both games, and there’s enough to please fans of both genres.

  Similar to
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  took more than a decade to materialize, putting heavy expectations on Capcom's sequel. Also, like Blizzard's most recent entry, the action RPG debuted to widespread acclaim and was even labeled as a potential Game of the Year candidate. Naturally, that initial excitement faded with time, leaving behind a very good sequel that, for the most part, fine-tunes its predecessor's ideas rather than fully evolving them.
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  might be just a better version of
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dark Arisen
  </em>
  , but that is more than enough to warrant a recommendation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gameplay-wise,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  are not cut from the same cloth, although they overlap in enough areas to suggest that fans of one game will enjoy the other. Capcom's project has a far more intricate combat system than Blizzard's franchise, and it can be very challenging at times. Players are given quite a lot of freedom to develop and customize their characters, with vocations acting as loose classes. While nowhere near as loot-heavy as
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  has a robust array of weapons and armor, and they drop at a fairly consistent rate. The dark fantasy world is pretty big and periodically beautiful, and the setting is not that far removed from
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  's.

  Formerly known for hard-as-nails hack and slash masterpieces (and
  <em>
   Ninja Gaiden 3
  </em>
  ), Team Ninja eventually shifted focus to hard-as-nails action RPGs that feature Soulslike combat, albeit a faster variant than the systems found in genre-instigators
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  . While the developer's resume has been fairly consistent over the last decade or so,
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  is arguably Team Ninja's crowning achievement, at least during its RPG era. Split into seven regions containing multiple main and side missions, all of which are filled with grueling boss fights and quite a bit of exploration, the game's campaign is substantial, to the point of requiring 50+ hours to complete in most cases. And, repeat playthroughs are encouraged due to the sheer range of viable builds, with each weapon type coming with a unique skill tree that requires dozens upon dozens of hours of investment. On top of all that,
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  has an overwhelming number of mechanics that all have their part to play in the addictive and deep combat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, admittedly,
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  's gameplay is not particularly similar to
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  . Not only is it far harder than most of Blizzard's entries, but it is also more methodical and does not lend itself to (for lack of a better term) mindless entertainment. Team Ninja's game punishes lapses in concentration harshly, making for a grueling but highly engaging experience. Despite all that,
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  is worth a recommendation simply due to its loot, which is plentiful and borderline exhausting. Every enemy drops a combination of weapons, armor, accessories, soul cores, and consumables; the former three are level-based, divided into tiers, and feature randomized stats, bonuses, and effects. Players will be hoarding weapons of all types too, regardless of whether they have ever equipped an odachi or axe, and before they know it, their seemingly generous 600-size inventory will be overflowing with content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Basically, if someone wants a Soulslike looter slasher,
  <em>
   Nioh 2
  </em>
  is probably their best bet.

  Unlike the mainline
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate RPG
  </em>
  series that originated on the PC,
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance
  </em>
  are dungeon-crawling action RPGs that feature cooperative gameplay and a top-down view similar to that of the
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Designed for PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, the
  <em>
   Dark Alliance
  </em>
  games are much less complicated than their CRPG counterparts, but they serve as a great introduction to the
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  universe. A new
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate:
  </em>
  <em>
   Dark Alliance
  </em>
  <em>
   was
  </em>
  released on consoles and the PC in the Summer of 2021, but it wasn't as well-received as the originals. It's advised to play through the remasters of the first two games if someone wants to revisit these projects, although newcomers should be aware that some aspects of the games have aged poorly.

  This title serves as a spin-off and a prequel to the original
  <em>
   Darksiders
  </em>
  titles, which were fully 3D action-adventure games. The series has always borrowed elements from other games and genres like
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Portal
  </em>
  series, but
  <em>
   Genesis
  </em>
  is more highly recommended for fans of the
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  series.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally,
  <em>
   Darksiders: Genesis
  </em>
  uses familiar elements like puzzle-solving and exploration, and blends this with
  <em>
   Diablo-
  </em>
  like progression mechanics and combat. It’s also worth noting that
  <em>
   Genesis
  </em>
  does a great job of expanding
  <em>
   Darksiders
  </em>
  ' already interesting and imaginative universe. That said, people who also like the hack-and-slash genre should still invest in the main games in the series as the combat, exploration, and series' depth are worth exploring from the beginning.

  <em>
   Vikings

  was developed by Games Farm and published by Kalypso Media Digital in 2017, but it still holds up to what one could want from an action RPG. The game has the player explore the mythical land of Midgard, a region inspired by Norse legends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players earn blessings from different Norse gods and bludgeon their enemies with hammers as they progress through the land. There are many monsters and undead to defeat, and players can invite friends to play in co-op mode. Plus, this game has interesting lore to discover, and humorous cutscenes to entertain.

  <em>
   The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing
  </em>
  puts players in the shoes of the legendary vampire hunter, choosing from six classes to play to slay monsters all around Borgovia.
  <em>
   The Final Cut
  </em>
  is a collection of the three previous games by the developer, told as a single story; together, they combine a lengthy and fairly enjoyable hack and slash experience that takes direct inspiration from classics like
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  . While technically the definitive version,
  <em>
   The Final Cut
  </em>
  is not the individual entries stitched together, and it is quite different from the individual episodes since it creates a more cohesive overall campaign.
 </p>
 <p>
  With over fifty hours of gameplay and an enormous variety of skills, this game will impress even the most experienced veterans of action RPGs. One highly appreciated feature is Lady Katarina, the protagonist's ghostly companion. She helps in several ways and is also very witty and charismatic. Players won't get bored with her around.
  <em>
   Van Helsing
  </em>
  is solid throughout, even if it does not quite reach the same heights as the best action RPGs on the market. Visually, the game(s) hold up well, and they have some eye-catching Gothic locations that compare favorably to most other genre entries. That said, the combat can get a bit stale after a while.

  <em>
   The Slormancer
  </em>
  takes a comedic approach to the action RPG genre, which already sets it apart from most of its contemporaries. Summoned to a world that needs a traditional fantasy hero, players find themselves in over their heads as they try to take down the eponymous villain. At the moment,
  <em>
   The Slormancer
  </em>
  only has three classes, which is fairly minuscule for this type of experience; however, the game makes up for this limitation through an overabundance of weapons and especially abilities. The latter provide a lot of wiggle room in each class, and it can be fun to just experiment with different skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to still being in early access,
  <em>
   The Slormancer
  </em>
  is not a finished product, resulting in a fun but ultimately incomplete experience. In its current state, the title is still worth a try for anyone looking for a lighthearted
  <strong>
   <em>
    Diablo
   </em>
   -like game
  </strong>
  , although people on the fence might want to wait a bit longer.

  fans seeking loot-heavy games should look elsewhere as
  <em>
   Nobody Saves the World

  will not satisfy that itch; however, if someone wants a creative action RPG, DrinkBox's project is a prime contender. The game follows Nobody, a literal blank slate character who picks up a wand that allows them to shift into other beings, each with unique abilities. Once Nobody grows proficient with a certain skill, he can equip it using other forms, opening up a wide range of possible builds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Nobody Saves the World
  </em>
  's combat is fairly typical for a top-down action RPG, although the world's vibrant aesthetic and enemy designs help set the game apart from
  <em>
   Diablo
  </em>
  . The title also has a charming sense of humor that comes through its roster of NPCs and side quests, and it takes inspiration from
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  .

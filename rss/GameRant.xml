      <title>If Atomfall's 'Experimental' Mechanics Are a Hit, Fallout May Want to Keep a Close Eye on Them</title>

  <strong>
   <em>
    Atomfall
   </em>
  </strong>
  is now only a few weeks away, and the post-apocalyptic open-world adventure has been teasing some compelling features. Between a mysterious cult, a handy metal detector, and an exploration-focused story that doesn't hold players' hands,
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  seems to take the concept of
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  and make it more hardcore.

  Considering it takes place after a nuclear catastrophe, it's hard not to compare
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  , but there are plenty of differences that developer Rebellion Developments boasts. The game's Northern English setting and more challenging exploration make
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  an incredibly intriguing project, and if one specific mechanic does well, then
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  may benefit from looking to the title for inspiration.

   According to the game's lead designer,
   <em>
    Atomfall
   </em>
   's environment and difficulty can change based on how players approach the game.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's lead designer, Ben Fisher, recently spoke with VideoGamer, and he had some fascinating details to tease. When it comes to the game's world, Fisher stated, "There’s events the player can trigger or completely miss that can have a huge influence on enemy population in the game world, and stuff like that… It might work, it might not… I’m looking forward to finding out." Fisher's comments hint that
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  could have a wildly dynamic world that is reliant on how players engage with the surrounding environment. Missing or interacting with certain things can completely change the experience for players, and that's compelling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even more interesting, Fisher doesn't even know if this approach to world-building will be a hit or not, which, honestly, makes it even more intriguing.
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's setting is just as important as its story, and it makes sense as to why such an experimental approach would be considered risky. If players miss certain content, it could keep them from exciting lore. On the other hand, though, players could trigger events that could potentially make in-game enemies overwhelming. Ben Fisher's comments raise plenty of questions, but his unsure nature is fascinating.

     <em>

     is inspired by an actual nuclear event. The Windscale fire of 1957 remains the biggest nuclear disaster in the history of England and one of the most devastating in world history.
     <em>
      Atomfall
     </em>
     takes place five years after the event.

 <p>
  Right now,
  <em>
   Fallout 5
  </em>
  is likely several years away at this point, but that also gives developer Bethesda plenty of time to look to other sources for inspiration. After the reception to
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , Bethesda will need to make world building a big priority going forward, as much of the criticism of its sci-fi adventure revolves around the world feeling empty. Ben Fisher may not be positive about whether fans will enjoy
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's experimental approach to the game's environment or not, but it may turn out to be a bold risk worth taking. If
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  really resonates with its players, Bethesda should probably study the game quite closely in order to see what features and mechanics fans enjoy the most.

  Although the game shares a lot of similarities with
  <em>

  </em>
  on the surface,
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  is promising a unique experience.
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's blend of historical fiction and experimentation has the potential to be a big success, especially for
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  fans who have been looking for something a bit deeper. As the game's release date draws closer, it will be exciting to see just how in-depth
  <em>
   Atomfall
  </em>
  's experimental qualities are, but only time will tell if Bethesda follows suit.

  If Arthur Morgan is going to get rich in 1899 to survive the outlaw’s life, then he is going to need to sell a whole lot of valuables. Not every cent can be made through robbing stagecoaches, trains, and banks. Sometimes, all it takes is a good Fence for Arthur to sell his illegal goods to get rich quickly in

 <p>
  There are plenty of easy ways for Arthur Morgan to make money in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , and one of the more important (and perhaps not-so-honest) ways is to sell valuables, to which there are countless variations of them in the game that players will want to seek out for easy cash in hand.

   Valued at: $300 per Gold Ingot, $500 per Gold Bar

 </ul>
 <p>
  Gold Ingots are perhaps the rarest valuable in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , but while they are scarce and hard to find, they will always have a guaranteed spawn. There are quite a few joyous spots to find Gold Bars, from within cave puzzles to treasure maps themselves, and each Gold Ingot is worth a whopping $300.
 </p>
 <p>
  While it might be nice to have a stash of valuable Gold Bars in Arthur’s satchel, it’s probably not a good idea to carry his weight in literal gold, so why not head to a Fence and sell these beautiful chunks of metal for the easiest cash ever.

 </p>
 <p>
  All jewelry can be sold to a Fence, and depending on the rarity of the item, players can earn anywhere from $5 to $150. It’s always worth looting bodies to see if they have anything valuable because if it’s shiny, it can be sold for some cash.

  Every animal has its own price, and while it’s not the most sensible or ethical idea for Arthur to roam the plains of New Hanover and try and personally make the bison go extinct just so he can sell their horns and pelts, it’s not a bad idea for those in need of some cash. Animals are an easy source of wealth in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , especially when Trappers, Butchers, and Fences require their materials.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players can easily hunt good or perfect pelt animals to kill them with the right weapon and skin them to obtain all their valuable materials. Players can get good and honest pay from some easy-to-find animals like deer, but they can also earn more from predators like cougars, panthers, and alligators.

 <p>
  On top of the abundance of jewelry found across the many bastions of civilization and lockboxes, Arthur can also find a set of rare valuables that are only obtained through exclusive and guaranteed methods. Whether it’s looting specific areas, helping specific people, or completing specific missions – these rare valuables can only be obtained through one way, and selling them will see them gone forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yet, Arthur isn’t exactly sentimental about things outside of his mother’s favorite flower and his dad’s leather hat, so why not sell these rare valuables? Arthur can find rare minerals, ancient items, family heirlooms, and even a gifted fountain pen – all of which can be sold for well over $25 each.

  The Bayou Nwa has a wealth of money-making opportunities, especially when it comes to poultry. Around the swamps of Lemoyne, players will find plenty of variations of the egret bird – whether reddish, little, or snowy, and each of them has a valuable set of plumes that can be easily plucked from their dead bodies.
 </p>
 <p>
  It might be bloody work, but obtaining plumes is easy cash, especially when bird meat and flight feathers are added to the list alongside these plumes, making an easy bundle of money off of just a few birds.

  There are 12 cigarette card sets in
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  , totaling 144 cards that need to be collected to be sold in a specific set. However, obtaining a set for $100 isn’t easy unless players are in the habit of smoking a pack of cigarettes or more a day, and while there are guaranteed spots for cigarette cards, it’s more often than not that players will have a few repeatable cards in their decks.
 </p>
 <p>
  For players who have already sold a set or have the same card twice or more, head to a Fence and sell the card. While it’s only going to be worth $1 or $2, players who loot bodies and smoke cigarettes for Dead Eye gain are going to definitely have a few identical cards to sell to clear out their inventory.

 <p>
  It’s a two-birds-one-stone situation here, as once players meet Seamus at Emerald Ranch and Alden at the Rhodes Station, they will not only be able to sell any stagecoach and wagon that they find to Seamus but they will always be given tips as to where valuable ones are located thanks to Alden.
 </p>
 <p>
  This synergy of stealing valuables from a wagon and then selling said wagon is a perfect crime, and although it might not be harmless, it does provide a good bit of cash for a side business. While some wagons are purchased for higher worth than others, it’s worth noting that players can get between $15 and $50!

  To begin their journey towards becoming a Master Mentor, Sims must first experience the benefits of learning under a skilled teacher. They must find a Sim with a mentorable Skill above level five and
  <strong>
   ask them to be their Mentor
  </strong>
  . Players can figure out if a skill is mentorable or not in the skills panel or by reading new skill level notifications. Under their mentor's guidance and supervision, Sims will receive a skill XP boost.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the other ways that Sims can learn and develop new skills — including using skill-related objects, engaging in social interactions, watching educational TV channels, attending high school or university classes, or reading skill books — Sims can attend Hobby Classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sims who visit small businesses as a customer can attend these classes by choosing the Ask to Start Class interaction on the Hobby Whiteboard. The students in class will need to complete different activities and interact with the students and teachers to earn either a Bronze, Silver, or Gold level rating.
  <strong>
   Achieving at least a Bronze Level in these classes three times
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   reaching level three in three different skills
  </strong>
  will mark steady progress in Sims' learning journeys.

  In the Aspiring Student milestone of this aspiration, Sims will continue their journey as a dedicated learner, progressing toward their own mentorship abilities. Now that they have chosen a mentor and had a few classes under their belt, it might be a good idea to
  <strong>
   make friends with students or the instructor
  </strong>
  . This could lead to a lifelong friendship, a healthy rivalry, or even a romantic connection as Sims bond over shared skills.

     Sims can use the Ask for Mentoring interaction by clicking on the Sim directly or on a skill-building object. Sims must be mentored for at least three hours to complete this milestone.
    </p>

 <p>
  Much like social events and parties in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , Sims can
  <strong>
   achieve Gold Level
  </strong>
  <strong>
   by completing all the event goals within the time slot
  </strong>
  during a Hobby Class. Just like having a mentor, having a good teacher can help Sims increase their skill levels at higher speeds. They can also receive moodlets that give them learning boosts for the hours following the class. Doing well in their classes will demonstrate their dedication and mastery, marking a significant achievement in their learning journey.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rather than focusing on one single skill, Sims should branch out and try to learn as many skills as they can. Figure out their interests and preferences and focus on at least three different skills. Have the Sim
  <strong>
   reach up to level five to complete the milestone's requirement
  </strong>
  and prepare them for a future in mentorship.

  With a solid foundation of skills, this Sim is now ready to step into the role of a mentor and instructor, guiding others on their learning journey. Now that they have reached level five in a mentorable skill (or level three for a minor skill such as dancing or pet training), they can select a Sim with a lower skill level and offer to be their mentor by clicking on a skill-building object or directly on the Sim using it to
  <strong>
   Offer Mentoring
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  If Sims want to profit off their high skill levels, they can do so by teaching their own hobby classes. They must open their own small business from their phone or computer and place a Hobby Whiteboard on the lot. Remember to
  <strong>
   set the Business Activity to "Attend Classes and Lectures"
  </strong>
  to influence customers to attend classes. Customers will pay to participate in these classes, depending on the instructor's skill level and the number of goals achieved. The event goals will prompt the instructor to engage in social interactions and skill-related conversation topics.

     Some classes may require specific objects for students to practice their skills on. For example, Sims attending a pottery class need a Pottery Wheel or Pottery Kiln to be placed near the whiteboard in the designated outline in Build/Buy mode.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </section>
 <p>
  Becoming a skilled teacher requires expertise in several different areas, so Sims attempting to complete this milestone must
  <strong>
   reach at least level eight in three different skills
  </strong>
  . Players can choose a Sim's skill preferences or randomize them in Create-A-Sim to influence their Sims' moods when they are working on their skills. Traits given in CAS or earned as a reward, like Overachiever and Quick Learner, can also influence the speed at which Sims learn skills.

  After a Sim has put in the work honing their craft and guiding others, they now stand at the pinnacle of mentorship. This final milestone cements their status as a true master of their skills. Sims must focus on the quality of their classes, achieving gold level by successfully completing all event goals while instructing their students. Instructors can earn rewards like cash, good reviews for their business, and moodlet buffs. The better the class, the higher the reward.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once a Sim reaches level 8 or higher in a skill, they have a chance to
  <strong>
   discover a
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Skill Mastery Perk
  </strong>
  . These unique perks enhance their abilities and provide special benefits, such as enabling faster skill gain types for other Sims, increased endurance, or even skill-building while sleeping. Elder Sims are especially likely to gain Mastery Perks due to their abundance of life experience, and attending Hobby Classes or being mentored increases the odds even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  To truly be a Master Mentor, Sims must
  <strong>
   maximize three different skills at level 10
  </strong>
  , ensuring they have the expertise to guide future generations. With this milestone completed, the Sim will have finished the aspiration and become a legendary mentor, shaping the skills and futures of Sims around them.

  Sims who are aiming to achieve the Esteemed Entrepreneur aspiration must finish the first milestone:
  <strong>
   Friendly Founder
  </strong>
  . This milestone sets attainable goals for new and aspiring small business owners.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first goal is to grow their Business Renown from the bottom-tier Garage Business level to a one-star Hopeful Hustle.
  <strong>
   S
  </strong>
  i
  <strong>
   ms can increase their Business Renown by getting positive reviews from customers. From the moment they walk in, welcome new customers with a friendly introduction and the Welcome to Business interaction. Increase the chances of getting positive reviews by creating a clean and pleasant ambiance that is nicely decorated and well-stocked or adequately prepared for the services provided
  </strong>
  . Maintaining a steady stream of satisfied customers and engaging with them is essential for business growth and achieving the first milestone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once a Sim levels up their Business Renown, they will
  <strong>
   earn Small Business Perk Points
  </strong>
  . Much like owners of retail stores (Get To Work) and restaurants (Dine Out), small business owners can use these points to purchase perks that can provide benefits — like attracting more customers, employee bonuses, and online advertisements to generate buzz — which contribute to the business's long-term success.

      Grow your Small Business to a Striving Startup
     </strong>
    </li>
    <li>

    <p>

   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The first step in the Popular Operator milestone is to
  <strong>
   grow the small business to a Striving Startup
  </strong>
  by reaching a two-star Business Renown rating. At this level, players may find that their small businesses will see a boost in foot traffic, more purchases, and a rise in their entry and hourly fees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar to the reputation system from the Get Famous
  <em>
  </em>
  expansion, Sims can run their shop with either a
  <strong>
   Dreamer or Schemer Alignment
  </strong>
  , which reflects how they choose to run their business and influences how customers perceive the shop. Dreamers focus on fairness, passion, and ethical business practices, while Schemers prioritize profit, strategy, and sometimes questionable tactics. Business owners can begin to develop their alignment by choosing social interactions in the Small Business menu that match the alignment they are interested in.
  <strong>
   Sims will also encounter Business Dilemmas which, depending on how they are solved, will influence their alignment
  </strong>
  . Reach the first level,
  <strong>
   Lawful
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Illicit
  </strong>
  , for benefits such as improved customer relationships from a simple greeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, Sims must
  <strong>
   hire an employee
  </strong>
  and become friends with them to help manage the growing workload. From the Small Business Panel, Sims can Manage Employees and select specific Sims to hire. Employees can be assigned various tasks, including restocking, cleaning, and assisting customers. Developing a positive relationship with employees is essential for creating a friendly work environment, so owners should take the time to chat and joke with them.

  Getting Happy Customers requires the business to have

  </strong>
  —
  <strong>
   Scrupulous
  </strong>
  for Dreamers or
  <strong>
   Underground
  </strong>
  for Schemers. This can be achieved by consistently selecting Dreamer or Schemer interactions and making business decisions that align with their philosophic approach.

     The choices Sims make when selecting Small Business Perks can push the business further into either alignment. Perks can unlock new interactions. Dreamers can share inspiring business stories while Schemers might take riskier actions such as "accidentally starting fires" for insurance payouts.

  Sims must also

  <strong>
   Local Legend

  by providing an experience that aligns with their business’s established reputation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, Sims must commit to their business's alignment by

      <title>Fallout 76: What’s The Difference Between Scorched and Ghouls?</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-scorched-ghouls-different-how-location-origin/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  When it was first released in 2018,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  was widely criticized for its lack of human NPCs, which ultimately made the game world feel empty. However, there was arguably a justified lore reason for the lack of locals in West Virginia, as any humans who didn’t flee the area or live in the safety of a Vault shortly after the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise’s Great War are believed to have succumbed to the local Scorched Plague, or had been transformed into a Ghoul. This is why the first players who left Vault 76 on Reclamation Day were essentially the only humans in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s wasteland at the time.

 <p>
  While both Scorched and Ghouls still roam the Appalachian wasteland in current-day
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , the passage of time within the game’s lore has since led to humans resettling in Appalachia and the formation of new factions in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  through the game’s various post-launch updates. For anyone playing
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  for the first time in 2025 and beyond, and finally leaving Vault 76, players may want to know the differences between some of the Scorched and Ghouls they’ll inevitably encounter, and where these mutants come from.

  The Fallout Franchise’s Ghouls Are Created By Radiation
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ghouls are known to be the result of humans and animals who were exposed to radiation and irreversibly transformed into mutants. Most Ghouls were likely created by the lingering radiation from the bombs dropping during the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise’s Great War, though Ghouls can seemingly be created from any source of radiation. A new type of Ghoul introduced in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s Skyline Valley region is the Lost. Aside from their distinct appearances, Lost are essentially identical to Ghouls.
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_8">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     Although
     <em>
      Fallout 76
     </em>
     ’s playable Ghoul character will let players “cure” themselves and undo their Ghoul transformation, this is likely for the sake of convenience and not a canon part of the franchise’s lore. Nor is the Scorched Plague curable after someone has become infected. Similarly,
     <em>
      Fallout 76
     </em>
     allowing players to recover from becoming fully Feral as a Ghoul is also unlikely to be canon.

 <h3 id="the-enclave-created-fallout-76-rsquo-s-scorched-plague">
  The Enclave Created Fallout 76’s Scorched Plague
 </h3>
 <p>
  Scorched are the accidental creation of the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  franchise’s Enclave faction. While Ghouls are created solely by exposure to radiation, the first Scorched were created by a combination of radiation and biochemical experiments conducted on bats that led to what is now known as the Scorched Plague. After the Enclave’s initial test subjects escaped containment, these bats (a.k.a. Scorchbeasts) began spreading the Scorched Plague to any creature that came into direct contact with them, which explains why
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  originally had no human NPC survivors when the first Vault dwellers left Vault 76 on Reclamation Day in 2102.

 <p>
  Aside from their origins, one of the differences between these two types of mutants is in their life spans. Instead of further exposure to radiation being harmful to Ghouls, it heals them, potentially allowing them to live many decades after their initial transformation. However, Ghouls are still susceptible to dying from natural causes or fatal injuries. On the other hand, human victims of the Scorched Plague will live short lives before the plague eventually overtakes their bodies and turns them into petrified statues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another key difference between these two types of mutants is that the Scorched are a hive-mind collective with little to no resemblance to their former identities. This is why whenever players are fighting a Scorchbeast, especially the Scorchbeast Queen in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , other Scorched will soon appear to join the fight. Whereas, for Ghouls, it’s common for human Ghouls to remain civilized individuals after their transformation and retain their pre-existing morals and intellect, so long as they can indefinitely fend off becoming Feral, where they then habitually accompany other Feral Ghouls and are reduced to primitive states.

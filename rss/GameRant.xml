      Fans are frustrated with Roblox's increased prices for cosmetic items, with some items now costing over 11 times their original price.
     </li>
     <li>
      The new Dynamic Price Floor system has led to fluctuating item prices, causing some popular items to become much more expensive.

     <li>
      Players are unhappy with recent monetization tactics, such as requiring a premium subscription to sell items and locking rewards behind paywalls.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Roblox
   </strong>
  </em>
  players are taking to the internet to air their grievances about the increased prices for cosmetic items in the online marketplace, which have risen exponentially. Creating a custom avatar is a huge part of the appeal of
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  and its millions of daily users, but some fans are finding the new prices to be a hindrance toward customization.

 <p>
  When
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  first launched in 2006, it was sold as a player-made platform and community where users can express themselves and engage in content created by their peers within a shared online network. Though it has grown into a multibillion-dollar company over the past 18 years, that concept has remained a key part of the appeal, though its massive rise in popularity also meant some major changes that have left many
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  fans pining for the old days.

 <p>
  One major effect of the game's meteoric rise is the hugely inflated costs of many of its cosmetic items, as Reddit user Disastrous-Sale-6510 pointed out on the official
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  subreddit, comparing the original price of one of its more popular items to what it costs today. The Robloxian 2.0 body, which is a more detailed variant of the original
  <em>
   R
  </em>
  <em>
   oblox
  </em>
  player model, originally sold for only 15 Robux, the platform's premium currency, and now goes for 175, over 11 times higher than its original price.

 <p>
  Fans in the comments quickly agreed with the original poster's frustration, stating that as recently as 2018, they could make several entire outfits for the same amount as just one or two individual items today. The platform has seen a variety of major changes recently as the company attempts to increase monetization for the game, like a new update that requires players to pay for a
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  Premium subscription in order to sell items on the marketplace.

 <p>
  The biggest reason cited for the massive increase in
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  item prices is the recent addition of the Dynamic Price Floor, which determines the lowest possible price that an item can sell for. In other words, creators no longer decide on a flat price for their items and instead have to decide how high above the minimum price they want it to sell, meaning the price is likely to change all the time depending on market demand.

 <p>
  In theory, this would mean that creators of items on the
  <em>
   R
  </em>
  <em>
   oblox
  </em>
  marketplace would make more from their sold items, but the reality is proving to be more predatory, according to fans, as it means a massive increase in the cost of some of its most popular items. The highly unpopular update comes right off of the heels of the recent
  <em>
   Roblox Classic
  </em>
  controversy in which players complained about some of the rewards being unfairly locked behind paywalls or requiring massive amounts of grinding.

      <title>After Silent Hill 2 Remake, The Series Should Replicate One of Resident Evil's Best Tricks</title>

 <p>
  The upcoming
  <em>
   <strong>
    Silent Hill 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  remake from Bloober Team has continued to look more promising with every showcase since its initial reveal, as fan concerns over staying true to the spirit of the original have seemingly been acknowledged over time. Though it remains unknown whether this title will be able to live up to the legacy of the Konami classic that it's set to bring into the current generation of gaming, the jump in technical fidelity that it represents is undeniable. No matter how its release later this year actually pans out, the
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  remake could easily pave the way for its engine and resources to be the foundation for remaking the next entry in the series.

 <p>
  It may seem like an odd decision to focus on a title like the second
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  game when the 1999 original has remained stuck in the style of the PS1 since its launch, but it's also true that
  <em>
   SH2
  </em>
  is the most popular entry in the franchise. With existing hype likely serving as the motivation to give the journey of James Sunderland a new life, it stands to reason that this will be a major factor in choosing where to take a future effort. While there's a case to be made for remaking the weakest
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  games after Bloober Team's current project,
  <em>
   Silent Hill 3
  </em>
  would serve as a safer bet through its potential for following in the footsteps of another one of survival horror's biggest names.

 </h3>
 <p>
  The first
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  remake from 2002 is still praised by fans to this day, so it's not surprising that Capcom chose to jump right into
  <em>
   RE2
  </em>
  after the RE Engine became the company's signature tool. This obviously entailed a complete overhaul of the 1998 game's style and level of detail which went far beyond what
  <em>
   RE1
  </em>
  received, but it's still seen as a huge success that captures aspects of the original's engaging sense of terror.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   RE3
  </em>
  remake which came in the following year was able to directly build upon this recreation of
  <em>
   Resident Evil

  's Raccoon City to achieve an impressively fast turnaround, as it could be developed concurrently due to sharing so much within the same engine. It saw several bigger changes when compared to its original version, but these could be attributed to the extra time afforded to the developer in terms of rethinking creative decisions.

 <p>
  With years having passed since a new
  <em>
   Silent Hill
  </em>
  game released, Bloober Team's remake will function as just as much as an update as a revival. With the resources that have been put into its realistic graphics and completely redesigned combat system, this over-the-shoulder experience will be something of an outlier against the tank controls and static camera angles of its roots. If another well received title like
  <em>
   Silent Hill 3
  </em>
  gets a remake on the heels of Bloober's first attempt, however, this style could come to characterize an entirely new era of the IP.

  Potential Regardless of Silent Hill 2's Reception
 </h3>
 <p>
  There are issues that players might end up having with the upcoming remake's take on the atmosphere of
  <em>
   Silent Hill 2
  </em>
  , which largely benefitted from the limitations of its hardware at the time, but even those sorts of complaints overpowering praise wouldn't make another attempt less viable. A completely different approach to the franchise's horror requiring new monsters and levels follows in
  <em>
   Silent Hill 3
  </em>
  , but the same fundamental remake engine being fine-tuned as its foundation could allow for a smooth transition with a far shorter production time. Just like with
  <em>
   Resident Evil 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Resident Evil 3
  </em>
  , a
  <em>
   Silent Hill 3
  </em>
  remake could use assets from Bloober's current project to speed up its release and give fans two games with very similar feels.

  A Ubisoft official revealed quite a few new details about
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </em>
  </strong>
  in a recent interview, including the confirmation that the upcoming game will feature same-sex romance options. But the way romance in general will be handled in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  will be slightly different compared to the last few entries in the popular franchise.

 <p>
  Same-sex romance was featured in both
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Valhalla
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  . The latter offered 14 romanceable characters, while the former had a dozen of them. Each game allowed its respective pair of protagonists to get intimately involved with any romanceable character.

  Naoe and Yasuke Will Have Different Romance Options in Assassin's Creed Shadows
 </h2>
 <p>
  In a recent interview with YouTuber JorRaptor (via TheGamer),
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  Associate Narrative Director Brooke Davies confirmed that the upcoming game will also feature same-sex romance options. However, Ubisoft is moving away from playersexual NPCs, and will instead be focusing on offering different romance opportunities for Naoe and Yasuke to pursue. This change largely stems from the fact that both characters have their own identities and roles in the story, unlike their counterparts from
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Odyssey
  </em>
  , respectively.

 <p>
  Davies also revealed that the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  protagonists will have opportunities to pursue "more developed" relationships compared to the previous series entries, some of which will be platonic in nature. As for romance, the Ubisoft official said that the game isn't aiming to be a "dating simulator," but that it will nonetheless try to offer a balanced mixture of serious romance and flings. She also confirmed that Naoe and Yasuke will both have optional opportunities to romantically pursue both male and female characters, and that none of those encounters will be missable by making certain story choices.

  Based on that overall description, it sounds like
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  <em>
   Shadows
  </em>
  will build on the way romance worked in
  <em>
   Valhalla
  </em>
  , but while significantly cutting down on the number of playersexual characters. Having predetermined sexual orientations for NPCs has the potential to make the game's world feel more realistic.

  Davies also revealed some other details about the game as part of the same interview, including the fact that Yasuke won't be able to wear a hood like Naoe, and that the seasons in
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  will only change on their own based on a dynamic clock, which won't be tied to story progression. Additionally, the game won't have the meditate feature from its last few predecessors that allowed players to quickly skip to any time of day at will. Most Templar targets will be available during all four seasons, but the experience of getting to them will be significantly different based on the in-game time of the year, Davies said.

 <p>
  BioWare has explained in a recent interview why
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  will not feature any multiplayer mode upon launch. While the previous entry of the
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series sported a co-op multiplayer mode, it seems
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veillguard
  </em>
  will not be following in its footsteps.

 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  series has not seen an entry in nearly ten years, and with
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  launching later in 2024, the expectations for the game are high, especially when compared to
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  . Something unique that
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  brought to the series was a co-op mode, where players could battle through various missions with up to three friends. These co-op missions featured a mostly unique cast of playable characters, each with their own specializations and skills. Players would have to coordinate their team composition to be successful in missions. The multiplayer mode for
  <em>
   Dragon Age:
  </em>
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  is not often remembered fondly, if remembered at all, and now with
  <em>
   The Veilguard
  </em>
  rapidly approaching, fans now have confirmation that multiplayer will not be returning.

 <p>
  As confirmed in an interview with Game Informer, there's a simple reason for this decision to omit multiplayer. In the interview, BioWare general manager Gary McKay shared how BioWare wants to attempt to get back to its roots with
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  ; with amazing storytelling, unforgettable characters, and the ability to feel like players truly influence the world around them with their choices. Multiplayer would not truly be able to capture this feeling, as can be seen from the multiplayer mode in
  <em>
   Inquisition
  </em>
  , and how it had no bearing at all on the wider game. As such, the concept of a multiplayer mode has been pushed aside to hone in on what the true vision of
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is supposed to be. By not committing resources to developing a multiplayer mode, full attention can be put on the single-player experience.

 <p>
  The multiplayer mode in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  was a rather polarizing addition among fans. Some enjoyed it, happy with the extra content it gave and the ability to play the game with friends. Many disliked its addition, believing that the inclusion of a multiplayer mode took away from the base game and ultimately harmed it during its development. While rumors were spinning several years ago about BioWare having abandoned multiplayer for the next
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  game, this most recent interview confirms it, as well as giving an understandable reason as to why, which many fans of
  <em>
   Dragon Age
  </em>
  are sure to appreciate, even if others may find the news of no multiplayer disheartening.

  Third-party accessories manufacturer Dbrand might have leaked a look at the highly anticipated follow-up to the
  <strong>
   Nintendo Switch
  </strong>
  . The leaks come right as anticipation for a new generation of Switch hardware is hitting a peak.

 <p>
  With the Switch entering its eighth year of service as one of the most popular consoles in the world, fans are getting increasingly anxious about when Nintendo will reveal its plans for a hardware upgrade. Though Nintendo has yet to even officially name its next console, more information about what's next from the company appears to be coming from outside sources. The most recent Switch 2 rumors have been powered by images and info leaked by third-party contractors working with Nintendo, like accessory makers tooling up to design or produce items to go with the successor console.

 <p>
  One such accessory maker is Canada-based Dbrand, which launched a page promoting what it calls the "Switch 2 Killswitch" carrying case. The page features an image of the case with a game console inside. The naming of the accessory, combined with some notable differences between the hardware covered by the case and the actual Nintendo Switch hardware, suggests that Dbrand is indirectly showing fans and potential customers what the Switch 2 will actually look like. With excitement high for the Switch 2 potentially addressing issues with the current hardware, the promotion quickly gathered attention from onlookers and commentators. In comments to Insider Gaming, Dbrand CEO Adam Ijaz said that the hardware rendered inside the case matches the design for the Switch 2.

 <p>
  Dbrand also put up images of the Switch 2 Killswitch case on its official Twitter account. The design of the case lines up with other rumors about changes to the Switch 2 design over the current Switch and Switch OLED. For example, the case includes indentations for an additional button on the right-side Joy-Con housing, distinct from the current "Home" button.

 <p>
  Though Dbrand didn't say exactly how it obtained the design for the Switch 2, its status as an accessory maker puts it in a position to know what the Switch 2 will look like. Such companies need early information about hardware designs to design and make their products in a timely manner. Dbrand is also known for bold moves that occasionally attract the ire of the major console makers. In 2021, Dbrand fell afoul of Sony, which forced it to stop selling black faceplates for the PlayStation 5. When officially branded black PS5 faceplates went on sale in 2022, Dbrand mocked Sony for not "figuring out the color black."

 <p>
  Dbrand isn't the only accessory manufacturer to potentially tip its hand about the Switch 2, whether by accident or intention. Just a few days ago, accessory maker Satisfye accidentally uploaded a trailer for a Switch 2 accessory, the Zengrip 2, revealing blurry images of the Switch 2 (or a close mockup).

  <em>
   <strong>
    Final Fantasy 7 Remake
   </strong>
  </em>
  has released its 1.004 update, and with it, two helpful new features that fans can use to make their playthroughs a bit easier and more convenient in both the standard campaign and the INTERmission DLC. The
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  update is out now for both PS5 and PC.

  <em>

  fans are pretty excited for the upcoming release of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  on PC. Square Enix finally revealed when
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
  </em>
  will arrive on PC at The Game Awards, and gamers won't have to wait much longer to try out the next chapter of the story, as it will release in January.

 <p>
  In the meantime,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7 Remake
  </em>
  , the first of the
  <em>
   FF7
  </em>
  remake trilogy, has released its new 1.004 update. This update adds two new features: Head Start Mode and fast-forwarding. Head Start Mode gives players a leg up from the get-go, allowing them to start a fresh game in either the main campaign or the DLC with significant bonuses. Players utilizing this mode can get started with their party members at level 45, fully leveled materia, good gear for every party member, items, and 50,000 gil to spend. For players who have tried the game before or are just looking to experience the story, this may be a great way of accomplishing that.

  Additionally,
  <em>

  has added a feature that lets players fast-forward the game's many cinematic scenes. Players can nose choose between 1.5 or 2x speed, allowing them to zip through the cinematics with ease. This feature will be particularly useful for those who haven't yet played

  didn't sell as well as Square Enix had hoped, so bringing it to PC gives the company an opportunity to engage the PC gaming market. As Steam has seen tremendous growth and new player milestones this year, there's a plentiful audience to potentially target. As the holidays approach, the original may also go on sale, potentially introducing new players to the trilogy as a whole.

  This year's Game Awards were stacked with major announcements, and the first look at
  <strong>

  CD Projekt Red Confirms the Name of the Monster Featured in the Trailer
 </h3>
 <p>
  In an interview with IGN,
  <em>
   Witcher 4
  </em>
  game director Sebastian Kalemba confirmed the name of the monster that Ciri fights in the trailer. The creature is called Bauk, and according to Kalembda, it's a force to be reckoned with. In the interview, Kalemba states, "He has this ability to smell your fear, to be able to play with your traumas, to paralyze you." Based on this statement alone, the Bauk could prove to be one of
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  franchise's most terrifying monsters. That wasn't all the information Kalemba shared about the Bauk, though.

 <p>
  According to the interview, CD Projekt Red was heavily inspired by
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  's Phantom Liberty DLC when designing the Bauk. Citing Phantom Liberty's Chimera tank boss, Kalemba claims Bauk is the result of what developers learned from working on such large enemy types. "The Chimera was a very, very good lesson on our path when it comes to designing big creatures," he states.

 <p>
  This statement is incredibly promising, as it leads one to believe that at least some of the monsters featured in
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  will be the biggest the franchise has seen yet. The Bauk was massive, and as more information comes out about the action RPG, it will be fascinating to see if there are monsters that are even more intimidating. While Ciri serves as this new era's protagonist, Geralt will still be in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  's picture, just not as much.

 <p>
  Although theories and speculation predicted a Ciri-led
  <em>
   Witcher
  </em>
  game, nothing had been made official until The Game Awards. CD Projekt Red's secrecy surrounding the project has finally come to an end, but there is still a long road ahead, unfortunately. With no release target announced,
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  could still be a long time away. On the bright side, though, CD Projekt Red's past with
  <em>
   Cyberpunk 2077
  </em>
  has likely taught the studio to not announce games too early, which could be a promising indication of how far along
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  is.

  Konami and Digital Eclipse confirmed a number of features for the upcoming
  <em>
   <strong>
    Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection
   </strong>
  </em>
  , including quality-of-life features like rewinding gameplay states, removing deck limits, and online multiplayer. The
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection
  </em>
  package features a number of classic titles remastered for modern platforms. These include games that were never localized in the West and have been Japan-only releases for the longest time.

 <p>
  First revealed in February 2024 for the franchise's 25th anniversary, the
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection
  </em>
  digs deep into its back catalog, with fourteen games collected from across its long history that were previously released on the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance systems. This package of retro video games includes titles from the series' past that use a different ruleset that was established before the physical card game's traditions were set. With the
  <em>
   Early Days Collection
  </em>
  set for a February 2025 release on both Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam, Konami and Digital Eclipse have revealed some new features exclusive to this remastered collection, including some important quality-of-life features that will make certain titles a much easier time.

 <p>
  On the official
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection
  </em>
  Steam page, one of the first things confirmed for the remastered releases is online play. Players can challenge each other in
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists
  </em>
  at launch, with select titles in the collection getting an online play patch post-launch as well. Certain
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  titles like
  <em>
   Stairway to the Destined Duel
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Destiny Board Traveler
  </em>
  did support multiplayer with the Game Boy's link cable, so it's entirely possible that these titles will get multiplayer after launch.

 <p>
  Also listed in the Steam description is the game's variety of quality-of-life features, including the ability to save anywhere and the rewind and fast-forward functions. The most important QoL feature listed, however, is the ability to customize the gameplay. This includes the ability to unlock certain characters and cards straight away, along with the ability to remove Deck Capacity, Duelist Level, and cards from the Forbidden and Limited list. Many of these features can make certain classic
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  games, such as the highly contentious
  <em>
   Reshef of Destruction
  </em>
  , much easier, as it imposed a lot of artificial difficulty.
  <em>
   Reshef of Destruction
  </em>
  in particular was criticized for only being able to save the game in one spot, along with the restrictions that stemmed from the Deck Capacity and Duelist Level mechanics.

 <p>
  The ability to turn off some of these features is entirely optional, so hardcore nostalgia-driven fans can also play these classic retro
  <em>
   Yu-Gi-Oh
  </em>
  games in their original form as well. The
  <em>
   Early Days Collection
  </em>
  will also feature a digital gallery that preserves all the box art and manuals from each title, too. All told,
  <em>
   <strong>

  looks to be a complete retro package with enough modern features for fans to enjoy.

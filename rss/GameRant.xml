  The Furnace Golem is one of the first elite enemies that players will face in the DLC. Defeating one is fairly easy, but there are some variations for the golem, which has armored legs, making the normal strategy almost useless. Here's how you can defeat these armored Furnace Golems.

 <p>
  There are many armored Furnace Golems in the DLC, and they can all be defeated using essentially the same strategy. Since the legs cannot be damaged, players need to deal damage to the head of the enemy. Typically, players will find an unsealed Spiritspring near the boss where they can be at a higher level than the golem itself, making it vulnerable to throwable items.

  Once players are at a higher altitude, they will have to look out for two attacks from the boss.

   <strong>
    Fire Storm:
   </strong>
   The golem will charge up its flames and spew out a storm of fireballs. These will track the player and can deal a lot of damage. Fortunately, they are fairly easy to dodge on Torrent and don't pose a big issue. Players don't need to panic as soon as the attack animation starts, as it takes a while to fully charge.

 <p>
  Once you've mastered dodging these two attacks, the golem can't do anything to you. After that, it's just a matter of throwing high-damaging fire pots into the furnace-like head of the Furnace Golem. Walk to the edge of the cliff you're on, and use either a Hefty Furnace Pot or a Heft Fire Pot. Smaller fire pots will work, too, though they will do less damage compared to their hefty variants.

  Different Furnace Golems give the player different Crystal Tears, a Furnace Visage, and about 100,000 Runes. The Armored Furnace Golem near the Church District High Road site of grace drops the Cerulean-Sapping Cracked Tear, which restores FP on successful hits when consumed in the Mixed Physik. The Furnace Visages can be used to craft Hefty Furnace Pots.

   <strong>
    Martial Arts Tycoon

  is a simulation game where players will step into the world of Lucas, a young trainer who inherits a jiu-jitsu gym in the favelas of Río de Janeiro, Brazil. Players will not only learn how to run their own gym through classic tycoon elements and train future champions with customizable workouts and classes, but they'll also be immersed in the diverse culture of Río de Janeiro.

  Chance Glasco, the CEO and creative director of Good Dog Studios—the indie studio behind
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon
  </em>
  —previously worked on
  <em>
   Medal of Honor: Allied Assault
  </em>
  and later co-founded Infinity Ward, which went on to create the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  franchise. Glasco had just turned 20 years old when he entered the gaming industry, and after working on first-person-shooter games for about 13 years, he told Game Rant that he wanted "to do something different." Eventually, he landed in Brazil, where he visited many times as a guest speaker, and founded Good Dog Studios, whose core team is also people recovering from working in the AAA field. At Gamescom LATAM, Glasco told Game Rant that he's past making "the biggest game ever" and instead wants to do something with more impact.

  Players will start off in
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon
  </em>
  on an empty rooftop of the favelas. Aspiring fighters will eventually find their way to the gym where players will meet different NPCs with varying backgrounds and different traits. In the teaser trailer, Jair Camara is shown with the traits "Early Reader," "Loner," and "Farmer." Players will also be able to see an NPC's skill level, like Jair's, who's level 4 in jiu-jitsu and level 13 in defense, submission, passing, sweeping, and takedown. Players will train their students in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, self-defense, and physical fitness, which will ultimately affect their personal traits.

 <p>
  Every NPC is procedurally generated and has their own life path. Glasco explained that, in the simulation game, if someone has a life path where they grew up with drug-addicted parents, there's a higher chance that they're going to have a drug-related character trait, which will affect them negatively. But training them in jiu-jitsu can help improve character traits and get rid of the negative ones. However, negative traits aren't completely avoidable, because if players make "bad choices," it could also give their fighter a negative trait. An example of a negative trait is a bully, which could be utilized for strength and athleticism, but there's a higher chance that that fighter injures another NPC while training with them. Then, players would have to decide if they want that student in their gym.

  Glasco also moved to Brazil and that helped his ability to depict the people of Rio. Of course, he notes that it's not just his experience going into the game:

   Even with me, who's lived in Brazil for over three years in total, I'm still not going to have the whole picture. All of my friends are Brazilian, and in Rio, I have a couple of best friends. One works for the city and the other lives in the same developed community that is depicted in the game, so I get to see different perspectives from different people, different walks of life.

  Glasco also explained that a lot of media, including films like 2002's
  <em>
   City of God
  </em>
  or 2007's
  <em>
   Elite Squad
  </em>
  often depict Brazilian people as drug dealers, traffickers, and just overall bad people. He also openly acknowledged that perhaps he has added to this stereotype; back in 2009,
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  took players to Brazil's favelas to fight a militia composed of criminals and worse. Despite these media stereotypes, Glascoe emphasized that the people living in those areas are more than this one-dimensional criminal stereotype. Good Dog Studios is "trying to address some of those stereotypes through the game."

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I think, like when you're touching on the favela-related stuff, when you're talking about more of what happens within those communities, we're going to show the difficulties that those people face living there...We're not going to dive into politics, it's just going to create division and everything, but we want people to understand what are some of the struggles that those communities deal with.

  Despite the global love for mixed martial arts, there hasn't been a tycoon game for it. 2016's
  <em>
   Punch Club
  </em>
  was close, as Glasco mentioned, but players would manage a boxer rather than the full gym. It'll be interesting to see how Good Dog Studios implements the different tycoon elements, addresses Brazilian stereotypes, and shows the impact of climate change all through
  <em>
   Martial Arts Tycoon
  </em>
  .

    The First Descendant

  is a loot-based shooter that pits players against the elements, plowing through waves of enemies in order to obtain valuable rewards. Some items may help boost players' stats, while others can upgrade weapons and armor for harder battles. The only way to get stronger is to continue joining missions and playing with other gamers around the world to continue obtaining these rewards.

  Caliber is a premium currency available in
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  , and
  <strong>
   it is only purchasable via the online store.
  </strong>
  The only way players can obtain Caliber is by spending real-life money to buy packages. These bundles range from
  <strong>
   $6.99 CAD for 250 Caliber, to $133.49 CAD for 5750 Caliber.
  </strong>
  While purchasing Caliber doesn't guarantee a player's success in
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  players can use it to purchase advantages to make life easier.

  For players interested in purchasing Caliber, an active credit card is required to finalize any transaction. Steam users will be redirected to their Steam wallets to complete the order, and will get a request to add funds if the wallet doesn't have enough to complete the transaction. PlayStation and Xbox users will receive a prompt opening with a confirmation message, using the credit card linked to the account.

     There have been several reports of players not receiving their Caliber once the purchase has been completed in the shop. There appears to be a delay between the time the transaction goes through to the time the players receive their funds. Players are recommended to contact the service provider if the issue persists.

  One of the best ways to spend some of that Caliber is on
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  's Battle Pass. A premium upgrade costs as little as 500 Caliber, but if players wish to order a premium upgrade with a 25 level increase bonus, it increases the price to 1500 Caliber.
  <em>
   The First Descendant
  </em>
  's Battle Pass comes with 96 levels and 12 pages of items to earn. It lasts 60 days, giving players enough time to maximize their return.

 <p>
  The Battle Pass comes packed with plenty of different items, including player and weapon skins, decals, emotes, and even additional Caliber. While the total amount of Caliber players can earn is only 300 if they reach Level 96, it still gives players an opportunity to earn back some of the currency they used to order the Battle Pass. Players can unlock levels through earning experience and completing special missions.

  While players start off choosing between Viessa, Lepic, and Ajax, they won't have to worry about being stuck with them forever. Players can use Caliber to unlock individual Descendants. You can obtain a special one to use as your main, or to buy them all and have a wealth of options to choose from during their playthrough. Descendants range in price from
  <strong>
   300 to 900 Caliber,
  </strong>
  with the more expensive options being the higher-powered descendants.

 <p>
  Skins and makeup are also available for descendants as a way to help players stand out among the rest of the group, but are purely aesthetic. These items do not grant any special boosts or enhance a player's stats, but they do help make players feel special. Some skins are limited and can cost upwards of 1900 Caliber, while premium skins cost 750 Caliber and common skins go for 125 Caliber. Makeup is by far the cheapest, at 50 Caliber per option.

  Whether it's to add some spunk to victories or ensure an easier path to better loot, players can also spend their Caliber on things like cosmetics, emotes, and convenience items specifically targeted to grant bonuses. Cosmetics range from celebrations meant to give team members a good laugh to showing off some items on their armor. These can cost anywhere from 50 to 500 Caliber, depending on the category and rarity of the item.

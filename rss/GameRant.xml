  While
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  is largely known as a gameplay-first series,
  <em>
   Aria of Sorrow
  </em>
  should still be commended for boasting a pretty engaging plot. Every character in the game boasts a compelling personality as players try to figure out which character is masquerading as Dracula.
 </p>
 <p>
  This keeps players on the edge of their seats as they make progress in Dracula's castle and deal with a whole host of enemies.
  <em>
   Aria of Sorrow

  's plot twist builds up beautifully as players second-guess every character's true intentions during this glorious adventure.

  is one of the better games in the series that fans can check out if they want to enjoy a great plot. While the second

 <p>
  Ubisoft has officially unveiled
  <strong>
   <em>
    Rainbow Six Siege
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Year 10 Season 1, including the debut of the new operator Rauora and the reputation system.
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  has been getting regular updates since its launch, with some bringing new seasons and features to attract new players and keep veterans engaged.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most recent
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  season is Operation Collision Point, which was released in December 2024. The main part of the update is the Blackbeard remaster, giving one of the shooter's veteran operators a complete revamp of his abilities. This same season saw the addition of new cross-play between console and PC, new measures to protect and improve the player experience, and various balances. Now, Ubisoft's shooter is preparing for what's next.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  Year 10 has been officially unveiled, the first season being Operation Prep Phase. The highlight of the update will be the debut of Rauora, a new
  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  attack operator who will be first available via the battle pass, and later, via Renown or R6 Credits. For the first time in the game's history, a character will have a Reaper MK2 pistol as her secondary weapon. Her unique gadget is the Deployable Omnilink Mesh (D.O.M.), a launcher that deploys bulletproof panels on doorways. With them, Rauora can block her opponents' line of sight and obstruct their movement.

  <em>
   Rainbow Six Siege
  </em>
  Year 9 Season 4 will receive an Alpha Pack as a reward. On the other hand, players with a Disruptive or Dishonorable rating will be restricted from playlists and unlocking certain rewards. The update will add new mechanisms to reduce exploits and cheating, and a new matchmaking system. From Operation Prep Phase, the devs plan to optimize matchmaking based on the volume of server requests with the inclusion of dynamic matchmaking 1.0, guaranteeing better matches even at peak times.

  Since the days of old-school RPGs, medieval-style action games have been a staple of gaming, from the high fantasy combat of
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls: Arena
  </em>
  all the way back in 1994 to the beautifully grounded realism of
  <em>
   Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
  </em>
  . With a major release every several years, this genre isn't falling into obscurity any time soon. Many more years of dragon slaying, justice bringing, and world exploring awaits.
 </p>
 <p>
  With only a sword on their back and a handful of coins to their name, players must survive in hostile worlds, overcoming the dangers of dastardly dragons, savage brigands, and villainous empires. Players must master their weapons and abilities if they are to stand any hope of carving out a legacy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following games are ranked on how engaging their action is — and the extent to which their medieval-style setting enhances gameplay.

  In this iconic open-world high fantasy RPG, players take on the role of a newly escaped prisoner of war. In this game, players explore the beautiful land of
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , locking swords with its many dangers, both fantastical and not. Here, players will make a name for themselves, rising from a penniless prisoner to the legendary savior of Tamriel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Locked in frantic, fast-paced combat, often against multiple foes, players must quickly learn how to balance their health, stamina, and magicka if they're to survive. There's tons of variety to be found in this game's combat system, including an expansive perk tree where players can unlock an array of powerful bonuses and abilities. Unfortunately,
  <em>
   Skyrim's
  </em>
  combat system does not hold up long-term. Late-game combat devolves into simple button mashing, with little risk of death for the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Skyrim's
  </em>
  medieval setting is a vital part of its narrative. Every quest, from the grand to the mundane, revolves around it, whether deities, destiny, and dragons or the more realistic threats of clan feuds, encroaching empires, and conflicting factions.

 <p>
  In this open-world fantasy RPG, players are let loose to explore the beautifully wild lands of
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  . Wrestle treasure hordes from deadly monsters, assemble an unstoppable squad, or fulfill their destiny as the Arisen; the possibilities are endless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players looking for a more organic approach to combat are in for a treat here. Combat can erupt at any moment, turning peaceful forest exploration into an epic player vs. griffon battle for survival. Even players expecting danger can never be certain of what to expect. All it takes is an unsuspecting troll to wander into a player's path, and their simple goblin fight transforms into a frantic battle for survival. Once locked into such an encounter, players must navigate an ever-evolving battle as monsters and companions adapt their strategies from one moment to the next. Players must keep up if they're to stand a chance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, none of these epic battles would be possible without
  <em>
   Dragon Dogma 2's
  </em>
  medieval fantasy setting. Many locations lean more heavily on their medieval inspiration, rather than the fantastical elements of the world, but the game offers little in the way of enemy variety, which can detract from long-term enjoyment of the open-world experience.

 <p>
  Renowned for its intense difficulty and complex combat mechanics,
  <em>
   Dark Souls 3
  </em>
  players take on the role of lone warriors fighting through the lands of a world fallen to decay. Terrifying horrors and otherworldly terrors lurk around every corner, ready to butcher players at a moment's notice. Needless to say, this is not a game for the light-hearted or the impatient.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players looking to push their skills to the limit will find a lot to love in this series. Pitting players against seemingly unkillable monsters, players are forced to reevaluate everything they've ever learned about combat. There's no overpowered weapon, difficulty lowering, or pausing here — only players, their characters, and their ability to adapt and overcome. For some, this will be the ideal challenge. Those looking for a laidback and relaxing game will, however, want to look elsewhere.
 </p>
 <p>
  No game quite subverts players' expectations as well as the
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  games when it comes to its setting. Rather than the beautifully whimsical worlds players have come to anticipate from high fantasy, players are instead greeted by a festering world gone to ruin, one where elves and dragons are replaced by gruesome horrors and terrible monstrosities. The setting itself is the most fantastical on this list, but what it lacks in medieval realism it more than makes up for in its gritty action.

  Combat is a visually engaging and mechanically rich endeavor that presents players with an array of abilities and attacks with which to obliterate their enemies. Built around the classic selection of mage, warrior, and rogue, each class boasts three unique subclasses filled to the brim with deadly attacks and powerful abilities that are sure to change the tide of any battle. The only problem is deciding which skill to pick first! Combat can also strike at any moment, as it's inherently tied to the game's narrative. All it takes is one poor decision and a tense negotiation descends into a deadly brawl.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Inquisition's
  </em>
  medieval setting is at the heart of the series. Every game is driven by medieval high fantasy elements, usually that of the misuse of magic and its world-shattering effects. The same can be said of most side quests, which feature magic, mythical monsters, and gods galore. Others, meanwhile, revolve around more realistic medieval themes, including those of poverty, famine, and class division.

 <p>
  By far the best aspect of this game is its combat, which is responsive, satisfying, and oh-so-varied. Whether facing off against orc grunts, hulking generals, or rampaging monsters, no one battle ever feels the same, as players always have new surroundings, threats, and environmental hazards to contend with. Combat is incredibly engaging, rewarding well-timed attacks with brutal combos and epic killing animations.
 </p>
 <p>
  For all the superhuman powers this game gives players, it sure can be punishing! Overconfidence is a swift killer, especially on harder difficulties. Death is penalized by advancing time, meaning a general that players were looking to capture might be dead by the time the player respawns.
  <em>
   Shadow Of War

  also features a complex skill tree for players to sink their teeth into. With the right skills unlocked, players can even ride drakes into battle!

  The
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade
  </em>
  series showcases some of the best combat seen in the medieval action genre. With only a weapon on their back and faithful steed beneath them, players can single-handedly change the course of even the most futile of battles. Combat is intensely brutal as players fight on the ground against hordes of enemy soldiers. Helping them in this quest is an array of weapons, armor, and equipment for players to choose from, each with their own advantages and drawbacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Mount &amp; Blade 2's
  </em>
  medieval setting is the backbone of the series. Its gameplay revolves around players carving out a name for themselves, whether as a mercenary, raider, or the ruler of a nation, something that is directly instigated by its medieval world — that being one of hardship, where those who fail to obtain glory fade into obscurity.

 <p>
  In this realistic open-world RPG, players follow Henry's story as he sets out on a quest to avenge his murdered family. This is not a world of nonchalant battles and glory-seeking but one of gritty violence and daily struggles for survival.
 </p>
 <p>
  Button-mashing attacks will get players nowhere here. Instead, precision, timing, and restraint are the name of the game, with combat being more a test of strategy than it is of strength. Akin to reality, fighting multiple enemies is all but a death sentence for new players. Even for the war-hardened, these battles should not be entered into lightly, no matter how powerful Henry becomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Medieval warfare is this game's bread and butter, with a central plot that seeks to shed light on the truly horrifying reality of war. There is no fantasy in which the player or Henry can hide from this reality — no magical way to revive the dead and prevent catastrophes, nor an unquestionably evil enemy to unite against. It’s just people murdering other people, perpetuating a cycle of vengeance and violence.

  At this point, it's expected that there will be a permanent upgrade system in a roguelike as opposed to the old style, which was more arcade-like in nature.
  <strong>
   <em>
    Warriors: Abyss
   </em>
  </strong>
  , a spin-off to both
  <em>
   Dynasty Warriors
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Samurai Warriors
  </em>
  , does indeed have a good upgrade system, referred to as the Hall of Bonded Souls.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will start
  <em>
   Warriors: Abyss
  </em>
  with over a dozen heroes to choose from, but the Hall of Bonded Souls can unlock more. There are about a hundred in total, and future updates from Koei Tecmo/Omega Force may add more. Unlocking heroes comes with the bonus of upgrading stats, including Attack Power, Defense, and Health. So, of the many heroes in the Hall of Bonded Souls, these are the ones that are both beneficial and fun to use once unlocked.

   Upgrade Effect: +3 Defense
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Hanbei Takenaka is one of the younger characters in
  <em>
   Warriors: Abyss
  </em>
  , and he also has a strange weapon. His shield is a yo-yo that he can fling at enemies as if it were a natural extension of his body. Players should find it easy to string combos together with this weapon, and Hanbei is an overall agile character.
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking his stats into consideration, he’s about middle of the pack without excelling in anything in particular, but that’s not a bad thing. His boost to the player's overall skill tree is good for Defense, too.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Upgrade Effect: +4 Health
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Huang Zhong looks like he should have retired from being an action hero, but this old codger still has some fight in him. He’s one of the few bow users in
  <em>
   Warriors: Abyss
  </em>
  who actually uses the weapon properly for most of his combos. As an opposing example, one of the starting bow characters, Ina, uses her weapon more like a sword.
 </p>
 <p>
  Huang can pull back and fire many arrows to hold enemies back. The wrinkles are deceiving, but Huang is worth unlocking for sure, and he grants a good boost to Health, too.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Upgrade Effect: +2 Defense
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Kotaro Fuma is one of the deadly ninjas that players can summon from the shadows. He looks like a demon and behaves like one, too, as he can unnaturally elongate his arms, evoking imagery of stretchy-limbed characters like Mr. Fantastic.
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn’t make a lot of sense, but these Musou games have never been about logic anyway. His sickest move has to be Kotaro’s Musou attack, which sees him spinning like a top, with players being able to direct him around for a limited time. He will boost Defense, too, but that’s not as cool as actually playing Kotaro.

 <p>
  Masamune Date is a samurai who seems like he should have a disadvantage with an eyepatch. However, he still manages to hit his targets with deadly accuracy. His main weapon is a katana, but his combos, along with his Musou attack, see him bringing out pistols, as if to emulate a gun-toting action hero akin to Dante from
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Right next to Masamune on the upgrade tree is Magoichi Saika, a character who wields a musket. They both boost Attack power and are fun to use, but Masamune is a bit more versatile.

  Naotora Li looks like a bit of a ditzy fighter because of the way her character is positioned, and her speech pattern is timid. However, like Huang’s old age, Naotora has a deadly secret. This beauty can punch so hard that she can create tornadoes on the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her punches and kicks are legendary, making her both an agile and a strong warrior to choose. She’d give a warrior monk like Tifa from
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  a run for her money and then some.

 <p>
  Sun Quan, like many characters in
  <em>
   Warriors: Abyss
  </em>
  , uses a sword. However, he holds it behind his back and drags it on the ground to create a dazzling effect. If players can string the right moves together, Sun will zip behind an enemy and then surprise them with a flaming blade.
 </p>
 <p>
  This fire effect will then continue to burn for a few seconds on his sword. Sun is one of the only characters who can use elemental coatings like this naturally without the aid of temporary upgrades like Emblems, making him a rare commodity.

  Tadakatsu Honda is an example of
  <strong>
   a
   <em>
    Warriors: Abyss
   </em>
   character who players should unlock as fast as possible
  </strong>
  , but he is not fun to use. Tadakatsu is plenty strong with his attacks, and he can retain a lot of damage. His slowness is not appealing, though, and his combos are kind of basic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, his boost to Defense is too good to pass up. Boosting Defense, even more than Health, will help
  <em>
   Warriors: Abyss
  </em>
  players survive longer, and survival is always a key factor in a roguelike.

  There are characters like Sun Quan who have a light command of the elements. Then there are mage-like characters akin to Yoshitsugu Otani in
  <em>
   Warriors: Abyss
  </em>
  , who can control straight-up magic.
 </p>
 <p>
  With his frilly baton, this wizard can create bolts of lightning, balls of energy, tornadoes, lasers, and so much more with just a few simple flicks. He is weaker against bosses, though, so he is definitely more of a crowd-dispersing character, but that’s still pretty intense.

  The Predator Strain is a terrifying Terminid subfaction in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Helldivers 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , mutated by the mysterious spore cloud known as the Gloom. These enhanced creatures are faster, stronger, smarter, and deadlier than their normal counterparts. Currently, only two Predator Strains have been revealed: the Predator Stalkers and the Predator Hunters, with possibly more hiding deep within the Gloom.

  Facing these new Terminid enemies requires more than just a good weapon and a stratagem that creates flashy explosions. You need a well-planned loadout that balances firepower, utility, and survival. To that end, here are the most optimal loadouts and builds recommended for the Predator Strain in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , ensuring you have the weapons, stratagems, and gear needed to put them down with ease.

  are the best answers to the Gloom-enhanced strain of Terminid Predators. Both shotguns stagger enemies on hit, stopping them in their tracks, and giving you enough time to unload more pellets into their mutated carapaces. The Punisher does more damage, but the Cookout fires incendiary pellets to set enemies ablaze, allowing you to retreat or focus on other targets while leaving them to burn.
 </p>
 <p>
  The footage below shows how powerful stagger shots can be in
  <em>

  . Notice how the Cookout momentarily stuns Predator Stalkers with each shot, and completely obliterates Predator Hunters with a single blast.

   EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank

  takes care of all heavies. It also provides the distinct advantage of picking up another support weapon you may find at a point of interest, leaving you free to call in an EAT-17 during an encounter and switch weapons as needed.

 <p>
  The AX/TX-13 "Guard Dog" Dog Breath may not be the most popular choice, but it is a perfect fit for a Predator Strain loadout in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . This automated backpack blinds and slows enemies that get too close. With Predator Stalkers and Hunters able to quickly reach your location by the dozens, the Dog Breath ensures your flank stays covered at all times.

  The best Predator Strain loadout in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  is all about mowing down Terminid swarms while keeping them at bay. The SG-8 Punisher offers
  <strong>
   devastating close-medium-range stopping power
  </strong>
  to quickly neutralize any advancing Predator Stalkers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your main firepower, however, will come from the hail of bullets from either the

   MG-43 Machine Gun

  . Both are top-tier support weapons in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , featuring
  <strong>
   high fire rates, large magazine capacities and stagger on every hit
  </strong>
  , making them perfect for cutting through waves of Predator Terminids.
 </p>
 <p>
  Add the Siege-Ready armor passive to this loadout, and your weapons get increased reload speed and ammo capacity, meaning
  <strong>
   your relentless barrage of fire will be even longer
  </strong>
  . When the magazine dries out, switch to the Punisher to blast any remaining enemies. Pair Siege-Ready with heavy armor, and you will be an unstoppable juggernaut, holding the line against even the most overwhelming swarms.

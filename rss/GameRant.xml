      <title>Roger Craig Smith Reflects on His Unorthodox Path to Voicing Ezio, Batman, and Sonic</title>

 <p>
  Roger Craig Smith, who has voiced iconic characters including Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Batman, Kyle Crane from Dying Light, Sonic, Captain America and numerous others, recently sat down with GameRant’s Naomi Kyle on Character Select.
 </p>

 <p>
  He talks about breaking into voice work, his early career path and how it continues to shape his voice work, and gives his thoughts on everything from returning to a character years later and VR.

  A non-linear career path
 </h2>
 <p>
  “I have, as of late, been joking with my friends, going, man, look at us. Look at where we are in life and all these things that have happened,” he told Kyle. “Then I chuck on. I go, exactly as we planned, right? Nobody I know is like, oh yeah. This is all where I was headed.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Smith started acting early, attributing his first line in an elementary school rendition of Charlotte's Web to placing him on a path into the arts and comedy. This single line caused raucous laughter to fill the room, a feeling Smith can still recall.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I can, still, now at this age, remember what that felt like to get a rise out of people,” he said. “And so I really think if we were to go, in the literal sense, it probably began there that I enjoyed the idea of moving people and making people laugh.”
 </p>
 <p>
  From there, Smith stayed involved in the theater arts through high school. He was a self-professed class clown, and began doing theatrical work outside of school in a youth musical Repertory Theater called MYART. He acted in everything from Grease to the Sound of Music and Wizard of Oz.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I enjoyed discovering what my strength was, which, back then, was being comedic, and it was also just what I loved,” he said. Once he’d graduated from high school and started doing jobs including pizza delivery and barista work, he discovered he didn’t want to work a classic 9 to 5. So, Smith started getting into stand-up comedy.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I went and watched an open mic. I watched a couple of comics do some stuff, and I thought I could do that. I'll put something together,” he said. At the same time, Smith went back to college to get his degree in screen writing. As he pursued a stand-up career, the idea of doing voice work was planted by his high school theater arts instructor.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I did a private stand-up show for her. We got done, and she was like, ‘Do you want me to be nice or be honest?’ And I go, ‘I'm here for honesty and not for being nice,’” Smith said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “She goes, ‘Where are your voices and characters? You're just doing stuff that anybody else could do. You can conjure up characters. You were always my little Robin Williams, why don't you go do that?’”
 </p>
 <p>
  From then on, Smith started incorporating characters into his act, which helped him stand out, and is what stuck with audiences. However, he knew he didn’t want to be a comedian forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the time, he had his eyes set on becoming a screenwriter (and he nearly made it, too) but his trajectory was altered after performing in an improv showcase at the Aspen Comedy Festival.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The show ends. We get back on stage, and [the evaluator] critiques us in front of our fellow stand-ups,” Smith said. "She gets to me and just goes, 'Hey, who represents you for voiceover?' And I was like, ‘Yeah, nobody.’ She goes, ‘You do so many characters in comedy and voices in your act. I thought you were a cartoon guy.'"

 <p>
  The next day, Smith started researching how to get into voiceover work. He took a class, worked with someone from his old film school to put together a demo, and took to the streets.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I stomped the ground around Orange County, California, and just dropped off demos in a suit, trying to be different. And out of 11 places that I found that were based down there, about three ended up calling me. I started working for them, took a class that one of them offered, sort of booking work. And I just basically started, entrepreneurially, building my own little voiceover business,” Smith said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, Smith took another class, which ended up being audited by a booth director for Abrams Artist Agency. She took a liking to his work, he submitted his demos, and a few weeks later, he had professional representation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It may sound simple when laid out like that, but Smith had to put in serious work. His work ethic was formed at an early age, slinging hundreds of avocados that grew in the neighborhood where he lived, and working for a family friend’s produce business during the summer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of his parents are ambitious workers who instilled early in him how important professional drive can be. But careers aren’t always linear, and Smith didn’t always have a clear vision of what he wanted.
 </p>
 <p>
  “On my 30th birthday, I woke up and was kind of like, oh, man, I’ve got to get this going. I’ve got to figure this out. I'm entrepreneurial, but I'm not really established in anything right now. And that was when things really started to kind of kick into gear, the year of my 30th birthday with getting representation and all that kind of stuff,” he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  His experience in these different fields – comedy, screen writing, theater work – all flowed together into his voice work.
 </p>
 <p>
  With stand up, Smith said, it’s almost like playing football. You huddle up, you do a post-game analysis, look at what worked, what didn’t, what’s the best way to approach the next show. It also taught him how to shed his ego and keep moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I utilize that in voiceover all the time. They want to know what else you got. Try another thing. Let's do it this way. Let's do it that way,” he said. Studying screenwriting helped him understand character development, story arcs, callbacks, plants and payoffs. His work ethic, honed over years, pushed him on.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All those things, just kind of all of a sudden, aligned. And I would find myself sitting in a voiceover booth going, I cannot believe I'm getting paid to do this thing that I would still do for free and started out doing for free to get people to, you know, take a listen. Here I am. As content as can be, and I feel like I'm good at this. I feel like I'm right where I should be,” he said.

  Smith on bringing iconic characters to life, and stepping back into their roles years later.
 </h2>
 <p>
  Smith has been playing Sonic for 15 years. He’s been the voice of Ezio and Batman for over a decade. Stepping into such iconic shoes (or in this case, tights) can be a tricky line to walk. Smith said he tries to respect those who came before while also bringing something new to each character.

  “When it comes to Ezio, I always say, look, that performance is as much me and Ida Darvish and Peter Arpesella and Amanda Wyatt, my director, and Patrice Désilets, who was there for AC to like Corey May, our writer. I mean, there were so many people that were involved,” he said. “It's a collaborative thing.”

 <p>
  That’s how film, video games and TV productions work, Smith said. It takes a team of people to create these stories and characters, and each – including himself as the voice actor – has an impact on the result.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I try to remember that, look, [Darvish] was my dialect coach on AC two, and about halfway through Brotherhood, she had to move for a job opportunity. And it's like, you know, she was instrumental in helping me shape what was our sort of, as always, I call it the Italia-spanglinish accent, but also speaking lines in Italian that I'd never done. She was crucial to that. And so I can't take full credit,” he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smith had a support network around him to help shape Ezio. The final performance was a collaborative effort between Wyatt, himself and others. “[Wyatt] was there to say, pull back on this. Or no push there,” he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wyatt was also instrumental in creating what Smith views as the quintessential scene in Arkham Origins. The confrontation between Alfred and the Caped Crusader, where Alfred is expressing worry about Bruce being in over his head, wouldn’t have come out the way it had without Wyatt’s help.

  “[Wyatt] was crucial in guiding me into a performance that I could be proud of, and that we both were like, ‘Yep, I like that. I'm okay with this.’ You know, ‘That was good,’” Smith said.
 </p>
 <p>
  And yet, he still gets nervous stepping back into the shoes of these characters he’s played for so long. He said he feels some pressure around getting things like the accent right, but the people around him help to keep him on track.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But also, along with that, it’s like, oh my gosh, you just asked me a question about voicing a character that I'm still getting to do over 10 years later. That is a good problem to have in this industry,” he said.

  <strong>
   Digtoise can be found in the Underground Desert
  </strong>
  , the sandy area deep below the surface of the desert in your world. Within this big cave full of yellow sand, you'll find pyramids and buggy enemies like scarabs, but also Digtoise.
 </p>
 <p>
  To get to the Underground Desert, dig down from the surface of the desert. Use a pickaxe or bombs to make a path.
  <strong>
   Digtoise looks like a fossil block stuck in the sand walls or floor
  </strong>
  – a round, spiky turtle shape. Mine it with any pickaxe, even a basic copper one.

  Once you mine the fossil block, Digtoise will be placed in your inventory.
  <strong>
   Left-click to summon Digtoise
  </strong>
  , and it will follow you like a pet. You can also
  <strong>
   right-click to call Digtoise back safely
  </strong>
  or right-click near it for a fun pet animation. Digtoise works best before Hardmode since it digs soft blocks but not tough ores later on.

      <title>Multiplayer Games That Became Popular Years After Launch</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/multiplayer-games-became-popular-years-after-launch/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Not every
  <strong>
   multiplayer game
  </strong>
  comes out of the gate as a massive hit. For every
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   ARC Raiders,
  </em>
  many other games have all the elements to achieve success, but they're brought down by other issues that hold them back. These issues aren't insurmountable, but they take time to iron out.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->
 <p>
  These next games went through that exact process. For a multitude of reasons, they didn't catch on at launch, but over time, players found these
  <strong>
   multiplayer games, and they became incredibly popular years after their original release.
  </strong>
  Not only are all these games still played today, but some of them are the most popular games on the planet, even if, when their journey started, they seemed destined for the dustbin of gaming history.

  Initially released in 2018,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Among Us
   </em>
  </strong>
  was barely a blip on the radar. This social deduction game was largely overlooked, which developer Innersloth attributed to their own poor marketing skills. At the time, the game's concurrent player count on Steam hovered between 30 and 50. Not 30 and 50 thousand; literally a maximum of 50 players.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two things turned the fortunes of
  <em>
   Among Us.
  </em>
  First, the Covid pandemic hit, forcing people to stay at home and seek other outlets for socialization. Second,
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  was picked up by Twitch streamers, beginning with American Twitch streamer Sodapoppin and eventually being promoted by major names like Pokimane, MrBeast, Ninja, Shroud, and PewDiePie. The rest, as they say, is history.
  <em>
   Among Us'
  </em>
  playercount skyrocketed, sales followed suit, and today the game has sold over 30 million copies on Steam alone.

 <p>
  The tale is well-told by now. At launch,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Battlefront 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  was so loaded with microtransactions that it instantly became the poster child for EA's obsession with excessive monetization. It was so bad that the game featured loot boxes within other loot boxes, the rewards for which were more powerful weapons and characters that effectively made the game pay-to-win.
 </p>
 <p>
  To try to save their game's reputation, DICE removed all microtransactions (minus some very minor cosmetic monetization) and added a ton of content through free updates. This drew in a massive influx of new players. While
  <em>
   Battlefront 2's
  </em>
  perception was still marred by its launch, those who have played it since DICE made those changes stand by it as one of the best multiplayer shooters on the market right now.

  Launching in early 2014
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Elder Scrolls Online
   </em>
  </strong>
  initially used a pricey subscription model akin to
  <em>
   WoW,
  </em>
  charging players a monthly fee to explore the world of Tamriel. In and of itself, this didn't sink the game, but when combined with a lackluster experience that did very little new and was essentially the same as playing
  <em>
   Skyrim
  </em>
  , just with other players running around disrupting things, it wasn't received well.
 </p>
 <p>
  One year after its launch,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  made the switch to a buy-to-play model with microtransactions and adopted a seasonal content model, rather than major annual chapter updates, all of which significantly improved player opinions about the game. Rebranded
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited,
  </em>
  things started to look up for the MMORPG. The first major expansion,
  <em>
   Morrowind,
  </em>
  released in 2017, was the icing on the cake, drawing long-time
  <em>
   TES
  </em>
  fans to the game, spiking its player count and revenue, and turning it into a success. As of 2024,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​has earned $2 billion in revenue.

  Despite being a Bethesda property,
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls Online
  </em>
  was developed by ZeniMax, and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  was actually Bethesda's first multiplayer game. Unfortunately, it didn't perform very well following its 2018 launch. Technical issues were a big factor, but other criticisms included aimless gameplay, questionable design, and a complete lack of NPCs populating the world. While
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  sold 1.4 million copies in its launch year, many of those players voiced their displeasure with the product. Worse still, the in-game currency was broken by a duplication glitch, allowing players to amass dozens of in-game items which they would then sell in external markets.
 </p>
 <p>
  It took until 2020 for things to start turning around. The catalyst for this was the
  <em>
   Wastelanders
  </em>
  update, which responded to a major player criticism by introducing NPCs into the world. This update was met with a relatively positive response, but it was enough to show that Bethesda was heading in the right direction. From there, further updates added new content to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  while making improvements to past issues, and the player count began to steadily climb as a result.

  Originally released in 2010, the first version of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Final Fantasy 14
   </em>
  </strong>
  was a critical and commercial failure, easily the worst that this long-running franchise had ever seen. Critics tore it apart for everything from its technical state to its shallow gameplay and uninteresting progression. It was so bad that the original version of the game was permanently shut down at the end of 2012.
 </p>
 <p>
  Less than a year later came
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn
  </em>
  , a full revamp of the first attempt featuring a fully reworked HUD, combat mechanics, and progression system.
  <em>
   FF14
  </em>
  may still rely on traditional MMO design tropes, but it executes on them to perfection. In fact, the re-release was so successful that Square Enix, which had a poor fiscal year in 2013, attributed its return to profitability in 2014 largely to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 14.
  </em>
  It's one of the all-time great gaming comeback stories, and while one can debate if the original release and
  <em>
   A Realm Reborn
  </em>
  can even be considered the same game, it's undeniable that the re-release garnered a lot more popularity than its previous iteration.

  Comparing
  <em>
   <strong>
    Warframe
   </strong>
  </em>
  today to what it was at launch is essentially like comparing two different games. Yes, in both cases, you're playing a space ninja called a Tenno, you have a sword and guns, and you're taking down waves of enemies, but what's on offer in the current version makes the 2013 release look like a tech demo shown as a proof of concept. However, that's also why its first iteration didn't garner a ton of positive attention. It wasn't
  <em>
   bad
  </em>
  by any stretch, but its uptake was slowed by middling critical reviews, low player counts, gameplay that grew stale too quickly, and typically unfavorable comparisons to
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  .

  However, developer Digital Extremes was keenly aware that it had a small but devout group of consistent players who would communicate regularly with the devs on potential improvements. This was motivation enough, and the updates slowly but surely started to roll out. With each update, new mechanics, Warframes, weapons, and enemy types are introduced. While it wasn't a rapid ascent,
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  has gradually amassed a registered player count exceeding 50 million people as of 2019, and that number is probably much larger today, as its popularity has grown even further. The best part is that those players consistently return, maintaining the game's popularity where other free-to-play titles might wane over time.

      <title>One Way or Another, Overwatch 2 is Changing Forever on February 4</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">

  <em>
   <strong>
    Overwatch 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  fans may be approaching Season 21 with trepidation — Season 20 brought the release of Vendetta, which means next Season will lack a new hero — but Blizzard is planning to drop a Spotlight Stream to reignite the hype. On February 4, said Spotlight will release, and based on last year’s event, there is good reason to be excited. The previous spotlight teased the next several
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Seasons while also highlighting two of the biggest adjustments
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  has ever received: Perks and Stadium. Naturally, expectations are going to be high for the next Spotlight, especially given its most interesting trait: the recent removal of the “2” from the game’s title.
 </p>
 <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! -->

 <p>
  While the previous Spotlight was labeled as being for
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , the branding for this year’s stream removes the 2 completely. In fact, all socials have removed the number, confirming that this is a deliberate change. This is interesting, as Blizzard essentially spent years improving the game to a point where it actually deserved its status as a sequel. Still, the numbering only existed because of a failed PvE mode, so Blizzard may have finally decided it’s best to abandon the number because of that rough origin. Perhaps Blizzard has no plans to ever make an
  <em>
   Overwatch 3
  </em>
  , and realizing that
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  now includes basically everything the original game had, it may want to make the game look more accessible to newcomers. Players who never played the original
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  could feel intimidated by the number, much like potential
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  fans regularly say about
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  , so dropping it could give those gamers the push to finally jump in. However, there are far more interesting possibilities than a rebranding to consider, however unlikely they may be.

  Assuming that the branding for the Spotlight just reading “Overwatch” isn’t a hint at
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  being officially retitled, it could be suggesting that the stream will include more than just
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  -specific content. For instance, if another game set in the
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  universe were being unveiled, the Spotlight lacking the number 2 would instantly make sense. There are countless opportunities for a spin-off game, too, including:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Singleplayer entries focused on popular heroes like Genji or Tracer.
  </li>
  <li>
   A standalone, co-op-focused
   <em>
    Overwatch
   </em>
   game that finally makes good on the PvE promises from when
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
   was unveiled.
  </li>
  <li>
   Another attempt at Project Titan, with this second shot at an MMO able to lean into all the existing
   <em>
    Overwatch
   </em>
   lore.
  </li>
  <li>
   A fighting game spin-off like
   <em>
    League of Legends
   </em>
   ’
   <em>
    2XKO
   </em>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  It’s worth noting that all the Talon branding shared by Blizzard as of late (the villainous faction has replaced all the
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  logos on social media) could be hinting at special content centered around the organization. While a spin-off game about a terrorist group could be a tough sell given their heinous crimes, the characters and their dynamics remain interesting. For instance, Sombra is only using the group for her own gain and has a soft spot for Sigma, both of which could be explored better in a dedicated Talon project. What members of Talon would be playable in a Talon-focused experience is unclear, but it’s one of many possibilities for spin-off games that will hopefully happen one day. No matter what, though, it’s clear that the China-exclusive
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  event where Talon hijacked the game was only the beginning for the faction.

   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     It’s worth noting that the Talon logos could be building hype for a new Archives PvE mission, as Blizzard made a tongue-in-cheek reply to a YouTube comment on the video "where are your heroes now?," where a player asked if Archives was returning. Specifically, Blizzard said it would “archive” that request, which certainly reads like a teaser.

  While a new
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  game is an exciting thing to theorize about, it does ultimately feel like a pipe dream given how there are no leaks about this kind of project. At the same time, more books and comics wouldn't be enough to justify a stream focused on a wider
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  universe. Fortunately, there’s one other idea big enough to explain the Spotlight seemingly being franchise-oriented and not
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  -specific: an animated series. This has been one of the community’s most common requests over the years, especially with stellar adaptations like
  <em>
   Arcane
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  thriving. The
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  universe is full of interesting concepts for a multi-season show to explore, from the rise and fall of Overwatch to the Junkers. Apparently, Blizzard and Netflix tried to make such a show happen back in 2020, but it fell through. Perhaps that working relationship has been rekindled, or a new streaming partner has been found. Something involving animated content seems to be happening, though, based on a post from Blizzard cinematics director Jason Hill.
 </p>
 <p>
  Considering that Hill hasn’t posted about
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  in 2 years, this teaser is hugely exciting. At the very least, it suggests that we could be getting a proper animated short in the Pixar-like style that put the series on the map. Said short would likely focus on Doomfist’s battle with Vendetta, with the latter overthrowing the former, though it could just as easily be a trailer for a new hero. Perhaps the animated short is just the beginning, though, as a proper
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  television series would certainly explain why the February 4 Spotlight Stream seems to be franchise-wide and not centered on
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  only. Like the spin-off theory, though, this remains speculation, so fans will just have to wait and see what happens on February 4.

  Even if
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  is just rebranding itself, that’d be a decision worth celebrating. While the name
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  is associated with a Game of the Year-winning project that popularized an entire genre,
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , even if it has come a long way, will always be looked down on by some. Dropping the 2 would be a final acknowledgment that
  <em>
   Overwatch 2

   <em>
    Heartopia
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s first major seasonal update has arrived, and winter has officially taken over the island. The Winter Frost Season Event introduces new quests, limited-time mechanics, and seasonal collectibles. If that wasn’t enough, there’s also a slow-building storyline centered around the mysterious
  <strong>
   Frostspore Infection
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  While the full event runs from
  <strong>
   January 24 to March 14
  </strong>
  , the first week acts as a prep phase. This way, players can ease into what will eventually become one of the most content-rich updates in the game so far. If you’ve logged in and felt a little confused about what’s happening, this guide can walk you through the Winter Frost Season Event in
  <em>
   Heartopia
  </em>

  The Winter Frost Season runs from January 24, 2026, until March 14, 2026, with daily resets occurring around 6 AM server time. At the center of the event is the
  <strong>
   Frostspore Infection
  </strong>
  , a strange winter phenomenon spreading through
  <em>
   Heartopia
  </em>
  due to extreme cold. Villagers are worried, animals are affected, and the Guild needs help managing the situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a player, your role is to assist NPCs, protect wildlife, and help the town adapt to the freezing conditions. However, the first part of the event, the
  <strong>
   prep phase
  </strong>
  , will run from
  <strong>
   January 24 through January 31
  </strong>
  . To participate in the Winter Frost Season Prep Event, you need to meet two requirements:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   DG Guild Level 7
  </li>
  <li>
   Completion of the main story quest “
   <strong>
    The Answer Lies Within
   </strong>
   ”
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once eligible, you’ll receive a call from
  <strong>
   Atara
  </strong>
  when you log in. This starts the first prep quest and unlocks the
  <strong>
   Winter Prep app
  </strong>
  on your in-game watch.

    <p>
     When it’s snowing, players can
     <strong>
      shovel snow and build snowmen
     </strong>
     around town. It’s an adorable feature that’s perfect for photos. Besides that, construction signs around Onsen Mountain signal the arrival of the Ice Skating Dream, a brand-new activity, seperate from your hobbies. Players will help build the skating rink and unlock figure skating content.

  Phase I begins immediately on January 24. You’ll receive a few quests through the
  <strong>
   Winter Prep app
  </strong>
  . These quests are short and easy, designed to be completed casually rather than rushed.

  Phase II introduces new objectives centered around
  <strong>
   gathering feedback

  ’s residents. Completing these quests rewards stamps that contribute to future unlocks.

     . They are expected to
     <strong>
      appear after January 31

     , when the full Winter Frost Season officially begins. We'll update this guide as we uncover more details about the upcoming phase.

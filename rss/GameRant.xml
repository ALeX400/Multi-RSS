      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds: How to Get Aqua Sac</title>

 <p>
  Aqua Sacs are Equipment Materials in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  that are used in the crafting of some of the game's earliest elemental weapons. As the name of the item suggests, Aqua Sacs come from monsters that have an association with water, though players who are looking for the material may be confused about exactly which monster they should target. This guide is here to alleviate that confusion, and it explains exactly how to get Aqua Sacs in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  .

     This guide contains the names of two large monsters that appear in the first chapter of
     <em>
      Monster Hunter Wilds
     </em>
     . While there are no further spoilers about those monsters, players who would be bothered by learning their names before encountering them in-game should return to this guide after completing Chapter 1.

  Players can earn Aqua Sacs as Target Rewards upon slaying
  <strong>
   Balahara
  </strong>
  , a large monster that appears within the
  <strong>
   Windward Plains
  </strong>
  . For full clarity, Target Rewards are the items that are awarded at the end of a hunt, not those that are obtained by breaking a monster's parts, destroying its wounds, and harvesting its carcass, and the Windward Plains is the first ecosystem in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  That said, players are not guaranteed to receive an Aqua Sac as a Target Reward every time that they slay Balahara, as it drops only
  <strong>
   18%
  </strong>
  of the time. As such, players may need to fight Balahara several times before they receive this Equipment Material in
  <em>
   Monster Hunter Wilds
  </em>
  , and here is one way to quickly, and repeatedly, initiate that fight:

   Work through
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
   ' main quest to reach the preliminary fight against Balahara. This fight occurs in
   <strong>
    Chapter 1-4
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Speak with
   <strong>
    Alma
   </strong>
   after beating Balahara. She can be found near the Tent when in an ecosystem's Base Camp, and she also accompanies the Hunter when they venture out into the open world.
  </li>
  <li>
   Select Post/Join Quest, navigate to the Optional Quests tab, and select
   <strong>
    Sand Sea Surges
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Accept &amp; Depart to initiate the quest.
  </li>
  <li>
   Use the waypoint that is set to reach Balahara. Notably,
   <em>
    Monster Hunter Wilds
   </em>
   ' Seikret will take players directly to the monster if they mount it and use its auto-move feature.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h3 id="utha-duna">
  Utha Duna
 </h3>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Utha Duna
  </strong>
  is another large monster that can grant Aqua Sacs as a Target Reward, and players will fight it for the first time in the
  <strong>
   Scarlet Forest
  </strong>
  during
  <strong>
   Chapter 1-5
  </strong>
  . However, it is actually rarer to get an Aqua Sac from this monster than it is to get one from Balahara, as Utha Duna only awards the material 16% of the time. Players who are looking for Aqua Sacs are thus advised to stick with Balahra, though they are certainly free to farm Utha Duna, using the Optional Quest that becomes available after killing it once, if that is their preference.

      <title>PS Plus Free Games for March 2025 Explained</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/ps-plus-march-2025-dragon-age-veilguard-sonic-colors-tmnt-cowabunga/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Every month,
  <strong>
   PS Plus
  </strong>
  subscribers are granted access to a handful of games that they can add to their library, making the service more than worth the price to those with a little extra time on their hands. With February now at a close, just around the corner are March 2025's PS Plus offerings, with
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sonic Colors: Ultimate
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection
  </em>
  becoming available to PS Plus subscribers of any tier.
 </p>
 <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. -->
 <p>
  While the free PS Plus titles for March 2025 have been announced, subscribers will still need to wait until March 4 before the games are available for download. From then on, March 2025's PS Plus games will remain accessible to subscribers until March 31, 2025, so they should have plenty of time to add each game to their library.

  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is a bit of an outlier on March 2025's PS Plus lineup, as it was only just released last November. It's not typical for PS Plus to add games to the service that haven't been out very long, but
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is a different story. Despite launching to generally positive reviews,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  only had around half of its projected players by the end of 2024, leading EA to include it in the PS Plus lineup for March 2025, in hopes that it might boost engagement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the troubles it has had, however,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  is worth a play, especially now that it's on PS Plus. Its combat, for one thing, is engaging and rewarding, inspiring players to be strategic about their build and approach.
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's companions are also a major highlight of the game, not only allowing players to form meaningful relationships with those companions but also adding layers to the game's combat with each companion's unique skillset. Finally,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  's visuals and technical performance are solid, giving players a smooth and captivating experience all around.

  Unlike
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sonic Colors: Ultimate
  </em>
  already has several years under its belt, and even far more from a certain perspective.
  <em>
   Sonic Colors: Ultimate
  </em>
  is a remastered version of
  <em>
   Sonic Colors
  </em>
  , a 2010 platformer originally released for the Nintendo Wii and DS, and while the upgrades it brought to the original game were some of its most praised features at launch, it was initially marred by technical issues. However, those issues have since been ironed out through patches, making
  <em>
   Sonic Colors: Ultimate
  </em>
  's arrival on PS Plus in March 2025 a great time for players to check it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Sonic Colors: Ultimate
  </em>
  is a fast-paced 3D platformer that blends speed-based gameplay with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. It features linear, high-speed segments and side-scrolling sections, making it a mix of 2D and 3D gameplay. The game’s defining feature is the Wisps, alien creatures that grant unique abilities. These abilities help Sonic navigate the levels, reach hidden areas, and defeat enemies in creative ways. In
  <em>
   Ultimate
  </em>
  , players can collect Park Tokens to unlock customization options for Sonic — like different auras, gloves, and shoes — and it also includes Rival Rush Mode, a new feature where Sonic races against Metal Sonic in specific levels for rewards.

      <title>Assassin's Creed Shadows Has Bad News for Steam Deck Owners</title>

    <ul>
     <li>
      Assassin’s Creed Shadows won't be compatible with Steam Deck at launch due to low specs.
     </li>
     <li>
      Ubisoft has faced delays and leaks with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, aiming for a smooth launch.

      Fans must wait for possible future Steam Deck compatibility for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.

 <p>
  Ubisoft has confirmed that
  <em>
   <strong>
    Assassin's Creed Shadows
   </strong>
  </em>
  will not be compatible with the Steam Deck at launch, which will come as bad news for those hoping to play the game on Valve's handheld platform.
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  is set to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, but will still be unavailable to a small section of gamers after this news.
 </p>
 <p>
  The road to
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  release has been fraught with controversy. Ubisoft has delayed
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  multiple times in an attempt to ensure the game is in the best state possible on release, hoping to avoid similar issues that
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  faced. On top of this,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  has leaked early, forcing gamers to avoid inevitable spoilers online for a few weeks, which is a challenging task. Because this leaked version of the game doesn't have a day-one patch, it won't represent the final product, which is a very unfortunate stroke of luck for Ubisoft.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a recent tech Q&amp;A with fans, Ubisoft confirmed that
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  "will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC." It does start the comment by claiming that this is the case "At launch," offering some hope that
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  will join the lineup of Steam Deck-verified games later down the line. Steam Deck gamers wanting to play the game on March 20 will have to look elsewhere, though.

 <p>
  Hopefully, if Ubisoft isn't confident that
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  will run on the Steam Deck, this means the game will take a significant technical step forward. Footage of the game looks stunning, with one particular trailer detailing
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  ' PC features and technologies that haven't yet been seen before in the series. It's an exciting thought for those who can meet the system requirements for the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  The finish line to launch is almost in sight for
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  . In mid-February, rumors were swirling that
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  won't be delayed again, despite some small noise to the contrary. Given the recent leaks, it seems increasingly unlikely. Ubisoft has already confirmed that a new expansion called
  <em>
   Claws of Awaji
  </em>
  is in the works for the game, so the fun won't stop once
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed Shadows
  </em>
  is released.

 <p>
  MercurySteam, the developer behind 2021’s
  <em>
   Metroid Dread
  </em>
  has announced its next project, a fantasy epic called
  <strong>
   <em>
    Blades of Fire
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The studio also has some other well-known games on its resume, including
  <em>
   Castlevania: Lords of Shadow
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Metroid: Samus Returns
  </em>
  for Nintendo 3DS, and a co-developing credit for
  <em>
   Clive Barker’s Jericho.
  </em>
  The upcoming action-adventure game by MercurySteam will be published by 505 Games.
 </p>
 <p>
  Developed alongside Nintendo EDP,
  <em>
   Metroid Dread
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  is the game MercurySteam will be most recently known for. The title won numerous awards when it was released, including Nintendo Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, Game of the Year from NME, and two accolades for Best Action/Adventure Game from The Game Awards and
  <em>
   Famitsu
  </em>
  ’s Dengeki Game Awards. The huge success of
  <em>
   Metroid Dread
  </em>
  , its engaging boss fights and combat, rich environments, and compelling gameplay led to high review scores and anticipation for MercurySteam’s next endeavor.
 </p>
 <p>
  That game will be arriving on May 22, 2025, according to an announcement by MercurySteam and 505 Games.
  <em>
   Blades of Fire
  </em>
  is a single-player experience and will be released on Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, and preorders are currently open. Those who purchase the game early will be rewarded with Iron Paladin and Lord of Steel Attires for the game’s protagonist, forging materials, and a weapon decoration.

  <em>
   Blades of Fire
  </em>
  introduces players to Aran de Lira, “the last hero who can wield steel,” on a mission to kill the queen, who has cast a spell that turns all steel into stone and thus renders her army invincible. Accompanying him is Adso de Zelk, a scholar who abandons his studies at the Abbey of Egion to help Aran on his quest. Adso uses his knowledge to solve puzzles, decipher ancient spells, and build a compendium of enemies encountered along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout their journey, Aran will use his skills, along with uncovered Forge Scrolls, to craft different weapons to suit various playstyles.
  <em>
   Blades of Fire
  </em>
  will offer seven weapon families and more than 30 Forge Scrolls to find, allowing for great customizability and experimentation. The protagonist will then take his newly forged weapons to the game’s over 50 enemy types, where players will be able to select the body part they want to attack. And using the appropriate weapon type will be crucial to coming out on top.
 </p>
 <p>
  This may not be the only game that MercurySteam has on its drafting table, either. In 2023, an earnings report by minority stakeholder Nordisk Games revealed that the studio is in fact working on two games. The fantasy project being published by 505, at the time known only as Project Iron, is surely
  <em>
   Blades of Fire.
  </em>
  The second game is still an unknown, but rumors began swirling in February that MercurySteam may be working on another
  <em>
   Metroid
  </em>
  game. After players have jumped into the world of Aran and Adso, the developer will hopefully begin to share more about the its second project.

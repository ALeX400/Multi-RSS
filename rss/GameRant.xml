      The House Va'ruun faction in Starfield offers unique, sleek, and often nonstandard weapons.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  has come quite a ways since its release back in September of last year. Bethesda Game Studio's long-awaited new alternate history futuristic sci-fi IP was set to bring fans to a NASA-punk-fueled vision of humanity's exploration of the galaxy's expanse and its Settled Systems world. While there were undoubtedly some rough edges around
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's initial launch, consistent updates and hotfixes have streamlined many of these, and the current state of
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  is generally agreed to be in a much better place in various areas, smoothing out the experience and bringing back noticeable numbers of players recently.

  One of its major elements that was in keeping with Bethesda's past designs, particularly in
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  , is the variety of weapons fans can loot and acquire through various quests and curious exploration. The extensive array of weapons in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  , featuring ones like familiar Old Earth pistols to laser sniper rifles, offers an option for nearly any preference. And within these, a few of the more unique and sometimes harder to find come from the shadowy House Va'ruun faction. With the Shattered Space expansion on track to drop this Fall, and highly rumored to feature the House significantly, it would be fitting if it expands much more on House-specific armaments alongside its story components.

  House Va'ruun Armaments in Starfield

 <p>
  Though
  <em>
  </em>
  it
  <em>
  </em>
  doles out weapons and other gear at a fairly clipped pace, the randomized nature of the loot generation as additionally related to character level and location in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  means some players will luck into finding valuable and powerful higher-level equipment early on, while it may take others dozens of hours to get their hands on some. Va'ruun weapons, while not strictly technically rarer than any others, have generally been noted to not be as prevalent in the overall hierarchy. One standout example that fans have discovered is the Va'ruun Inflictor, a unique particle beam rifle that can come in upgraded legendary named variants such as Eternity's Gate. Va'ruun weapon types also have a sleeker, more exotic, almost ritualistic look in terms of visual aesthetics, and their functionality is often nonstandard compared to many other selections within
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's impressive range of guns.

  How Starfield's Shattered Space Could Expand and Update House Va'ruun Weapon Types
 </h3>
 <p>
  As there are currently multiple outstanding intrigues surrounding
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's House Va'ruun, with mainly only scintillating hints and scraps of lore thus far, some of which require meticulous digging and may be easily missed, the potential for Shattered Space to expand on Va'ruun's various aspects, including its weaponry, is high. Along with the direction and themes of the narrative and world building, perhaps with questlines that allow for combating or allying with agents of the House, the number of available related weapons should naturally increase as well.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":584} -->
 <p>
  If information and details uncovered about it so far hold water, and Shattered Space is indeed more massive than previously assumed, this could provide the path for seeing a whole slew of new House Va'ruun stylized weapons in it. Even if some of the House's firearms might not align with players' preferred play styles, their value in
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's in-universe economy is also generally greater than others, and this could impact how fans view and use them as resources down the line. In any case, including more Va'ruun items in Shattered Space would be the perfect opportunity to give players even more cool options, as well as hopefully revealing more interesting details and history about the House itself.

 <p>
  The character creator of the upcoming
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Age: The Veilguard
   </em>
  </strong>
  will finally fix BioWare’s long-standing issues with bad hair. BioWare recently shared a preview of its upcoming RPG with Game Rant, and it seems that
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  will have several character customization options.

 <p>
  First announced as
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Dreadwolf
  </em>
  in 2018,
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  received its first trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase earlier this week. While opinions about the trailer are somewhat mixed, fans are eager to know more about the game, and BioWare is slowly unveiling more details about its eagerly awaited game.

 <p>
  Now, BioWare has shared more details about character creation in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  in its preview. Players will be able to pick between four races (Human, Elf, Qunari, and Dwarf) and three classes (Warrior, Rogue, and Mage), but most importantly, their hair finally looks really good. BioWare previously had notorious issues with bad hair, as gamers complained that the hair of their
  <em>
   Dragon Age: Inquisition
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  characters looked bad or fake. So, it’s good to see that this long-standing issue won’t bother players anymore, as BioWare likely used EA’s latest technology to create hair that finally feels real.

  Apart from improved hair, visuals, and these classic races and class options, gamers may pick between six different backgrounds: Grey Warden, Veil Jumper, Ativan Crow, Shadow Dragon, Mourn Watch, or Lords of Fortune. Not only will these new origins affect the game, but they are also linked to companions. The elf Bella, for instance, is a member of the Veil Jumpers, while Emmrich is part of the Mourn Watch, and the player’s choice of background could affect their relationship with these characters.

  Another significant detail that players can expect in
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard

  is the return of the Inquisitor from the previous game. Ahead of the gameplay reveal, BioWare revealed that players can customize their Inquisitor, hinting that the character will appear in the game in some way, and probably with better hair.

 <p>
  While many gamers are very enthusiastic about these features, not everyone is excited about
  <em>
   Dragon Age: The Veilguard
  </em>
  . Many fans were disappointed in the new
  <em>

  </em>

  After rumors and rumblings of its existence previously, id Software officially unveiled their latest project,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Doom: The Dark Ages
   </strong>
  </em>
  , at the 2024 Xbox Showcase; part of the extended
  <em>
   Summer Game Fest
  </em>
  that recently concluded. The next
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  game's presence at the event was eagerly anticipated, and it seems not to have disappointed.
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  is, of course, one of the all-time most legendarily important games and franchises ever devised for how it impacted the burgeoning medium, and its indelible influence on it since inception is hard to miss.

 <p>
  As beloved and renowned as the original two titles were, 2004's
  <em>
   Doom 3
  </em>
  was met with a more mixed reception. The series then went officially quiet until a reboot came in the form of
  <em>
   Doom (2016
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   )
  </em>
  While it was initially uncertain whether it could make the transition to a modern context, the entry saw players ripping and tearing across a campaign that captured the bloody essence of
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  's old school spirit combined with current-gen top-of-the-line production and informed design.

  <em>

  <em>

 <p>
  Given its colossal status,
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  managing to reinvent itself to remain relevant and engaging in the hugely changed landscape and scope of first-person shooter design and technological advancements since its original was a notable accomplishment. In addition, 2016's
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  , and to a much greater extent,
  <em>
   Doom: Eternal
  </em>
  , expanded extensively on the series' lore, filling out background information and some of the history of the Slayer's life and travels prior to his current incarnation. Without the gameplay to back it up, though, this wouldn't mean much. Both previous titles understood what it meant to be a true
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  experience, and found the right balance to achieve it.
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  looks to be following suit, not attempting to fix or change what isn't broken, but putting a cool twist on the general framework.

 <p>
  Per the above lore, The Night Sentinels, aka the Argenta, are a mighty warrior tribe from the planet of Argent D'Nur. The upcoming entry's title implies it will be set in the "lost" era from The Slayer's time there, and it seems
  <em>
   The Dark Ages
  </em>
  may be exploring this period when the Slayer joined the Sentinels' ranks. It will possibly have players controlling the Slayer alongside the Argenta when he helped them defend Argent D'Nur from the forces of hell, perhaps explaining his familiarity and expertise in eradicating demons by the score. The Argenta were shown to be no strangers to the art of warring against demonic spawn either, and the premise is ripe with potential.

  <em>

  contains a confluence of sci-fi and fantasy aspects in its presentation and other elements glimpsed in the footage. Decked out in a version of his iconic armor with medieval trappings like spikes, the Doom Slayer is seen wielding a shield that almost seems to function similarly to Kratos' Leviathan Axe in the two most recent
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  games. In an excellent
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  -like touch, this shield is edged with sawed teeth, perfect for slicing up hellspawn. There is also what appears to be a mace, possibly a special weapon similar to the Crucible sword or Hellbreaker hammer, returning glory kills, and more.

  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  introduced anointments to the franchise (not to be confused with anointed enemy types featured in-game), which were Cult of the Vault-inspired augments for gear that heightened an individual Vault Hunter’s stats in a given area. All four playable characters have unique anointment characteristics for their unique skills. While these make up the majority of the anointments in the game, there are other, less interesting offerings that buff generic stats that can be used across all four characters. It’s unclear if anointments will be returning in a possible
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  , but it would be wise to make these gear augments more fun to use, more rewarding to earn, and encourage more diverse builds loadouts.

  How Can Borderlands 4 Improve Anointments?

 <p>
  Unfortunately, these guns become available way too late into the game. These powerful new additions to the player’s arsenal only start dropping into the loot pool after completion of
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  's main story, when most players have already decided on their play style/build for the character.

 <p>
  When
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  introduced the new slag mechanic, the game made sure to introduce players to it as soon as they arrived at the hub in Sanctuary, along with the various other elemental effects.
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  reintroducing anointments around the halfway point in the campaign would let players grow with the mechanic as they level up and build out their Vault Hunter. The additional stat boosts provided by the anointments can make loadouts that previously weren't viable into forces to be reckoned with. Injecting anointments into early-mid-game characters will also increase build diversity before they have access to late-game-leveled gear.

 <p>
  In the game, anointments turn a piece of gear into a powerhouse, often allowing for three digit buffs to player stats. Despite this, it’s still very easy to overlook them in favor of the
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  legendaries that players spend hours farming for. The solution is just to make the already powerful gear even more powerful.

 <p>
  Gearbox should make those triple digit buffs quadruple digit buffs, or even create anointments that radically change a Vault Hunter’s ability in the same way a capstone skill would. There would have to be a happy medium between providing players with strong gear early on and making sure there’s enough challenge to keep gameplay interesting for the rest of the playthrough.

 <p>
  Gearbox can easily fix this problem by simply adjusting drop rates for the anointed weapons to be in-line with legendary gear.
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  legendary drop rates are already pretty low without Mayhem Mode activated, so an anointed weapon drop would be a rare and exciting find for a player on their first playthrough and might entice them to keep playing for more of those exciting discoveries that the franchise is built on.

 <p>
  It could be that anointments won’t even return in
  <em>
   Borderlands 4
  </em>
  . After all, slag elemental damage and laser weapons were one-off gimmicks for
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel
  </em>
  respectively. That's a real shame, because they had a lot of potential to be truly great franchise mainstays if Gearbox had stayed the course by adjusting them in each
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game. Anointments have that same potential, if only the studio sticks with them and makes them the great addition they were meant to be.

  's 1.0 launch came with a new area as well as the
  <em>
   Castlevania
  </em>
  crossover content. There are six regions filled with different resources, creatures, and enemies. The title introduces an interesting way to gain new abilities, namely taking out

  's 50+ V Blood bosses. The

  Players can enjoy the game offline, online, or in multiplayer.

  also features different difficulties, giving those that want a harder or easier experience the option for it. There's an established PvP community, though not all multiplayer servers support it. Since the game doesn't have crossplay, PvP experiences may become startlingly different depending on the platform. How the PS5 player base influences builds and tactics remains to be seen.

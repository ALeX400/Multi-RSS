      <title>Call of Duty: Warzone's Season 6 Update is Making It Harder to See, and Players Aren't Happy</title>

      Gun smoke has seemingly worsened in Call of Duty: Warzone following the Season 6 update.
     </li>
     <li>
      While it appears worse than it is within the firing range, the increased smoke is problematic in areas like the Gulag.
     </li>
     <li>
      As such, fans are frustrated (especially those on PC who lack aim assist), hoping for a patch that makes gun smoke less frustrating to deal with.

  fans are disappointed with the changes made in the recent Season 6 update, with thicker gun smoke making it extremely difficult for players to be able to see their surroundings. In fact, the issue seems to be more pronounced for
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  players on PC as the aim assistance on consoles makes it somewhat easier for console players to aim despite having limited visibility.

  fans are eagerly waiting for the release of
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , which is all set to make a series of interesting changes to the game's mechanics. Before that, the developers released loads of new content in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Warzone
  </em>
  as part of the Season 6 update. While some of the changes have become quite popular, fans are not happy with the changes to the game's smoke.

  In a new post on the CODWarzone subreddit, user dinzyy highlights a frustrating issue with the latest
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  Season 6 update. The picture showcases how intrusive the smoke is in the current version of the game, making it close to impossible for the players to be able to see what is on the screen. The user shows the smoke from two guns to highlight the issue, with it clearly getting thicker in the second of the two images, which is presumably from the current Season.

  While this is an annoying issue for anyone to deal with, many highlighted that it affects players using keyboard and mouse way more. This is because aim assist can play a crucial role in circumventing situations like these, something PC players do not have access to.
  <em>
   Call of Duty's

  aim assist feature has been quite a controversial aspect of the game, and it seems like the recent update has reignited the debacle.

 <p>
  On the flip side, some players noted that this problem is a bit situational, as the gun smoke isn't as bad as what it looks like in the post since it depicts a screenshot from the firing range. Apparently, the smoke is much more pronounced in the
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Warzone
  </em>
  firing range due to limited lighting. However, fans noted that the changes to the smoke have definitely caused issues in some locations, such as the Gulag. So far, the developers have not responded to the issue, but hopefully a fix is released soon.

    Updated September 21, 2024, by Jake Fillery:
   </strong>
   God of War Ragnarok welcomes new challengers to its arena with PC joining PS4 and PS5 as platforms that the game can be purchased. As such, it's a good time to look at some of the hardest boss fights in God of War Ragnarok and its DLC, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla. Considering Ragnarok indulges the end of the Norse mythology for Kratos, it's no surprise that some of the best boss fights in God of War Ragnarok are also some of the hardest and most challenging, regardless of difficulty and skill.

 <p>
  Gryla is the first boss that Atreus must fight without his father's help, and as such, it can be a pretty challenging battle. Without the brawn and brutality of Kratos, Atreus has to rely on his wits and his bow in order to get the job done. Gryla isn't the hardest boss in the game, but without the training wheels, she can be pretty punishing considering Atreus only has a bow and not a Leviathan Axe to stab and slash with.

 <p>
  Grya is best fought with ranged attacks and by utilizing the runic mechanics, so it's not the longest or the hardest boss fight, but there is some level of challenge within its gimmicks. The true difficulty lies in not playing as Kratos and instead resorting to ranged combat.

 <p>
  For a Valkyrie, Vanadis is a fairly easy challenge. Whilst all Valkyrie boss fights in
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  provide players with the hardest challenge, putting every single skill they have to use, fighting Vanadis is essential to the story, and one that doesn’t require too much difficulty. However, that doesn’t mean players should underestimate Vanadis’ abilities. After all, this is a disguise for the vengeful and mourning Freya.

 <p>
  Vanadis has quick attacks, making her agile and vicious. In order to best Vanadis, players should keep as close as possible, fulfilling their violent attacks with their weapons, rather than Atreus’ bow. Vanadis can be brutal at long-range, so it’s best to keep the pressure on.

  Dragons are rather scarce in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  , but when they do appear, they are not exactly the easiest of foes to battle. The Corpse Eater is one such dragon that hunts in Vanahiem. Not only is this dragon difficult for its size and aggression, but even getting to the boss can be fairly difficult for those who struggle with puzzles.

  The Corpse Eater in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  requires players to mess with the time of day, and water levels, and to backtrack to kill a guarding troll. Then, the boss fights itself and sees the Corpse Eater deal with multiple and almost random attacks, with a strong health bar.

  Garm’s nature is to destroy, and when met with the fury of Kratos, the two are in for a fierce battle indeed. However, what could be more destructive, and unkillable, as one without a soul? Garm is a difficult boss fight for the player, with fun and recognizable pattern attacks that will need to be evaded or countered. This giant monstrous wolf that wreaks havoc in the nine realms is plenty dangerous in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  What makes the Garm boss fight great is that Garm will continuously come back to life and regenerate health, because there is no soul in Garm to destroy. Therefore, players will need to utilize their arsenal, and Atreus’ compassion to put this boss down once and for all.

  The hateful is an optional boss fight, one that reoccurs time and time again. Every time players fight The Hateful, they will become far more dangerous than their previous fight. The Hateful will provide Kratos with a challenge, due to their powerful health increases and violent swipes and attacks. The Hateful should be feared, with their fire quelled by the Leviathan Axe.

  The Hateful can be found in many Draugr Holes across

  As Ragnarok approaches, Odin will do anything to stop it. Kratos and Atreus are faced with one of their hardest challenges, as Odin sends forth two new Valkyries to stop them in the Spark of the World. Valkyries are a great challenge in
  <strong>
   <em>
    God of War
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
  </em>
  (2018), and fighting two at once is a greater challenge than before. However, with Atreus on Kratos’ side, this fight will show the union of father and son.

 <p>
  Hrist and Mist can power themselves up and regain lost health together. The sisters may be a challenge to some, but considering Kratos will have his Spartan Rage and his son as a bear, it’s safe to say that this boss fight will regret messing with Kratos and Atreus.

 <p>
  Located in The Plains within Vanaheim, The Untamed Fury is a vicious boss fight, one that will see players attempt to hunt the hunter. This Centaur enemy has multiple phases, we can be rather bothersome for some. This boss doesn’t have the usual phases that most boss fights have, but instead, the Untamed Fury will run away, and players will have to search new areas in Vanaheim to continue the fight.

 <p>
  The Untamed Fury utilizes surprise attacks, kicks, and violent thrusts to try and kill Kratos. If Kratos is to fall to the Untamed Fury, then they are in trouble, as they will have to try and find the boss once again in the sprawling location of The Crater in Vanaheim.

 <p>
  The Raven Keeper is not an easy boss to battle. Not only due to the intense fight itself but the journey to reaching the Raven Keeper is equally as hard. Players will need to claim all rewards from the Raven Tree in Niflheim and destroy 48 of Odin’s Ravens to unlock the Raven Keeper boss fight.

 <p>
  The arena for this fight isn’t the largest, and the boss will need to be shot with arrows to make the boss available for Kratos’ attacks with his many weapons. However, when the boss gets weaker, the Raven Keeper will summon a dragon, meaning this is a duo boss fight in one.

  Many games suffer from a slow start, but
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  is not one of them. The beginning of
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  is intense, and within an hour, players are battling Thor across the skies of Midgard and crashing into statues like they are nothing. The first fight against Thor sees the god of thunder and the ghost of Sparta face off in true fierce fashion.

 <p>
  What makes this fight difficult is the fact that players might not be familiar with the combat yet, and will see themselves thrown around and hit by Thor. Their shield also breaks during the fight, and Thor relentlessly belittles Kratos as inferior, all whilst regaining health in each fight.

  This giant mythical Lindwyrm lives in the branches of the world tree Yggdrasil and is tasked with protecting its roots. However, when Freya meddles with the roots to try and free herself from Odin’s imprisonment in Midgard, Nidhogg comes forth to protect said roots and battles Kratos and Freya out of duty and nature.

 <p>
  Nidhogg is huge, and the boss takes up the majority of the arena. Nidhogg’s attacks are fast and random, and Kratos can easily fall to the great foe due to the lack of knowledge regarding blocking, evading, and parrying. It’s an intense and demanding fight and one that sees Freya freed.

  It’s difficult to fight a man who can see everything that is going to happen. Heimdall can predict every move that Kratos makes, which makes for a challenging fight ahead. Not only with players need to defeat Heimdall’s stead, but the fight against Heimdall himself sees the Aesir god block and dodge every attack effortlessly.

 <p>
  There is only one way to best Heimdall, and that is in blind range and the use of the Draupnir Spear, which Heimdall fails to predict the pattern for. Battling Heimdall is one of aggression and timing, and is a sensational boss fight in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok

  As the leader of the twelve Berserkers, it’s no surprise that King Hrolf Kraki in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  would be a challenging battle. The aggression and ferocity of this boss are reminiscent of the Valkyrie fights in
  <em>
   God of War
  </em>
  (2018), but with an extra punch. Players will need to utilize the best equipment in
  <em>
   God of War: Ragnarok
  </em>
  , as well as the skills they, have learned to battle King Hrolf Kraki.

 <p>
  It’s a true challenge to fight the Cursed King of the Berserkers, as this will be the strongest of the other foes that players have encountered. His location is in Midgard and locked until all 12 previous Berserkers have been destroyed.

  Replacing the Valkyrie enemies, the Berserkers in
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  are a challenge to marvel at. Whilst they may not fight independently, and have the spirits of the most cunning warriors of Odin’s leading generals in Valhalla, the Berserkers are a threat that players should not underestimate, especially when it comes to the set of three enemies that will fight Kratos and Atreus at once: Svipdagr the Cold and the Sisters of Illska.

 <p>
  To unlock the Berserker Gravestone near The Barrens of Alfheim, players need to bring everything they can to not only try and survive this boss fight but to beat it and come out victorious. Players have to fight two sisters of Illska, as well as Svipdagr, making for three strong enemies at once. The Sisters rely on long-range and furious attacks, whilst Svipdagr will chase the player down with two axes. Killing one before the other sends down a violent rage to make this one of the hardest bosses in
  <em>
   God of War Ragnarok
  </em>
  .

  is none other than the All-Father himself. Odin has been preparing for decades for Ragnarok, and he isn’t about to let a boy, an ex-wife, and the Ghost of Sparta ruin his life for prophecy.

  By far one of the most challenging fights that awaits Kratos is in its free DLC epilogue, Valhalla, in which Kratos must fight Tyr, the Aesir god of war who challenges Kratos with a plethora of weapons from different cultures and pantheons, while Kratos also tries to face his own inner turmoil.

 <p>
  Tyr might be an advocate for pacifism, but he's the perfect sparring partner as he does not hold back on Kratos, and he proves that with a fist and sword, he is a capable adversary and there's a reason why he's the god of war. Throughout each fight with Tyr, he will challenge in new ways and feature unpredictable and brutal attacks that may send Kratos back to the start.

      <title>5 JRPGs With Morality Systems</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/jrpgs-with-morality-systems/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  One of the many things that role-playing games do well is allowing a player to shape the protagonist's moral leaning and outlook. In some of the best recently released RPGs, it's clear to see this philosophy take hold.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":218} -->

 <p>
  JRPGs are actually usually an outlier for this particular role-playing trope. Certainly, there are a variety of JRPGs that have branching outcomes, but a tangible and effective measurement of a character's morality, ala the Paragon/Renegade system from Mass Effect, or a game that actively responds to moral alignments, is quite rare. Rare does not mean nonexistent, though, and there are a few JRPGs with ways to gauge morality.

 <p>
  The ever shifting timeline in
  <em>
   Radiant Historia
  </em>
  :
  <em>
   Perfect Chronology
  </em>
  is representative of the player's moral choices in a series of increasingly difficult dilemmas. Stocke's use of the White Chronicle, an artifact that allows for the use of time travel, splits the story into two major timelines, each indicative of a particular moral outlook from Stocke.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1022} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  These two timelines have smaller branches, and as the story continues, a chronology of Stocke's decisions, functionally shaping who he is, starts to form. This is a level of moral dissection not usually seen in JRPGs, and makes this title among one of the various 3DS JRPGs that deserve revitalization on the Switch.

  Building on an epic accumulation of countless moral choices,
  <em>
   Langrisser 1 &amp; 2
  </em>
  continues the legacy of its original title before finishing up in one of 22 endings and a whopping 560 character outcomes. These character outcomes form a sort of collage that defines the protagonist's morality from afar. The two games have a narrative that syncs up well together, but in particular,
  <em>
   Langrisser 2
  </em>
  has a twistier and more subversive fantasy story.

  For a game where the morality mechanics are balanced on a sovereign ruler who must make difficult choices, there are a few options available to players, but the
  <em>
   Langrisser
  </em>
  duology stands among them as one of the greats.

  <em>
   Tactics Ogre
  </em>
  is, according to many longtime fans, Square Enix's magnum opus when it comes to the SRPG genre. It's clear to see why, with the tile-based battles and gameplay playing like an incredible game of fantasy chess, over a sprawling, incredibly long campaign to secure a kingdom come under attack. Starting as early as the end of chapter 1, the player is tasked with making some very serious moral choices that skew them more towards either a lawful or chaotic bent.

 <p>
  Utilizing a variety of classes,
  <em>
   Tactics Ogre
  </em>
  will keep players occupied on the battlefield for an incredibly long time - but it's off the battlefield during some incredibly hard-hitting narrative moments that players make choices that will shape the outcome of the war and the fate of the whole continent.
  <em>
   Tactics Ogre: Reborn
  </em>
  does take some getting used to, with a rather complex story and some lack of polish with the spritework, but the end result is a uniquely in-depth strategy experience.

  The alignment system in most Megami Tensei games has players riding along an axis with chaos at one end, and law on the other. These alignments are moral, but they're also philosophical and theological, with the specific philosophies and tones underlying each alignment changing within each game.
  <em>
   Strange Journey
  </em>
  is just one game in a series that has a plethora of morality-based decision-making.

  Like many Atlus remakes,
  <em>
   Strange Journey Redux
  </em>
  manages to bring a plethora of quality of life changes with it that make it the definitive version of this title, not least of all a host of additional content that flesh out the three major alignments of chaos, law and neutrality, providing each with a more satisfying ending. This makes
  <em>
   Strange Journey
  </em>
  an especially good title for not falling into the trap SMT 4 did of making the neutral ending the only satisfying one.

  implements several features to make its conviction system more nuanced than a wide breadth of other morality systems.

  <em>

  which does have a bit more intricacy to it.

      <title>5 Most Influential Video Games That Bombed On Release</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  Making a video game is hard, especially for those who want to both produce good art and make enough money to keep a roof over their heads. Popular wisdom attests that a good game, by the nature of its quality, will get good reviews and sell well. That game then goes on to influence other developers until there is a beautiful ecosystem of worthy titles, all competing for a gamer's attention.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":0,"ruleCount":200,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":393} -->

 <p>
  However, this isn't always the case, as sometimes games that have been massively influential and have garnered wide critical acclaim have been known to put studios in the ground. Whether it's a case of bad timing, bad marketing, or just good old bad luck, not every finely-cut gem has a chance to glitter in the sun.

  The original
  <em>
   System Shock
  </em>
  , now a cult classic with a well-received remake, was mistaken by audiences as a
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  clone back when it was first released, despite having plenty of ideas and features to distinguish it from the shooter.
  <strong>
   <em>
    System Shock 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  integrated RPG elements into its gameplay (something new at the time), something that many later games (for example, Arkane Studio's
  <em>
   Arx Fatalis
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  and Frictional's
  <em>
   Amnesia
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   SOMA
  </em>
  ) would try to emulate.

 <p>
  <em>
   System Shock 2

  's influence on first-person shooters and immersive sims is hard to state. Its design philosophy can be seen in Ken Levine's later work at Irrational Games,
  <em>
   Bioshock
  </em>
  in particular, but a more recent example of a game trying to recapture its creative spirit and atmosphere is Arkane's
  <em>
   Prey
  </em>
  .

  While it is still a divisive title today,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shenmue
   </em>
  </strong>
  is often hailed as groundbreaking, having pushed the boundaries of what games could achieve storytelling and world-building-wise. However, despite its ambition and innovation, the series never became a big hit. The game's detailed environments, including life and social sim elements, real-time weather systems, fully realized NPCs with complete backstories and schedules, and interactive mechanics, were revolutionary. This revolution did not come cheap, as
  <em>
   Shenmue
  </em>
  was the most expensive game ever made at the time.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the audience for a slow-paced, slice-of-life experience (a massive divergence from its action-oriented contemporaries) wasn't quite there, and
  <em>
   Shenmue
  </em>
  was ultimately viewed as a commercial failure. Besides being a game that featured a 3D open-world city that debuted before the likes of
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 3
  </em>
  , its influence on the highly popular
  <em>
   Yakuza
  </em>
  series is fairly self-evident (although
  <em>
   Shenmue
  </em>
  is admittedly a lot less explosive and violent).
  <em>
   Shenmue 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  saw better sales but nothing to catapult the series to mainstream success.

  Most gamers will probably associate Ness with
  <em>
   Super Smash Bros.
  </em>
  , as he is among the original roster of fighters in the franchise. However, as even Nintendo games can fail to sell, some gamers may still be surprised to know that he stars in his own trilogy of games that weren't popular enough to get a Western port.
  <strong>
   <em>
    EarthBound
   </em>
  </strong>
  (or
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mother 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  in Japan) sold very well in its country of origin, but due to Nintendo's bizarre (and incredibly expensive) marketing mishandling, it utterly bombed in North America, which prevented a European release.

  <em>
   EarthBound

  had a "This game stinks" tagline to accompany a scratch-and-sniff feature on the box, which likely prompted would-be fans to dismiss the EarthBound as unserious or a joke game. Despite the lack of an official translation of the original or sequel,
  <em>
   EarthBound

  has influenced many game developers across the world, most notably indie gems like

  , the player has no bullet count for their gun and instead has to listen out for their avatar's vocal assessment or count. There is no health bar; instead, there is a damage-indicating heart-shaped tattoo "diegetically" located on the player character's chest.

  While this unique take on UI is interesting, its most significant contribution was a universal and realistic physics engine, one of the first of its kind, which inspired many games with worlds grounded in realistic physics. Without
  <em>
   Trespasser
  </em>
  , there would be
  <em>
   no Half-Life
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Far Cry
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Trespasser's
  </em>
  design pillars seemed to stipulate that control and immersion would never be taken away from the player. As such, the story is delivered via audio narration rather than cutscenes or text
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  making
  <em>
   Trespasser
  </em>
  somewhat responsible for the "audio log" fad of the 2000s and 2010s.

   <em>
    Planescape: Torment
   </em>
  </strong>
  may be widely celebrated as a classic now, but when it was first released, for whatever reason, it did not resonate with audiences. Despite its initial launch into obscurity,
  <em>
   Planescape
  </em>
  went on to become a beloved game in RPG history, influencing inXile in their spiritual sequel,
  <em>
   Torment: Tides of Numinara
  </em>
  , and the Estonian art collective ZA/UM with
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  . Like those games,
  <em>
   Planescape
  </em>
  offers many more ways to progress besides combat.

  Through the Nameless One, players can engage in deep, well-crafted dialogue, solve the burning mysteries scattered throughout the fantasy multiverse's lurid landscape, and make choices that affect the story's outcome. Unlike many other
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  adaptations,
  <em>
   Planescape
  </em>
  emphasized nuanced storytelling and morally ambiguous choice over traditional RPG tropes or power fantasy cliches, which could explain the general lack of audience excitement.

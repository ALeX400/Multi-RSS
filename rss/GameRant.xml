  <strong>
   Intel
  </strong>
  's plans for its new desktop CPU have leaked, including a projected October release. Codenamed "Arrow Lake," this CPU has yet to be revealed to the public. However, Intel is expected to unveil Arrow Lake sometime in September with its launch following soon after.

  In May, details were given about another Intel CPU coming this year. Intel's Lunar Lake CPU is its new mobile chip launching in Q3 of this year. This mobile chip, alongside the yet-to-be-announced Arrow Lake, will be Intel's premiere chips on the market. Intel boasts about Lunar Lake's "AI performance." The CPU has a neural processing unit, or an NPU. According to Intel, "An NPU is a specialized accelerator that efficiently handles AI and machine learning (ML) tasks right on your PC instead of sending data to be processed in the cloud. The AI PC is increasingly important as the need to automate, streamline and optimize tasks on the PC grows." This is expected to improve performance for the Lunar Lake and outshine Intel's previous chip.

 <p>
  Intel's Arrow Lake is similarly expected to be its best-performing CPU yet, according to wccftech, and it's expected to be launched in October this year. The chip will likely be unveiled in September. Intel's keynote event, Intel Innovation, is scheduled for September 24 and 25. This is where the CPU will most likely be revealed.

  The Arrow Lake CPU will be supported by z890 motherboards. Developers of the motherboards are currently preparing for the chip's launch later this year. The Arrow Lake is said to improve IPC by 14% and 38% over the previous generations of CPUs. The clock speeds are expected to be around 5.5ghz.

 <p>
  When compared directly to the Intel Raptor Lake CPU, Intel's previous chip, the Arrow Lake looks even more impressive. The Arrow Lake's power consumption is down 20% from the Raptor Lake, meaning the chip won't be as demanding as Intel's 14th-generation chip. With this improvement, Intel is also reportedly rebranding its flagship chip. Despite being codenamed "Arrow Lake," the CPU is said to be launching under "Core Ultra 200." This comes as a departure from Intel's previous chips which launched under the "lake" moniker.

 <p>
  With the reported launch of Arrow Lake later this year as well as the launch of Lunar Lake, it's an exciting time to be a fan of Team Blue. Once the CPU is officially revealed, official benchmarks will be given to more accurately compare it to other chips on the market. Maybe this will be the chip that Intel needs to cement itself ahead of AMD in comparison of the two companies' products. Until then, this is all there is to go on.

      <title>Mortal Kombat 1: How to Get the Reptilian Eye &amp; All Key Items in Season 6 of Invasions Mode</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/mk1-mortal-kombat-1-how-to-get-reptilian-eye-location-key-item-invasions-mode-season-6/</link>

 <p>
  As they explore the six Mesas that make up Season 6 of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </strong>
  </em>
  's Invasions Mode, players will encounter a series of green locked gates. Unlike regular gates, which lead to the Mesa boss, green locked gates grant access to special areas, containing chests, Klues, and a series of uber-challenging fights.
 </p>

 <p>
  Although the game makes it very clear to
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  players that they'll need the Reptilian Eye to unlock these green gates, it doesn't provide any information about where to actually find it. As one might expect, it's not something that can be found early on in Season 6, with players having to jump through quite a few hoops in order to obtain it.

   Players will get the Reptilian Eye as a reward for beating Sinister Syzoth

  , who serves as the final boss of Season 6. This deadly Reptile variant can be found in the Flesh Pits Mesa and is best tackled using Sub-Zero. This is because in the world of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  , Ice is strong against Acid, meaning that Sub-Zero will deal more damage to and take less damage from Sinister Syzoth, which can make beating the final boss of Invasions Mode a whole lot easier than it would be with any other character. After overcoming all three phases of the fight, players will receive the Reptilian Eye upon reaching the encounter Rewards screen.

  In addition to the Reptilian Eye, there are six other key items in Season 6 of Invasions Mode, each of which unlocks the gate that leads to the boss of their respective Mesas. One or two of them are unmissable, as players will need to complete the Node that they're tied to in order to even reach the locked gate. However, most of the key items in Season 6 of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  's Invasions Mode are tied to optional Nodes, meaning that players will need to stray from the beaten path just a little if they're to have any chance of reaching Sinister Syzoth and unlocking the Reptilian Eye.

To reach it, they'll need to pass the PET FOOD Klue and keep following the path around until they reach the center of the back wall.

       The Sacred Fireflies key item is tied to the Fun Sister node, which is near some ruins to the right of the I Blame Kang node. For whatever reason, though, as of the time of writing, completing I Blame Kang does not unlock Fun Sister, so players will need to loop around and approach the Node from the opposite side.

  Each of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Baldur's Gate 3

  's nine classes offers a different gameplay experience, providing the character different combat and exploration capabilities. The
  <strong>
   Ranger
  </strong>
  class specializes in navigating the wild, utilizing a mix of martial combat bonuses and divine magic similar to the magic Druids use. Rangers choose a favored enemy and terrain, gaining bonuses based on their choices and allowing them to further customize their build.

  The Ranger subclasses in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  allow the Ranger to gain additional abilities inspired by the Ranger's core concept as a Scout that hunts dangerous foes and has a deep understanding of the natural world. The Beast Master subclass allows them to acquire an Animal Companion to aid them in battle, the Hunter chooses a specialization to aid them in taking down their chosen foes, and the Gloom Stalker learns to steel their mind against mind-altering effects and strike at their foes from the shadows. Rangers select their subclass at level Three.

   With the full release of Baldur's Gate 3, players are now able to access all three of the Ranger Subclasses and reach the maximum level: 12. As such, this guide has been updated to reflect the new level cap and explain the abilities granted by each of the subclasses.

   Updated on February 21, 2024, by Thomas Hawkins:
  </strong>
  Now that Baldur's Gate 3 has been out for a while and players have plumbed the depths of the game for magic items and multiclassing combinations, this guide was in dire need of an update to reflect each subclass' multiclassing utility and discuss some of the items that can make a Ranger build more powerful. The guide now contains a thorough list of abilities gained by each animal companion as the Beast Master subclass increases in level, along with a new section discussing items that all three subclasses can benefit from.

   This update is designed to aid players looking for Act 3 upgrades to their equipment. It adds a new section discussing useful Act 3 items to seek out, titled appropriately to help players avoid spoilers for the final act of Baldur's Gate 3. These sections contain more specific information on the locations of said items too.

  The Hunter Subclass gains some powerful once-per-turn effects through Hunter's Prey, which could benefit other martial classes like the Fighter and Paladin. Multiattack Defence could be really helpful on a tanky character when facing powerful foes later in the game. Monks can also benefit greatly from abilities like Giant Killer and Colossus Slayer, as long as there is a weapon in their main hand.

  The Beast Master subclass gains the ability "Summon Companion," allowing them to call forth a number of different animal companions to aid them in combat. These animal companions are considerably stronger than those summoned by the "Find Familiar" spell. All Companions have the "Prey's Scent" ability, which causes them to deal 1d6 extra damage to a creature marked by the Beast Master's "Hunter's Mark" spell.

  Since the Beast Master Subclass gets its strongest features at level 11, it is typically ill-suited to multiclassing. That said, players could take a level in Fighter to gain an extra fighting style, or a level in Barbarian for access to Rage (though Raging will prevent the Ranger from casting or concentrating on spells.)

  Gloom Stalkers are ambush specialists and gain abilities as they level up to aid in exactly that.
  <strong>
   At level three,
  </strong>
  they get the abilities "Dread Ambusher," "Dread Ambusher: Hide," "Umbral Shroud," and "Superior Darkvision." The first of these allows them a +3 bonus to initiative rolls while also letting them move 3m further and deal an extra 1d8 damage on the first turn of combat.

 <p>
  "Dread Ambusher: Hide" simply allows them to hide as a bonus action. "Umbral Shroud" allows them to become invisible as an action as long as they are obscured. "Superior Darkvision" allows the Gloom Stalker to see up to 24m in darkness without issue. They also automatically learn "Disguise Self" as a first level spell.

  <strong>
   Level seven
  </strong>
  grants them "Iron Mind," giving them proficiency in intelligence and wisdom saving throws.

 <p>
  The Gloom Stalker's affinity for ambush makes them a natural fit for multiclassing with Rogues, allowing them to add Sneak Attack damage to their excellent damage output. Mixing in Fighter for Action Surge and a second Fighting Style can also be beneficial. While there's a certain amount of overlap in their kits, Shadow Monks can also be a good multiclass choice for the Gloom Stalker.

  Where equipment is concerned, Rangers should seek out the
  <strong>
   "Speedy Reply" scimitar in Act 1
  </strong>
  (found on a dead caravan agent near Flind) or the
  <strong>
   "Thorn Blade" Scimitar sold by Dammon in Act 2.
  </strong>
  These two can be very effective during the first two acts, though the Thorn Blade's poison damage is unfortunately resisted by quite a few foes.
  <strong>
   The Justiciar's Scimitar
  </strong>
  (found in the Gauntlet of Shar during Act 2) is also an excellent pick that synergizes well with the Gloom Stalker's stealth tactics.
  <strong>
   During Act 3, players can track down Belm,
  </strong>
  a returning weapon from Baldur's Gate 2, which is an exceptional weapon that can turn your bonus action into an extra attack and is thus excellent for builds that aren't dual-wielding. It has some unique synergy with certain weapons when held in the off-hand, which are discussed in the Act 3 section.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Since Rangers have proficiency with all martial weapons,
  </strong>
  they can achieve a ton of flexibility by using finesse weapons. Along with the usual suspects (Daggers, Shortswords, Scimitars, and Rapiers), there are also three unique finesse weapons in the game from weapon types that aren't usually finesse weapons. These are
  <strong>
   Phalar Aluve
  </strong>
  (longsword, Act 1, in the Underdark),
  <strong>
   Larethian's Wrath
  </strong>
  (longsword, Act 1, sold by the trader in the Githyanki Creche), and
  <strong>
   The Dancing Breeze
  </strong>
  (Glaive, Act 3, sold by Exxvikyap in Rivington.)

 <p>
  For ranged combat,
  <strong>
   players should pick up the Spellthief bow
  </strong>
  from Arron at the Druid Grove, allowing them to restore a first level spell slot the first time they land a critical hit each short rest. This can be helpful during the early-game where spell slots are few.
  <strong>
   The Joltshooter longbow
  </strong>
  can also be found in Act 1, as a reward for rescuing Councilor Florrick at Waukeen's Rest, and allows the Ranger to build up lightning charges and dish out extra damage with their attacks.

  As mentioned briefly in the previous section, Rangers can get hold of the exceptional scimitar "Belm" in Act 3. This can be found in Jaheira's Basement, under Elerrathin's Home in the Lower City. Belm is a legendary scimitar that can perform Whirlwind Attack, making an attack against all enemies within range, as an action once per short rest. The wielder can also perform an extra attack as a bonus action, which calculates its attack and damage modifier using the stats of the weapon in the wielder's main hand. This makes it tremendously powerful when used in conjunction with a main-hand weapon that deals more damage, like Phalar Aluve or Larethian's Wrath. If focusing on strength over dexterity but still using the dual-wielder feat, you could use the Nylruna trident (obtained by winning the jackpot from Akabi at the carnival, getting teleported to the jungle, and then picking the lock on the chest near the portal back to the Carnival) or Voss' Silver Sword (stolen from Kithrak Voss via pickpocketing or murder) in the main hand to great effect. The aforementioned trident is also excellent for adding some range to a Strength-focused Ranger Build.

 <p>
  For defensive options, players should pick up the Cloak of Displacement from Entharl Danthelon in Wyrm's Crossing and the Boots of Persistence from Dammon in the Lower City (assuming he survived until Act 3.) The former gives enemies disadvantage on attack rolls against the wearer until the first time the wearer takes damage on each turn. The latter provides permanent Freedom of Movement (same as the spell), Longstrider (same as the spell), and a +1 bonus to Dexterity saving throws. The "Legacy of the Masters" gloves are also sold by Dammon during Act 3, offering +2 to attack rolls and damage with all weapons. Picking these up can make any martial character more effective, so they're worth grabbing if Dammon is alive.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Mortal Kombat 1
   </strong>
  </em>
  players have expressed their continued disappointment with the Switch version of the fighting game, this time with regard to how Homelander from
  <em>
   The Boys
  </em>
  looks. NetherRealm recently released the Homelander update for
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  , which adds
  <em>
   The Boys
  </em>
  ' iconic Homelander as a playable character, alongside new skins for various characters. Homelander is the fifth DLC character in the game's Kombat Pack 1, alongside other guest stars like Peacemaker from DC Comics and
  <em>
   Invincible
  </em>
  's Omni-Man. This update was made available for all versions of the game, including the Switch version, which has again started drawing heat from fans.

 <p>
  The developers released
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and the PC, with each version and character model looking incredibly realistic. However, the game was also ported to the Nintendo Switch, a console that is much less powerful than the other three platforms and has a reputation for third-party games running poorly.
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  on Switch is no different, as it has garnered a lot of heat from fans, with many writing it off as "unplayable." The latest frustration drawn from the game is how Homelander looks in the Switch version.

 <p>
  Posted on the r/gaming subreddit by user ewelumokeke, they showed off some comparison shots of how Homelander looks in
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat 1
  </em>
  . While the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC versions all manage to realistically capture Anthony Starr's likeness of the character, the Switch version's character model takes a big hit in quality. Blemishes include less polished lighting, hair textures, and facial expressions.

  The Switch version of

  continues to be lambasted by fans, as comments underneath the post mocked the quality of the model. Some comments note that the Switch is capable of making models look much better than this version of Homelander, with some being comparable to the other versions of
  <em>
   MK1

  . As such, this might be an individual case of the QA team not double-checking the quality of this model for the Switch version.

  One of the key characteristics of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  's Final Shape expansion is the nostalgia-inducing reimagining of everything players have experienced during their time in
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  . As players journey into the Pale Heart of the Traveler in pursuit of The Witness, the landscape begins to take shape, eventually becoming an abstract representation of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's most iconic images and locations. This is all due to the Pale Heart's ability to be transformed according to the memories and imagination of those who enter it, so as Guardians step inside, they begin to see the world they've spent a decade with taking on an entirely different appearance but still maintaining its identity.

  The location many players have most been looking forward to visiting in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Final Shape expansion is the Tower from the first game. Those who had the privilege of experiencing
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  in its earliest years know the Tower all too well, as they likely spent a significant amount of time there, much like they now have in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Tower. However, the version of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's Tower that is now present within The Final Shape's Pale Heart is a bit different, not unrecognizably so, but just enough to set it apart from the home base players became familiar with in the first game. As such, it's worth examining how this new Tower compares to the original in its layout, structure, and appearance.

  The Pale Heart's D1 Tower Maintains the Same Structural Layout
 </h3>
 <p>
  As far as the overall structural layout of the Pale Heart's Tower goes, it's almost identical to the original
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  Tower. From a layout standpoint, everything is exactly where it was in the original Tower, to the point that it's possible to take screenshots of the Pale Heart's version and line them up exactly with the original Tower. Of course, there are plenty of things missing from this version of
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's Tower that were in the original.

  There Are Several Things Missing From The Pale Heart's D1 Tower
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the Pale Heart Tower's Tower Watch plaza, veteran players will find that everything is exactly where they left it, but with a massive cosmetic overhaul now. There is still one Vault available via a console embedded into the base of one of the trees growing out from where the old Vaults used to be, but the others are inaccessible. The Postbox is exactly where the Postmaster used to be in the original Tower, but the Eververse store that used to be on the other side of that building is missing. Players can find Cayde-6 standing near where Xander 99-40, the Bounty Tracker, once was, and trees have grown over where Master Rahool's stall and Banshee's shop used to be. Furthermore, the Tower Hangar has been completely closed off due to vegetation growth.

 <p>
  Traveler's Walk, which was the large courtyard on the east side of the original
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's Tower, has been made permanently inaccessible in the Pale Heart's Tower. Players can venture downstairs to where the Hall of Guardians was in
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  , but a tunnel of tree roots leading to the Tower's exterior has replaced it in the Pale Heart's version. Tower North is still open in the Pale Heart's Tower, and this is actually where players will meet Cayde-6 during The Final Shape's campaign. Here, veteran players can revisit the Speaker's platform where they were directed to shortly after the first
  <em>
   Destiny
  </em>
  's prologue mission. Unfortunately, every other area in Tower North is blocked off.

 <p>
  For the most part, the Pale Heart's Tower in The Final Shape stays true to the original. Its structural layout is nearly identical to the first, but it is missing some of the original's key components. However, this is all understandable, as it fits in with The Final Shape's narrative and what has now been made available to players in
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  's Tower.

      <title>Amazing PC Games With Low System Requirements</title>

 <p>
  It becomes abundantly clear from playing
  <strong>
   PC games
  </strong>
  that graphics aren't everything. Many of the most streamed games on Twitch have low PC requirements, which isn't a coincidence. Sometimes developers sacrifice gameplay quality for graphics. It's an unfair tradeoff, but it's a stark reality.

  Someone can pour hundreds of hours into these games until their laptop or desktop computer overheats. With a quality PC build, people can play most of these games on maximum settings or increase the frame rate on lower settings. Note that many of the
  <strong>
   best
  </strong>
  <strong>
   low-spec PC games
  </strong>
  are also playable on macOS.

    Low-end PC gaming

   is forever expanding thanks to the indie scene. Most weeks produce at least a couple of projects that run well on anything resembling a modern system. While they cannot all be amazing, there are usually a few pretty good titles. A recently-released co-op game has been added to this article.

  What Constitutes A Low-Spec Game?
 </h3>
 <p>
  The definition of "low-spec" varies from person to person. For some folks, a desktop with a GTX 1050ti and a 5th gen CPU would qualify; meanwhile, for others, low-spec means a non-gaming laptop that does not have a dedicated graphics card. Consequently, each game's minimum requirements will be included to provide some guidance, and the definition of "low-spec" will be treated as flexible.

  Adapting MMO gameplay into a bullet hell format,
  <em>
   Rabbit and Steel
  </em>
  is a singular beast that targets a very specific audience, and it hits the bullseye. The gameplay revolves around tab-target attacks (or dodges) and is designed to capture the feel of MMO raids, creating fast-paced and intense combat scenarios. Stages consist of multiple fights in a row and are somewhat structured like boss rushes, although there is a clear increase in difficulty. Considering its inspiration, it should come as no surprise that
  <em>
   Rabbit and Steel
  </em>
  is mainly advertised as a co-op experience, with four players being allowed to join forces either in local or online multiplayer.

 <p>
  This title is fun, charming, and replayable thanks to a decent range of classes; consequently, if a player opts to raid solo, they can try out different characters to get as much mileage as possible.
  <em>
   Rabbit and Steel
  </em>
  is also a roguelite, so repetition is part of its core appeal. Now, all that being said, the combat loop is an acquired taste and can be a hard sell to someone not familiar with MMOs. Due to that, interested players should 100% download the demo before purchasing the full game. It costs nothing and provides more than enough content to allow for an informed decision.

  In 2024's early months, the PC scene welcomed
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Enshrouded
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dragon's Dogma 2
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Tekken 8
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Unicorn Overlord
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Persona 3 Reload
  </em>
  , all of which garnered near-universal praise. However, one of the year's best releases to date was an indie Metroidvania with such low system requirements that they almost seem wrong. Running on most computers with specs (and Windows 10),
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  is a stunning and fresh entry in a genre that has been somewhat overexposed in recent years. With almost no setup, the game drops players in a surreal and atmospheric setting and just lets them be, encouraging them to go out, explore, collect eggs, and face off against a couple of bosses.

 <p>
  Unlike many Metroidvanias,
  <em>
   Animal Well
  </em>
  focuses on puzzles rather than combat; in fact, the latter is almost entirely absent, although players can use fireworks to take down or stall enemies. Each part of the map effectively functions as a mini-brainteaser, encouraging lateral thinking and clever use of the available tools to unlock gates and get past obstacles. Even boss fights are puzzles. Naturally, exploration is also a big part of the package, and the same can be said for platforming. The latter is simple but enjoyable, while the former is generally rewarding despite some frustrating moments.

  One of 2023's nicest surprises,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is a pixelated delight. Restaurant and fishing sims are not particularly uncommon, but very few games not only combine the two but also create something that feels genuinely unique. Despite sharing many similarities with other projects,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  is one of a kind. As Dave, players find themselves owning a new sushi restaurant, and they are also in charge of acquiring the fish that will be served to customers. During the day, Dave dives into a peculiar sea in search of ingredients that his restaurant can then serve at night.

 <p>
  Although not the deepest restaurant manager on the market,
  <em>
   Dave the Diver
  </em>
  grants players a fair amount of control over the restaurant's direction, allowing them enough creative input to give the experience a personal touch. While these sections are fun, the game is at its best when focusing on diving. Blending exploration, combat, and some customization, the dives are surprisingly action-packed, and they have quite a bit of variety as well.

  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  follows a nameless protagonist who receives cryptic messages that are generally interpreted as "go here and kill everyone." Set in the late '80s, the top-down shooter is drenched in neon lights and video game eccentricities that inspire players to not give much consideration to the reasons behind their actions. As the killer shoots their way through a building's floors, they leave behind a trail of blood, guts, and bonus points.

 <p>
  Straightforward as the formula sounds on paper,
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  contains quite a bit of depth, both in the way stages need to be approached and the narrative that drives the slaughter. Perhaps more importantly, the game is a lot of fun to play, and it has not aged a bit since its 2012 debut.
  <em>
   Hotline Miami
  </em>
  is not just one of the
  <strong>
   best low-end PC games
  </strong>
  but also one of the greatest projects of all time.

  Debuting in February 2024,
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  took the gaming world by storm, being a massive hit on both PS5 and PC. While not a traditional AAA project that requires an extremely powerful system to run, the game is still a bit too intensive to recommend as a low-budget option, although the minimum graphics specs are reasonable since they require a GTX 1050 Ti or an RX 470. Still, if someone is specifically craving a trip to this universe that can be run on most modern PCs, the original
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  is right there on Steam, and it is a fantastic game by most metrics.

 <p>
  Similar to its sequel,
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  is intended to be played in co-op, with players being encouraged to work together to take on missions. Solo runs are possible, but they tend to be very difficult and often encourage a preventive and defensive playstyle that does not reflect the gameplay's strengths. Otherwise,
  <em>
   Helldivers
  </em>
  is an awesome twin-stick isometric shooter with a wicked sense of humor and quite a bit of replay value.

  Eric wakes up on a treacherous island without his son, and he soon comes to realize that surviving a plane crash was the easy part of this adventure. A survival horror game,
  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  incorporates most of the standard elements associated with the genre, including crafting tools, building shelter, and finding food. Eric must also deal with the locals who happen to be cannibals, although they are not necessarily evil (or good).

  <em>
   The Forest
  </em>
  is a must-play for survival or horror fans. While not especially striking in the visual department, its gameplay and story are rock-solid. A sequel called
  <em>
   Sons of the Forest
  </em>
  launched in February 2023, but that requires more juice under a computer's hood.

  Valve does a fantastic job optimizing its games, with pretty much all of them playing well on low-end PCs.
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  is no exception, although the game can look pretty fantastic with high-end graphics. But even "watered down," and with the settings on low,
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  is one of the most engaging and entertaining puzzle adventures ever produced. Most players come to experience the hilarious storyline and stellar voice action, only to be completely gripped by Portal's unique brand of gameplay.

 <p>
  What's even better is that
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  can be enjoyed with a friend, thanks to an entirely separate cooperative storyline. This means there's twice as much to see and do in
  <em>
   Portal 2
  </em>
  , and it should all run smoothly with low requirements.

  It's hard sometimes to find enjoyable multiplayer games that feature very low-end requirements but there are some serious gems out there.
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  is a great example that video games don't need insanely complex graphics or gameplay elements to be a blast. With its cute 2D art style and mini-game-like structure,
  <em>
   Among Us
  </em>
  offers players a fun gameplay loop that is accentuated by a multiplayer mechanic that makes it even more engaging.

 <p>
  Not only will players enjoy the "tasks" sprinkled around each map, but they'll also need to keep away from a player-slaying imposter, while also maintaining their innocence.

  Released in 2019 before receiving an updated version two years later,
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  is among the most decorated RPGs of the last decade. ZA/UM's game follows an amnesiac detective who is assigned a murder case, one that quickly spirals out of control while also revealing different facades of the protagonist.

 <p>
  Presented from an isometric angle,
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  is reminiscent of old-school '90s RPGs that prioritize world-building and dialogue over action. Set in cyberpunk-esque universe, the story dives into the political ideologies that shape the world's various cultures, and the player's choices impact the protagonist's thought patterns and beliefs.
  <em>
   Disco Elysium
  </em>
  is a story-driven experience with fantastic writing, unforgettable characters, and genuinely impactful choices. Ultimately, the RPG is not for everyone, but that has nothing to do with its accessible specs.

  Crystal Dynamics'
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  reboot will be celebrating its 10-year anniversary soon. While the sequels surpass the 2013 game in a number of ways, Lara Croft's first "contemporary" adventure is arguably the most consistently great, and the game does not outstay its welcome. Anyone looking for an action-packed game with good visuals, fun gameplay, and a passable storyline will find what they are looking for in this title.

 <p>
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  is well-optimized on PC, and the game is likely to run on most (relatively) modern systems. On low settings, the game can be played on a laptop with Intel HD Graphics 3000 and a halfway decent processor. Lara might lag on occasion, but she will run.

  Compared to some other
  <strong>
   low-spec PC games
  </strong>
  ,
  <em>
   Subnautica
  </em>
  requires slightly more juice under the hood, which is to be expected of a 2018 open-world release. However, Unknown Worlds' game entered early access in 2014, and its system requirements are more in line with projects from that era. Consequently, this title is a great option for users with budget computers who are searching for an immersive 3D experience with a reasonably-sized map for exploration.

  Crash-landing on planet 4546B, Ryley Robinson finds herself alone in a world consisting primarily of water. In order to survive and perhaps find a way off this rock, the protagonist must scour the ocean for resources, a process that is just as likely to produce beautiful or nightmarish sights.

  A space flight sim,
  <em>
   Kerbal Space Program
  </em>
  has been around in some form since 2011, although its official release did not happen until 2015. Do not be fooled by the quirky mascots into believing this is an accessible and casual game as that is far from the case.
  <em>
   Kerbal Space Program
  </em>
  strives for realism, and players need to know what they are doing if they want a successful lift-off, let alone complete a full trip.

 <p>
  Even though the gameplay is difficult to master, the journey tends to be fun regardless of whether a mission ends in triumph or failure.
  <em>
   Kerbal Space Program
  </em>
  has an active online community that has crafted tons of great mods and is likely to keep the game active for a long time, even with a sequel announced for 2023.

  <em>
   Loop Hero
  </em>
  is a fantastic strategy game with a unique premise and some serious nostalgic vibes. Featuring a chiptune soundtrack and some SNES-era graphics, this procedurally-generated RPG world doesn't take extensive PC hardware to run well. That said, players with high-end PCs shouldn't sleep on this title just because it looks and feels like a retro release.

 <p>
  The world of
  <em>
   Loop Hero
  </em>
  is complex, giving players the opportunity to "influence a world" rather than simply control a character. They'll need to place down cards, create paths, manage resources, and "strategize for the future." It's challenging, deceptively simplistic, and a good change of pace for players looking for something to tease their brains.

 <p>
  Ah,
  <em>
   Football Manager
  </em>
  . A franchise that, while not as mainstream as
  <em>
   FIFA
  </em>
  , is just as capable of consuming all of someone's free time. Sports Interactive's series has been going strong for decades by this point, and most entries are well-regarded, even if they are not all equally adored.
  <em>
   FM
  </em>
  has always been driven by data, and the last couple of entries have doubled down on emphasizing the minute pieces of club management. This attention to detail has resulted in some of the most complex and deep management sims on the market, and the 2024 iteration is arguably an improvement over its immediate predecessor.

 <p>
  Along with offering potentially endless hours of entertainment as players try to lead their chosen teams to glory,
  <em>
   FM 24
  </em>
  's hardware accessibility is also a major selling point. The game will likely run on most relatively modern laptops, although some systems might be hamstrung by their Windows version. On more budget PCs,
  <em>
   FM 24
  </em>
  may lag a bit at times since it needs to constantly process a lot of information, but that should not impact the gameplay's viability.

  Grasshopper Manufacturer's
  <em>
   Killer is Dead
  </em>
  garnered a mixed reception upon release, mostly thanks to its similarities to the developer's more popular
  <em>
   No More Heroes
  </em>
  games and some rather awful mini-games. However, the hack and slash title's positives still shine roughly a decade following its debut. Firstly, the game's stylized graphics have aged beautifully, arguably better than most mid-tier 2013 releases with more realistic visuals. Secondly, and more importantly,
  <em>
   Killer is Dead
  </em>
  's combo-driven combat is incredibly fun, and it holds up well on repeat playthroughs.

  <em>

  was never a very demanding game, and in 2023, most low-spec laptops are likely to be able to run it. Due to its unique art style, the title still looks decent even when its graphics settings are set to as low as possible.

  <em>
   Batman: Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   City
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Origins
  </em>
  are all good
  <strong>
   games for low-end PCs
  </strong>
  , and they come with the added bonus of being quite cheap.
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  might drop players in a smaller-scale playground than its successors, but this translates to a strong and focused campaign. Visually, the 2010 game has aged extremely well, thanks in part to its Gothic and stylish architecture.

  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  is one of the greatest and most influential action games of all time. Rocksteady's combat system inspired projects like
  <em>
   Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Mad Max
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Remember Me
  </em>
  , and none of those titles are as great as
  <em>
   Arkham Asylum
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Fallout 1-3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  are safe picks for RPG fans with low-end computers. Although naturally dated in certain ways, all four games have timeless strengths, with
  <em>
   Fallout 1
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   2
  </em>
  's storytelling aging particularly well.
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  is still probably Bethesda's strongest entry in the series, and mods have greatly extended the game's lifespan.

 <p>
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  serves as a middle-ground between
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  's isometric and 3D eras, combining the complex world-building and quest design of the former with the modern sensibilities of the latter. Obsidian's RPG can be enjoyed without any mods, although that scene should not be ignored either.

 <p>
  Auto-action roguelikes in the style of
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  are basically all great picks for
  <strong>
   low-spec PC gaming
  </strong>
  since they are as untaxing on hardware as possible. And, the subgenre has produced a fair few impeccable titles beyond just
  <em>
   Vampire Survivors
  </em>
  . One project that came out of nowhere but quickly rose to the top of the pile was
  <em>
   HoloCure - Save the Fans!
  </em>
  , a fan-made release revolving around HoloLive's Vtubers. Now, this description might put off people who are not interested in that side of pop culture, but the game is surprisingly accessible to non-fans.

 <p>
  Ultimately, at its core,
  <em>
   HoloCure
  </em>
  is a colorful, creative, and addictive roguelike that comes with a surprisingly robust selection of characters that play quite differently from each other. Most importantly,
  <em>
   HoloCure
  </em>
  is free-to-play, meaning it comes with absolutely no risk. While a work in progress, the current version is still packed to the brim with content, and players can easily spend hours on end just trying to unlock all the playable Vtubers.

  Compared to most other
  <strong>
   low-spec games
  </strong>
  recommended in this article,
  <em>
   Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition
  </em>
  requires slightly more power under the hood; however, the 1999 original game and its HD version are also readily available and can be run on a toaster. A contender for the greatest strategy title of all time,
  <em>
   AOE 2
  </em>
  combines city building and war management to create a deep and potentially endless experience.

 <p>
  Besides a graphical upgrade, the
  <em>
   Definitive Edition
  </em>
  primarily sticks to implementing quality-of-life improvements, most of which enhance the gameplay in small but welcome ways. There are also a few new campaigns and modes, so this package is not simply a more beautiful version of a timeless classic.

 <p>
  Those who enjoy punishing gameplay and strategy elements should put
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  at the top of their list. This gritty, macabre RPG is downright unfair at times, hitting players with strings of bad luck and RNG-generated madness. Even the smartest and most prepared players can find themselves hopelessly clinging to life at the hands of
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  's mechanics.

 <p>
  Thanks to its charming 2D aesthetic and side-scrolling action,
  <em>
   Darkest Dungeon
  </em>
  doesn't require an immense amount of PC power to run smoothly. A lack of complex particle effects paired with its hand-drawn and sometimes simplistic graphics allows players with low-end PCs to join in on the fun. It also features a pretty dedicated modding community, so there's a lot of customization to be found.

  There's a lot of debate found throughout the gaming world on whether games need expressive graphics and gameplay to be considered truly great.
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  firmly plants itself as an Indie release that proves that a game can have a fantastic story, fun gameplay, and engaging characters with minimal graphics and effects.

  Toby Fox created an incredibly imaginative world that spawned a massive cult following thanks to its colorful cast of characters, incredible soundtrack, and fast-paced dodge-based gameplay elements. Anyone who hasn't played
  <em>
   Undertale
  </em>
  is seriously missing out and its ability to run well on even the lowest of low-end PCs gives almost anyone a chance to experience it.

  Farming games, like tycoon games, are typically great for low-end devices. The goals of the game are simple on the surface, but with layers and layers of depth to keep players engaged. And, of course, it's hard to mention the genre without bringing up the best title:
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  . This game wears a lot of different hats over the core farming gameplay loop, and it executes everything it tries to do well.

  In terms of running
  <strong>
   games on low-end computers
  </strong>
  , the minimum requirements for
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  include Windows Vista as the operating system, among other quaint settings. If that doesn't indicate the fact this game can run on anything, I don't know what else will. It's frequently on sale, so PC game players both hardcore and casual have no excuse to not pick up
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Slay the Spire
  </em>
  is one of the best roguelites of all time and basically shaped what became the deck-building subgenre. The game is simple and easy to learn but with so much depth in building decks that each character can play radically differently between each attempt. For example, the mage analog in The Defect can use its elemental orbs to succeed or can pick up a bunch of Claws and rip enemies apart. It's so much fun to experiment, and getting an overpowered run is an amazing dopamine hit.

 <p>
  For
  <strong>
   low-end PCs
  </strong>
  , the game's style is what carries it over the edge. It doesn't look like a typical card game, but it certainly runs like one. Even the slowest of PCs can get the game going without too much effort. For fans of the genres
  <em>
   Slay the Spire
  </em>
  flirts with, it's definitely worth it to check out.

 <p>
  Debuting in 2012,
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  is more than a decade old by this point. In Ubisoft's long history of open-world releases, few garnered as much praise or were as influential as
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  . A critical and commercial success, the FPS drops players on Rook Islands, a gorgeous but highly dangerous archipelago that does not take kindly to outsiders.

 <p>
  Featuring an iconic villain in Vaas and a decent protagonist in Jason Brody, the campaign holds up reasonably well. Although expanded upon by its sequels,
  <em>
   Far Cry 3
  </em>
  's gameplay is still fun today. The gunplay is responsive, while the exploration benefits from taking place on a big but not overwhelming map.

  <em>
   A Hat in Time
  </em>
  is a throwback to classic 3D collectathons, and it does a great job of capturing the magic of yesteryear's masterpieces. Oozing charm and featuring tight controls, the campaign tells an endearingly silly story that guides players through a plethora of diverse levels that generally avoid overused settings.

  While perhaps not breaking new ground,
  <em>
   A Hat in Time
  </em>
  shows that some formulas are simply timeless, provided they are executed with love, care, and expertise. If someone enjoys games like
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  , they will have a blast with this indie project.

  Plenty of things contributed to
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's success. Epic capitalized on the battle royale craze just as it was picking up steam, arguably producing the subgenre's definitive IP. This mode's free-to-play status attracted people who might have been on the fence about dropping cash on something like
  <em>
   PUBG
  </em>
  . The gameplay is intuitive and addictive for both the battle royale mode and
  <em>
   Save the World
  </em>
  , while
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  's love for cross-promotion has prolonged its existence in the public eye.

 <p>
  All those components helped cement the license as a juggernaut, however, the importance of the PC game's low specs should not be underestimated.
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  has become the de facto "casual" game because of its accessibility, not only in terms of its content but also availability. Essentially, almost anyone can play this (highly popular) release.

  Another extremely popular free-to-play release,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is an action RPG that utilizes a gacha system for unlocking characters. Set in Teyvat, the game has been steadily expanding its world, story, and roster of characters, and the future is bright for Mihoyo's project. Now,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  requires a bit more under the hood than most other
  <strong>
   low-spec PC games
  </strong>
  mentioned in this article, but the requirements are shockingly manageable for what is an open-world experience filled with content.

 <p>
  Even if its graphics or map density cannot compare to games like
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Grand Theft Auto 6
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  is still visually appealing and offers quite a variety of variety in its locations and storytelling.

  Steam is flooded with retro shooters, and most do not have high technical barriers for entries.
  <em>
   Prodeus, Ultrakill
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   HROT
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Amid Evil
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Cultic
  </em>
  are all very good FPS games that harbor back to old-school projects like
  <em>
   Doom
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Blood
  </em>
  , which are also options for anyone who wishes to revisit the classics rather than their spiritual successors. Out of all these releases,
  <em>
   Dusk
  </em>
  is arguably the pick of the bunch, offering three fantastic campaigns that are gruesome, intense, and fantastically designed.

 <p>
  While adhering to the standards of '90s shooters,
  <em>
   Dusk
  </em>
  also fully embraces horror, arguably more so than any of its contemporaries. The episodic structure allows the game to shake up its setting and enemies, ensuring things do not get repetitive. Most importantly,
  <em>
   Dusk
  </em>
  's nails its weapons and gunplay.

  In 2012,
  <em>
   Torchlight 2
  </em>
  attracted attention for providing a traditional hack and slash experience during a time when they were hard to come by. It is hardly surprising that a decade-old game can be run on the PC equivalent of a toaster, especially one that was not even intensive when it debuted. Regardless of its age,
  <em>
   Torchlight 2
  </em>
  is still a fantastic dungeon crawler and a must-play for anyone itching to pick up as much loot as digitally possible.

 <p>
  The RPG's cartoonish art style is timeless in a similar way to how the early
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  games look set to always be pleasant to the eyes. More importantly,
  <em>
   Torchlight 2
  </em>
  's gameplay also seems to be immune to aging, provided a player enjoys its classic approach to combat.

  <em>
   Spelunky
  </em>
  is one of the definite indie titles on both PC and console. In terms of influence, the game should be considered in the same league as
  <em>
   The Binding of Isaac
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Cave Story,
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Super Meat Boy
  </em>
  . It's a game designed with infinite ways to make the player struggle, but just as many ways to help the player succeed. Sometimes the chips don't fall in favor of Spelunky Guy, but when they do, it's so worth it.

 <p>
  The sequel,
  <em>
   Spelunky 2
  </em>
  , delivers more of the same, but it may require a somewhat more modern system to get working.
  <em>
   Spelunky
  </em>
  's HD port on Steam, on the other hand, can still run on Windows XP. The game operates smoothly and is still as engrossing as ever.

  While
  <em>
   The Witcher 3
  </em>
  requires a fairly hefty PC to run, the same cannot be said about the older entries in the franchise. Considering the original sequel debuted in 2011,
  <em>
   The Witcher 2
  </em>
  's low PC requirements are not that unexpected; however, the RPG is also very well optimized. Quite a few non-gaming modern laptops are likely to meet the game's recommended criteria, resulting in a decent experience rather than just a serviceable one.

 <p>
  Overshadowed as it might be by its more decorated successor,
  <em>
   The Witcher 2
  </em>
  is nevertheless a fantastic game by most metrics. Rather than open-world, the RPG's campaign is divided into semi-explorable regions, each one containing side quests along with the main story beats. Unsurprisingly, CD Projekt Red's tight writing is in full display throughout
  <em>
   The Witcher 2
  </em>
  , and an argument could be made that this entry's central storyline is better than the one in its sequel.

  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  requires a fairly beefy PC, so it is not a great pick for budget gaming even if the RPG is not quite as taxing as other modern AAA projects. However, if someone is craving a (comparatively) low-spec game that is slightly similar to the
  <em>
   DnD
  </em>
  title, they should check out Larian's previous masterpiece,
  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2
  </em>
  . Debuting in 2017 and arguably setting a new benchmark for tactical RPGs, this release is the full package, offering deep combat, a fully realized world, and a lot of customization options.

  <em>
   Divinity: Original Sin 2

  comes with a high skill ceiling, and the campaign's first couple of hours can threaten to overwhelm newcomers as it does not pull any punches. While never becoming easy, the game should eventually start to click, provided enjoys turn-based tactics.

  The gaming industry has tried its hand at a lot of
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  projects over the years, a few of which are even decent. While the majority of these titles take inspiration from the more action-oriented
  <em>
   Aliens
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Aliens vs. Predator
  </em>
  , the franchise's strongest game turns to the 1979 original movie for tips on how to craft a proper sci-fi horror experience that could terrify genre veterans. A direct sequel to the film,
  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  centers around Ellen Ripley's daughter as she tries to discover what happened to her mother. Naturally, Amanda finds herself stuck in a space station that happens to have a Necromorph problem.

 <p>
  <em>
   Alien: Isolation
  </em>
  nails the most important thing about the franchise: the Necromorph is a genuine threat. Throughout most of the campaign, Amanda is very much the prey, and she spends her time trying to hide away from the deadly creature stalking her. Graphically, Creative Assembly designed a fairly impressive game that is not too taxing on the system, which makes sense since the space station is a rather desolate place.

  The 2010s saw the independent scene reach dizzying new heights. Each year seemed to produce an indie game that could match AAA projects in most areas besides their budget.
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  is one such masterpiece, and the game's brilliance attracted a passionate and large fanbase that is eagerly awaiting its sequel,
  <em>
   Silksong
  </em>
  . Naturally, 2D Metroidvanias should never require an RTX 4090 to get a solid 60 fps, and the genre has produced plenty of low-spec classics; however,
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  still manages to stand out from the crowd.

 <p>
  Visually, the game is nothing short of striking. Hallownest is a hauntingly gorgeous world that is deceptively massive; in fact, the latter extends to
  <em>
   Hollow Knight
  </em>
  in general. Team Cherry's title is absolutely overflowing with secrets, weapons, side quests, and bosses, to the point that a playthrough can easily last around 50 hours. It is all high-quality stuff as well.

  2D platformers are a dime-a-dozen in the independent scene. They come around so often, they do have a habit of blending together; consequently, if a game manages to stand out from the crowd, that must mean it is extra special.
  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  is one of those releases. Matt Makes Games' title follows Madeline as she tries to scale the eponymous mountain, a journey that serves as a metaphor for her own experiences with things like depression.

  <em>
   Celeste
  </em>
  is a very difficult game, which makes sense considering the mature themes it tries to tackle. For the most part, platformers tend to prioritize gameplay over story, but this 2018 project is something of an exception since it melts the two together in a way that causes them to be intrinsically linked.

  Initially created by one person (Chris Hunt),
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  is an ambitious indie title that has been around for more than a decade. The project takes cues from strategy, survival, and role-playing games, combining them to create a package with basically no peers. Although not much of a looker,
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  's rough aesthetic fits its
  <em>
   Mad Max
  </em>
  -esque universe, all the while ensuring that most modern computers should be able to run the game without much issue.

 <p>
  <em>
   Kenshi
  </em>
  strips the open-world concept down to its fundamentals. Players are dropped into a sandbox and essentially given no direction or story to follow; basically, they are left to their own devices. While overwhelming at first, this level of freedom is the game's best overall feature, and it can create an addictive escape from reality.

  <em>
   Team Fortress 2
  </em>
  is free-to-play on the Steam Store, and the game still continues to sit somewhere near the top of the platform's most-played titles. It's a multiplayer first-person shooter from Valve, the famed developers that brought the world
  <em>
   Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Half-Life
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Portal.
  </em>
  Games like
  <em>
   Overwatch
  </em>
  might not exist if it weren't for
  <em>
   TF2.
  </em>

 <p>
  Even if someone has a basic integrated graphics card like the Intel HD Graphics 630, they will probably meet the minimum and recommended requirements for
  <em>
   Team Fortress 2
  </em>
  . Although it's aged since its release in 2007, the gameplay holds up well.

  Players who love the
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  franchise but may not have a proper setup to enjoy it on PC can turn to
  <em>
   BattleBit Remastered
  </em>
  . This
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  -style shooter looks deceptively simple from the outside but features some incredibly tight, entertaining, and fluid FPS gameplay.

 <p>
  Players will be able to jump in with friends and join massive online battles with 254 players at a time, greatly eclipsing the amount in a standard
  <em>
   Battlefield
  </em>
  -style server, thanks to their much lower graphical requirements.
  <em>
   BattleBit Remastered
  </em>
  is a fantastic way to scratch the FPS itch and doesn't require a high-end PC to enjoy.

  Nowadays, quite a few of the most popular casual games come with a low barrier for entry.
  <em>
   Gang Beasts
  </em>
  is a silly physics-based multiplayer title that sees players trying to push each other toward certain doom. Boasting vibrant graphics, Boneloaf's game is a crowd-pleaser capable of entertaining both casual and hardcore gamers.

 <p>
  <em>
   Gang Beasts
  </em>
  does not require much power under the hood, and the game is likely to be playable on most modern laptops regardless of whether they are intended for gaming or not. As this is solely a multiplayer package, anyone seeking a solo experience should look elsewhere.

  Released in 2013,
  <em>
   Call of Juarez Gunslinger
  </em>
  is a Western shooter split into short chapters revolving around famous figures from history. Silas Greaves saunters into a saloon filled with patrons who are (mostly) willing to hear his wild tales, some of which sound too outlandish to be true.

 <p>
  Although hardly a graphical powerhouse,
  <em>
   Gunslinger
  </em>
  's visuals have aged shockingly well, and the same could be said for its gunplay. Although repetitive at times, the campaign shakes things up just enough to keep things interesting. The narrator's big personality also enhances these stories.

  The
  <em>
   Postal
  </em>
  series has produced its share of terrible games (
  <em>
   Postal 3
  </em>
  ), but there is a reason Running with Scissors's franchise is still around more than two decades after its debut. A lot of the goodwill acquired by the license can be credited to
  <em>
   Postal 2
  </em>
  , arguably the only genuinely decent entry in the series prior to 2022's
  <em>
   Brain Damaged

  As the infamous Postal Dude, players lead their lives in a relatively normal town; however, they can decide to turn things on their heads whenever they want.
  <em>
   Postal 2

  is unapologetically violent and irreverent, but it is also entertaining.

  Sega's
  <em>
   Valkyria Chronicles
  </em>
  debuted in 2008 on the PS3, although the PC version did not launch until 2014. This iteration comes with a boost in visuals, offering 1080p fidelity, along with all the DLC, so it is a good option for people looking to get into this well-respected but somewhat underrated franchise. Importantly,
  <em>
   Valkyria Chronicles
  </em>
  ' cel-shaded visuals have aged beautifully, and the game looks just as stunning now as it did when it originally launched. Now, that would not matter if the rest of the package failed to hold up, which is fortunately not the case. This unique release is frankly timeless.

 <p>
  Blending tactical RPG gameplay with third-person shooter elements and a lengthy story,
  <em>
   Valkyria Chronicles
  </em>
  features strong writing, memorable characters, and challenging combat. Set during a war reminiscent of WW2, the campaign puts players in charge of leading a unit, and if a character falls within a battle, they are permanently gone. This aspect adds weight to every battle, which can get quite long and brutal during the second half of the story.

  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  has been around since 2013, and the game has evolved significantly over the last decade. Since the very start, Digital Extremes' free RPG delivered fast-paced combat that ranked among the online sphere's best options; however, it took a while for the package around the battle system to blossom into something special. Nowadays,
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  has the content to back up its mechanics.

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Now, that's not to say the RPG has no flaws, as it is very grind-heavy and does a pretty terrible job of easing in newcomers. However,
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  can be generally enjoyed without spending a dime, which is not something that can be said for every free-to-play game.

  While the third entry debuted in 2023,
  <em>
   Payday 2
  </em>
  is still extremely popular, to the point of having far more active players on Steam than its successor. Launching in 2013, Overkill's first-person shooter is firmly established as a cornerstone of the multiplayer scene, and part of that can be at least credited to its accessibility.

  While the game's age shines through its core gameplay,

  's heist-based loop is timeless, and it provides crews with enough freedom to justify an endless grind. At this point, one has to assume that anyone remotely interested in this title has already jumped on board, but if anyone is on the fence, it is still a fun time.

  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  has been in early access for nearly a decade, but despite all that time in the oven, the game has continued to consistently sit among Steam's most successful releases. The 2D horror title takes place in a grueling open-world where the main goal is survival, although there is a backstory for those who wish to do so. However, the gameplay loop revolves entirely around collecting resources to build the necessary equipment to persevere as long as possible in a post-apocalyptic universe.

  Although not much of a looker,
  <em>
   Project Zomboid
  </em>
  's presentation gets the job done and does not distract from the gameplay. The game was not especially difficult to run when it debuted in the early 2010s, and it is now firmly established as one of the
  <strong>
   best low-end PC games
  </strong>
  on the market.

  Compared to other major 2023 releases like
  <em>
   Street Fighter 6
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Dead Space
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  is forgiving when it comes to minimum specs. Nevertheless, a player needs at least a GTX 660 and an i5 2500K to get the game running, which will eliminate most people who do not have a gaming-leaning desktop or laptop. If an action RPG cannot quite get Blizzard's project running, they can always just check out
  <em>
   Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls
  </em>
  .

  While the original version of
  <em>
   Diablo 3
  </em>
  garnered a lot of criticism, the
  <em>
   Reaper of Souls
  </em>
  iteration is generally well regarded, to the point that it should have been the entry's launch state. Although not a looker by traditional standards, the game's visuals hold up rather well, provided the cartoonish visuals hit the mark with a player.

  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  is a free-to-play game that has remained consistently popular since its 2017 release, an achievement that can be credited to both the dedicated team behind the indie project and the community built around it. The latter is particularly crucial as
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  emphasizes multiplayer quite a bit, although the game does provide single-player options for people who just want to try and survive in a zombie-infested world. Still, if someone plans to play this survival title for a long time, they will almost central interact with the community-driven content.

 <p>
  Featuring fairly expansive maps and solid gameplay that sticks close to the survival formula,
  <em>
   Unturned
  </em>
  has a lot to offer, provided someone enjoys its gameplay loop. The visuals have a
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  -style aesthetic, which is not going to be for everyone; that said, the two games are otherwise quite different.

  <em>
   Sonic the Hedgehog
  </em>
  has led a rough life. Nowadays, Sega's legendary mascot has a resume filled with both masterpieces and bottom-of-the-barrel junk, and the latter have dominated the discourse over the last two decades. Despite its many failures, when the franchise gets a project right, it tends to hit a home run.
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  is almost unquestionably the license's best title of the current century, and it was developed by a team that previously worked on fangames.

 <p>
  The developers' experience shines through the game's retro visuals, tight level design, great music, and classic gameplay.
  <em>
   Sonic Mania
  </em>
  pays homage to the Blue Blur's Genesis era in a way that feels fresh rather than a complete retread, although that might have to do with the fact Sega had largely ignored 2D
  <em>
   Sonic
  </em>
  except for a few levels in games like
  <em>
   Sonic Generations
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Cities: Skylines

  Supergiant's
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  is comfortably among the most popular roguelites on the market, and it serves as a good entry point for newcomers to the genre. The narrative follows Zagreus, the eponymous god's son who wants to leave the Underworld and make his way to Olympus. However, his father rejects this plan, and he intends to not make the journey easy for the young prince. As a roguelite,
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  ' loop revolves around replaying the same stages; however, unlike many similar games, defeat does not result in a complete reset. Instead, Zagreus' story develops naturally following a failure, so there is a constant sense of progression during the first 20 hours or so.

 <p>
  Boasting a gorgeous art style and fast-paced hack and slash combat,
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  knocks its presentation out of the park. Although an indie release, Supergiant's title is so polished and visually striking that it outshines most AAA projects; however, unlike the latest gaming blockbusters,
  <em>
   Hades
  </em>
  does not require a high-end PC. In fact, the game is really not demanding.

  If Earth's deep waters can inspire chills, then a distant moon's seas are the stuff of nightmares.
  <em>
   Barotrauma
  </em>
  taps into humanity's innate fear of the unknown by locking players in a submarine and tasking them with exploring an ocean riddled with creatures that would not look out of place in a Lovecraftian story. Blending survival horror with RPG elements,
  <em>
   Barotrauma
  </em>
  's brilliance really shines through when co-op is in play. Undertow's game supports up to 16 players, all of whom would be assigned roles within the submarine.

  Although certainly indie in presentation, the project nonetheless looks great and stylish, and it manages to produce some real scares despite being presented from an angle that does not facilitate horror particularly well.
  <em>
   Barotrauma
  </em>
  is an intense, suffocating experience that will test a team's communication, competence, and foresight, and its low barrier of entry when it comes to specs means that most people should be able to tag along for the ride.

  Many of the most popular video
  <strong>
   games have low PC requirements.
  </strong>
  It's not always about frame rate or graphics, which is why a game like

  Whether someone is a
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  or a
  <em>
   Dota 2
  </em>
  player, they can't deny that the former has left a huge impact on the gaming world.
  <em>
   League of Legends
  </em>
  is a MOBA that can be difficult for newcomers to jump into, especially after the game has been on the market for so long, but players won't need an especially jacked PC to get the title running.

  An indie darling released in 2013,
  <em>
   Papers, Please
  </em>
  utilizes a minimalist presentation to tell a harrowing story about war, sacrifice, and guilt. Set in a fictional state that is at odds with other countries, players control a border agent who must examine the documents of migrants trying to cross over. Simultaneously a nameless cog in the machine and an entity capable of dictating the lives of countless people, players will steadily come to understand the responsibility placed on their shoulders.

  Letting the wrong person through or denying someone who should have been accepted comes with dire consequences in the form of a salary penalty. While this might not sound like a big deal, the agent needs to use their measly income to keep their family fed and alive.

  will never die, or that at least seems to be the case. Valve's co-op shooter has been out for more than a decade, and the game's popularity has hardly waned. Four players must work together to blast their way through creative levels overflowing with zombies, some of which are quite creative.

  Even in 2009,
  <em>

  was not a particularly taxing game; consequently, modern systems should not have any trouble running this title on minimum or even maximum settings.

 <p>
  Honestly, most of Platinum's projects are good candidates for low-spec gaming, especially the developer's "masterpieces."
  <em>
   Bayonetta
  </em>
  does not require much to get working on a PC, and the same can be said for
  <em>
   Vanquish
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Transformers: Devastation
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   The Wonderful 101: Remastered
  </em>
  is a bit more taxing due to being a comparatively modern release, but it is still not too bad. Even
  <em>
   Nier: Automata
  </em>
  should run on most low-end PCs without too much hassle. All these are fantastic games that will likely hit the mark with most hack and slash fans (or third-person shooter fans, in the case of
  <em>
   Vanquish
  </em>
  ).

 <p>
  Therefore,
  <em>
   Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance
  </em>
  is being used as a representative of the developer's portfolio. This spin-off delivers fast-paced, stylish, and satisfying combat, along with a ridiculous over-the-top story that does not take itself too seriously. A player does not have to be a
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  fan to fall in love with
  <em>
   Revengeance
  </em>
  .

  <em>
   Rusty's Retirement
  </em>
  is not a typical game. It does not expect or even wants to hog the spotlight, instead preferring to quietly run in the background. This auto-run farming sim makes its home at the bottom of a player's screen, allowing them to continue using the computer while its eponymous robot manages their farm. Interaction comes in the form of planting seeds and acquiring upgrades, the latter of which arrive in many types and uses.

 <p>
  Steam has no shortage of farming sims, and they can threaten to blend; however,
  <em>
   Rusty's Retirement
  </em>
  is one of a kind. While not the deepest game out there, it offers a charming loop and a mild distraction that can add color to even the most boring of days.

 <p>
  Although
  <em>
   Valorant
  </em>
  was released in 2020, the
  <strong>
   game has surprisingly low PC requirements
  </strong>
  . This low-end favorite is jumping on the scene as one of Twitch's most streamed games. Its mass appeal is likely because of its low PC requirements and because it's free-to-play.

  As a game,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Ghost of Tsushima
   </em>
  </strong>
  is already an incredible cinematic work in its own right, so Hollywood picking the title for a live-action adaptation wasn't too surprising. Headed by Chad Stahelski, the stuntman turned director who is responsible for the hit
  <em>
   John Wick
  </em>
  franchise, the
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  movie is already off to an exciting start.

 <p>
  However, one recent rumor swirling around about the film's production is one of the most promising updates about the movie yet. Acting veteran Hiroyuki Sanada is apparently being eyed for a role in the film, and if this report is true, then that is promising news for
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's live-action adaptation. Not only would this be great for the movie's cast, but it's a positive omen for the production in general.

  Hiroyuki Sanada has decades worth of great films on his resume, but one of his most notable is his recent work on this year's series
  <em>
   Shogun
  </em>
  . From
  <em>
   John Wick
  </em>
  to
  <em>
   The Last Samurai
  </em>
  , Sanada has a long history with great action films, and
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima

  would be a perfect fit for the actor.

  Casting Rumors Point Toward Attention to Quality
 </h3>
 <p>
  It's quite obvious that Hollywood has been heavily focused on turning video games into live-action adaptations. In recent years,
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  have all gotten the live-action treatment.
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  didn't quite stick the landing that
  <em>
   The Last of Us
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  did, and it all seems to boil down to the attention and care of early production. That's why Sanada's rumored casting is so important. It's already a solid indication that early production is being handled with a lot of care.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":951} -->

 <p>
  Hiroyuki Sanada playing Jin Sakai is highly unlikely, but he would be perfect in the role of Lord Shimura, Jin's mentor and uncle. If these casting rumors are accurate,
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's production seeking out such heavy-hitting talent as Sanada for the role of a side character is a solid indicator that a lot of effort is being put into the project.
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima'
  </em>
  s embrace of cinematics really brought the game's story to life with some great performances, so it only makes sense for the live adaptation to seek out such talented actors.

 <p>
  As one of the biggest games of 2020, there are a lot of expectations for
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  's live-action movie. One of the biggest hurdles for the project to clear is with the cast, and Hiroyuki Sanada would be a stellar start. If Sanada takes on the role of Lord Shimura, the rest of the cast has to be on par with the veteran actor, at least in terms of talent. Director Chad Stahelski has worked with Sanada previously, so it's not entirely surprising that he would reach out to the actor to help bring the film to life.

 <p>
  After Sanada's potential casting is hopefully confirmed, the next big question revolves around who will play the titular Ghost himself, Jin Sakai. The game already has its own great performance from actor Daisuke Tsuji, and some are even hoping that he reprises his role in the live-action
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  . However, if the film takes a different route and casts a new actor, then he needs to be able to stand up to the likes of major names, like Sanada. Although the release of the
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  movie is far off in the distance, Hiroyuki Sanada's rumored casting negotiations could signal that the movie will be worth the wait.

  codes can be used to obtain valuable in-game rewards such as coins. This is useful for both new and experienced gamers. These coins can be spent to purchase various items such as gloves, shoes, and other visual items. Even though these are just cosmetic items, looking cool on the football field is very important because it allows players to stand out and other users will notice and remember a player better.

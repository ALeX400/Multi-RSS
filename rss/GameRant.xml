     <li>
      Mounts like the springer, raptor, and skimmer each offer unique abilities and playstyles to enhance gameplay.
     </li>
     <li>
      The roller beetle stands out for its extreme speed but challenging maneuverability, creating a thrilling racing experience.
     </li>
     <li>
      The griffon is hailed as the ultimate flying mount, offering exhilarating speed and freedom of movement without breaking exploration like the Skyscale.

 <p>
  The mounts in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Guild Wars 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  are one of the MMO's greatest selling points. Each of the nine mounts was seamlessly integrated into the story and gameplay and designed orthogonally, meaning that each one offers its own use case, look, and feel. The concept was introduced in the second expansion, "Path of Fire," and additional mounts were added with subsequent patches.

 <p>
  Some mounts and their abilities have changed over the years. For example, the "Janthir Wilds" update brought a suite of new abilities for the Warclaw in both World VS World and PVE. Each mount is ranked according to its current abilities rather than its state upon release, but returning players (or those interested in returning) may be interested to know how each has changed.

 <p>
  Although the springer can't reach the same speeds as other mounts, there's just something lovable about these energetic rabbits. Negating fall damage and bouncing to scarily high places in a single, dusty bound is extremely satisfying, and bounding around on one is still very fun.

 <p>
  However, once a certain mount is unlocked (the skyscale), the springer sadly becomes somewhat redundant, besides some specific situations. The springer's "cannonball" ability can still be used as an effective way to start breaking down a boss' defiance bar, and getting up and down steep terrain fast is best achieved on the back of this bouncy bunny.

 <p>
  The first mount added to
  <strong>
   <em>
    Guild Wars 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still a highly viable way to get around on land. Although it comes with none of the fancy tricks of the other mounts, the raptor's leap allows it to cross gaps or gain speed quickly and reliably, all with a whoosh of satisfaction. Its engage attack ability is still very useful for rounding up enemies to put them into one spot for a pummeling.

 <p>
  In terms of their looks, this mount clearly had a lot of love put into its design despite only being a starter mount. Using a raptor is an excellent way to enjoy the game with alt characters, as their speed doesn't turn the world into a blurry smear, but it does let players take in their beautiful surroundings at an easily adjustable pace.

  On release, the skimmer offered a way to cross water without hitting the slowdown of swimming. Since then, there has been a way to upgrade the skimmer to allow it to move just as rapidly through water as well.

  This stunning mount's blink ability doesn't just look or feel cool; it is a highly useful feature for maneuvering, effectively offering perfect turning precision. Since blink can be used mid-fall, it can both help its rider reach far-away ledges and negate all fall damage.

  Blink's secondary ability brings it through sand portals, and the jackal is able to run along sand bridges. While this makes the jackal an essential mount for map completion in "Path of Fire" and "Living World Season 4," it is a little niche, as these features do not occur much else outside Elona.

  The siege turtle, along with the skimmer, can be mounted while swimming, but it can also be ridden by two players at once, making it perfect for two friends or a couple. One player drives while the other rides shotgun (or, more accurately, jade tech cannon). While its siege attack is powerful, the gunner must watch their ammunition count.

 <p>
  Despite its massive, bulky body, the siege turtle is able to build up immense speed and even hover above the ground with its jump jets, if only for a short time. However, being the two-seater combat mount, the turtle is, of course, still quite sluggish in terms of its speed and stamina regeneration.

 <p>
  To many players, especially those who only played around with the Warclaw at its original release or those without the "Janthir Wilds" mini-expansion, the Warclaw may seem like a more sluggish version of the raptor. However, besides the fact that it is the only usable mount in World Verus World (
  <em>
   GW2
  </em>
  's huge-scale battle mode), it has seen many great improvements over time, with or without visiting Janthir.

 <p>
  The warclaw can be mounted even during combat (although this applies a cooldown each time it is done). It currently runs much faster now in PvE than it did in the past, and its "sniff" ability displays enemies and treasure on the minimap. The "Janthir Wilds" warclaw mastery line grants it a suite of moves, including mid-air jumping, fall damage negation, and additional mounted combat moves.

 <p>
  The appeal of the Skyscale (being able to fly across the landscape) is undeniable, as is being able to cling to the sides of walls and cliffs to reach greater heights, perform barrel rolls, and shoot fireballs from the sky. There's nothing quite like taming a dragon and taking it out on a skyward adventure.

 <p>
  However, this mount's implementation comes at the cost of retroactively turning all of Core Tyria and much of the previous expansions into "flyover country." All the future work of ArenaNet's level designers has to take this game-breaking mount's abilities into consideration, meaning ballooning map sizes and less intimate detail on the ground.

 <p>
  As much as the addition of mounts shook things up, the roller beetle mount is a game-changer even among them. While its blinding top speeds may be too much for some to handle, especially given the challenge of maneuvering, many players will swear that being able to rocket around a map from one side to the other in a matter of seconds somehow never gets old.

 <p>
  This extreme speed would not be as much fun without roller beetle racing. These tracks can be found across Tyria and offer a real challenge for racing fans. The roller beetle was implemented so well that it's possible to forget that
  <em>
   Guild Wars 2
  </em>
  is an MMO and not a high-speed racing game.

 <p>
  The griffon was
  <em>
   Guild Wars 2
  </em>
  's first flying mount, and while it isn't able to hover in place or reach new heights, it has a much better implementation. For one, the griffon does not invalidate land travel or vertical travel as the skyscale does, but it also outpaces it both literally in terms of speed, skill, and freedom of movement.

 <p>
  Moving around in the air with the griffon is a pure rush that makes the skyscale feel sluggish by comparison. Diving down to gather momentum and rising back up in a glorious ascent is easily one of the best feelings
  <em>
   Guild Wars 2
  </em>
  can offer. High-speed griffon flying, although it takes time to master, is both satisfying and incredibly useful for both traversal over short and long distances.

  When first arriving at the eponymous Iron Rig, players will notice that there is not much to interact with, let alone upgrade. This is because the Iron Rig is meant to be built-up over time, as the main story progresses. Over the course of the main narrative, players will need to both construct and upgrade several new facilities on the platform. The order in which these new buildings are created is largely dictated by the story, and is not decided by the player. Here, we will list the order in which each structure will be built, so players will know what to expect, and when a desired Boat upgrade will become available.

     Even though players do not have the freedom to build each structure when they want to, knowing the order and building requirements is still incredibly helpful. By knowing the required materials in advance, players can begin collecting them from the moment they begin 'The Iron Rig,' which will save them from a considerable amount of backtracking.

  The first step to
  <strong>
   building The Iron Rig
  </strong>
  is to locate it. It is visible from nearly every point of the map, but just in case, players will find it between the
  <strong>
   Twisted Strand
  </strong>
  and the
  <strong>
   Devil's Spine
  </strong>
  , in the center or the north end of the map. Upon arrival, players will begin with their very first crafting requirements. The following list will start here, and go through to the end:

  <li>
   Upon docking at the Iron Rig for the first time, players will be introduced to the
   <strong>
    Ironhaven Crates
   </strong>
   . These lost supplies are essential to building and upgrading every new facility on the platform. Any time you encounter them floating in the sea, make sure to collect them.

  In
  <em>
   <strong>
    Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  , weapon perks are special modifications that can be assigned to your weapons to
  <strong>
   improve their efficiency and performance on the battlefield
  </strong>
  . These perks can significantly enhance your combat experience by buffing your weapons with special mods, such as
  <strong>
   faster reloads, improved accuracy, and increased fire rate
  </strong>
  .

  , the game doesn't do a great job of explaining how you should go about unlocking these valuable mods for your favorite weapons. And, if you've found yourself in a position where you don't understand how to unlock weapon perks in the game, the following guide should come to your rescue.

 <p>
  You can level up your weapons in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  by simply using them in cooperative and PVP modes. The more you use a weapon in missions, the greater your XP gain. Eventually, you'll have earned enough XP to upgrade that weapon and transition to the next tier. There are four upgrade tiers in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  , including
  <strong>
   Standard, Master-Crafted, Artificer, and Relic
  </strong>
  . To upgrade your weapons from one tier to the next, you must earn a specific amount of XP and a specific type of Armory Data.
 </p>

 <p>
  Each time you upgrade a weapon tier, you also
  <strong>
   gain access to unlockable variants of the same weapon
  </strong>
  . These weapon variants provide a slight improvement over the base variants, but they do not come close to what you can achieve when outfitting weapons with perks. You can unlock weapon variants by
  <strong>
   spending a certain number of Requisition Points
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Weapon variants also have their own separate XP bar, which is filled when you use the weapon in co-op and PVP modes. Once this XP bar is completely filled, you'll gain a Mastery Point, which can be spent in the Perk Tree to unlock new perks for your weapons.

 <p>
  It’s also important to note that weapon upgrades are universal and class-independent. Once a weapon is upgraded, its benefits, including any assigned perks, are available to all classes that use that weapon. This means you won’t need to upgrade the weapon when switching to a different class that also uses it.

 <p>
  Since Requisition Points allow you to unlock new weapon variants, which eventually lead to acquiring weapon perks,
  <strong>
   it's important to understand how to earn Requisition Points in
   <em>
    Space Marine 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The quickest way to earn Requisition Points is by simply
  <strong>
   completing all available trials for each class
  </strong>
  . Completing all trials will leave you with potentially
  <strong>
   450 Requisition Points
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  You can also earn Requisition Points by
  <strong>
   playing Operations and Eternal War modes
  </strong>
  . Playing and completing Operations on either Substantial or Ruthless difficulties rewards you with additional Requisition Points.

 <p>
  Now that you've learned the basics of weapon upgrades, weapon variants, and Requisition Points,
  <strong>
   it's time to find out how to unlock weapon perks
  </strong>
  . In
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  , you unlock perks by spending Mastery Points. These points are earned when you complete the XP requirement for a weapon variant by using it in co-op and PVP modes.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Similar to weapon tiers,
  <strong>
   the Perk Tree features a tier-based unlock system
  </strong>
  , starting from Standard and going up to Relic. These tiers correspond to your weapon’s upgrade level. For instance, if your weapon is upgraded only to the Master-Crafted tier,
  <strong>
   the Perk Tree will only grant access to perks within the Standard or Master-Crafted tiers
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  As you continue to upgrade your weapons to higher tiers, you will unlock corresponding tiers in the Perk Tree.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":947} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Before picking a perk under the Perk Tree, take the time to observe how the tree progresses. It's important to understand that you cannot unlock every available perk, and
  <strong>
   acquiring certain perks will lock you out of acquiring other perks
  </strong>
  . The Perk Tree also follows a unique progression system,
  <strong>
   indicated by the lines that connect one perk to the other
  </strong>
  . Make sure that you study the perk progression before making your first investment. But it's not a nail-biting decision, since you can always reset and reassign them.

 <p>
  Finally, the Perk Tree in
  <em>
   Space Marine 2
  </em>
  features both passive and active perks. The difference between the two is that you can deactivate active perks if you don't like them. You can identify active perks by their hexagonal design and passive perks by their square shapes.

  There are plenty of games that let players stretch their creative wings, giving them the tools to create buildings, contraptions, and even entire levels. Creative games like
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , level creators such as
  <em>
   Halo's
  </em>
  Forge mode, and the construction simulation of games like
  <em>
   RimWorld
  </em>
  allow players to construct buildings, which has proven to be a strong core gameplay loop.

 <p>
  Although players can build castles in games like
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  , these more creative-focused games often lack gameplay loops that center on castle-building. While many of these games contain strong mechanics for building castles in a way that affects the gameplay, some are more focused on creative freedom.

     Castle-building games
    </strong>
    are a relatively underserved market in the world of PC gaming, even though they're relatively popular. However, the successful release of both Stronghold: Definitive Edition and Cataclismo shows that there's still a need for good castle-building experiences, so much so that people will still happily purchase a game that's over twenty years old. Some games, such as the aforementioned Stronghold, focus almost entirely on building castles, while games like the upcoming indie title, Tiny Glade, provide players with creative sandboxes that allow players the freedom to build impressive castles.

  <strong>

  ​This tough-as-nails multiplayer survival game takes on a Viking theme and focuses its gameplay on exploration, combat, and building. Although still in Early Access at the time of writing,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Valheim
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the highest-rated survival games on Steam.

 <p>
  <em>
   Valheim's
  </em>
  building tools are incredibly intuitive and merge with the survival gameplay perfectly, allowing players to get creative as they explore and gain access to more resources. The potential for complex and large-scale castles in the world of
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  can be seen in the community. YouTube alone is heavily populated with complex and large-scale castles built by dedicated players. Although
  <em>
   Valheim
  </em>
  is one of the most well-received castle-building games, its focus on exploration and combat makes its gameplay less centered around castle-building than others.

  This base defense game is all about building and defending a castle from waves of enemies in a fantasy setting. The game features increasingly difficult sieges to defend from, resource management, and light RTS elements that help to add a layer of depth to the game.

 <p>
  Because of
  <em>
   Foundation's
  </em>
  laid-back nature, players are given more freedom to focus on the city-building aspects of the game, rather than worrying about constant threats looming over their growing city. That's not to say that players won't encounter adversity in
  <em>
   Foundation
  </em>
  , but growing a medieval city and watching as castles begin to take form is both a relaxing and satisfying experience that's worth trying out.

  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  is, at its heart, a survival-crafting game with a focus on mining and building. However, the sheer number of tools and materials that
  <em>
   Minecraft
  </em>
  offers both in and out of its designated Creative Mode allows players an unprecedented amount of freedom.

 <p>
  This freedom allows players to essentially build whatever they can imagine, so long as it can be made out of blocks. Over the years of
  <em>
   Minecraft's
  </em>
  development, players have honed their skills and mastered the game's tools to such a degree that they're able to build extremely impressive structures. However, even for the average player, building a simple stone castle is still perfectly possible, albeit not the game's focus.

  This retro RTS game was released back in 2001 and defines itself as a "castle simulator," allowing players to design and build sprawling castle complexes. It could be argued that building strongholds and defending them from large armies has never managed to live up to the standards
  <em>
   Stronghold
  </em>
  set all those years ago.

  Although
  <em>
   Stronghold
  </em>
  features a full campaign with some great missions to complete, its economic campaign allows players to relax as they design and build castles in a combat-free environment. The game features a revered HD version on the Steam storefront, and a definitive edition was released on November 7, 2023.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Cataclismo
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a combination of real-time strategy, tower defense, and base-building. The game tasks players with building castles piece by piece using a modular system inspired by LEGO.
  <em>
   Cataclismo
  </em>
  features a somber world and an art style to match, providing an eerie atmosphere as players defend their growing castle from waves of enemies.

  Though at the time of writing
  <em>
   Cataclismo
  </em>
  is currently in Early Access, it already features a single-player campaign, a skirmish mode, and a highly replayable challenge mode. The game even features a map editor that allows players to build and share their own skirmish maps. All in all,
  <em>
   Cataclismo
  </em>
  is a castle-building base defense game with a great sense of atmosphere and high replay value.

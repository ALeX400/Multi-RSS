	The new Veiled Threats quest in
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Destiny 2
	 </strong>
	</em>
	offers an exciting conclusion to the game's final season of the year, though players who have finished the seasonal content on multiple characters have noticed that this final mission can actually drop some hilariously underwhelming loot. While many of the reward drops in
	<em>
	 <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/destiny-2/">

	</em>
	have been turned up prior to the launch of the game's Final Shape expansion in just over a week, players will have to act fast if they hope to complete all the content from this year's seasons and the Into the Light update before it's gone for good.

	Season of the Wish was met largely with positive reception following its release - an especially good thing, considering the season stands out as the longest-running season in
	<em>
	 Destiny 2
	</em>
	's history after it was extended due to The Final Shape's delay. The season's story has focused on Guardians working with the paracausal apparition of the last Ahamkara, Riven, in order to forge a pathway to the Pale Heart - the strange new destination where

	While Season of the Wish has given Guardians the opportunity to earn tons of good loot, particularly with the introduction of the lucrative Coil seasonal activity, the season's final mission has left players with some rather disappointing loot in some cases. A popular post recently made on Reddit by the user PrimitusVictor shows off exactly what players get when they complete the Veiled Threats quest on any other character after finishing it once - nothing more than a fizzled gear mod, which is now completely useless after being removed from the game long ago. While this certainly isn't the only time
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-crotas-end-flawless-shader-complaints/">
	 <em>
		Destiny 2
	 </em>
	 has dropped some woeful loot
	</a>
	into players' hands, it's difficult not to find this instance kind of funny, as the defunct mod actually dismantles into components that have also been removed from the game.

	Why Players Shouldn't Sleep on Season of the Wish's Conclusive Mission
 </h2>
 <p>
	It's worth noting that these defunct gear mods are only given to players after they've completed the final seasonal mission at least once on any character. For players who haven't yet had a chance to play through the mission, it's absolutely worth it - if not for the free ascendant shard and unique ship it awards upon completion, then definitely for the fantastic cutscene that's sure to

			<description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
	It's a common thing for games to have daily missions to incentivize their players to return every day, and
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is no different. In
	<em>
	 WuWa
	</em>
	, Rovers must complete the daily activity if they wish to
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/wuthering-waves-how-get-astrite-wuwa-location-where-find/">
	 obtain 60 Astrite
	</a>
	. Those who missed a day will not get the resources back, so it's important to log in every day.

	daily activities, players may get one that tells them to
	<strong>
	 use 1 supply in

		Wuthering Waves

	</strong>
	. Although it feels abstract and unclear, this mission is one of the easiest to complete, so players should look forward to it.

	Noctemint, Dewvetch, and Lemongrass are all common flora that can be found all over Jinzhou. Unlike materials such as

	 Pecok Flower in
	 <em>
		Wuthering Waves
	 </em>

	, these three are considered materials for cooking and synthesis, so players don't have to worry about needing them for character ascension materials.

 <p>
	Meanwhile, Raw Meat is easily obtainable by hitting animals in the open world, such as rabbits, goats, and cows. Naturally, the bigger the animal, the more drops they give. These animals only need one hit to grant their drop, but players must ensure the character hits them as they will try to run away, and some characters don't auto-target the roaming creatures.

 <p>
	During their journey in
	<strong>
	 <em>
		Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
	 </em>
	</strong>
	, players will come up against many difficult foes. However, none are quite as difficult as the Iron Clefts found in the Glitz Pit. After
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-how-get-blimp-ticket-glitzville-ttyd/">
	 Mario finds the way to Glitzville
	</a>
	, he'll join the popular fighting arena and battle his way to the top.

 <p>
	Starting in the minor leagues, players should easily make their way up to their qualifying match at Rank 11. But when Mario goes up against the Ranked 10 Iron Adonis Twins, players will find themselves in an impossibly difficult scenario: their opponents' iron hides are too tough to pierce.

	With the help of one of

	 the game's partner abilities

	, players can get all the information they can about the two Iron Clefts.
	<strong>
	 Goombella's Tattle
	</strong>
	will reveal that no attack will work against their tough exterior, and suggests that, if true, the only way to beat one is to whack it with the other. Unfortunately, neither Mario nor any of his partners in the ring have the ability to do anything of the sort.

	<strong>
	 The Iron Adonis Twins are impossible to beat the first time around.
	</strong>
	Though it might seem counter-intuitive to some, the only way to progress in the game is to lose or flee from the fight. Mario will get knocked out and return to the minor league locker room, but not without earning his one-coin consolation prize.

	Yoshi excitedly joins the party and brings with him a winning strategy against the Iron Clefts. Players can immediately sign up for another ranked match to hop back into the ring and take Yoshi for a test drive. Facing off yet again, the Iron Adonis Twins start the match with some more trash talk before diving in.

		 <li>
			GreedFall focuses on rich storytelling akin to old-school BioWare games, with strong characters driving the plot effectively.
		 </li>
		 <li>
			The history of the protagonist's family, particularly De Sardet, remains shrouded in mystery and deserves more exploration.
		 </li>
		 <li>
			GreedFall 2: The Dying World should provide more extensive exposition on the protagonist's backstory to avoid past storytelling mistakes.

 <p>
	<strong>
	 <em>
		GreedFall
	 </em>
	</strong>
	is a very story-rich experience, as it prioritizes narrative above almost everything else. Of course, this is primarily on account of it being very similar to
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/6-most-timeless-bioware-games/">
	 old-school BioWare games
	</a>
	like
	<em>
	 Dragon Age: Origins
	</em>
	and
	<em>
	 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
	</em>
	, which were specifically designed to essentially be choose-your-own-adventure novels brought to life. In
	<em>
	 GreedFall
	</em>
	, its characters are its strong suit, which is precisely how its story and worldbuilding are as effective as they are. However,
	<em>
	 GreedFall
	</em>
	didn't get everything right from a storytelling perspective, as it neglected to delve too deep into the history of its protagonist's family.

	De Sardet is the central protagonist and player character of
	<em>
	 GreedFall
	</em>
	. As the Legate of New Serene, De Sardet travels to Teer Fradee along with their cousin, Constantin d'Orsay, in search of a cure for the Malichor disease their mother is plagued by and to establish a foothold for the Congregation of Merchants on the island. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of unanswered questions by the time the credits roll, and this is something
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/">
	 <em>
		GreedFall 2: The Dying World
	 </em>
	</a>
	could afford to remedy and also take note of when it comes to its own protagonist.

	GreedFall 2 Should Dive Deeper Into the History of the De Sardet Family
 </h3>
 <p>
	As
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/greedfall-2-dying-world-story-similarities-gacane-teer-fradee/">
	 the story of
	 <em>
		GreedFall
	 </em>
	</a>
	progresses, one thing becomes clear: the history of the De Sardet family is chock-full of secrets. In fact, it is eventually revealed that De Sardet isn't of noble descent at all and is instead a Teer Fradee native. This shocking truth is frequently hinted at throughout the story of
	<em>
	 GreedFall
	</em>
	until it is finally confirmed by Admiral Cabral after completing a certain quest.

	De Sardet's real mother was actually kidnapped by the Congregation of Merchants during her pregnancy, and De Sardet was then born on the Naut ship that was transporting them to the
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/greedfall-2-old-continent-lore-story-setting-explained/">
	 Old Continent of Gacane
	</a>
	. Upon their arrival, De Sardet's mother was taken prisoner and De Sardet was given to Prince d'Orsay's sister, Livie De Sardet. Livie then raised De Sardet as her own daughter, and De Sardet never knew any better.

 <p>
	Despite giving some backstory to De Sardet's true family, the
	<a href="https://gamerant.com/greedfall-2-de-sardet-returning-character-constantin/">
	 history of the De Sardet family
	</a>
	remains largely a mystery. As the story of
	<em>
	 GreedFall
	</em>
	's protagonist has shown, the De Sardet family's history is shrouded in mystery, founded upon secrets and lies that were largely ignored throughout the game's narrative.

	This is especially unfortunate considering how compelling of a character Princess Livie De Sardet is and how little is known about her and her husband, who most likely died before she began raising De Sardet. While it hasn't been confirmed whether any members of the De Sardet family will make an appearance in
	<em>
	 GreedFall 2
	</em>
	, there may not be a better time to divulge more of their history.

	Plenty of information was given about De Sardet's personal history in the first game, but the history of the family they grew up with was largely neglected. As such,

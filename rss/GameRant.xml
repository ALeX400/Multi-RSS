  Nicole is one of the first characters players get in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  . As a Support unit, her job is to improve the combat effectiveness of everyone in the squad. She isn't quite as flashy as the rest of the Cunning Hares, but it's hard to deny how valuable she can be.

  Support units are excellent in every gacha game, and they're no exception here. If you play according to your characters' specialties in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , you'll be able to steamroll through even the most difficult content the game has to offer. Here's a guide for Nicole that covers her best build and general tips on how to use her.

  Nicole has three main roles:
  <strong>
   shred the enemy's DEF
  </strong>
  , pull enemies together, and buff the squad's Ether DMG. The first two are universally useful, while the third one only really benefits herself as she is the only Ether unit so far. With that said, Nicole will be even more valuable once more factions and characters in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  are released.

 <p>
  As long as Nicole has enhanced bullets (marked by a bullet counter below her status bar), her abilities will shred up to 40% of an enemy's DEF for 3.5 seconds. Players should prioritize leveling up her passive and Special Attack, as these are where most of her value comes from.

 <p>
  When using Nicole, you should be constantly swapping characters around to maximize the uptime of her DEF shred. Build her Energy up, and use her EX Special whenever it's available to artificially increase the duration of her passive shred effect.

     Nicole's EX Special Attack always enables Quick Assists for the next character in the queue. When choosing your team, make sure to put her
     <strong>
      before your main DPS

     , especially if that DPS is Billy or anyone else who benefits from Quick Assists.

 <p>
  The best W-Engine for Nicole is
  <strong>
   Weeping Cradle
  </strong>
  , an S-rank engine that increases the energy regeneration of the user while they're off-field. Dealing attacks with Weeping Cradle equipped also increases the damage output of everyone in the squad. Energy management in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  is especially important for Support characters, so taking Weeping Cradle for Nicole should be a no-brainer.

 <p>
  Nicole's second best W-Engine is
  <strong>
   The Vault
  </strong>
  , which boosts the damage of all members whenever the user deals Ether damage with their Ultimate, EX Special Attack, or Chain Attack. It also buffs the wearer's energy regen on top of providing a nice energy regen stat by default. If you have neither of these, then the B-rank Reverb W-Engines will suffice.

  Drive Discs are the equivalent of Relics and Artifacts in

  . For Nicole, you'll want to prioritize getting the following stats in order:

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <ul>
  <li>
   Energy Regen
  </li>
  <li>
   Anomaly Proficiency
  </li>
  <li>
   Ether DMG
  </li>
  <li>
   ATK

 <p>
  Nicole doesn't need damage as much as other characters to be effective, but it doesn't hurt to have the extra offensive stats. With that said, you'll want to use the
  <strong>
   Swing Jazz
  </strong>
  set plus either
  <strong>
   Freedom Blues
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   Chaotic Metal
  </strong>
  for your off-set two-piece bonus. Swing Jazz boosts energy regen and the damage of all squad members. Meanwhile, you can get extra Anomaly Proficiency or Ether DMG from Freedom Blues and Chaotic Metal respectively.

  Bangboos in

  provide a variety of benefits. If you really want to double-down on energy regen for Nicole and your other characters, we highly suggest grabbing a Butlerboo. If you don't have one, any other Bangboo that synergizes with your team will have to do.

      Assassin's Creed games feature secret hideouts that serve as essential assets for the Brotherhood, providing storage, meditation spaces, and upgrades.
     </li>
     <li>
      Hideouts in the series vary in style and functionality, from the smoky, grand Galata HQ in Assassin's Creed: Revelations to the mobile Frye Train Hideout in Assassin's Creed: Syndicate.
     </li>
     <li>
      Base-building gameplay and community development mechanics have been used in some games, such as the Davenport Homestead in Assassin's Creed 3, to create unique stories and experiences.

 <p>
  An assassin's home may be in the streets, blended in among the crowds, but when a job goes foul, or they simply need a place to meditate on the creed, restock, or rest, a secret hideout becomes one of the Brotherhood's most essential assets. Typically, each
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  game allows the player to upgrade and develop their secret base, turning the neglected and run-down safehouse into a covert palace to store their equipment and hang out with their trophies.

 <p>
  This serves as a long-term side activity and storyline that gives players something to spend their money on besides pointier daggers or dye jobs for their hoods. An Assassin (or Hidden Ones) bureau provides effectively the same services and gameplay functions as a hideout, but unlike the series' hideouts, the player does not have a hand in their development and thus will not be counted.

 <p>
  Smokey, grand, and housed within a mixture of stone and grand architecture, the Galata hideout is exactly what someone might imagine when evoking an assassin hideout. The well-placed assassin headquarters, as seen in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed: Revelations
   </em>
  </strong>
  , is connected to several locations across Constantinople via a secret tunnel system and also houses some of the most important texts and relics relating to the history of assassins from around the world.

 <p>
  The library, perfumed with incense and furnished with fine-quality Ottoman items like rugs, pillows, and tapestries, all lit under a surprising amount of natural light, is the perfect place for Ezio to gaze back into the past at his predecessors, thematically appropriate for a game about coming to terms with one's own mortality and incoming winter years. There is less base-building gameplay than previously seen, as the Constantinople franchise was, for once, functioning before Ezio's arrival.

 <p>
  The Victorian era, depicted in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed Syndicate
   </em>
  </strong>
  , was undergoing a steam-powered revolution, and that is exactly what the Frye base does in-game as well. Rather than being in one fixed location, the hideout train circles the vast London metropolis and acts as a mobile base to plan operations, refill ammunition or consumables, or pull a pint in the train's very own pub. Like many British dwellings, the hideout is a little cramped due to all the rooms being squeezed between each carriage.
 </p>

 <p>
  While the idea of rolling a means of transportation into a safehouse sounds like a winning idea, in practice, the hideout's constant movement is more of a pain than it is useful. Getting onto the train without resorting to fast travel is tricky, and it is a wonder why Ubisoft didn't program the train to slow down upon either of the Frye twins' approaches. Nevertheless, the cozy, compact, but a little snug makes the train a chuffing classic.

  Perhaps because, unlike its predecessor,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood

  <strong>
  </strong>
  has the player spending their money to build up and garner influence across the entire map, which happens to be Rome, the then

  capital of Europe. It is not as well-hidden as other locations in the series, but it is well-placed. Its island puts it out of reach for most guards and is surrounded by services such as the blacksmith right next door.

  Though not as grand as Ezio's former home, the family villa, the layout is efficiently planned and laid out in step with Roman tradition, which should please fans of Roman or Italian history. Besides, property prices in the big city will always be much higher than in the countryside. Although the base is a bit sparse and flat, it is an efficient design, and who wouldn't appreciate spending time in a structure with magnificent Romanesque vaulted ceilings? Most impressive of all is the ritual room, which is used to anoint new master assassins when they come into their own.

   <em>
    Assassin's Creed 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  may not be the series' fan favorite, but its story of colonial power, rebellion, and the rise of a new nation is cleverly told through two narratives. In the main story, as is tradition in Assassin's Creed, Conner meets most of the significant figures of the time, from Benjamin Franklin to George Washington. The player gets to see how the yearning for simple freedom in the face of tyranny does not come from its leaders (who are, more often than not, just as interested in oppression as the kings of the old world) but grows in the hearts of the smallfolk.

 <p>
  This second story plays out through the base building mechanics of the Davenport Homestead. Rather than spending coins to make upgrades as before, Conner can complete quests to draw newcomers in. These people provide services and enhancement components to the homestead, and over time, a grassroots community arises full of familiar faces. The homestead also has a neat basement hideout with a hidden lever and sliding wall entrance with all the expected amenities and showcasing options.

  , the estate on Great Inagua, an island in the Caribean Bahamas, formally owned by an unfortunate Templar, serves as Edward Kenway's navel hideaway. The above area is a posh living space that can be decked out with the finest decor, thanks to a little pirating finesse. Just below is a cavern that seems to exist purely to store filthy great piles of loot with a back exit that leads to a shoreside cove.

  Great Inagua is a great home away from home (Edward's true home, of course, being the Jackdaw and the high sea). The island is expansive and a wonderful place to explore for those missing the sturdiness of land. Plus, the armor set behind bars beside Edward's planning desk is a surefire motivator to keep plundering the high seas in search of those elusive Templar keys.

  Grand, iconic, and the gold standard for the Assassin HQ: Villa Auditore in
  <strong>
   <em>

  </strong>
  is perfect within and without. Surrounding the magnificent estate is Monteriggioni, a small town in dire need of patronage and town planning. Embodying the spirit of the Renaissance, Ezio acts not as a ruler but as the town's benevolent investor, an act that not only benefits the people but rewards him by unlocking new equipment upgrades and beautiful works of art for his home, Villa Auditore.

 <p>
  Once restored to its former glory, the villa is almost a work of art. Additionally, each upgrade rewards Ezio with the ability to reach new secrets. Best of all, the secret hidden behind the bookcase in the study, Sanctuary, serves as a museum of the assassins' greatest heroes and their artifacts. This hidden area is not only beautiful but offers some of the series' most tantalizing assassin lore. Villa Auditore gives Ezio a reason to return regularly and not just collect his paycheck. Visiting the hideout is a pleasure akin to exploring a work of art from the inside.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout 76
   </strong>
  </em>
  . From taking on endless waves of Ghouls in Radiation Rumble to helping a beverage-obsessed robot make tea in Tea Time, there are constantly events going on that players dive into.

  <strong>
   Hoard Events are pretty common. They are also fairly easy to complete.
  </strong>
  Sometimes, when traveling to a Hoard Event, you'll load in right next to the hoard. This is great for getting the event done quickly. However, for the most part, there are four possible locations that could contain the hoard. You'll need to travel to these locations to find it.

 <p>
  While this may seem a bit tedious, there is a simple way around it. If there is a Mirelurk hoard in the Mire region, then the hoard will probably be located at Highland Marsh. This is because Highland Marsh is a Mirelurk spawn location.

 <p>
  By finding out where specific enemy groups can typically be found, it's possible to narrow down the search to one or two locations. This way, you won't have to visit all four locations to find the hoard. This may take some time or even a little bit of research, but the more you play, the more you'll figure out where certain enemies can be found.

  When traveling to a Skyline Valley hoard, a message will pop up asking the player to search various locations to find the hoard. However, if you open up the map,

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  modder has created a useful in-game compendium mod for the game that contains comprehensive data about a huge number of planets and systems. The mod launched via the official, Bethesda-supported
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  Creations mod repository.

 <p>
  Though
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  received positive reviews during the game's original release period, many players expressed dissatisfaction with what appeared to be the limits of Bethesda's vision of space exploration, particularly compared with rival space games like
  <em>
   Elite Dangerous
  </em>
  or the current versions of
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  . But in the wake of the launch of the
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  <em>
   Shattered Space
  </em>
  DLC
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  the game is experiencing a resurgence of interest from the community.

 <p>
  That interest is helped by the release of official modding tools for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  by Bethesda, making the game significantly easier to alter by modders. One such mod is the recently released
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  Compendium mod, which adds a massive source of information to the in-game interface, available to players for calling up without having to resort to an external website.

  The mod allows players to directly search for planets in the database, as well as filter them to find what they're looking for, such as when hunting for the rarest
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  resources. According to Ideki (via a post from their Reddit account, Zorglub01), the mod's functionality is limited compared to the website, and does not yet contain a complete list of organic resources available directly from a planet's surface via manual gathering as opposed to outpost-based automated extraction. Ideki said they are working on adding it, and are 86% complete as of July 6, 2024. Support for
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  on Xbox is also planned.

 <p>
  Reaction from players to the update was largely positive, with some exploration-focused players celebrating the ability to consult planetary data without having to leave the game. Others asked whether it was possible for the compendium to hide information that players hadn't discovered themselves in-game, but Ideki responded that while a "dynamic" compendium that grows as players explore is their goal, it isn't currently possible due to the technical limitations of the engine and its interaction with mods. They said that Bethesda is willing to "look into" making it possible, but it would be dependent on the company's availability.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Star-Studded Cast
  </strong>
  banner in Zenless Zone Zero serves as the standard Gacha system where players can obtain a variety of high-rarity characters and W-Engines. While they may not at all times amount to limited-time banner characters or W-engines, it is an excellent way for players to build a robust roster, while considering synergies between certain characters. The pity system ensures that even with less than optimal luck, players will eventually obtain high-rarity items.

  The inclusion of a diverse array of 5-star characters and W-Engines means there is something valuable for every type of player, whether you need a powerful attacker, a steadfast defender, or a versatile support character. This guide will delve into the mechanics of the banner, including the pity system, drop rates, it's pool, and some other benefits this banner brings.

However, there are additional details such as soft-pity which is not shown right away, and as such here's all players will need to know as far as this standard banner's pity and drop rates:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Soft Pity: The chances of pulling a 5-star Signal increases significantly after 75 pulls.
  </li>
  <li>
   Hard Pity: Guaranteed 5-star Agent or W-Engine at 90 pulls.

 <ul>

  </li>
  <li>
   4-star (A-Rank) Signal: 9.4% (4.7% for Agents, and 4.7% for W-Engines)
  </li>
  <li>
   3-star (B-Rank) W-Engines: 94.3% (There are no B-rank Agents)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":694} -->

 <p>
  It's worth noting that, players generally have equal chance of receiving a character, or w-engine from this banner, meaning that if players have gotten S-Rank character for example, it doesn't mean that it is guarenteed to be a S-Rank W-Engine next time. That being the case, it may take quite a while until players get their desired characters or w-engines unless they are very lucky. However, there are some exceptions to this, being the first 50 pulls, and the 300 pull S-Rank Agent selector.

 <p>
  Instead of implementing a separate beginner banner like
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  had, The Star-Studded Cast banner incorporates a one-time only early pity system within the standard banner, where players are guaranteed a 5-star character within the first 50 pulls. Furthermore, the first 50 pull are 20% discounted, meaning it actually takes only 40 Master Tapes to reach pull, when players do 10 pulls at a time.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":965} -->

 <p>
  If players get lucky and get the character before their 50 pull completed, the pity will reset to the standard banner pity, being 90, and players won't be guarenteed another 5-star character at their 50th pull. On the other hand, the 20% Discount pulls still last until first 50 pulls are completed.

 <p>
  One of the most significant features of the Star-Studded Cast banner is the 300 pull character selector, quite similar to what
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  has.
  <em>
  </em>
  Once players have accumulated a total of 300 pulls on this banner (which also includes the first 50 pulls within it) they will be able to choose the 5-star standard character they wish to get, and will be given this character directly regardless of their current pity.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":965} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  Additionally, this selector doesn't reset the pity, as it is separate from the pulls, and not simply a guarantee for the next pity's reach. Unfortunately however, it is also one-time only, meaning that once completed, players won't be able to start over the counter for another 300 pulls. Nevertheless, while it may take a while to get to 300 pulls, especially as F2P, it is a good opportunity for players to have a character they may have not been able to obtain.

  Star-Studded Cast, currently includes 6 S-rank Agents, and 9 A-rank Agents. While this is subject to change, typically S-Rank characters remain as is for a long time as limited-characters don't often come to standard banners, while players can expect A-Rank pool to be updated whenever a new A-rank character is released.

This effect can trigger once every 12s. The cooldown for each type of attack is independent of others. Passive effects of the same name do not stack.

  New additions to
  <em>
   World of Warcraft
  </em>
  after the Cataclysm expansion include several new factions, and many of them have the enchants, trinkets, and gear that players crave. Whether it's for raid optimization or bragging rights, there are several good reasons players should get to Exalted with the Guardians of Hyjal.

  There are currently very few daily quests for the Guardians of Hyjal, but there are still quests in the Mount Hyjal zone for level 80 players to help them get started. The new and exciting dungeons can also be a source of reputation, but there's a process to follow to get there.

  Some players have seen this zone before, but as part of a raid in the Caverns of Time as opposed to an open zone. Players took part in the epic battle against Archimonde himself to save the world tree from Archimonde. In the previous expansions, the geographic location of Mount Hyjal was visible in northern Kalimdor on all the maps, but it wasn't open for gameplay.

  The Guardians of Hyjal are similar to the Cenarion Circle, a faction that was also part of the original game including the
  <em>
   Wrath of the Lich King
  </em>
  expansion. They're made up entirely of Druids who are either Tauren or Night Elves. Their allies include the Ancients, gigantic animals that are also powerful earth spirits, and famous heroes like Ysera, the Green Dragon Aspect, and Malfurion Stormrage.

  What follows is a short trip to Moonglade, a zone that's usually exclusive to Druids and occasionally opens up during special seasonal events like the Lunar Festival. From here, the player secures one-time transportation to Nordrassil on the back of a chatty green dragon, who narrates some of the recent history and actions of the Guardians on the trip.

 <p>
  There's a nice quest chain that leads across the zone, and this is enough to get to Friendly but it won't get you to Revered. The next step is to grind up to level 85 and run the Lost City of Tolvir, the Halls of Origination, and Grim Batol in Normal mode or any Heroic Cataclysm dungeons while wearing the tabard.

  There's only one Daily Quest in Phase One of Cataclysm, "Vigilance On Wings." This is located in The Regrowth, centrally located in Mount Hyjal, and the quest chain that started in Nordrassil eventually leads there. After you finish the quest for the first time, it becomes a repeatable daily and rewards 250 reputation points.

     Hyjal is one of the new zones for level 80 players, so most of these items aren't BiS for the endgame, but some of the items are still important. It's not just a question of decent gear or fun new trinkets from the Quartermaster, but also the enchantments and buffs available.

 <p>
  The nostalgic value of questing through Mount Hyjal as an individual player as opposed to being part of a phased-in raid group makes it fun anyway. The cinematics and the characters involved have been a part of Azeroth's lore since ancient times, which refers to the old RTS games of the 1990s as much as Azerothian history.

 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   Arcanum of Hyjal
  </strong>
  is the most important item on the list and is the new BiS enchantment for the character's headpiece. It requires a Revered reputation, adds 60 Intellect and 35 Critical Strike rating, and costs 150 gold. Even after leveling past everything else, this is the enchantment players have to come back for no matter how epic their gear is.

 <p>
  Some are best-in-slot and part of a raid or PvP build, while others are just nice to have. The
  <strong>
   Sly Fox Jerkin
  </strong>
  , a leather chest piece, has two gem sockets and improves Critical Strike rating, so it's better for leveling and PvE. The
  <strong>
   Belt of the Ferocious Wolf
  </strong>
  is one of the few heavy armor items on the list, and also increases Critical Strike, so decent item for Warriors and Paladins.

  The Prince of her Dreams quest will be unlockable by the player after the main character separates from Aogami upon returning to their world. Specifically, they will be able to take on this quest when they return to school. There, the character will take this quest from Miyazu, an individual the player should be familiar with, especially if they played

 <p>
  The Prince of Her Dreams is an interesting quest that seems to have a role in the story later on when it comes to Miyazu. Miyazu is a student from the same school as the player, but she constantly feels ill. However, sometimes she has dreams of a Prince, and that makes her feel a lot better after waking up. This Prince, however, isn’t a regular Prince Charming on a white horse; instead, he sails on a boat.

 <p>
  Miyazu wants to learn more about this and maybe figure out who this individual is, so with that, she tasks the player with discovering who her the Prince of her dreams is, and recommends the player ask someone apart from the Occult Research club.

  To find him, the player simply has to be on the Jounin high school’s second floor. The player will go right from their classroom and then again into a corner on the right. There, they will find a lone male student who has an answer for Miyazu’s odd dreams she keeps having, probably a member of the occult club.

  The student is unsure at first who this prince could be, but ends up telling the player that the Prince sailing a boat through the night is most likely none other than Khonsu, the Egyptian God of the Moon. He tells the player that this god helps cure a Princess who was suffering from a disease and then sails back to the moon.

  The main reward, however, is 3 cans of jelly. These can be sold in the Cadaver’s Hollow for 400 macca each, which in total amounts to 1200 macca, which isn’t much but can be of use either way.

      <title>Black Myth: Wukong Hands-On Preview – Carry a Big Stick</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Black Myth: Wukong
   </em>
  </strong>
  initially seemed too good to be true. Its beautiful graphics, fluid animations, and fast-paced gameplay were so impressive that a groundswell formed on social media, and the title jumped to the top of many gamers’ most anticipated lists. Of course, those thoughts of the game being just a tech demo lingered, but over time, developer Game Science showed more of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  and it became clear the title was very real. Now, having played the game for a few hours, I’m happy to report that, based on this first hands-on,
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  is one to watch out for.

  Black Myth: Wukong's Combat is Fast and Furious
 </h2>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  might have some similarities with the Souls-like subgenre, it is not a full Souls-like. Players will use shrines to perform actions like replenish heals, log a checkpoint, and fast travel throughout the world, but
  <em>
   Black Myth
  </em>
  has as much in common with FromSoftware’s titles as it does a character action game. For starters, the combat in the game is extremely fast-paced. Dodging is essential for survival, with no traditional options for blocking or parrying attacks. And where a Souls-like might feel more open in its construction, the first few hours of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  appeared fairly linear.

 <p>
  Whether Black Myth: Wukong can be classified as a Souls-like is beside the point; this is a game that will appeal to fans of those brutally difficult titles and series like
  <em>
   Devil May Cry
  </em>
  as well. The player character, Sun Wukong, evolves through a standard skill tree and with the abilities he acquires, rather than through spending points to buff stats like Strength and Endurance. Combo strings are essential for getting big damage on a foe, and mixing in charged heavy attacks allows players to express their skill in different ways.

 <p>
  Sun Wukong’s staff is his main offensive weapon, capable of flashy combos with a press of the light attack button. Holding the heavy attack button can charge up a stronger attack that, in its basic form, has Wukong slamming the staff down on an enemy. As players mix up their combos and charged attacks, they will fill up a focus meter and eventually earn a focus point. These points can be spent on an even more damaging attack that can be timed at the end of a combo as a pseudo-finisher.

 <p>
  It’s an elaborate ballet of dodges and attacks that makes
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  so addicting - taking risks to get in damage and then retreating when necessary. Things get more interesting with the introduction of spells and transformations, the latter of which can completely change up gameplay. I only had access to a few spells during the preview, one that allowed Sun Wukong to freeze an enemy in place and get some free damage, and the other that turned him invisible for a sneak attack (or to bypass a group of baddies altogether). Spells cost mana, though, so even though a cooldown relegates them, players won’t be able to use them infinitely. It’s a smart balancing move since the freezing spell (called Immobilize) works on bosses.

  Black Myth: Wukong is Stunning to Look At
 </h2>
 <p>
  Game Science has adapted
  <em>
   Journey to the West
  </em>
  to great effect, crafting some truly memorable enemy types that run the gamut from grotesque to beautiful. But it's the boss battles that are the most eye-catching. During my three hours with the game, I came across at least 5 bosses (and some mini-bosses): some favored offense, others defense, but most rewarded a mix of both. Pattern recognition is essential for success, but a stamina meter ensures that players are not simply dodging forever. Similarly, attacks cost stamina, so it’s important to leave a little fuel in the tank to get clear after unleashing a devastating combo or charged attack.

 <p>
  While the boss fights are a clear highlight of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  , both for their design and how they mix up the gameplay, they are also essential for the Monkey King’s evolution, as defeating key bosses will unlock Transformations. Essentially, Transformations let the player embody the spirit of a boss, taking on a stylized look inspired by that boss and wielding a version of the staff inspired by them as well. For example, after beating a fire-wielding boss, Wukong gained access to a Transformation that gave him a fire staff that inflicts burn damage and has a dash-strike move that closes large distances quickly.

  So, while there may not be builds in the traditional sense, players can approach
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  in different ways based on their spell and Transformation choice. They can also take things a step further by spending skill points on different staff forms (switched using the d-pad) that have their own attack patterns. For the preview, we unlocked the Tower Form, which has a nifty move where Sun Wukong climbs to the top of his staff and stands out of harm’s way before doing a flashy flip and slam move. It seems likely that most players will unlock all of the skills by the game’s end, but those different staff forms seem to do enough to mix up combat and allow for unique approaches to varied enemies.

  The best compliment that can be paid after any hands-on preview is that it leaves you wanting more.
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  did that in all the best ways. I wanted to see more of the evocative world that lay ahead, improve my skills and challenge some of the optional bosses I saw but quickly trounced me, and to experience how the combat evolves over time. Just this small taste was enough to prove that the initial promise of
  <em>
   Black Myth: Wukong
  </em>
  – a beautiful game with impressive combat – was not a trick. This is the real deal and it’s easily one of my most anticipated games releasing in the latter part of 2024.

  <strong>
   Square Enix
  </strong>
  has made tons of sequels in their biggest franchises, like
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dragon Quest
  </em>
  . None of them were direct sequels, though. For example,
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  did not act as a direct sequel to
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 6
  </em>
  . It wasn’t until the early 2000s that the company started to make direct sequels to some of these games.

 <p>
  One of the first ones was
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10-2,
  </em>
  which directly continued the adventures of Yuna. That’s one example of a sequel, but Square Enix has also made several prequels to further expand on original games. Many Square Enix franchises feature prequel games, but some stand out for being slightly better than others.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dragon Quest Treasures
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a prequel adventure to
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11: Echoes of an Elusive Age
  </em>
  , starring one of the party members, Erik. In
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11
  </em>
  , Erik talks about adventuring with his sister, Mia, when they were younger and before she was cursed to a motionless hell. It’s a dark backstory, but
  <em>
   Dragon Quest Treasures
  </em>
  is a more whimsical game without a lot of heartache.

 <p>
  Players will dive into dungeons, fight monsters in real-time, and get tons of loot in the process. It’s not going to answer any huge questions about Mia, but it is nice to have a game wherein Erik can be seen happily questing with his sister. Of the many spin-offs in the series, this one is still worth picking up on Switch even if players have not touched
  <em>
   Dragon Quest 11
  </em>
  .

  takes place in the near future of Earth when it is plagued by a third World War. Resources are bad, so a mandate to explore the cosmos is set forth, kicking off the entire series. The game takes place hundreds of years before the first game on the SNES, and it is the only game in the series to be set this far back in the timeline.

  Players can think of the
  <em>
   Star Ocean
  </em>
  series as a more anime-inspired Japanese take on
  <em>
   Star Trek
  </em>
  , where exploration and communication between worlds is key to humanity’s survival. This knowledge isn’t necessary to enjoy
  <em>
   Star Ocean: The Last Hope
  </em>
  , though, as it is yet another fine action RPG that blends fantasy and sci-fi tropes together. It has received various editions and upgrades over the years, most recently in 2017 with a big 4K remaster on consoles like the PS4.

    Life Is Strange: Before the Storm

  </em>
  was the first game that Deck Nine worked on for Square Enix after they reformed from Idol Minds. This was also the start of Deck Nine taking over the series primarily for Don't Nod Entertainment. It was a prequel to the first game, showcasing what Chloe was up to before Max returned to town.

 <p>
  It featured a good story that illustrated how Chloe was much more than just a victim. She was a person with strong feelings for a love she lost, mirroring the journey Max went through in trying to save her in the original
  <em>
   Life is Strange
  </em>
  . There aren’t many weird powers to speak of in this title, but the game does feature a quirky dialogue-choice system that allows for a deeper look into what makes Chloe who she is.

   <em>
    Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes place approximately ten years prior to the story of the debut game and does a great deal to set up the events that are destined to transpire later in the series. It tells the tale of three Keyblade wielders who are trying to become Masters of their craft. Terra, Aqua, and Ventus are training under Master Eraqus, but the only one to move on is Aqua. The game is divided into three campaigns, with each character uncovering different secrets and engaging in unique activities throughout each world they visit.

 <p>
  It was a good prequel to show how things got muddled in the first place, showcasing how Master Xehanort was always the big bad behind the shadows, even as Sora was taking flight in the first game. It does retcon a few things, like how Riku and Sora are touched with Keyblade magic, but a lot of prequels do similar things to some degree. The gameplay featured is similar to that of the console games. It is an action RPG, but it features a new engaging mechanic that allows players to combo skills together and craft new forms of magic, allowing for a lot of experimentation.

  showcased how good of a character Zack was in the original game. The entire prequel takes place seven years before
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  , and it takes a look at how Zack rose through the ranks within the SOLDIER program at Shinra. He goes through a lot of heartache following the betrayal of multiple mentors, like Angeal and Sephiroth. Despite his low points, Zack was always able to keep a grin on his face and a positive attitude in his mind. Zack is a genuinely caring person who does not go out of his way to seek power.

 <p>
  The game ends on a sour note, however, as Zack is gunned down by Shinra officers, but this heroic act was all to save Cloud, setting up the events of
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 7
  </em>
  in the process. It was a bittersweet end for a genuinely engaging action RPG on the PSP, which still looks great natively to this day. That said, the
  <em>
   Crisis Core -Final Fantasy 7- Reunion
  </em>
  remaster is currently the best way to experience Zack’s story.

  takes place hundreds of years before the first game and is not directly tied to anything besides the wider Norse mythology. Ragnarok is on the brink of eruption, and a young girl, Alicia, is the only one standing in its way. Inside her are warriors who form a Persona-like bond with Alicia’s soul, which is a bit hard to explain, but that's essentially the gist of it.

 <p>
  The game is set on a 2D plane, and there are puzzle platforming segments to engage with, too. Battles have a tactical edge to them, as players can run around the battlefield to avoid attacks while planning their own stationary counters. It’s one of the hardest tactical games Square Enix has ever produced, and only the strongest of strategic minds will be able to get through it.

  The beauty of using a handheld gaming device like the
  <strong>
   Steam Deck
  </strong>
  is the ability to take and play games anywhere. The convenience of playing anywhere around the home or taking it on a long journey can't be understated. However, some games can be more demanding on the battery life and potentially switch the machine off. Thankfully, there's a free plugin called
  <strong>
   Steamback
  </strong>
  created by Geeksville. The Steamback plugin creates snapshots of the game for you to restore. It's also a great way to revert to a game's save if you regret any decisions using a title's default one-save file system, like losing all your Runes in
  <em>
   Elden Ring.
  </em>

  A prompt from the Steamback app will appear when exiting a game to indicate that a snapshot/save is registered. To revert back to the snapshot saved by Steamback click on
  <strong>
   Revert
  </strong>
  and the game will run from the last saved snapshot. A snapshot can be removed by selecting
  <strong>
   Undo.
  </strong>

 <p>
  That's everything needed for reverting games using the Steamback's revert function. The app should create multiple saves to choose from.

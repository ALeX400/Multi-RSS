  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  will have one of the most complex combat systems in the RPG genre on release thanks, in part, to it being based on the Fifth Edition of
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  ' ruleset. Though there are some major changes to adapt the formula to a video game, most strategies work in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  as they do in the TTRPG – including the benefits of a well-rounded party.

  It's a good idea to have one or two melee-focused party members, a perfect slot for the Fighter Class to fill in. The best Fighter build in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  is one that takes the class' melee prowess and turns it into a close-quarters devastator via the Battle Master subclass.

   : A year after its launch, Baldur's Gate 3 remains firmly at the forefront of fans' minds as one of the best RPGs ever made – and it's still attracting new players. Now that we understand what makes the best Fighter build in BG3, helping to explain the basic concepts of the class and how it works can be a big aid for getting new players into the game. To help players unfamiliar with how the game works trying it out for the first time, this guide has been updated with several beginner-friendly tips and explanations. Among these updates to the best Fighter build below are new details on the basics of Class and Skill Proficiencies, your choice of Fighter Subclasses, what leveling up unlocks for both the Fighter Class and the Battle Master subclass, and a brief overview of the best Fighter ability scores.

  The Fighter is a class that's meant to be played up-close-and-personal. Whether that's through sheer brutality or magical assistance is up to the player – no matter their choice of Subclass, Fighters gain a few abilities that set them apart from other melee-oriented classes like the Barbarian. At Level 1, Second Wind grants a Bonus Action Self-Heal ability once per combat, then at Level 2, players get an Action Surge to grant an extra Action once each combat. Later on, Fighters gain better Saving Throws, Extra Attacks, and Fighting Styles, too.

 <p>
  Players choose their Fighter Subclass at Level 3, which can completely change how combat is approached. Though Fighters may lack the raw power of a Barbarian, the class' ability to stay alive in combat and control the battlefield from the front lines makes them a great addition to a party lacking melee specialists.

  What Makes Battle Master the Best Fighter Subclass?
 </h3>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "Battle Masters are paragons of tactical superiority, combining combat maneuvers and experience in the field to dominate every fight."

 <p>
  The Battle Master Fighter build is named after the Subclass that players select at Level 3, which grants a powerful new set of skills to the Fighter that rely on a new resource: Superiority Die, used to fuel Battle Maneuvers. At Level 3, Fighters can unlock three Battle Maneuvers from a list of six, most of which have both a ranged and melee version that unlock together.

 <p>
  These Battle Maneuvers, paired with the Fighter's base Action Surge and Second Wind actions, make them a serious force in melee combat – as long as they actually hit the enemy, that is. They are great at controlling enemy locations with certain Battle Maneuvers, rooting them in place or pushing them away, and can also be a source of minor buffs for the party and debuffs for enemies.

 <p>
  Battle Master Fighters rarely spent too much time away from direct melee combat, and in a party with ranged damage and support sources, they should spend as much time as they can up-close and personal with enemies. It's perfectly fine to start a fight with a shot from a Crossbow, but when Initiative rolls, be prepared to close that distance quickly.

  Best Battle Master Battle Maneuvers (Superiority Dice)
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Battle Master's unique mechanic is Battle Maneuvers. Upon reaching Level 3 and selecting the Battle Master subclass, players gain access to melee and ranged attacks that offer powerful additional effects. When using these abilities, though, they use one of the Fighter's limited Superiority Dice. Each day, players get eight Dice to spend on these abilities, each of which uses just one. Of the choices presented to players, Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, and Riposte are the ones players should prioritize first, though Riposte can be replaced with Rally if your party lacks healing. Rally benefits parties more at low levels as the total amount of HP that the Fighter gives to an ally doesn't improve. Maneuvering Attack, too, can be useful for parties without a way to reliably get squishy allies out of range of opportunity attacks, but it's a bit more situational.

  Best BG3 Fighter Race: Half-Orc
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Half-Orc race comes with a few notable racial abilities that help the best BG3 Fighter build become even more powerful and resilient. The race comes with Darkvision, and proficiency in Intimidation, but its real draw for Fighters comes from the Savage Attacks and Relentless Endurance passive features.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":10,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":10,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":948} -->

 <p>
  Savage Attacks lets players add an additional Damage Dice on top of their normal critical hit damage, but only with melee weapon attacks. Relentless Endurance prevents the Fighter from going down, restoring them to 1 HP upon reaching 0, only once per long rest. For the Battle Master build, which is a close-range melee build, these two abilities let the character persist through death and absolutely pile damage onto opponents with critical hits – just be sure to pick up abilities and gear that reduces the Critical Hit threshold.

 <p>
  A good alternative to the Half-Orc is the Githyanki, which gain Githyanki Psyonics to further enhance their ability to control the battlefield (and jump around from enemy to enemy as if on a trampoline). However, the Gold Dwarf or Dragonborn races are decent Racial good choices, too, thanks to inherent defensive that benefit melee characters considerably.

  Best BG3 Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting
 </h3>
 <p>
  Upon creating a Fighter character in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , players are asked which Fighting Style they would like to follow. There are six choices: Archery, Defence, Duelling, Great Weapon Fighting, Protection, and Two-Weapon Fighting. These all have their own bonuses and drawbacks, but ultimately the Great Weapon Fighting style is best because it simply increases the baseline amount of damage every Two-Handed weapon can do. However, the Defence style is good for Fighters who will spend a lot of time in close combat.

 <h3 id="best-fighter-backgrounds-in-bg3-soldier-or-outlander">
  Best Fighter Backgrounds in BG3: Soldier or Outlander
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Fighter's focus on Strength and Constitution gives them a big boost to Ability Checks that rely on those stats. As such, gaining proficiency with Athletics and Intimidation via the Soldier background is the best route to go to further improve two skills that the class already exemplifies. Just be prepared to muscle your way through dialogue and RP encounters, foregoing alternative solutions, to earn Inspiration.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":12,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":12,"nbrPlacementsScanned":12,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":948} -->

 <p>
  However, Fighters can also gain proficiency in Athletics via the Outlander background, which replaces Intimidation with Survival. Its Inspiration mostly comes from achieving feats in the wilderness, like felling a large beast, or finding a mythical location.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Athletics and Survival are great for exploring the world, while Athletics and Intimidation is better for an in-your-face Fighter. Either way, Fighters have plenty of opportunities to naturally trigger Inspriation from these two Backgrounds.

  Best BG3 Fighter Skill Proficiency Choices: Perception and Intimidation (or Insight)

  Fighters get a choice of two skills from a list of eight, but both of the recommended backgrounds above cover two of the choices, leaving six to choose from.

 <p>
  If you go with the Soldier background, proficiency in Athletics and Intimidation are already granted. In this case, choose instead to go with Insight and Perception, as the game gives players a lot of dialogue checks involving these two skills. Choosing the Outlander background grants Survival instead of Intimidation, so if you go this route, choose Perception and Intimidation for your starting skills.

  Barbarian Multiclass – Fighter 11/Barbarian 1
 </h3>
 <p>
  Choosing the Barbarian class to multiclass into as a Fighter is important for one reason: Rage. Rage is an incredibly powerful ability that lets a character use a bonus action to make an additional attack on their turn, but it requires a bonus action to activate.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":21,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":21,"nbrPlacementsScanned":21,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":265} -->
 <p>
  As a Level 11 Fighter, players can attack three times in a single turn, but by putting one point into barbarian, they can attack four times minimum every turn – as long as a bonus action isn't used for another ability. It's also viable to put three points into Barbarian to be able to select a subclass, but the character will lose out on the Fighter's third attack granted at Level 11.
 </p>

 <h3 id="cleric-multiclass-ndash-fighter-11-cleric-1">
  Cleric Multiclass – Fighter 11/Cleric 1
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Cleric multiclass option for Fighters is good for similar reasons as the Barbarian multiclass. Fighters unlock their third attack at Level 11, leaving just one level to put into another class. The Cleric, specifically the War Domain subclass, is an excellent choice because it unlocks a fourth attack, and grants access to some basic Cleric support spells.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":21,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":21,"nbrPlacementsScanned":21,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1033} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  It's not a bad idea to go with the Eldritch Knight subclass instead of the Battle Master subclass for this multiclass choice, as Cleric spells will complement the Eldritch Knight's toolkit. Just be sure to select War Domain, as it lets the Cleric take a bonus action to attack an extra time on their turn.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Wuthering Waves
   </strong>
  </em>
  ' has garnered a substantial following from the open-world gacha community since its debut in May. This excitement has only grown with the release of the latest patch, Thaw of Eons, which introduced the icy region of Mt. Firmament and new 5-star Resonators, including Jinhsi, Changli, Xiangli Yao, and Zhezhi. Interestingly, though Patch 1.1 included Act 7, several quality-of-life changes, and new Echoes, the game's co-op mode remained unchanged despite receiving criticism.

  ' current co-op mode has a wealth of pros and cons. While some believe it's a slight improvement over HoYoverse games like
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , it's evident that there is still room for improvement. Strikingly, a recent rumor surrounding Kuro Games' title suggests that the co-op feature is set to undergo a rework.

  Wuthering Waves Co-Op Changes May Finally Grant Players Their Desired Co-Op Freedom
 </h3>
 <p>
  Anime-style gacha games such as
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  include co-op modes, but these features often lack depth. This makes sense considering that these games typically cater to solo gameplay. However, this hasn't diminished the community's long-standing desire for more in-depth co-op features. As it stands, the mode is usable, but may not be very popular due to the limited options.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  Presently, players unlock "Co-op Mode" at Union Level 22. Up to three players can join a friend's world, allowing them to explore the map, collect materials, farm Echoes, and defeat bosses together. Nevertheless, many features, such as the ability for everyone to claim chests, do puzzles, and access single-player story quests, are not available in cooperative mode. More significantly, players have limited parties when entering co-op, which can lead to them avoiding the feature altogether.

  Razor_Language, an X (formerly Twitter) user known for leaks and rumors about
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , has suggested that Kuro Games is overhauling the co-op mode. The update may allow players to separate their teams and use all three characters on their team. Although they caution that this information should be taken "with a grain of salt," the reaction to the potential changes has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic, especially considering that
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  has yet to implement such changes in nearly four years of being out.

 <p>
  While the introduction of a more robust co-op mode is seen as a positive development, there are concerns that it might impact
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  ' optimization, especially for mobile users. Since the game's launch, players have reported issues such as FPS drops, system UI lag, and crashes. As such, the idea of a more intensive co-op mode is appealing, but it must be implemented carefully to avoid exacerbating these problems.

 <p>
  Regardless, even if these changes do occur, there has been no official confirmation or set date for their implementation. If these rumors turn out to be true, hopefully, Kuro Games can learn from the mistakes of past co-op modes in open-world gacha games, such as
  <em>
   Tower of Fantasy
  </em>
  , to develop a system that functions well in the world of Solaris-3. In the meantime, players can watch
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves

      The FromSoftware boss suggested the company's next projects might be smaller than Elden Ring.

      Miyazaki also revealed he's not opposed to the idea of an Elden Ring movie or TV adaptation, although he doesn't believe FromSoftware has the expertise to tackle such a project.

  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is "the limit" of what
  <strong>
   FromSoftware
  </strong>
  can currently achieve in terms of content scope, according to the game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki. The industry veteran offered this perspective as part of a recent interview that also saw him hint at what kind of projects FromSoftware might tackle next.

  Although plenty of video games dwarf the size of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's world, the Lands Between are still a gigantic place, measuring approximately 30.5 square miles (79km²) in size. The 2022 hit is hence by far the biggest game FromSoftware ever made, and that's without even accounting for its massive
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  expansion.

  FromSoftware Boss Has 'Concerns' About Making a Bigger Game Than Elden Ring

  And while the Japanese studio reached new heights of content volume with its latest Soulsborne title,
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is likely as big as FromSoftware games are going to get for the foreseeable future. That's according to Hidetaka Miyazaki, the company's president and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  director, who said as much in a recent interview with The Guardian. "Where FromSoftware is right now, in terms of scale, I would say
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  is really the limit," the studio official said, adding that he would have "concerns" if the company were to attempt a project that surpasses the scale of its 2022 game anytime soon. Reading between the lines, that statement suggests no such gigantic game is currently in the works at FromSoftware.

  Elden Ring Developer Might Tackle Multiple Smaller Games Next
 </h3>
 <p>
  Given that state of affairs, the
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  director said that tackling multiple smaller projects might be the next logical step for the company. That possibility would match Miyazaki's long-standing ambition to offer other FromSoftware creatives a chance to direct their own games. The industry veteran has already been handing out such opportunities for a while now, as underlined by the fact that Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura directed the 2014
  <em>
   Dark Souls 2
  </em>
  , while the 2023
  <em>
   Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon
  </em>
  was helmed by Masaru Yamamura. Likewise,
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  was only co-directed by Miyazaki, who collaborated with Kazuhiro Hamatani on the 2019 game.

  The same interview saw Miyazaki confirm that
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  was the last
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  -related project that the Japanese company had in the pipeline. However, the executive said he is not opposed to licensing the IP. "I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  ; a movie, for example," he explained. That notwithstanding, Miyazaki opined that FromSoftware likely lacks the expertise to tackle different mediums. Coincidentally, this remark was given mere weeks after George R.R. Martin fueled rumors of an
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  film or TV adaptation.

 <p>
  In any case, it sounds like FromSoftware's next title will not be bigger than
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , and might actually be notably smaller. While some recent reports suggested that the Japanese studio is currently working on multiple projects, it has yet to reveal what's next on its plate after
  <em>
   Shadow of the Erdtree
  </em>
  .

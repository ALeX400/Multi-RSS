  An
  <strong>
   <em>
    Overwatch 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has recently discovered a little-known hiding spot on the Esperanca map. Positioning is often important in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  matches, and the high ground offered by this hidden perch on Esperanca could help some players gain an advantage in skirmishes.

 <p>
  With the launch of
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  , Blizzard released the Esperanca map. This colorful map based on the architecture of Portugal was designed for the sequel’s new mode, Push. It was the third map created for the mode, the previous two being Colosseo and New Queen Street. The Esperanca map in
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  features a colorful city setting, meaning there are many buildings to use as perches to fire at the opponents transporting the robot on the open street. Despite being playable for nearly two years, some players have highlighted a hidden spot that could serve as a tactical advantage in fights.

 <p>
  On Reddit, a user known as malinusha shared a picture of a terrace they never knew was there. According to the player, they found the spot after “randomly landing there” during a game. Based on the post’s screenshots, the place is located near the middle of the map, above a room that includes a health pack. A potential reason players, such as malinusha, never noticed the hiding spot before was due to its height. Players would likely need to use certain hero abilities to reach the elevated spot. For example, a Widowmaker could grapple to the terrace, and Echo could simply fly there.

 <p>
  When posting the discovery to the
  <em>
   Overwatch

  subreddit, malinusha claimed they had never seen anyone taking advantage of the hiding spot on the Esperanca map. With over 2.2K upvotes, many took interest in this sneaky location on the
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  Push map. While several users said they had used the spot before, numerous players had never noticed the terrace before seeing the Reddit post.

 <p>
  Since this discovery has gained so much traction on Reddit, the little-known spot on the Esperanca map could get more use in the coming days. Given its position near the middle of the map, it could offer a strategic position for long-range
  <em>
   Overwatch 2
  </em>
  characters, such as Ashe or Widowmaker. In addition, its height and partial cover could make it challenging to eliminate players utilizing this high ground.

  With Season 12 of
  <em>

  </em>
  underway, time will tell what other secrets players discover in the hero shooter. Blizzard introduced two maps for the new Clash game mode as part of the seasonal update. Perhaps these locations will feature new hiding places for players to stumble upon in the coming weeks.

  The hugely popular mobile game developer,
  <strong>
   Supercell
  </strong>
  , has made a lot of games in its time; some have never launched, some have been canceled, and some have become mobile classics. Part of what makes Supercell’s games so successful is that they are free-to-play, which draws players in. Furthermore, the monetization of each game aims to boost player progress, but not be pay-to-win by allowing free-to-play players to earn everything if they play regularly. Drawing from a variety of themes and genres, Supercell’s games are among the most beloved and well-known mobile games in the world, but which ones are the best?

 <p>
  There are currently six Supercell games that are live and playable for players and this list will rank them from worst to best, considering longevity, replayability, monetization, and player feedback. That’s not to say that any of the games on this list are bad, and it depends on which genre of game players like as to which one they’ll love playing the most.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Squad Busters
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the latest game to be released by Supercell, where 10 players compete in action-packed matches to collect coins and gems. The player with the most gems at the end of the match wins. Players build their squads over time, earning new characters that each have unique abilities. Once unlocked, these characters can be found in chests that are opened with coins during a match. The characters are a mixture of familiar faces, crossing over from other Supercell games, and new ones, that are unique to
  <em>
   Squad Busters
  </em>
  . Furthermore, there are various maps, game modes, spells, and monsters that change how players approach any given battle.

  While fun to begin with, the repetitive nature of the game and its lack of interactivity when fighting means it can get boring very quickly despite all the random variables. Additionally, the game’s randomness can make it frustrating to play. The random maps, game modes, and chest unlocks mean that every game is slightly different, but it also means that players who get offered weaker characters to others are at a disadvantage. On the other hand,
  <em>
   Squad Busters
  </em>
  has listened to community feedback and has made several changes to improve the game, removing battle items and mega units that gave an unfair advantage to certain players. Therefore,
  <em>
   Squad Busters
  </em>
  is moving in the right direction and is a great game for those wanting fast-paced and action-packed fun.

  Since its release in 2012,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Hay Day
   </em>
  </strong>
  has become the go-to farming game for mobile users. While each Supercell game is different,
  <em>
   Hay Day
  </em>
  is a complete change of pace for players, offering a relaxing experience free from fast-paced thinking, explosive battles, and mind-provoking strategy. Instead,
  <em>
   Hay Day
  </em>
  focuses on the simplicity of farming, allowing players to grow crops, rear animals, and manufacture goods all while expanding their farm, selling goods to the community, and exploring new places.

  The satisfaction of unlocking a new building, raising new animals, and growing a farm in
  <em>
   Hay Day
  </em>
  is unrivaled in the world of mobile farming games. Plus, it’s perfect to play with family and friends, as players can join a neighborhood, allowing them to visit each other’s farms and trade resources to help each other out. It may not receive as many updates as other Supercell games, but there are still new events, buildings, and animals being added to keep the game exciting. Overall,
  <em>
   Hay Day
  </em>
  is perfect for those looking for a less intense game to play.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Boom Beach
   </em>
  </strong>
  was released globally in 2014 and has since become a staple of mobile strategy games. Players start on their own individual island which develops as they unlock, build, and upgrade their defenses and other buildings. They then expand their control across the sea, taking over resource settlements, battling other players, and taking down the evil Blackguard to earn loot and gain new territory. As they progress, new troops are unlocked, new buildings are built, and more of the map is explored. Plus, players can join a Task Force, where they work together with others to destroy Blackguard Power Bases.

  The military and island theme brings with it unique features, such as the gunboat and landing crafts, which are key to any attack. Plus, the addition of the warship is an interesting mode that changes how players battle. However, the single builder means that players can only upgrade one building at a time unless they pay for another builder with real money, and even that isn’t permanent. This feature makes progression feel rather slow. Furthermore,
  <em>
   Boom Beach
  </em>
  doesn’t receive as many updates as other Supercell games, and therefore, new features that freshen up the experience aren’t regularly added.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Clash Royale
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a real-time multiplayer card game that was hugely popular when it was released in 2016, offering a new experience within the
  <em>
   Clash
  </em>
  universe. Borrowing troops and spells from
  <em>
   Clash of Clans
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  ’s new format gave players a unique battle experience. Players build a deck consisting of eight different cards and battle it out in the arena to destroy the opponent’s towers while protecting their own. As players progress up the arenas, new cards become available, which can be unlocked through chests that are earned in battle. Plus, every card has several levels to it and can be upgraded if the player has the required number of cards and gold to do so, creating an almost endless progression system.

 <p>
  To this day,
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  continues to thrive by regularly adding new cards, new arenas, and new game modes that keep players hooked. However, with so many new additions, powerful cards, and evolutions of existing cards, players have raised concerns about the pay-to-win aspect of
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  . These complaints aren’t unfounded, and there is an absurd amount of offers for real money in the shop to speed up progression and to purchase the newest cards. Despite this, everything
  <em>
   Clash Royale
  </em>
  releases can be earned for free, it just takes time to get. Furthermore, the game continues to release events that increase progression, and there are often free offers that give players free cards and even free evolutions.

  Launched globally in 2018,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Brawl Stars
   </em>
  </strong>
  quickly made a name for itself among the very best mobile games out there. In
  <em>
   Brawl Stars
  </em>
  , players control a brawler of their choosing, battling against other players in various 3v3 game modes and battle royale. Each brawler has a unique set of abilities, offering lots of options that fit any playstyle. Furthermore, each brawler can be upgraded to level 11, unlocking gears, gadgets, star powers, and hypercharges along the way that players can buy with gold. Each of these items makes the brawlers more powerful in a variety of ways.

 <p>
  Offering a vast array of unlockable brawlers and numerous game modes, there’s always something for players to be excited about in
  <em>
   Brawl Stars
  </em>
  . A lot of this is because of the regular, monthly updates, which introduce a new season, and with it, a new brawler, lots of new skins, and a new event, which may even be a cross-over. For example, the current season is
  <em>
   SpongeBob SquarePants
  </em>
  themed, and it includes new game modes and
  <em>
   SpongeBob
  </em>
  -themed items and skins.
  <em>
   Brawl Stars
  </em>
  is also brilliant at offering tonnes of free rewards that significantly boost progression for new, returning, and long-time players through community challenges. The generosity of the game is one of the reasons it has kept a strong player base and is how it attracts old and new players to the game.

  Almost everyone with a smartphone has played, or at least heard of,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Clash of Clans
   </em>
  </strong>
  . The hugely popular mobile strategy game is one of Supercell’s longest-running games, and yet it remains relevant with regular updates. Players start out with a small village which they can grow into a formidable base as they upgrade their Town Hall, unlocking new buildings, Heroes, troops, and spells, each with numerous levels. To grow their base, players attack other villages, stealing loot to fund their own upgrades. A key part of the game is joining a clan, where players can interact with others and donate troops, spells, and siege machines. They can also participate in Clan Wars, Clan War Leagues, Clan Games, and Clan Capital.

  Much like
  <em>
   Brawl Stars
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Clash of Clans
  </em>
  releases a new themed season every month, bringing with it new skins, events, and challenges. Larger events and updates are also regularly released, bringing new features, building levels, units, and sometimes even an additional Town Hall level. The constant updates mean that players always have something new to look forward to and something to work towards. One criticism is the slow progression due to long upgrades and research times, but players can earn magic items through a variety of ways that speed things up. Carefully designing a base, selecting an army, and strategically executing an attack are all satisfying things players can do in
  <em>
   Clash of Clans
  </em>
  .

  Obsidian Entertainment's forthcoming fantasy RPG
  <strong>
   <em>
    Avowed
   </em>
  </strong>
  has been in the works for some time, but still has a little left to go. Having spent at least four years in development, fans have been looking forward to
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  since 2020, and until recently, it seemed as if the title would finally drop this Fall season. However, earlier this summer, the studio announced it would be delayed into early next year, with a new date of
  <strong>
   February 18, 2025,
  </strong>
  at present.

 <p>
  One of the notable elements about
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  is that it traces its roots to Obsidian's prior CRPG series,
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  . Set within a darker, politically and socially volatile fantasy land with a complicated history,
  <em>
   PoE
  </em>
  's established world of Eora bears many hallmarks of the developer's strengths in creating original and memorable worlds. Being built upon the solid foundations of the two
  <em>
   PoE
  </em>
  titles,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  will be adding to them via sending players to a previously unseen region of Eora. And though it will expand on the already elaborate setting,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  could set Obsidian up to take further advantage of Eora's great potential by filling out even more of it in future games.

  Eora is One of the Most Fascinating and Robust Fantasy Lands In Recent Memory
 </h3>
 <p>
  Obsidian has often earned its touted reputation by displaying its talent for designing rich and arresting worlds in its titles, and Eora stands as some of its best work in that area to date. In the first
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  , players were introduced to what seemed like a fairly recognizable fantasy world at the outset, but which quickly revealed itself to be meticulously designed and envisioned, much more than a stock setting.
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  's depiction of Eora's past and present was absorbing, with a story of moral uncertainties and heavy philosophical musings to match. Even so, it was still localized to the area known as the Eastern Reach and the handful of provinces that comprise it; overall, a fairly small region of Eora.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":987} -->

 <p>
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire
  </em>
  , saw fans journey to the titular archipelago that lies to the south of the Reach.
  <em>
   Deadfire
  </em>
  did a lot to flesh out Eora even more deeply, introducing a host of new facts and factions into the wider mix. The nature of its layout made for a compelling way to present another side of the world, as the jagged collection of islands were replete with numerous interesting and mysterious locations for players to uncover and learn more about, and
  <em>
   Deadfire
  </em>
  was a satisfying followup for gameplay and lore equally. But although both titles covered some excellent ground, there remains vast swaths of Eora that are beckoning to be explored.

  Why Avowed Should Only Mark the Start of Expanding Eora

 <p>
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  will whisk players to a part of Eora that was only briefly mentioned and described previously in
  <em>
   Pillars of Eternity
  </em>
  . Shifting to the far north of the known world,
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  will let fans explore the Living Lands, a mystical tropical jungle with its own secrets and factions vying for control of it. Gamers will thus get to see yet another intriguing section of Eora, and the developments in its world building that
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  will bring to the table hold great promise.

 <p>
  As exciting a prospect as
  <em>
   Avowed
  </em>
  moving to the Living Lands is, and taking into account everything seen in
  <em>
   PoE
  </em>
  , there is still so much more to Eora that could be contained in future titles. And if Obsidian decides to follow its pattern of focusing on a new region each time, the potential is high if there is indeed more to come. As just one example, as prominent a part as the Aedyr Empire plays in lore, it has yet to be seen firsthand. While perhaps a more obvious choice of locale to feature next, it highlights the fact that Obsidian has still really only scratched the surface of Eora so far. If the studio plans to do more with it, there are multiple options at its disposal for continuing to craft and show off Eora in any possible followups.

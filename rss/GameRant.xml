  Growing plants and trees in your plot in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palia
   </em>
  </strong>
  can help you obtain a wide variety of resources, such as wood, fruits, and vegetables. Not only can you use these to keep your area stocked up on goods, but you can also utilize the items you obtain from plants and trees to give to villagers as gifts.

  One of the seeds you can get in the game is Juniper Seeds, which grow into Juniper Trees. This seed can be difficult to find and can only be located in a few areas. Here's
  <strong>
   how you can get some Juniper Seeds
  </strong>
  for yourself.

  If you want to get your hands on some Juniper Seeds in
  <em>
   Palia
  </em>
  , you will want to keep in mind that they can only be found in a couple of locations. One of these is
  <strong>
   Bahari Bay
  </strong>
  , which can be found at the back of your housing plot, toward the area with a wooden path to a mine.

 <p>
  Head through here, and you'll be on the Bahari Bay map. There are many areas where you can find
  <strong>
   Sapwood Trees
  </strong>
  , which you will need to chop down to get Juniper Seeds. Make sure you at least have
  <strong>
   the upgraded Standard Axe
  </strong>
  , since the Makeshift Axe will not be strong enough to cut down a Sapwood Tree. Here are a few locations to visit for some Juniper Seeds.

  Just south of the entrance into Bahari Bay from your housing plot, you'll notice the large area of the

  Once you've successfully obtained a Juniper Seed from a Sapwood Tree, there are a few things you can do with it. This includes:

    Badruu, Hekla, Nai'o, and Hodari

 <p>
  Since Juniper Seeds are very rare and don't often drop from Sapwood Trees, you will want to make sure you choose wisely when deciding what to do with them. We recommend
  <strong>
   planting it
  </strong>
  on your housing plot, or using it to complete the quest 'Prove Your Devotion'. Otherwise, it is best to save it rather than sell or gift it to someone.

      LGBTQ+ representation in video games is increasing, with more diverse narratives and characters being included in both classic and modern titles.
     </li>
     <li>
      Games like
      <em>
       Borderlands 2, Fallout 2,
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
      </em>
      have paved the way for LGBTQ+ romance and marriage options in the industry.
     </li>
     <li>
      Titles like
      <em>
       The Sims, Fallout: New Vegas,
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Dragon Age: Origins

      continue to push for inclusivity, offering players diverse relationship mechanics and LGBTQ+ characters.

 <p>
  As video games as a medium have progressed, the topic of representation has become more and more relevant. Today, people are increasingly aware of the diverse range of individuals who play video games, and how they want to experience stories that personally resonate with them. This has led to a new influx of diverse narratives to choose from. Whether that be indie games with deeply personal LGBTQ+ stories, or games with engaging LGBTQ+ romance options, there's bound to be something to fit everyone's tastes.

 <p>
  That doesn't mean, however, that
  <strong>
   classic games
  </strong>
  were without LGBTQ+ representation. In the past, there have been plenty of notable games that pushed boundaries in order to portray LGBTQ+ narratives. Though some forms of representation may seem outdated, there are many
  <strong>
   classic games whose LGBTQ+ characters and themes still hold up well today.

  As a series,
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  is brimming with LGBTQ+ characters,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Borderlands 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  builds on the first game's charm and atmosphere by adding a number of fun, diverse new faces for the player to get to know. As with most
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  character development, much of the LGBTQ+ representation is told through loud, irreverent jokes and dialogue.

 <p>
  Tiny Tina, for example, is a lesbian who was first introduced in
  <em>
   Borderlands 2
  </em>
  - she received her own DLC,
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep,
  </em>
  and went on to play a role in
  <em>
   Borderlands 3
  </em>
  and star in her own game,
  <em>
   Tiny Tina's Wonderland
  </em>
  . She, slong with other LGBTQ+
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  characters' increase in relevance, shows the trend of rising awareness of the importance LGBTQ+ representation in video games.

  While other games in the
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  series may have more in-depth representation,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is notable in its progressive portrayal of gay marriage in 1998, years before it was legalized anywhere in the world. The player character may choose to marry either Davin or Miria, regardless of their character's gender, in a humorous but very real ceremony.

 <p>
  Though this may seem like a small addition today, including LGBTQ+ romance and marriage in
  <em>
   Fallout 2
  </em>
  proved to be a landmark moment for the games industry's understanding of LGBTQ+ representation, and paved the way for later entries in the series to include further diversity.

  In the past,
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  has not been known for its LGBTQ+ representation. Though it may now feature a number of LGBTQ+ characters, it took some time for them to get there.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
   </strong>
  </em>
  introduces the franchise's first gay character: Juhani. Juhani is a companion that a female player character may pursue romantically; her romance route offers a deeper look at her character, allowing players to form an emotional connection.

 <p>
  While Juhani's role in
  <em>
   Knights of the Old Republic
  </em>
  may seem commonplace today, her inclusion as a lesbian in both the
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  franchise and video games as a whole is extremely notable. She would pave the way for more video games to include LGBTQ+ romance options, and for
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  to begin diversifying the characters they added to their universe.

  Commonly overlooked,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Sims'
   </em>
  </strong>
  role in the landscape of LGBTQ+ characters in games is pretty formative. The first game in the series made the choice to allow same-gender relationships, at a time when showing a gay kiss in a video game was enough to receive backlash. Each successive game went on to add more and more features, tweaking romantic relationships and allowing the option of gay marriage in 2004's
  <em>
   The Sims 2
  </em>
  , over a decade before it was legal in every US state.

 <p>
  Overall, the franchise aims to be inclusive, with later entries adding features such as customizable genders and pronouns, pride cosmetics, and more relationship mechanics for players to tweak.

  The
  <em>
   Persona
  </em>
  games are all about self discovery and coming of age. Their high school setting allows them to tell stories that lean heavily on themes of identity, first love, and self-acceptance. However, while many games in the series touch on dating and sexuality, with romantic relationships becoming a fan-favorite feature,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Persona 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is the only game in which the player character may enter a same-sex relationship.

  During the game, the player can choose for Tatsuya, the protagonist, to enter a romantic relationship with one of the other characters, and one of these characters is Jun, Tatsuya's childhood friend. Their relationship is treated no differently than the potential romantic connections Tatsuya may have with his female friends, making it a surprisingly progressive portrayal of young LGBTQ+ love for a game released in the 1990s.

  As a game,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Fallout: New Vegas
   </strong>
  </em>
  could be described as timeless. Despite its age, people are still heavily invested in playing, discussing, and modding it, with its story and narrative themes still feeling fresh today. Among its cast of interesting and well-written characters are a number of LGBTQ+ NPCs populating the world and existing with the same level of depth as every other character. Players may also take on optional Perks that allow them to flirt and do extra damage against members of the gender they're attracted to, making bisexuality a useful strategy for anyone aiming to optimize their character.

 <p>
  In addition, two of the main companions that the player may encounter are brilliant LGBTQ+ representations; Veronica Santangelo and Arcade Gannon are both gay, with their sexualities simultaneously being an important aspect of their characters while only being a small piece of their story. Though they are only two of the many LGBTQ+ characters found in the game, it's obvious that a huge amount of care went into writing them.

  </strong>
  is the first game in the series, and the one to begin this trend of representation. Out of the four companions the player character may pursue romantically, two are bisexual: Zevran and Leliana. These two companions both have backstories where their bisexuality is relevant, meaning that their sexuality doesn't hinge on the player showing interest in them. They are also well-written, with their own opinions on the main quest and optional side quests that allow the player to get to know them better.

 <p>
  Microsoft Gaming chief Phil Spencer has confirmed that the company will be porting more
  <strong>
   Xbox
  </strong>
  first-party titles to other platforms in the future. Xbox first announced its seismic deviation from console exclusivity earlier this year, when it revealed that four first-party titles from its back catalog would head to rival platforms, PlayStation and Nintendo. At the time, Spencer clarified that this initial batch of multiplatform titles wasn't a sign that the "floodgates" were opening, but it appears Microsoft isn't done porting.

 <p>
  Xbox's first group of multiplatform titles consisted of smaller games, namely
  <em>
   Hi-Fi Rush
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Pentiment
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Grounded
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  . Although the change in its exclusivity strategy was sudden, the general notion was that these games had exhausted their sales potential on Xbox and PC, and so it made sense for them to find a new player base on competitor platforms. However, rumors surrounding more multiplatform Xbox ports have accelerated recently, and now, the head honcho has spoken.

  Speaking with IGN after the recent Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer elaborated on the company's plans for both Xbox customers and players on other platforms. Spencer stated that the company is "committed" to offering its users the "opportunity to buy or subscribe" to its first-party titles, alluding to Xbox's continued confidence in Game Pass. Spencer then remarked that Xbox will also support its games on "other screens," before confirming that players are "going to see more of our games on more platforms."

 <p>
  The CEO sees the multiplatform strategy as a "benefit" to Xbox's first-party franchises, acknowledging that "players love to be able to play." This comment potentially hints to promising sales data for the first four multiplatform titles, which isn't surprising considering
  <em>
   Sea of Thieves
  </em>
  ' substantial popularity on PS5. Microsoft may be looking to capitalize on the userbases of its rival platforms further, and Spencer's confirmation means PlayStation and Nintendo users can look forward to more Xbox titles in the future.

 <p>
  The only remaining question is when Microsoft will announce the next batch of multiplatform first-party ports. The latest Xbox Games Showcase revealed that id Software's highly anticipated
  <em>
   Doom: The Dark Ages
  </em>
  will launch day one on PS5, but beyond that, there's no telling which back-catalog first-party titles Microsoft will bring to rival platforms next. Rumors of a
  <em>
   Halo: Combat Evolved
  </em>
  remaster being considered for PS5 have surfaced recently, but nothing concrete about its launch platforms has been decided yet.

  has a lot of crafting materials players can find and use to upgrade their character or use to make consumable elixirs. Elixirs offer temporary boosts to various stats along with a boost in earned XP, making them useful no matter the situation.

  As players level up and reach milestones, they will be able to upgrade their healing potions and make them much more efficient to make them viable with the player's higher max health. All of these things will require a rare material known as Angelbreath; here's how to get some.

  Angelbreath can be found growing randomly throughout the world, though it is incredibly rare, and this method is not recommended due to the amounts required for any of its uses. One early
  <strong>
   method to obtaining Angelbreath is by opening Tortured Chests in the Helltide
  </strong>
  . This will require players to farm Aberrant Cinders in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , and chests don't have a guarantee to drop these flowers.

 <p>
  A Helltide lasts for 55 minutes, which is more than enough time to open every chest available. Players can use Profane Mindcages in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  to increase the drop rate of Aberrant Cinders, and can also attempt to kill the Blood Maiden to maximize the amount of Cinders they earn during the event. Another method for farming Angelbreath is by clearing Nightmare Dungeons. These don't have as consistent drop chances but will be
  <strong>
   found more often than not when completing events in a Nightmare Dungeon
  </strong>
  .

  One of the endgame
  <strong>
   uses for Angelbreath is for rerolling the stats on
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Affixes
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Diablo 4
  </em>
  , which greatly helps in rounding out your build after reaching the max level. Earlier than that, Angelbreath will be used when trying to upgrade your healing potion to some of the highest levels. While players should save Angelbreath early on when possible, this is a situation where it is a necessity.

 <p>
  Angelbreath is also a
  <strong>
   common crafting material in many Elixirs

  , which are great ways to increase earned XP. Angelbreath is also a necessary item to craft an elixir that lets players use two elixirs at once in

      Nintendo's challenging 3D platformers like

      </em>
      and

      <em>

  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  is one of the biggest and most well-known video game companies, and has created some of the most popular gaming franchises enjoyed by many over the years. Along with re-releasing some classic titles for newer consoles, such as
  <em>
   <strong>
    Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
   </strong>
  </em>
  , Nintendo has created many 2D and
  <strong>
   3D platformers
  </strong>
  that are enjoyed by children and adults alike.

 <p>
  However, not all the platformer games Nintendo has published are simple and straightforward. Some of their 3D games, both well-known and underrated, offer a more challenging gameplay experience for players. Whether it be due to poor camera issues, or requiring incredibly tough and precise platforming, the
  <strong>
   hardest 3D platformers published by Nintendo
  </strong>
  have surely challenged even experienced gamers at some point.

  The 2004 port of the groundbreaking
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  added 30 new Power Stars for players to collect. The game also treated players to three other playable characters in Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario. All these characters have their own unique skills, from Yoshi’s Flutter Jump to Luigi’s High Jump.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Super Mario 64 DS
   </strong>
  </em>
  had new mini-games, missions within the Castle grounds, and playable courses, some involving collecting Silver Stars.

 <p>
  However, the lack of the N64's analog stick is really felt here, making tricky levels from the original, such as Rainbow Ride, even more fiddly. The DS's D-Pad doesn't allow for those smooth controls, meaning it can be more difficult to pull off stunts, swim, and fly. Controlling certain characters can feel stiff, and the smaller screen coupled with its camera issues can make players exasperated.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Banjo-Tooie
   </em>
  </strong>
  may not be remembered as very difficult, but certain elements make it a more challenging game than its 1998 predecessor,
  <em>
   Banjo Kazooie.
  </em>
  With larger locations to explore,
  <em>
   Banjo-Tooie
  </em>
  requires players to work harder to collect each ‘jiggy’. Worlds are also interconnected, which can be confusing at times, as some are discovered only via certain exits. Players are required to do a lot of backtracking to get the items they need and to navigate correctly towards their destination, especially if they're aiming for 100% completion.

  Some of the enemies and bosses are quite difficult, especially against Gruntilda, who requires players to be quick on their feet to answer her questions correctly whilst battling her. This sequel carries on the groundbreaking 3D platforming that its predecessor introduced, but overall, is more complex and longer, and therefore more tricky than the first game in this beloved series.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Donkey Kong 64
   </em>
  </strong>
  is often remembered for its tedious gameplay, though it received good reviews upon release. Similar to
  <em>
   Banjo-Tooie
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   DK64
  </em>
  requires players to backtrack repeatedly to collect every necessary item, which is not all that surprising, since Rare was the developer behind both games. However, due to the lack of a map, and the game's sprawling level design, it can be particularly difficult to find everything that’s needed to progress, and this often leads to getting lost. What does provide a unique platforming experience are the five playable characters, though some are more awkward to control than others. Their unique individual skills are shown in the iconic opening song.

  Reaching the final boss proves challenging, requiring the Rareware and Nintendo Coins. Players need to beat two original arcade titles,
  <em>
   Jetpac
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Donkey Kong
  </em>
  , the latter two times over. Much like other early 3D platformers, players had to deal with an unresponsive camera and sluggish controls, but DK64 still remains beloved by fans today.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Bomberman 64
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the first fully-3D installment in the
  <em>
   Bomberman
  </em>
  series. As such, it brought a different kind of difficulty to the franchise. It undoubtedly had the hallmarks of every early 3D game, such as a very shaky camera and static controls. However, the tricky puzzle platforming, especially with the lack of a jump button, means players can spend hours wandering across the stages hunting for each hidden bonus.

 <p>
  With a big focus on exploration, the game requires players to collect at least 100 Gold Cards to reach the final stage: Rainbow Palace. There are 120 cards in total, some of which are extremely difficult to obtain, making 100% completion a frustrating challenge. In the notorious Hard Mode, the card locations are altered, and the enemies become even tougher to defeat.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Super Mario Sunshine
   </em>
  </strong>
  is often considered the hardest 3D entry in the
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  series. This title introduced a completely new mechanic in F.L.U.D.D., a sharp turn from its predecessor,
  <em>
   Super Mario 64
  </em>
  . F.L.U.D.D feels unfamiliar, seeing as it's required for most levels and battles, although Mario still has his consistently iconic moves, like Triple Jumps and Ground Pounds. What makes matters even harder is that some secret courses then remove the F.L.U.D.D mechanic, and feature some very tricky platforming segments, involving unstable or disappearing ground.

 <p>
  This game undeniably requires precise platforming, and players have to work against slippery controls and an infamous camera. Each course has a Red Coin mission, which requires players to hunt around the entire area, or even on the back of a giant Sand Bird in one level, to find it. The Pachinko game is particularly notorious for its controls, giving players a real challenge.

   <em>
    Snake Rattle 'n' Roll
   </em>
  </strong>
  can easily be regarded as one of the most challenging NES platformers. With an infamously tough final boss and time limits on all courses, its unique isometric style further adds to the challenge. Though that isometric style creates a 3D illusion, this does not pair smoothly with the strong platforming elements. One slightly wrong move means players will fall back to ground level. This isn’t helped by the fact that the controls are very sensitive. To make things even harder, some levels have "power ups" that seem to work against the player, like reversing the controls.

  To pass each level, the two snakes, Rattle and Roll, must be of a certain length, achieved by eating Nibbley Pibbleys. Any enemy attack causes the snakes’ size to decrease, eventually leading to losing a life, and unfortunately, the enemies are particularly hostile. Each level increases in challenge, and since there is a very steep spike in difficulty as players progress, just making it to the credits is a harrowing experience.

  Shift Up's
  <strong>
   <em>
    Stellar Blade
   </em>
  </strong>
  is by far one of the most surprising gaming success stories in recent memory. After battling plenty of controversy over its character models ahead of its release and even now,
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  initially seemed like it would have a very hard time sticking the landing. Thankfully, it proved to be much more than that, with vast open-world zones to explore and satisfyingly challenging gameplay, despite a lackluster narrative. Now, even without being a live-service game,
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  is set to receive several updates throughout 2024 after Shift Up reported estimated sales surpassing one million copies.

 <p>
  During an IPO press conference on June 25, Shift Up announced its plans for
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  during the remainder of 2024 and beyond. The developer not only reported that
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  has sold over one million copies but also that it has achieved universal acclaim on Metacritic with a user rating of 9.2, one of the highest for a PlayStation 5 game so far. In light of that, the developer has refused to quit with
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  , even after adding a Boss Challenge mode to the game and several new outfits for EVE. Included in
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's 2024 roadmap are a few fan-requested features, as well as a collaboration that Shift Up has yet to be transparent about.

  Stellar Blade Will Finally Receive a Photo Mode Around August
 </h3>
 <p>
  When
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  first launched at the end of April 2024, the lack of a photo mode was perplexing. A game that seemed to focus so much on its visuals and yet lacked a proper photo mode just didn't make sense. Of course, Shift Up assured fans that it would add a photo mode to
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  if fans requested it enough, and it turns out the developer is going to make good on that promise. "Around August,"
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  will finally receive a photo mode, so players can take customized screenshots of their favorite moments in the game.

  Even More Outfits Will Be Added to Stellar Blade After October
 </h3>
 <p>
  Ahead of its release,
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's outfits were one of its most prominent features, and that remained true even after the game's launch. There are dozens of outfits for EVE and her friends to wear in
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  , and more have been added since. Shift Up isn't going to stop there, however, as it plans to add even more character skins to the game "after October." Whether that means in October after it begins or sometime in November or December, at least there is confirmation that more outfits are on the way.

 <h3 id="stellar-blade-will-feature-a-large-scale-collaboration-at-the-end-of-2024">
  Stellar Blade Will Feature a Large-Scale Collaboration at the End of 2024
 </h3>
 <p>
  The most cryptic mention in the IPO press conference is a "large-scale collaboration" that
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  will be participating in at the end of the year. As of now, Shift Up has not been clear as to who or what this collaboration will be with, but some have speculated it will be with
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  , considering
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's similarities to
  <em>
   NieR: Automata
  </em>
  and the good rapport shared between Shift Up and PlatinumGames. However, Shift Up has already announced a collaboration with its other game,
  <em>
   Goddess of Victory: Nikke
  </em>
  , which has yet to happen. It's possible
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  's collab with
  <em>
   Nikke
  </em>
  could very well be the "large-scale collaboration" Shift Up was referring to during the press conference.

 <p>
  Shift Up also confirmed "additional DLC" and "sequels" for
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  coming after 2024 during the IPO press conference. The additional DLC it mentioned could simply be more cosmetic outfits, but a
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  DLC featuring Lily would be an excellent addition to the base game. Furthermore, the fact that Shift Up said "sequels" implies it is already cooking up plans for multiple subsequent installments for what will become the
  <em>
   Stellar Blade
  </em>
  franchise.

    Updated July 5, 2024:
   </em>
  </strong>
  Another week has come for
  <strong>
   <em>
    Destiny 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which means missions, challenges, and rewards have been reset. After months of new content and updates,
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  has reentered a quiet period as Episode Echoes moves into a 3-week dormant period between Acts 1 and 2. For many, this will probably be a time that many use to catch up on everything that has come out since The Final Shape has launched, including the episodic content.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, Bungie continues to attempt to keep players engaged and anticipating what's coming as game director Robbie Stevens recently teased that Act 3 of Episode Echoes will feature one of the biggest Exotic missions that
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  has ever seen. Stevens stopped short of giving any more details, though it was confirmed that this new episodic format was the big reason why creating a mission this size was even possible at all.

 <p>
  In the meantime, the
  <em>
   Destiny 2
  </em>
  weekly reset is back again, bringing refreshed content, activities, and rewards for players to chase over the next week. For a complete look at all the new content available for the week of July 2, including Nightfalls, Crucible modes, and challenges, here is everything players need to know.

  High-ranking
  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  executives recently shared some insights into why modern video games take longer to develop. Long waits between the time a given title is announced and the time that players finally get their hands on it have grown increasingly common over the years, even without delays and production issues that can crop up during development. For example, the Nintendo title
  <em>
   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  finally launched on the Nintendo Switch in 2023, no less than four years after it was originally announced and six years after its predecessor,
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild.
  </em>

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":true,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":591,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":true,"countRemainingForInjection":309,"nextBlockCount":635,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":true,"nextCount":1226} -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":true,"actualCount":900} -->
 <!-- Zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":true,"actualCount":0} -->
 <p>
  Likewise, fans had been waiting for
  <em>
   Metroid Prime 4: Beyond
  </em>
  for nearly 10 years when it was initially announced by Nintendo back in 2017 - only for its development to be completely restarted from scratch in 2019. Now the title is set to launch sometime in 2025, eight years after its existence was officially confirmed.
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  also began development in 2019, four years before it debuted on the Nintendo Switch in late 2023. This doesn’t factor in how
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  was the first traditional 2D
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  platformer since
  <em>
   New Super Mario Bros. U
  </em>
  back in 2012, which made the wait even tougher for fans.

 <p>
  Nintendo Senior Managing Executive Officer and Corporate Director Shinya Takahashi noted this long wait during a recent shareholder Q&amp;A session (via NintendoLife), pointing out that
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  wasn’t in development for the full decade following the previous
  <em>
   Mario
  </em>
  sidescroller. He did, however, acknowledge how video games are taking longer to develop these days, stating that such waits are “inevitable” as hardware continues to advance. However, he states that Nintendo is making efforts to shorten software development periods by “steadily improving the development cycle.”

 <p>
  Takahashi also provided some more reasons behind the long wait for
  <em>
   Super Mario Bros. Wonder
  </em>
  , citing various initiatives and studies that he claims were meant to encourage as many people as possible to enjoy the game once it finally launched. Meanwhile, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa agreed that game development has become “more prolonged, more complex, and more advanced” over the past few generations, and that his company will continue to mitigate this by expanding its development resources and making "necessary investments."

  During the Q&amp;A session, Shuntaro Furukawa also addressed the increased use of generative AI in game development and stated that Nintendo currently has no plans to incorporate such technology into the development of its future first-party titles, largely due to concerns over IP rights. While this same AI could be used to cut down on development time,
  <strong>
   Nintendo
  </strong>
  is looking into other ways to create games faster while maintaining the high level of quality that players have come to expect from one of the biggest video game companies out there.

  Released fully all the way back in October 2017,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Brawlhalla
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been going strong for almost seven years now. As a free-to-play platform-fighter,
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  has managed to retain a sizable player base by continuing to release a consistent stream of updates and patches, some of which have added new crossover fighters to the game.

  Though it doesn't get talked about nearly as much as games like
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  's had a rather lengthy history with franchise crossovers.
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  's first major crossover came all the way back in October 2018, when characters and weapons from
  <em>
   Shovel Knight
  </em>
  appeared in the platform-fighter. Since then,
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  has hosted almost 20 major crossovers, with collabs ranging from gaming icons like
  <em>
   Rayman
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  , to family-friendly cartoons like
  <em>
   Ben 10
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   SpongeBob SquarePants
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Adventure
  </em>
  <em>
   Time
  </em>
  . But there's one popular franchise that
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  still needs to have if it plans on completing its fighting game trio.

 <p>
  Back in November 2021,
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  hosted a huge
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  crossover event that lasted three weeks and was so well received that it returned in May 2022. In these two
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  x
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  crossover events, an impressive total of eight new character skins were added, all of whom mirrored various fighters from the base game. Ryu, Chun-Li, Akuma, Ken, Luke, M. Bison, Sakura, and Dhalsim all came to the platform-fighter, along with some new cosmetics like a themed KO Effect, and a new limited-time game mode and map.

 <p>
  More recently, back in September 2023,
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  had a similar
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  crossover event. Though it was much smaller than the
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  event,
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  collaboration added three new character skins to the game, those being Devil Jin, Yoshimitsu, and Nina Williams. Along with them came a slew of Avatars, an Emote, and a KO Effect, as well as a Mishima Dojo map.

  Brawlhalla Just Needs a Mortal Kombat Crossover To Complete Its Fighting Game Trifecta
 </h3>
 <p>
  When it comes to non-crossover fighting game franchises, there are three big names that never leave the top spots. These are
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  .
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  has characters from both
  <em>
   Street Fighter
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tekken
  </em>
  , but it still needs a
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  crossover to complete its fighting game collection. A
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  x
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  crossover would make a lot of sense. Though
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  's cartoon-y aesthetic has often led to crossovers with more family-friendly properties, the fighting game hasn't been afraid of more adult-oriented IP, such as
  <em>
   Halo
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Hellboy
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   The Walking Dead
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  There are also plenty of
  <em>
   Mortal Kombat
  </em>
  characters who could make the transition over to
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  . Scorpion is probably the best pick, with him being the franchise's biggest mascot. Scorpion's moveset would fit a few of
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  's base game fighters, with Ada probably being the best fit thanks to her spear and elemental blasters that could be easily reskinned to look like Scorpion's spear and fire attacks.

 <p>
  Of course, there are plenty of other fighting franchises that are also worthy of a
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  crossover. Though it's been out of the ring for a while,
  <em>
   SoulCalibur
  </em>
  would make for a great crossover IP for
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  , as would
  <em>
   Killer Instinct
  </em>
  . More recent fighting games like
  <em>
   Guilty Gear Strive
  </em>
  are also deserving of a cameo spot on
  <em>
   Brawlhalla
  </em>
  's roster.

  After more than four and a half years on the market,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot
   </strong>
  </em>
  is still surpassing sales milestones, recently eclipsing eight million copies sold. Even with one
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  game released after
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot
  </em>
  and another on the horizon, the action RPG remains popular among fans of the late Akira Toyiyama's work.

  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot
  </em>
  was originally released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in January 2020. Subsequent ports have resulted in versions for Nintendo Switch and Google Stadia in 2021 and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2023. Separating itself apart from the formula used in many other games in the
  <em>
   Dragon Ball
  </em>
  franchise, the title is a single-player action RPG, though
  <em>
   Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot
  </em>
  still has a large roster of playable characters familiar to fans of the series.

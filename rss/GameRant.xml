  If you have an open spot in your attacking lineup, your other positions are set, and you have the coins to spare, investing in Streets Won’t Forget versions of Doumbia, Ibarbo, or Gervinho in
  <em>
   EA Sports FC 25
  </em>
  could be a smart move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their base cards aren’t competitive, especially at this stage of the game where most opponents are using
  <strong>
   +90-rated
  </strong>
  players. However, after completing the Evolutions, you can enhance each player even further by unlocking a PlayStyle+. Simply play
  <strong>
   three matches
  </strong>
  with
  <strong>
   Doumbia, Ibarbo, and Gervinho
  </strong>
  in your starting squad in any Ultimate Team mode to activate this additional upgrade.

  It’s almost impossible to lavish
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  with enough praise. Almost a decade after its release, it’s still considered a must-play and maintains a large active player base, with little wonder why. Upon release, the pixel art life simulator quickly revealed its surprisingly deep gameplay, world, and even some well-hidden lore.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unsurprisingly, the magic that
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  captured has led to its share of imitators, as well as some genuinely inspired competitors. For PS5 players looking for that signature blend of coziness, farming, and just a dash of adventure and combat, there are plenty of other fish in the town pond. We’ve gathered some of the best available for the PS5 here, ranked by their PlayStation player ratings.

  These days, there is seemingly a simulator game for everything. Lucky for fans of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  ’s farming gameplay, there is a simulator for just that, too. Not only is
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  all farming, but it is also meticulously crafted to include every detail of farming, from the ground up to an entire supply chain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps the best aspect of
  <em>
   Farming Simulator 25
  </em>
  lies in its vehicle controls. Driving the assorted machinery around to reap, process, and transport crops is fun and rewarding, something at the heart of all good sims.

  Its impressively cute and charming aesthetic ensures that
  <em>
   Hokko Life
  </em>
  is the type of life sim that will attract an audience no matter what. Luckily, it is also a fun, addicting game that will keep players going for hours if for no other reason than to assemble the perfect outfit for their darling avatar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Hokko Life
  </em>
  allocates the bulk of its gameplay to exploration in order to complete daily requests and help locals with ever-randomized tasks, and the formula works thanks to a cute menagerie of NPCs around town. There is also a city that players can visit in order to interact with other players and share their creations in furniture, which helps it feel nice and connected.

  There is no doubt that
  <em>
   Everdream Valley
  </em>
  is geared towards younger players, but that should not deter players of any age from skipping it if they’re in search of simple, relaxing, colorful farming. Even better, the game balances its more conventional gameplay with dream sequences that are almost guaranteed to make players laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding to the surreal charm is the cast of NPCs that include both the human townsfolk and the wild animals throughout, who will send players on a range of quests. The results lead to a farm that is visually-pleasing and absolutely packed with mini-games to keep things engaging.

  As its name suggests,
  <em>
   Sugardew Island
  </em>
  is openly seeking that
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  style and adding a saccharine, kid-friendly twist. It further adds a simple but effective story based around conservation and restoring native animals to their rightful habitats.
 </p>
 <p>
  One fun part of the
  <em>
   Sugardew Island
  </em>
  gameplay loop is that, after players plant and harvest crops like an average farm sim, they also mind their own shop, personally selling their own crops, as well. If the simple cycle of plant, tend, harvest, and sell appeals to any player,
  <em>
   Sugardew Island
  </em>
  is a worthy consideration.

  <em>
   Potion Permit
  </em>
  is only partially a life sim, relying heavily on RPG adventuring for its core gameplay. What life sim portions it has, however, are refreshingly unique, being set in a makeshift hospital instead of a farm. Thanks to its artful pixel graphics and sprites, even the adventure elements of
  <em>
   Potion Permit
  </em>
  feel cozy and relaxing, as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Players will still explore and forage for ingredients with which to craft better and better gear, as usual, but any monsters to be fought are few and weak, mainly keeping foraging from becoming monotonous. Most of the thrill will come from the minigames back at the hospital, thanks to its surprisingly empathetic NPCs.

  In general, every game in the
  <em>
   Story of Seasons
  </em>
  franchise bears some resemblance to
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , but
  <em>
   DORAEMON STORY OF SEASONS: Friends of the Great Kingdom
  </em>
  is the best for PS5 players. Its east-meets-west art style helps it stand out from related sims, making every chapter in the game feel like a short film or scene from a Hayao Miyazaki movie.
 </p>
 <p>
  True to its more cinematic nature, the game is very story-heavy, although it mainly stays light and comedic. This helps the characters all feel important and relatable, helping to make the farming, gathering, and crafting feel genuinely meaningful.

  Among the many relaxing homestead-building games,
  <em>
   Cozy Grove
  </em>
  stands out for its unique art style and supernatural world-building. Like in
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Cozy Grove
  </em>
  starts players out alone and with essentially nothing, encouraging them to build their settlement around them as they gather resources and eventually produce their own.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unique to
  <em>
   Cozy Grove
  </em>
  , however, is the ghost-based mechanism in which players expand their property. It’s only through helping a series of spirits with their unfinished business in life that players unlock new townsfolk and new utilities like fishing and baking. As if that weren’t unique enough, most of the NPC ghosts that players meet take the form of large, cubic bears.

  The
  <em>
   Harvest Moon
  </em>
  franchise actually predates
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  by around 20 years, with its first entry released for the SNES in 1996. It’s become a staple of the genre, setting the tone for generations of peaceful ranching sims set in whimsical, childlike worlds.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos
  </em>
  is set in a green open world that encourages exploration, even allowing players to relocate their farm wherever seems most fruitful or picturesque. Combined with a pleasant cast of characters and a fun mythological story, the game is one of the more adventure-based farm sims.

  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  is relatively new, launching for the PS5 at the end of 2023. Suitable for a game so fresh, it’s loaded with fun, new takes on traditional concepts and promises to add even more in the coming months or years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  shares a lot of its core DNA with
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  : players alternate between building up their farm crops for income and resources, chatting up village locals to build relationships, and embarking on mini-adventures through enemy-laden mines. To set itself apart,
  <em>
   Coral Island
  </em>
  is tropical and vibrant, and the cast of characters are infectiously charming representations of all walks of life.

  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  is certainly an oddball in the cutesy farming sim genre, as it trades traditional livestock such as cows, chicken, and pigs for little bouncing balls of slime. As players might expect, slimes don’t produce the usual milk or eggs but rather plorts, exotic gemstones used as the game’s basic building blocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Other than that,
  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  follows some familiar paths for the genre. Collecting slimes becomes farming slimes, which becomes upgrading the ranch, equipping players with what they need to access better areas and better slimes.

 <p>
  An intrepid fitness enthusiast and
  <strong>
   <em>
    Red Dead Redemption 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  player has completed a major journey across the game's map using a treadmill to control Arthur as he walks across the whole in-game world.
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  won praise upon its release in 2018 for having a massive open-world map filled with naturalistic detail.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it has been nearly seven years since it first released,
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  continues to impress players, with fans continuing to find creative ways to have fun in one of the biggest open world games around. The adventures of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang at the end of America's Wild West era take on a legendary quality when considered against the backdrop of the game world's massive, photorealistic vistas. Even outside the game's story and designated activities, players find moments of quiet and humor just by visiting places on the map. In short, Rockstar's rendition of the fictional U.S. states like New Hanover and West Elizabeth are engaging places just to live in and walk through.
 </p>
 <p>
  One player, who goes by ShakeMistake on YouTube, shared his literal "walk through" of
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  with the game's Reddit community. Using the unusual hardware combination of a step tracker, a low-profile "walking pad" treadmill, and an app that remapped the in-game controls to his movement, ShakeMistake was able to walk Arthur Morgan almost all the way across the
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  game map. He trekked from the town of Annesburg in the northeast corner of New Hanover to Tumbleweed in the southwest reaches of New Austin, spending the entire time on foot and without stopping.

  Red Dead Redemption 2 Player Takes More than 3 Hours to Walk Arthur Across the Map With a Treadmill
 </h2>
 <p>
  To accomplish his feat, ShakeMistake used an android smartphone app called StepL, which connects to a PC and can turn gyroscopic input from the phone into in-game movement, similar to the way fitness games like
  <em>
   Zombies Run
  </em>
  track steps. ShakeMistake streamed the whole journey live on Twitch, sharing the condensed version with Reddit and uploading a more detailed breakdown on his YouTube channel. According to him, it took approximately three hours of walking constantly to move from Annesburg to Tumbleweed, with the app counting roughly 16,000 steps in total.

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  Players praised ShakeMistake for the feat of conquering the whole
  <em>
   Red Dead Redemption 2
  </em>
  map "physically," and likening the accomplishment to other stunts involving games and fitness equipment, like when one player turned a treadmill into a
  <em>
   Death Stranding
  </em>
  controller.
 </p>
 <p>
  ShakeMistake's journey of 16,000 steps put the map's size at somewhere under 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) in distance between two of its furthest points. Despite this, the game gives the impression that Arthur and his compatriots are traveling for days or even months through entire U.S. states and beyond.

  Upon arriving in Wyveria for the first time in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Monster Hunter Wilds

  , you'll be faced with a Guardian Doshaguma. This is the first of the Construct-type monsters you'll face throughout the final region of the game that have deep ties to the main storyline.

  While you'll have already faced a regular Doshaguma much earlier in the game, the Guardian Doshaguma is much stronger with a lot of different tricks up its sleeves. Here's how to prepare to face it, beat one, and everything it drops.

 <p>
  All of the attacks from a Guardian Doshaguma do basic damage, and they also have a way to lower your overall defense. With that, you'll want to
  <strong>
   equip physical defense-focused gear
  </strong>
  over anything with elemental protection. On top of any armor that already focuses on defense, you'll also want to upgrade that armor as doing so will further boost the physical defense of any armor. Some armor sets that have good defense are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Rey Dau
  </li>
  <li>
   Nu Udra
  </li>
  <li>
   Guardian Ebony
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Beyond that, you'll want to make sure you have a weapon that deals Ice damage. While Guardian Doshagumas have a few elemental weaknesses, their biggest one is ice.
  <strong>
   Weapons made from the drops from a Hirabami deal ice damage
  </strong>
  , and excel when facing a Guardian Doshaguma.

  Being a Construct, Guardian Doshagumas are only found in the
  <strong>
   final region of the game, Wyveria
  </strong>
  . They are also one of the more common monsters to find and can be found in just about any area. If one doesn't immediately spawn for you, you can rest in your tent to pass in-game time and get new monsters to spawn. You can also choose to accept an optional quest that targets a Guardian Doshaguma, guaranteeing it spawns.

  Guardian Doshagumas are big, slow creatures with large wind-ups and many close-range attacks. Overall,
  <strong>
   you'll want to fight at the monster's feet
  </strong>
  , which also happens to be the most dangerous place. Luckily, the large wind-ups will give you more than enough time to get out of the way. Focus your attacks on the front legs of the monster, as breaking wounds on its front legs will expose its weak point to further deal more damage.
 </p>
 <p>
  As long as you stay close, the spit attack shouldn't be used often, but be sure to avoid it when you see it. While it doesn't deal much damage, it lowers your defense temporarily leading to you taking much more damage over time. The long wind-ups of every attack make them fairly easy to dodge, though you'll want to
  <strong>
   give yourself a good buffer since a lot of the attacks will also have following shockwaves
  </strong>
  to cover a wider area.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like most monsters, Guardian Doshagumas also have a roar, but bringing the right supplies can help you avoid this entirely. Unlike other monsters in the game, Guardian Doshagumas don't have any major tricks up their sleeves and, aside from their shockwaves, what you see is what they will use to attack.
  <strong>
   Most of their attacks will be slams or sweeps with their front legs
  </strong>
  , and attacking those legs and breaking wounds on them will stun their best options temporarily.

  Normally, when the idea of an RPG comes to mind, gamers think of fantasy games such as
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gat
  </em>
  e. However, many RPGs with a sci-fi setting have also excelled and one of the most anticipated is
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Outer Worlds 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which is currently set to release later in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, there are other sci-fi RPGs out there that can help gamers pass the time before
  <em>
   The Outer Worlds 2
  </em>
  is released. They range from other space-faring adventures set on alien planets to Earth-based stories set in the distant future, either post-apocalyptic or dystopian. Each one takes on RPG aspects in their own memorable ways.

  Rather than going for something like
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Guardians Of The Galaxy
  </em>
  with outlandish sci-fi elements,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  takes a more practical approach to a space-faring adventure. Everything is designed to be more rugged and industrial, akin to films like the original
  <em>
   Alien
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Interstellar
  </em>
  , while giving gamers the chance to explore over one thousand planets across different star systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  is Bethesda’s newest original RPG and despite initial drama about it being an Xbox and PC-only release, it still provided much of what fans loved in
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  games. Building and upgrading starships, fighting space pirates and aliens, and completing quests across different planets has resulted in one of Bethesda’s more underrated titles.

   <em>
    Earthbound
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the victim of poor marketing when it was released in 1995, but over the years, word of mouth spread and gradually turned the flop into an all-time classic. It features kids on an adventure in a suburban town fending off an alien invasion utilizing simple weapons and a little telepathic ability.
 </p>
 <p>
  The story of
  <em>
   Earthbound
  </em>
  is a mind-bender, especially since it was originally a sequel to a Japanese game called
  <em>
   Mother
  </em>
  , but that became part of its charm. The bizarre enemies, characters, and story beats combined with well-made turn-based RPG gameplay all became vital pieces of what would become an iconic game.

  The planet of Pandora has become iconic due to the
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  series. While the first game is enjoyable, many fans consider
  <em>
   <strong>
    Borderlands 2
   </strong>
  </em>
  to be the best installment. The playable characters are unique, and even the new Siren class stands out from Lilith, offering greater depth in their skill trees and the RPG system.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s not a
  <em>
   Borderlands
  </em>
  game without guns, and Borderlands 2 is filled to the brim with thousands of guns that are to be looted, upgraded, or traded. On top of it all, Pandora is expanded upon even more with different biomes that provide more diversity in visuals as well as the different kinds of foes, especially with the series’ now-iconic villain: Handsome Jack.

  Thanks to a rushed release,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cyberpunk 2077
   </em>
  </strong>
  was met with a controversial launch in 2020 filled with missing content and a plethora of glitches. Fortunately, CD Projekt Red took the time to release numerous patches and an expansion that turned it into the immersive RPG that it is now. It is a real-life redemption story for a video game that comes so rarely, but gamers were happy it happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the character known only as V, the player dives deep into the dystopian underbelly of Night City to pursue their criminal life as they choose. They can be as heroic or as villainous as they wish, both in terms of character development and in the way they level up their cybernetic upgrades to suit their needs. With Keanu Reeves, Idris Elba, and hundreds of hours of content, the final product emerges as a modern classic.

  Nearly every
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  game takes inspiration from other games and the
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi
  </em>
  series by Respawn Entertainment borrows heavily from Souls-like action RPG games such as
  <em>
   Bloodborne
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
  </em>
  . The sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
   </em>
  </strong>
  goes even further into RPG territory with even more skill trees to level up, more weapon variation with the five lightsaber stances, abilities, and perks that turn Cal Kestis into a powerful Jedi.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
  </em>
  not only adds to the RPG aspects, but improves on what many felt lacked in
  <em>
   Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
  </em>
  . The planets are even bigger with more activities to do, including side quests. Cal Kestis and his loyal companion droid BD-1 are also far more customizable from head to toe, and the same can be said for lightsabers, which were already a highlight in
  <em>
   Fallen Order
  </em>
  .

  In the 2010s, the original
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  trilogy was considered the gold standard when it came to space RPGs, rivaling the likes of
  <em>
   Star Trek
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  in terms of world-building, storytelling, and character development. That’s why fans were happy to see all three games remastered in one package with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mass Effect: Legendary Edition
   </em>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Like most BioWare RPGs,
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  games mix top-tier storytelling and characters with strong gameplay, mixing third-person shooter elements with psionic powers depending on the class. The Legendary Edition keeps all that made the three games so cherished, especially the story and dialogue options that can drastically change entire plotlines. At the same time, it updates a few outdated aspects, especially in the first
  <em>
   Mass Effect
  </em>
  .

  Bethesda had a tough act to follow after their explosive hits with
  <em>
   Fallout 3
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim
  </em>
  , but
  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  proved to be a worthy addition to their library. It gave fans a fresh perspective of someone who has survived the nuclear apocalypse since the day the bombs dropped and is now searching the wastelands of Boston to find their lost child.
 </p>
 <p>
  Longtime fans often debate between
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Fallout: New Vegas
  </em>
  as which is the best in the series.
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  boasts even better visuals, even without the many mods available for it, and more simplified but effective controls that make wandering the wasteland a blast. It also introduces base-building mechanics that give the player more to do outside the already expansive list of quests.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Deus Ex: Human Revolution
   </em>
  </strong>
  reboots the series by putting the player in the shoes of Adam Jensen, who feels like a love letter to classic cyborg characters like RoboCop. He is a Detroit SWAT operative-turned private security officer who is rebuilt with cybernetic augments after his body is mostly destroyed, turning him into a superhero agent for a cyberpunk future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alongside a gripping and thought-provoking story of corporate espionage, Deus Ex: Human Revolution maintains what made the original
  <em>
   Deus Ex
  </em>
  so revolutionary in terms of gameplay. Nearly any situation can be handled via stealth or guns-blazing action as the player wishes and just like Mass Effect, the player can make choices that alter the story.

  Adam Jensen continues with the direct sequel, which took an already strong template of the first game and pushed it even further with polished visuals and gameplay. The result is
  <strong>
   <em>
    Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
   </em>
  </strong>
  , which pushes its hero even more with a story being the aftermath of the first game’s ending.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
  </em>
  also takes its cyborg concept even further with even more upgrades for Adam Jensen unlocked throughout the game that make him even more powerful. However, that doesn’t mean he is a perfect super-soldier, as enemies are not only stronger but are even more difficult, resulting in a sequel that is considered on par with the first, if not superior.

  While fans wait for the sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    The Outer Worlds
   </em>
  </strong>
  is still worth playing, even if it's for a third or fourth time. Obsidian Entertainment delivered when it came to giving fans an intergalactic RPG that mixes retro-futurism and fun first-person shooter gameplay to create a memorable adventure that can appeal to fans of their previous endeavors and sci-fi fans in general.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only is it a delight to explore planets freely, battling other space explorers, bandits, and alien monsters,
  <em>
   but The Outer Worlds
  </em>
  also features player choices that truly matter. From character creation to mission outcomes, Obsidian ensures that even the smallest details have significance. The addition of social satire targeting capitalism and corporate control serves as a humorous icing on a delicious cake.

  Nitro's set of skills makes her an excellent asset to have on the defending team, with her skills primarily serving as a means to
  <strong>
   beef up the defenses of both the A and B Sites.
  </strong>
  However, her combat drones can also play a great role in
  <strong>
   sniffing out the opposition on the attacking team
  </strong>
  , whilst also proving to be a nuisance when their cannon is put to good use. In this section, we will run through some general tips and tricks for playing Nitro in
  <em>
   FragPunk

  Use Chug Chug For Surveillance &amp; Diversion

 <p>
  Chug Chug is not the most practical skill on the surface. The drone itself is fairly easy to destroy, and its cannon deals just 20 damage per shot—not exactly an ideal weapon. However, Chug Chug shines in two key scenarios: surveillance and diversion. Since Chug Chug can be controlled remotely, players can use it to
  <strong>
   scout ahead in the immediate area
  </strong>
  , spotting enemies around corners or key points of interest to anticipate their movements. It also
  <strong>
   allows players to ping enemy positions
  </strong>
  for their team.
 </p>
 <p>
  On a similar note, Chug Chug
  <strong>
   serves as an excellent distraction
  </strong>
  for the enemy team. If a site is heavily guarded or an enemy is holding a key angle, deploying Chug Chug can be an effective way to divert their attention—especially when using its cannon. This creates an opening for allies to strike, catching the enemy off guard while they focus on taking out the drone. Chug Chug can also serve as a great means to eliminate other traps using its cannon, as the drone itself will not set them off.

  Many players tend to use The Wall primarily as a cover option, ducking behind it to avoid incoming fire or placing it in doorways to conceal allied traps. However, The Wall has several unique abilities that are often overlooked. For example,
  <strong>
   walls can be stacked on top of each other.
  </strong>
  While this may not always be the most effective use of the ability, stacking them can
  <strong>
   completely block a doorway
  </strong>
  , similar to Pathojen’s Shroom Wall.

  But that’s not all—The Wall can also be
  <strong>
   deployed to allow players to mantle onto structures that they otherwise couldn't
  </strong>
  , or to create a makeshift platform for accessing new angles. Combined with the stacking mechanic, this allows players to engage opponents unexpectedly, whether on offense or defense.

  When it comes to Mr. PewPew, players may be tempted to throw the turret on the ground or in a doorway and call it a day. However,
  <strong>
   the turret thrives in open space
  </strong>
  , particularly due to its large detection radius. Instead of placing it low for site defense, players will get better results by
  <strong>
   throwing the turret high up
  </strong>
  at site entrances or even in the middle of the site itself to maximize coverage. This tactic also benefits attackers—positioning Mr. PewPew high up to watch a planted Converter or attaching it to the ceiling of the site to flush out enemies.
 </p>
 <div class="valnet-gallery">
  <div class="article__gallery type-gallery" data-article-gallery="article-gallery-modal-3-978792090" data-gallery-id="main-carousel-3-978792090" data-gallery-lightbox="gallery-modal-3-978792090" data-gallery-thumbnail-id="gallery-thumbnails-3-978792090" data-gallery-thumbnail-img-class="gallery-thumbnails-3-978792090-img" id="article-gallery-3-978792090">

    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p>
  Another way to use Mr. PewPew, especially for attackers, is
  <strong>
   a quick way to reveal enemy positions.
  </strong>
  For instance, if players hear opponents inside a site or around a corner but aren't sure of their exact location, they can throw Mr. PewPew inside. If the turret detects an enemy, its laser and
  <strong>
   the damage numbers from its shots will expose their position
  </strong>
  , making it easier to rush in for the kill. The same strategy applies to defenders, who can take it one step further by placing Mr. PewPew in lanes leading up to each site to act as an early warning system.

  A
  <em>
   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  player has experienced an extremely weird glitch that has made their entire home disappear. The odd moment maybe connected to a recent patch that was released for
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  While the majority of the game has remained playable and enjoyable,
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  has been experiencing some bugs in recent times. Developer ConcernedApe has been hard at work figuring out what's behind the bugs and releasing patches to fix them, but some of the patches have also either caused or failed to fix some bugs in the game. This particular bug seems to have happened following installing a recent patch for
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Reddit user Chase2543 has shared their odd discovery that their house has vanished on their farm, with a blank black box taking up the space where it should be. Chase2543 is playing the Switch version of
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  , and notably updated the title just before this bug appeared. The house is actually still there, technically, but its visual appearance makes it look like a void has consumed it. Chase2543 explained that if they carefully skirt around the house, they can actually find the door and enter it, so thankfully, the necessary functionality in the game of going to sleep for the night isn't completely gone. However, in addition to throwing off the appearance of their farm, it could make getting into the house difficult in a rush, like when one is hurrying back just before the 2 am nightly cut-off.

 <p>
  Players seem to be in agreement that this bug likely has something to do with the recent Switch
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  patch that came out, but it doesn't seem that many have experienced it. However, plenty of fans have taken the opportunity to make jokes about the scene. Some have mused that Mayor Lewis took the house since players don't pay taxes, or that Pierre stole the house to sell it in his store. Others teased that the player must have done something to upset the spirits, while some joked that they had personally borrowed the player's house.

 <p>
  For the moment, there doesn't seem to be a known fix for this particular issue.
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  fans on the Nintendo Switch who haven't updated the game yet might choose to put it off, but the most recent patch did fix some bugs that could crash the game. It's ultimately up to the player, but the risk of facing a graphical glitch like this may be preferable to having to avoid parts of the game that aren't working properly.

  A
  <strong>
   <em>
    Palworld
   </em>
  </strong>
  player recently created an amazing lake house in the game and shared the results along with a quick tutorial on how to build a similar structure with other fans. Building is a huge part of
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  , and some dedicated gamers have been able to come up with incredible ideas for bases since the game’s release.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  was released in early access early in 2024, and it has been in development since then. Despite not being a full release yet,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  has been incredibly popular, exploding in popularity soon after its launch and selling over seven million copies in only five days. As time passed,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  reached over 32 million players on all platforms, including the ones who purchased it and the ones who played it via services such as Xbox Game Pass.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, a gamer called Vilestride- shared their latest creation with
  <em>
   Palword
  </em>
  , a beautiful lake house. In their post, Vilestride- showcased eight screenshots of the amazing construction, showing it from several angles, such as the beach near the lake, the terrace, a room inside the building, and more. In the post’s comments, Vilestride- also shared a short tutorial on how to build a lake house like this one, which lasts around six minutes. In the video, it’s possible to see detailed instructions about which building parts to use, where to place the building, and how to decorate it.

 <p>
  Like Vilestride-, other players often share the bases they’re most proud of with the community. Last month, for example, one
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  gamer designed an incredible base on Sakurajima Island, which was set near a waterfall and was gorgeous.

 <p>
  Last year, yet another gamer built a very realistic house in
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  , which resembled a bar. The place was decorated with wooden tables, stools, drinkware sets, barrels, and colorful rugs, looking like it took a lot of effort to create.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hopefully,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  players will come up with even more amazing creations after the game continues to improve its building system. Earlier this year,
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  developer Pocketpair shared its early access roadmap. The roadmap included several new features, such as co-op crossplay on all platformers, World Transfers for Pals, a Final Boss for the game, and much more. Unfortunately, the developers did not enter much detail about how they will keep improving the base system, but it’s expected that this part of the experience will keep increasing in quality as time passes and
  <em>
   Palworld
  </em>
  receives more updates.

  A leak shows that
  <strong>
   Sony
  </strong>
  has developed an AI prototype that can take on the persona of
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  's Aloy to engage in conversation with its users. Although only one character has been shown off following this test, it's possible that Sony could plan to use this tech with its other mascots like Kratos, Joel, Ellie, and many more once it's ready for a release.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has become clear that despite being somewhat quiet about their progress so far, many of the leading gaming companies are actively developing AI-based models and prototypes to achieve various goals. One example is the Microsoft Muse AI model, which was trained on Ninja Theory's
  <em>
   Bleeding Edge
  </em>
  to produce working versions of playable games to preserve older titles. Now, Sony appears to be putting its spin on AI technology.
 </p>
 <p>
  Per a report by The Verge, Sony is testing AI chat models, and its current mascots could end up being the faces of anything the company ultimately produces. A leaked video surfaced on the internet following an anonymous tip about Sony's recent experiments. In the video, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, a Sony Interactive Entertainment software engineering director, speaks to a version of Aloy from
  <em>
   Horizon Forbidden West
  </em>
  that's been powered by AI in collaboration with developer Guerrilla Games.

 <p>
  Raghoebardajal has a short conversation with Aloy, asking how she's doing before she mentions having a sore throat, which may have been a joke to explain why she doesn't sound like the iconic Ashly Burch rendition. After small talk, Raghoebardajal asks a bit about Aloy's backstory, and she talks about her journeys, referencing moments from the
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  games. To achieve this, the team at Sony used OpenAI's Whisper along with GPT-4, Meta's Llama 3, and Sony's Emotional Voice Synthesis technology. This led to a speech-to-text model capable of accounting for what the user is saying, making decisions, and responding with appropriate vocal and facial reactions to facilitate conversation. Although many have already seen the video, provoking mixed reactions, Muso, a copyright enforcement company attached to Sony, released a claim and took the source down.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are numerous directions that PlayStation could be headed with this type of AI technology. The AI model of Aloy answers questions about the world she inhabits, expanding on prompts and filling in gaps with details from her game's story. There's a chance that this could be implemented as an interactive way for players to refresh on stories if they've missed out. For a practical approach, this model could end up replacing or working alongside the PS5 Game Help feature, but it could also be used for things like events or exhibits. Regardless, it doesn't seem like Sony is ready to officially reveal this tech just yet.

  <strong>
   Open-world games
  </strong>
  have long captivated players with their freedom, offering diverse methods of traversal across sprawling environments. As technology and the genre have evolved, new ways to explore have emerged, including
  <strong>
   flight without traditional transport
  </strong>
  , which is arguably the most thrilling way to navigate vast worlds. Many standout open-world titles now
  <strong>
   let their players fly naturally
  </strong>
  , explained through varied means like superhero-like abilities, magical artifacts, scientific gear, special suits, or even rideable flying mounts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though still relatively uncommon in the genre, non-vehicle flight elevates the experience—both literally and figuratively. It provides players with fast, exciting ways to reach their destinations while, more importantly, offering a breathtaking new perspective on the game's beautiful landscapes, revealing intricate environmental details from above.
 </p>
 <p>
  For this list, we'll rank modern open-world titles (released no earlier than 2015) with stunning graphics, focusing solely on
  <strong>
   games that let players fly
  </strong>
  using skills, abilities, special gear, or exotic mounts, thus excluding conventional vehicles like planes or helicopters, which are far more common in the genre. Rankings are
  <strong>
   based purely on flight mechanics
  </strong>
  , and not any other aspects of a game.

   <em>
    Palworld's
   </em>
  </strong>
  runaway success owes much to its creature-collecting charm, captivating fans of
  <em>
   Pokémon
  </em>
  -style games. Beyond the creatures players can gather for various tasks, the game introduces flying Pals like Nitewing, Vanwyrm, Beakon, Ragnahawk, Frostallion, and Jetragon. These act as handy flying mounts, offering sustained, nearly unrestricted flight limited only by occasional stamina depletion. Fortunately, stamina recharges quickly; players simply let their Pals rest briefly to catch their breath before taking to the skies again.
 </p>
 <p>
  While
  <em>
   Palworld's
  </em>
  flight mechanics show promise, the game remains in early access with a relatively small development team. As a result, flying isn't as refined or thrilling as it is in some other open-world titles, at least for the time being.

  Even years after its release,

   <em>
    Batman: Arkham Knight
   </em>
  </strong>
  remains one of the finest Batman games ever crafted and a pinnacle for Rocksteady Studios. The open world of Arkham City is vast and stunning, offering players multiple ways to explore, from roaring through the streets in the Batmobile to soaring with impressive gliding mechanics.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though Batman's cape-based gliding doesn't fully qualify as flight, players can unlock upgrades to boost aerial control, distance, and speed. Better yet, combining the cape with the grappling hook and leveraging the environment can extend airtime significantly. Once mastered, this traversal method comes remarkably close to vehicle-free flight, becoming the go-to way to navigate the city.

  Greek mythology offers a rich wellspring for gaming inspiration. It boasts a roster of mythical monsters and artifacts that bestow godlike powers on its heroes. In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Immortals Fenyx Rising
   </em>
  </strong>
  , players acquire several such tools throughout their journey, with the wings standing out as the most valuable. This mythology-infused open world from Ubisoft prioritizes exploration, making aerial abilities a cornerstone of the experience, so getting the wings quickly to be able to fly is a must.
 </p>
 <p>
  Crafted by Daedalus, these wings allow Fenyx to glide and briefly take flight after building momentum, with stamina upgrades extending their potential. Players can unlock various improvements, and thus more airtime, by defeating the servants of Typhon the Titan. Before long, they'll soar with skill enough to rival Icarus himself.

  in a while might find this surprising, since the game has always featured plenty of flight strictly through spaceship mechanics. Yet, post-2021 updates have significantly shaken things up. Among various new features and gameplay options, these updates introduced rideable flying mounts that players can tame.
 </p>
 <p>
  These aerial creatures provide near-unrestricted flight across planetary surfaces, distinct from spaceship travel. They enable organic, low-altitude soaring over procedurally generated worlds. With a variety of tamable creatures boasting impossible designs, players gain a fresh and unique way to navigate a galaxy of unmatched scale.

  The
  <em>
   Just Cause
  </em>
  series is renowned for its massive open worlds, making varied traversal options a necessity for player convenience. The addition of a wingsuit paired with a grappling hook proves brilliant. It lets protagonist Rico Rodriguez glide skillfully across the landscape, using momentum and the environment to his advantage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wingsuit debuted in
  <em>
   Just Cause 3
  </em>
  , but its sequel,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Just Cause 4
   </em>
  </strong>
  , elevates the chaotic sandbox experience further. It introduces even more unique tricks to Rico's toolkit. Players can still turn to traditional aircraft when needed, or even use their gear to hijack vehicles mid-air. Now, you don't get to see something like this in gaming too often.

  The post-apocalyptic
  <em>
   Horizon
  </em>
  world brims with machines of all sorts. Most resemble dinosaurs, posing a constant threat to the surviving human tribes. Fortunately, protagonist Aloy wields a staff to override their programming and turn them to her advantage. Some become mounts, carrying her across the treacherous landscape. The sequel builds on this concept by introducing aerial mounts, though players must advance well into the story to unlock this feature.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
  <strong>
   <em>
    Horizon Forbidden West
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Aloy can hack a Pterosaur-like machine called a Sunwing. Riding this creature offers a stunning bird's-eye view of the primitive world below, although its implementation could benefit from more creativity. Nevertheless, from such heights, even the massive T-Rex-inspired Thunderjaw appears insignificant.

    Hogwarts Legacy

  </strong>
  ranks among the most versatile open-world games with flight mechanics to date. This open-world RPG invites players to explore Hogwarts and its surrounding areas through fluid aerial traversal, offering more than just one method to take flight. Instead, players can pick their preferred tool for seamless soaring: a trusty broomstick or one of several magical creatures.
 </p>
 <p>
  True to the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  universe, this world teems with magical beings that rule the skies. The most iconic are Hippogriffs, striking creatures blending eagle and horse traits, with various types available to ride. Other options include Sepulcheria, Thestrals, and Graphorns. Though not as nimble as broomsticks, these majestic avian-equestrian mounts bring a grander flair to flight. Better still, they can carry players across Hogwarts and its sprawling countryside with ease. What more could a Potterhead want?

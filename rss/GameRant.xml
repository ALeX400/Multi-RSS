      <title>Pokemon Legends: Z-A's Spotlight on Lumiose City Hopefully Isn't End-All, Be-All</title>

  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends: Z-A
   </strong>
  </em>
  has the potential to break new ground for the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series by cementing the new mechanics and themes presented in
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  . The game will focus on the redevelopment of Lumiose City, but the Kalos region has too much to offer for
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  to be stuck in just one location.

 <p>
  Fans were surprised when the announcement of the next
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  game confirmed the Kalos region as the next to receive a makeover. But, as more news and theories began to spread, it became clear that Kalos would be the perfect region for a
  <em>
   Legends
  </em>
  game. Ever since the
  <em>
   X and Y
  </em>
  era ended without the typical third game, fans have complained that the story of the region felt unfinished.
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  provides a chance to rectify that by diving deeper into the history of the Kalos region's war and the ultimate weapon that ended it. The game’s story will focus on the urban redevelopment of Lumiose City, Kalos’ hub location, with The Pokemon Company confirming that the entire game will take place within the city’s limits. But, in a region with so much to offer, it would be a tragedy if players couldn’t return to other locations from the
  <em>
   X and Y
  </em>
  games.

 <p>
  Based on real-world France, the Kalos region hosts some of the most beautiful locations in the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  series, all inspired by the natural, architectural, and historical variety of one of Europe’s most visited locations. Lumiose City is home to the iconic Prism Tower, which will likely play a central role in
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  , but the memorable locations don’t stop there, and the game shouldn’t either. The mysterious beauty of the Anistar City Sundial and its link to Mega Evolution would be a wonder to see in an updated art style. Parfum Palace holds too much historical significance not to be part of the game’s narrative. If the game stays locked in Lumiose, it would be giving up chances to enhance parts of the gameplay and story that would be better served by the larger region.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a focus on redevelopment of the region’s major city, it would be reasonable for most of the game to occur there, but certain areas of the region must at least be referenced in
  <em>
   Legends: Z-A
  </em>
  in order to create thematic unity between the games. It may be that part of the development efforts focus on bringing the greater Kalos region into Lumiose City. This would at least offer players a reminder of the wondrous setting around them, even if the decision is made to exclude certain areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the Kalos Region's most interesting locations include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Parfum Palace
  </li>
  <li>
   The Anistar City Sundial
  </li>
  <li>
   Geosenge Town
  </li>
  <li>
   Ambrette's Fossil Lab and Aquarium
  </li>
  <li>
   Santalune Forrest
  </li>
  <li>
   The Sea Serpent's Den
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="staying-in-lumiose-might-have-some-advantages">
  Staying in Lumiose Might Have Some Advantages
 </h3>
 <p>
  Anyone who’s played
  <em>
   Pokemon X and Y
  </em>
  will remember Lumiose City and instantly understand why it needs to be redeveloped. The location does an excellent job of capturing the hustle and bustle of a worldwide tourist spot, but part of that feeling is the ability to get lost easily. To its credit, the game makes sure there’s plenty to do in every corner of the city by packing it with memorable locations. Some fans would say that the returning landmarks in Lumiose City are grand enough to carry the game by themselves. Locations like the Looker Bureau and the Stone Emporium could offer enough potential for unique quests and storylines. With all that the city has to offer, some might argue that including outside locations would, ironically, make the game feel smaller when returning to the hub city.
 </p>
 <h3 id="a-large-region-was-key-to-the-success-of-legends-arceus">
  A Large Region was Key to the Success of Legends: Arceus
 </h3>
 <p>
  Because the
  <em>
   Pokemon Legends
  </em>
  games are a brand-new subset of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, it’s still not clear to fans, or maybe even developers, what works best for this type of experience. What they can look to though, is what worked well in
  <em>
   Legends: Arceus
  </em>
  . One of the best parts of that game was exploring a familiar region and finding hidden locations in Hisui. If
  <em>
   <strong>
    Pokemon Legends: Z-A
   </strong>
  </em>
  forgoes the region surrounding Lumiose city, it risks eliminating an important part of the last game's success.

  The
  <strong>
   Departing Blossom outfit
  </strong>
  in
  <em>
   Infinity Nikki
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   3-star Fresh-themed outfit
  </strong>
  that is unlocked by completing various
  <strong>
   faction styling challenges in the Wishing Woods
  </strong>
  . This means that you will need to have at least reached the Wishing Woods region of the game by progressing to at least
  <strong>
   Chapter 6
  </strong>
  in the main story questline.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you've done that, you can then start exploring the Wishing Woods and finding the members of each faction in the region to compete in their respective styling challenges. These involve following a certain theme requested by the faction member (e.g. - Fresh, Cool, Elegant) and putting together an outfit that meets their standards. The higher your score, the more rewards you will receive, and they can include a piece of the Departing Blossom outfit as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  The faction members that carry outfit sketches with their rewards include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Aiboda
   </strong>
   (Glam Squad) - Level 8 Difficulty; 'Blossoming Bouquet' (earring accessory) sketch (Average Score)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Sinida
   </strong>
   (Glam Squad Leader) - Level 9 Difficulty; 'Wind of Thoughts' (top) sketch (Average Score)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Jesanda
   </strong>
   (Time for Work) - Level 9 Difficulty; 'Petal Whisper' (headband accessory) sketch (Average Score)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Piralibo
   </strong>
   (Time for Work Leader) - Level 10 Difficulty; 'Smoky Blue' (skirt) sketch (Average Score)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Heyda
   </strong>
   (Choir of Wishes) - Level 10 Difficulty; 'White Petals' (socks) sketch (Average Score)
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Sieyeda
   </strong>
   (Choir of Wishes Leader) - Level 10 Difficulty; 'Divine Memories' (shoes) sketch (Average Score)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If you're having a difficult time defeating any of the above faction members, remember to
  <strong>
   Glow Up your outfit pieces and Eurekas
  </strong>
  with Shiny Bubbles and Shining Particles respectively. This will dramatically improve your overall scores and also help you with all other styling challenges in the game such as the Mira Crown.

  Once you have the entire sketch for the Departing Blossom outfit, you will then need to craft it in order to wear it. That means you will need to gather a variety of resource items found across most regions in Wishfield. To gather item Essences, remember that you need to unlock the appropriate ability enhancement nodes on the Heart of Infinity Grid for their respective regions.

  Below is a list of all the items required to craft the Departing Blossom outfit and how to obtain them.

   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  bundle that includes a plethora of different cosmetic items, but fans aren't happy about it.

  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   On February 4, Activision released a new PlayStation Plus exclusive store bundle for
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    Warzone
   </em>
   . The bundle includes two operator skins: Exterminator and Clear Cut. The former is for Elizabeth Grey, and the latter is for Hasib Nazir. Numerous other cosmetic items are also included, such as three weapon blueprints, emblems, stickers, double XP tokens, and much more. The release of the bundle left many fans confused, largely because
   <em>
    Call of Duty
   </em>
   's publisher, Activision, is now owned by Microsoft. Yet, despite the two companies being tied together, Xbox Game Pass subscribers haven't been treated to the same benefit.

  Black Ops 6's New PS Plus Bundle Has Angered Fans
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  players are once again unhappy with Activision, this time over the new PlayStation Plus store bundle that was released earlier this week. In a new post on Reddit, user Unknown_Mafia786 said that the bundle is "by far the scummiest thing Activision [has] ever done." The user then explained that both operator skins included in the free bundle have previously been included in paid bundles. The two skins were previously available in the Blood Letting and Jungle Trooper bundles, but can now be obtained for free by users who are subscribed to PlayStation Plus, which some fans believe isn't fair to those who have already purchased the skins.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the community clearly isn't happy, not everyone seems to agree that this is the "scummiest" thing Activision has ever done. Reddit user Pavlovs_Human quickly reminded the original poster of
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's controversial Blackcell Battle Pass, which is a premium edition of the game's paid Battle Pass with even more cosmetic items. "BlackCell is scummy. Selling skins for $30 is scummy. This is actually consumer friendly we should want MORE of this," the user said. Many others were quick to remind fellow players that purchasing skins in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  is "part of the problem."

 <p>
  This isn't the first time that fans have been unhappy over
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's operator skins, and it likely won't be the last. According to a new leak, a new bundle is set to hit the in-game store sometime in Season 2 that will be priced at 3,300 COD Points, making it one of the most expensive bundles in
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   <em>
   </em>
  </span>
  ​​​​​​history. Fans have previously expressed their frustrations during
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's
  <em>
   Squid Game
  </em>
  event due to the price of the skins, so there's likely going to be even more backlash headed Activision's way when the aforementioned bundle is released.

  Whether the player is relatively new to the game or has been playing for a while, they will constantly find themselves moving things around and changing things as they unlock new stock, purchase expansions, and invest in more shelving units. There are lots of great ways to set up a store in

  Let's go over some of the most interesting and useful ones.

  <em>
   TCG Card Shop Simulator is receiving regular updates. While this steady stream of updates does bring in new things for players to do, it does mean that regular changes are needed within the player's store to fit the ever-growing volume of products on the shelves. The original piece had 8 entries. This update will bring in two additional entries.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The first is centered around the secondary store, which can be used as a playroom, creating plenty of additional room in the player's larger store. The second is a minimalist design. Sometimes, the best answers are the simplest ones.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Perfect For New Players
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Players are limited as to what they can do early on. Initially, it does take a few weeks for players to save up enough money to begin branching out into better stock, expansions, and new shelving units. Unless the player is lucky enough to pack a valuable Ghost Card early on, they'll need to optimize the speed at which customers get served.
 </p>
 <p>
  To do this,
  <strong>
   players should keep their register close to the door
  </strong>
  . The same goes for their stock. If the stock is close to the door, then customers won't waste time walking around the inside of the store. If the player really wants to make things more efficient, then they can place a couple of card tables in the window. This will prevent any customers from walking around the empty back area of the store.

   Focus On Purchasing A Small Selection Of Licenses To Make Things Easier Early On
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While purchasing expansions does increase the number of customers the player will receive in a day, it can also be tricky filling all the space that comes with expanding the store. Some players may prefer to keep the store small but packed.
  <strong>
   It's possible to fit a surprising amount of stock in a relatively small space
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  Not only does this design save players the extra costs that come with expanding a store, but it is also much easier to order and refill shelves as everything is close together.

 <ul>
  <li>
   This Can Help To Create A More Natural Flow Through The Player's Store
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Card tables are a great side hustle. However,
  <strong>
   as the player's store grows in popularity, it's very easy for things to get a little cramped in the main store
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
  While having a busy store is great, if there are too many customers inside, things can get a little messy. Managing restocking shelves, serving customers, and dealing with smelly individuals can be difficult if there is just a sea of people throughout the store.
 </p>
 <p>
  To help combat this, the player can move their tables into the second store. This creates a clear divide between customers and players. This divide can help to make it easier for the player to keep an eye out for smelly customers. Not only that but with less foot traffic in the main store, the player will be able to spot any potential traders and smelly customers easily.

   Only Stocking One Of Each Item Can Help To Create Space For Displays And Tables
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  There are a lot of items that players will unlock as they progress. Once a new item has been purchased by the player, it's important to keep it out on a shelf for customers to buy.
  <strong>
   If the player decides to purchase the license to sell a new item only to decide not to put it on a shelf, customers will begin leaving the store dissatisfied with the service
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Players who want an easy ride may want to consider a minimalist design. Instead of having full shelving units dedicated to one particular item, players can instead only give each item one small section on a shelving unit. While this will mean that the player (or their staff members) will need to restock the shelves pretty frequently, it does open up plenty of additional space for things like card tables and display units.

   Creates An Additional Makeshift Store Within The Player's Main Store
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  With a bit of clever placement,
  <strong>
   it's possible to create a gap behind a single-sided shelving unit that acts as a hidden area.
  </strong>
  This area can be used for more stock, or as a storage area. However, it's often best used for card tables. It creates a nice little effect that allows customers to come and play cards out of the way of wandering customers.
 </p>
 <p>
  It also separates the store a little bit, making a clear divide between the store itself and the playing area. By doing this, players can use store B as a dedicated store room as they won't need to give up any space in there for stock or card tables.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Stocking Only One Item Type Is A Great Get-Rich-Quick Method
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  There's a bit of an exploit that players can use to make over $30,000 every game day. To do this, the player needs to find one high-profit item. For the most part, this will be a booster box. When they have selected an item,
  <strong>
   they will only need a few shelves placed close to the door.
  </strong>
  If the player puts down a register close by and then stocks the shelves with that one high-profit item, they will make lots of money quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  While this method doesn't exactly please customers, and it doesn't look good either, it is a great way of getting rich quickly. A lot of players do this relatively early on so that they can afford all the items necessary to furnish a top-notch store further down the line.

   By Filling A Large Part Of A Store With Tables, The Player Will Be Able To Make Money Without Having To Be Overly Concerned With Filling Shelves
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Card tables are a great way of making some passive income. Not only that but depending on the game selected by the player, the values of certain items can be increased.
  <strong>
   Players who have large portions of their stores dedicated to card tables tend to also lay down a few tables for selling single cards.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Selling single cards can be very profitable, especially if the player sells cards that are tied to the specific table game that they have going on. If the player has the tables in the center of the store, then they can build around them and create quite an elaborate design with the tables as the central point.

   A Visually Pleasing Store Design
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  For those who want a more visually pleasing store design, the color-coded option may just be the perfect choice. By arranging items by their color instead of their type,
  <strong>
   players can create a smooth rainbow effect that is very pleasing to the eye.
  </strong>
  While it may make ordering stock a little more time-consuming, the visual effect of everything matching is a nice effect to have.
 </p>
 <p>
  This may take some time, but there are a few key colors like red, green, yellow, and purple that show up multiple times across all product categories. Once the player reaches shop level 80, they will have unlocked all the items needed to have a color-coded store that's made up of every item in the game.

   Perfect For Players Who Enjoy Showing Off Their Top Cards
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While they won't net the player any money, display units are great for making a store look more inviting. Unfortunately, there aren't any decorations that can be placed on the walls. So, the only way to make the interior look better is by either using mods or investing in some display shelves.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the player progresses, they'll open up thousands of packs. If the player is lucky, then they will end up with a nice collection of rare and valuable cards. Instead of keeping them hidden away inside a binder,
  <strong>
   players can display the cards they are most proud of inside these units.
  </strong>
  By doing this across the back wall, players can make something that looks almost like a museum exhibit inside their store. Just be sure to leave enough space for regular stock.

   Grouping Items Together Can Make Restocking And Ordering Stock Much Easier
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   One of the most popular store layouts is one that displays items in their groups.
  </strong>
  For example, all the cards will be next to each other, the same goes for figurines and plushies. This not only looks good, but it also makes ordering stock a breeze. If the player groups items together in the same order that they appear in on the stock order app, then they can scroll through in order and buy all of the items they need without having to keep going in and out of the app. Having a natural flow is great for ordering stock, filling shelves, and it looks good too. A store with a natural product flow gives off a welcoming and tidy vibe.

      <title>One Clever GTA 5 Feature Will Likely Be Taken to New Heights in Grand Theft Auto 6</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/gta-5-feature-grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-phones-influencer-social-media/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  It's quite clear that
  <strong>
   <em>
    Grand Theft Auto 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  is set to be the biggest release of the year. Rockstar's beloved crime-filled action series is set to get its next mainline entry this year, marking 12 long years between chapters.
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  has been highly anticipated for years now, and its impending arrival has many eager to jump into the party-loving world of Vice City.

  Most of the details of
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's deeper story are currently under wraps, but what little information was offered in the game's first and only trailer offered a few peeks into what to expect. While some questions about
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  still remain unanswered, the presence of social media and phones was made abundantly clear.
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is bound to continue the tradition of including a mobile device, but cell phones are a completely different ball game now.
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  took the phone mechanic to its greatest heights yet, but
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  has so much more room to grow in this aspect.

  Since
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  hit the scene back in 2013, the evolution of cell phones has been wild to watch unfold. Granted, cell phones back in 2013 were still plenty impressive, as the first iPhone was released six years before, in 2007. However, the changes that have happened between 2013 and 2025 are even more mind-boggling. From high-powered cameras to the ability to play video games like
  <em>
   Resident Evil 4
  </em>
  on the iPhone 15 Pro, these devices have become far more powerful.

  GTA 6's Phone Could Play an Even Bigger Role in the Story
 </h3>
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  , the in-game phone was an essential tool, and
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  is bound to take its usage to the next level in order to reflect the present day setting of Vice City, especially with influencer culture being such a big part of society. There are a variety of upgrades that could be made to
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's phone that would bring immersion to even greater heights.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Social media apps
  </li>
  <li>
   Live-streaming
  </li>
  <li>
   Dating apps
  </li>
  <li>
   Video calls
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The above is just a few of the possibilities that could bring a big upgrade to
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  's phone mechanics. Of course, it's possible that
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  may simply wish to refine the base mechanics of
  <em>
   GTA 5
  </em>
  's phone, but with the franchise's knack for reflecting society, a greater emphasis on using the game's phone seems likely. It's unclear just how much Rockstar plans to shake up the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  franchise, but with 12 years between releases, it leads one to think that there may be some major updates in store.

  Since Its Announcement Trailer, GTA 6 Has Remained in the Shadows
 </h3>
 <p>
  The first and only trailer for
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  was released in December 2023, and while it was a thrilling moment for fans who had been waiting so long, Rockstar has once again resigned itself to a long vow of silence. The lack of updates has begun to inspire wild theories about
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  , so Rockstar will hopefully bring more news into the spotlight sooner, rather than later.

  As of now, the wait for
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  continues. The hype surrounding the title is palpable, and analysts are even predicting
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  will have a massive impact on the entire gaming industry. Due to the sheer power and reach the
  <em>
   GTA
  </em>
  franchise has, that seems inevitable, but only time will tell. Until then,
  <em>
   GTA 6
  </em>
  remains a fertile ground for speculation and theories to grow, and it will be fascinating to see which ones turn out to be true.

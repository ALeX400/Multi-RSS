  Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon was born as the fruit of the love between the Urcheon of Erlenwald (also known as Emyr Var Emrheis) and Princess Pavetta of Cintra. Theirs was a doomed love story, never meant to be, but their unfortunate meeting was bound by the Law of Surprise, a powerful geis that is said to bind the fates of two people. So, when the cursed heir to the Imperial Throne of Nilfgaard met Pavetta, it was pure fate that made them meet. They thought they were in love, but it was a powerful ancient magic that drew them together.

 <p>
  On the other hand, Cirilla's mother's bloodline ties her to two characters from
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  lore that are known for their exploits, and infamous at the same time. One is Lara Dorren Aep Shiadhal, an ancient and powerful elven sorceress who led her people away from the broken Elven world after the Conjunction of the Spheres. Lara fell in love with the human mage Cregennan of Lod, and together they sired Riannon, one of the first half-elven children.

  Riannon had powerful magic that was nearly uncontrollable, and she ended up being adopted by the queen of Redania after her parents were murdered. Thus, these powerful magic users' bloodlines also transmitted the "curse" of their lineage up to Cirilla's nearest ancestor, Falka, also known as The Bloody. That's what makes Ciri's ancestry quite the talk among heraldric experts, and a target for magicians both elven and human alike.

  Since Cirilla not only inherited her aptitude for Elven Magic but also a lot of the tools of the Witcher's trade, she is quite powerful. But there are also a couple of things that make her particularly special: she has the power to see beyond past, present, and future, a gift that seems to have been sparked somewhere around Ciri's elven lineage (and probably related to Ithlinne). Like her ancestor Lara Dorren, she is also a space-time mage, or "Navigator," a power she used to evade her persecutors for nearly a decade.

  Cirilla is also gifted with Telepathic abilities, which seem to be more attuned with animals than humanoids, this is why she was able to speak with "Horsey" (a.k.a. Ihuarraquax) a unicorn that saved her life more than once and guided her back to her world. Perhaps, she will be able to wield these powers in
  <em>
   The Witcher 4

  When Cirilla fled Vilgefortz's clutches using her newly awakened powers, she teleported to the Desert of Korath, located southeast of the Northern Kingdoms, in the easternmost part of Nilfgaard. Here she nearly met her demise due to exhaustion, dehydration, and famine, but thanks to a unicorn whelp named Ihuarraquax, who she rescued from a giant Antlion monster, she managed to find water, food, and solace in a travel companion.

 <p>
  Together, they carried on their journey through the desert, though Ciri's powers were lost by a powerful mind block she imposed on herself by rejecting Falka's latent bloodline, which nearly drove her mad and caused her to end the world. Both Cirilla and Ihuarraquax parted ways when the little one was able to find his pack, but he would return later as an adult (since the time in their dimension works differently than in Ciri's) to aid her again when she needed him most.

  As the heiress of Cintra's throne and Nilfgaard's Empire, Ciri is the rightful ruler of most of the Northern Realms and the Empire, since she is also related to the Redanian (by mother's side) royal family, and to several other of the kingdoms by right of marriage and ancestry. Through her Grandmother's second marriage, she is also a rightful heir to the Skellige Islands and part of Cidaris and Verden by right of conquest.

  Ages ago, using schemes and the excuse of a prophecy about a solar eclipse, mages all around the Northern Realms (and beyond) banded together in a tremendously well-devised conspiracy to track down Ancient Elven ancestry in the heirs of the Kingdom's most notorious kings and queens, and to conduct the most horrendous experiments, getting away with some of the heinous acts that would spark a generation-spanning war. So, the wizards managed to convince the kings and queens that some of their heirs born during the eclipse would be cursed forever and should be imprisoned in towers as far from society as possible.

  This, of course, is revealed in Renfri's tale to Geralt of Rivia, but there are lots of clues spread by Sapkowski throughout
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  saga about The Black Sun Prophecy being bogus and an excuse for mages to experiment on forbidden magic like the one that created the Witchers. How does this relate to Ciri, then? Well, at some point throughout the years, some mages managed to convince Emhyr to give away Pavetta for experimentation, in exchange for that they would spare Cirilla and grant him the opportunity to rule the Empire. So, yes, Emhyr sold her one true love and endangered his daughter at the same time, a foolish act that would doom the world.

  Since her birth is the product of the ages of meticulously planned "selective breeding," orchestrated by mages to create a powerful Source (font of magic incarnated in a person) she is also biologically suited to become a Witcher and survive the terrible Trial of the Herbs.

 <p>
  It is possible that she is the most perfect candidate to be subjected to the changes without altering her biology radically, making her a Witcher and possibly allowing her to pass down her mutations to future generations. Unlike other Witchers and mutants, she could avoid becoming sterile during the process which leads to a lot of possible ramifications for
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  saga. An excuse for more sequels perhaps? Time will tell.

  After the Tor Lara incident and crossing the Korath desert, Cirilla of Cintra was heartbroken. Her powers were gone, and as she was a fugitive of both the Empire and chased by Wizards all across the continent, what better than to join a gang of thieves and murderers under the moniker of Falka? Ciri explored her worst nature while she was part of the Rats of Geso, a bunch of war orphans who banded together to lash out at the society that had shunned them.

 <p>
  During her time as a bandolier, Ciri suffered a lot and grew into a teenager while going through an ordeal. She managed to somehow retain some sanity and humanity, despite the gang being forced to rob, murder, and worse to survive. During that time, Cirilla also got her famous Heart-shaped tattoo and fell in love for the first time, only to lose it all once again when Leo Bonhardt, the most notorious bounty hunter murdered her whole crew in front of her eyes.

  A recurrent topic in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  lore has always been the Ithline prophecy, which alongside the Black Sun prophecy were the two determining factors in the development of the meta-narrative of the series. Ithiline prophesized the end of the world in an age of war and chaos where the wolf and the axe would cull the weak and only the strong would survive. But most importantly, she predicted the birth of a powerful sorcerer (or sorceress) that would tap into the power of Fire (forbidden for all magic users) to remake the world.

 <p>
  According to one of the parts in Ithlinne's soothsaying, the world would be restored after being burned to ashes: "It will be reborn of Elder Blood, of Hen Ichaer, of the seed that has been sown. A seed which will not sprout but burst into flame." This was most definitely talking about Ciri's tap into the source of Fire in the desert and the events that were sparked after that.

  Ciri's instruction as a sword user started young when Geralt saw the need to teach her how to protect herself in the worst-case scenario, but it was later revealed that Calanthe had secretly been training her as well. Calanthe was a jealous and doting grandmother, and after the loss of Pavetta to the "shipwreck" who also allegedly killed Dunny (Emhyr) she became notoriously more fierce about her grandaughter's education.

 <p>
  So she taught her a lot, a crash course on how to rule and direct an army. Though Ciri was too young to consider all this as important, she retained some of the teachings of the best swordmasters, one of them being Eist Tuirseach, king of Skellige. She would later be taught about swordplay by Vesemir, Lambert, Eskel, and Cohen. They drill-trained her to hone her sword skills to the limits of human capacity and turned her into a killing machine.

  During her odyssey through time and space, Cirilla was captured by the Aen Aelle, the ancient elves who lived in a realm separated from the world of
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  . There, she was paired with Auberon Muicetarch, also known as "The AIling King," in the hopes of restoring the lineage of Lara Dorren and the Elven's time-space magic to their rightful owners.

 <p>
  Needless to say, this ended in failure, as neither Auberon nor Cirilla (which was being practically used as a breeding mare) were attracted to each other. During her stay with the elves, Cirilla discovers that the Aen Aella were always enslaving "lesser races," both humans like herself and Aen Sidhe who they captured and experimented with. This ended with Eredin Bréacc Glas (also known as Sparrowhawk and the Witch Hunt Leader) murdering Auberon and hunting Cirilla down to resume what the former king could not do. Cirilla escaped through a portal to realms unknown, evading the Wild Hunt for a while.

  The Lady Of The Lake, also known as Nimué, is a powerful transcendent Elven Sorcerer who is connected to both Ciri's bloodline and Codwiramus Tilly's family (Corinne Tilly) both of them worked together since Codwiramus was a powerful oneiromancer (dream mage) and was able to help Nimué locate the exact spot in space and time which she could use to contact Cirilla and ser her on the right path to correct history.

 <p>
  Her intervention has also been suggested to be much more important than what Sapkoski has revealed so far, and Nimué has also made several apparitions in
  <em>
   The Witcher
  </em>
  games, so it is probably that Ciri and The Lady of the Lake will have some kind of rapport in
  <em>
   Witcher 4
  </em>
  .

  During her travels across time and space, Cirilla was stranded in Avalon, a region of Britannia lost to all except a selected few. There, she not only met the prodigious Lady of The Lake but was escorted by none other than Galahad of Caer Benic to meet King Arthur himself. During her stay at Camelot, Ciri ended up befriending Galahad and then fell in love with him, so she narrated her story to his beloved.

 <p>
  This is revealed in Sapkowski's final book The Lady of The Lake in several added side-stories which weren't part of the original compilation. There's also a canonical ending for the series, but it is not related to the games, which are an alternate timeline. Be it as it may, there's a chance that the Ciri from
  <em>
   Witcher 4
  </em>
  has also participated in these events and it is yet to be revealed.

  During her flight from the Aen Aelle's persecution, Cirilla was stranded in a gloomy and dangerous realm, filled with corpses, rats, and the stench of decay. She was then horrified by an army of fleas jumping over her body and stinging her, so she used her power to jump again and landed on one of the southern ports of the Northern Realms, near the border of Nilfgaard. The fleas, stunned by the time-space translocation jumped from her to a nearby rat, and the rat boarded a ship named The Catriona.

 <p>
  It was later revealed that this caused an epidemic known as "The Catriona Plague," which is none other than The Black Plague brought from our world by Ciri. This curious fact about Cintra's Princess and protagonist of
  <em>
   The Witcher 4
  </em>
  is a well-kept secret that not many fans know about.

  There are several ways to complete the quest quickly, with the various
  <em>
   Fortnite

  XP farming maps being some of the most popular methods. However, considering that this challenge requires only 100,000 XP, players can opt for a much simpler approach by simply focusing on the weekly or daily quests in
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  . The weekly quests reward 25K XP each, so doing around 4 of them should be more than sufficient.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Fallout 76
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’s Gleaming Depths raid is the new hardest content in the game, requiring endgame builds, coordinated teamwork, and a whole lot of ammo. However, finding a group of players to take on the new Gleaming Depths Raid in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is also proving to be quite difficult, highlighting the need for a matchmaking feature to finally be added to the game.

 <p>
  Players have requested for
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  to add a matchmaking feature for years now, except with the raid being as hard as it is, the need for this feature has reached a new extreme. Even outside of the new Raid, a matchmaking feature could help to breathe new life into the many endgame activities in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , keeping the game well and thriving
  <strong>
  </strong>
  for many years to come.

  While it’s possible for players to brute force some of the encounters in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s new Gleaming Depths Raid with less than a full team, or even solo, this Raid is widely considered to be the hardest content in all of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , so it’s generally best to bring a full team. However, finding a full team for the Raid is oftentimes an unnecessarily difficult task, so a matchmaking feature has become an increasingly popular request among
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s community.

 <p>
  For now, the closest thing to a matchmaking feature is creating a Public Team in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  . This sends a notification to all players on the same server to join the team, and there are specific teams dedicated to endgame activities like Raids, Daily Ops, and Expeditions. Even with Public Teams though, since servers have a limit of twenty-two players, finding a group of four players who are prepared for the Raid with a max-level, endgame build isn't always an easy task. Players often have to hop into multiple servers to find a server populated with raid-ready teammates or rely on community social media platforms, which many players have resorted to the latter.

  One of the most popular platforms to find teammates in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is currently Bethesda’s official Discord server. Additionally, there have already been three new Subreddits created for matchmaking since
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s Gleaming Depths and Season 19 update was released last week, r/F76Raids, r/FO76Raids, and r/fo76Teams. While these community resources are proving especially useful, players have been requesting a matchmaking feature in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  for years now, although the new Raid especially makes this feature needed now more than ever.

 <p>
  The Gleaming Depths Raid is extremely hard on its own, so finding a group shouldn't have to be an additional hurdle to overcome. Considering that the Raid is currently the only way to earn the new four-star legendary mods, Raid weapons, and the new Vulcan Power Armor set in
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  , adding a matchmaking feature will be a big step towards making these highly exclusive rewards more accessible to the broader community without the need for controversial nerfs.

 <p>
  Even beyond making the Raid and other endgame content more accessible, matchmaking could ultimately be the key to
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ’s longevity in general. More specifically, when or if
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  ever stops receiving major content updates, matchmaking could help to keep the community active by increasing engagement with specific activities for as long as the public servers stay online. While the end of
  <em>
   Fallout 76
  </em>
  is still likely many years away, it’s an inevitable part of every live service game’s lifecycle, though it’s still best to prepare for this moment sooner rather than later.

  Zombies brings more than just Monkey Bombs to the Tactical party, and those who want to discover the best things to craft with their Salvage can check the list of every Tactical equipment available to them in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6

  ’s Zombies mode, and just how one of them may save their life against the hordes to live for another round or several.

  Tactical Equipment is extremely useful in the right hands, and when used correctly, it can passively negate the effects of a Mangler, heal players from certain death, or even provide brief periods of respite to breathe and save allies in desperate need of a hand from a fellow survivor.

    Updated on December 13, 2024, by Jake Fillery:
   </strong>
   It's vital that players know the best Tactical Equipment for their Zombies loadout in Black Ops 6 so that they have the easiest time ahead for reaching high rounds and completing easter eggs efficiently. There are 7 different versions of Tactical Equipment in Black Ops 6, and with a changing meta, it's essential that players stay on top of the game and understand what the best one to use will be for their loadout and Salvage.

 <p>
  The Smoke Bomb is one of the more mediocre options that players have in their Tactical Equipment arsenal for zombies. The zombies found in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  aren’t exactly over-reliant on their eyes, so throwing down a smoke will obscure the player’s vision more than the overwhelming and aggressive hordes of rotting corpses.

 <p>
  The Smoke Bomb can be good for halting Mangler’s cannon attack, which will track players unless it’s through the smoke. However, the smoke is rather small and dissipates pretty quickly, and compared to other Tacticals, it’s not worth it, especially when players can't see the zombies within the smoke so they are basically at a visual disadvantage.

 <p>
  One of the most useful Tacticals in Multiplayer returns for the Zombies mode, in which players can inject themselves with a Stim Shot to provide a refreshing rate of health that beats out natural healing and Quick Revive’s Perk potential.

 <p>
  However, the Stim Shot can be easily interrupted, so if players are cornered and think a Stim Shot will shoot them back up to full health while they murder the horde that’s trapped them, they will be disappointed. The Stim Shot will stop healing if damage is taken, and the health regeneration is pretty average at best. However, being able to use a Stim Shot while running from a horde may influence the health regeneration to save the player's life before that one fatal swipe forces them to hit a game over.

  If there are too many zombies chasing a player down, then throwing a Concussion might help them thanks to its ability to completely halt the zombies in their tracks, leaving them dazed and confused for a couple of seconds, almost like they are ready to take a long nap.

 <p>
  The Concussion Grenade is also pretty funny for its trolling potential, as players can throw one into another player’s horde and watch the train get all messed up due to half of them sleeping on the job. It’s an okay tactical that’s beaten by others since the effects of a Concussion Grenade doesn't last all that long, and it doesn't impact Special and Elite Zombies. On top fo that, it can bounce around a lot, so throwing it at a charging zombie might result in the Concussion Grenade bouncing back to stun the player.

 <p>
  The Shock Charge provides the ground with a trip mine that deals electric damage, providing stun to enemies to halt them in their tracks. It’s great for stopping advancing and aggressive zombies, but doesn't do much to stop Manglers, Abominations, Amalgams, and Doppelghasts, and the extent of its ability is mainly just for the hordes of undead.

 <p>
  Throwing a Shock Charge is never a bad idea to temporarily stun a horde of zombies, and the damage it deals might not be the greatest, but it's definitely viable for high-round strategies, especially against a cluster of zombies that can be stunned while players shoot them relentlessly.

  The Decoy is the far cheaper Monkey Bomb that actually works almost better than the original. The Decoy can be thrown extremely fast and far, allowing players to revive their allies or grab some breathing room and an opportunity to hit the Mystery Box without cause for concern from a rushing horde slapping them down.

 <p>
  The Decoy can be thrown at enemies as it sticks to surfaces, and the horde will all rush to the Decoy until it eventually runs out. The time is quite generous with it, and its instant use makes it effective for playing fetch with zombies. The only real problem with the Decoy is that it can sometimes deactivate too soon, or zombies simply won't be close enough to hear it. Additionally, Special and Elite zombies do not care for the Decoy, and the tactical itself deals no damage when it runs out.

  The original Tactical Equipment is hard to beat, and who could want anything more out of the cheery and eerie Monkey Bombs? These classics have been with the series since the beginning, and they haven’t needed to improve or upgrade themselves to stay relevant.

 <p>
  The Monkey Bombs can deal a great amount of explosive damage after their time is up, but what’s truly special about them is how they distract every zombie. Every zombie will rush the Monkey Bomb and stand around while it plays its song, and once it's finished its song? Zombies go boom.

  If players have ever had the privilege of using the Gersh Device in older

   Call of Duty Zombies
  </em>
  titles like
  <em>
   Black Ops and Black Ops 3

  , then they will know just how superior it is to the Monkey Bombs. The LT53 Kazimir blesses players in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6

  , and it’s certainly a doozy with its black hole potential that rips through hordes.

 <p>
  The LT53 Kazimir is a more portable Gersh Device, and once thrown, every zombie nearby will be slowly dragged into the singularity, where they will be sucked in and instantly killed. Even better, is how if players are in a pinch, they can jump into the LT53 Kazimir to teleport like they are using the Anywhere But Here GobbleGum. It might take a lot to craft with Salvage, but it's entirely worth it to have a portable Monkey Bomb that kills zombies and stuns Special/Elite enemies.

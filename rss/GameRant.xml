  Most video games strive to be as accessible as possible, which is certainly a novel course of action to take. However, this leads to the vast majority of titles adopting the same control schemes and gameplay loops, which can become rather tiresome after a point for players who want to check out something new. Thankfully, some games got this memo and tried to innovate in some form or another, and titles that try to implement original controls instead of sticking to what works should be praised for the same.

 <p>
  After all, there are only so many times that players can press certain buttons to perform the same actions over and over again before they need something different to stimulate them. Switching up the way a controller's input works can go a long way in keeping players engaged from the get-go as they strive to master these unique controls and become experts in a game that can be tricky in the early going.

  One of the quirkiest games gamers can check out,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Katamari Damacy
   </em>
  </strong>
  lets players take on the role of a prince who must undo his father's harm and form planets to populate the cosmos once again. He achieves this by rolling a ball around that causes anything and everything to stick to it. This may sound silly, but players will slowly but surely get into the idea of avoiding larger objects and trying to increase their size as much as possible until the entire level is theirs to mess around with.

 <p>
  To roll this celestial sticky ball around, players use both analog sticks. This lends a ton of weight to the player's movement, making them feel like they're pushing themselves to roll around this massive object and accomplish a level's goals. It also helps them make precise movements if they need to avoid certain hazards and large objects as they try to roll over everything in sight, eventually bringing them one step closer to forming another star or planet.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Dark Souls
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the greatest video games ever made, paving the way for future games to try and emulate its success in some form or another. This applies to combat, too, with numerous video games opting to use shoulder and trigger buttons to let players attack, to the point where this has become commonplace in gaming. So, most gamers would be surprised to learn that this was far from the industry standard back when
  <em>
   Demon's Souls
  </em>
  and its sequel implemented this control scheme.

 <p>
  It's funny in hindsight to see gamers complain about this control scheme when it allowed for players to dodge and heal on the fly while preparing their attacks. It may not seem all that unique, but
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  ' massive success turned this unorthodox way of attacking into the norm that more and more players have become used to. It's just one of the many ways that FromSoftware's magnum opus shaped the gaming landscape for years to come.

  Bennet Foddy is a developer notorious for turning the simple act of moving around into one of the most ludicrously challenging parts of any video game, and shades of the same can be seen in
  <strong>
   <em>
    QWOP
   </em>
  </strong>
  . This absurd video game became a viral phenomenon back when it launched, with players being tasked with controlling one of the unwieldiest track runners of all time to cross the 100m finish line by individually controlling his thighs and calves.

 <p>
  This makes for a hilarious yet frustrating time as players continue to fall over numerous times before finally making progress. Even then, players need to learn how to skillfully manipulate this runner's muscles so that they can cross the finish line. Despite the game being as goofy as they come, the sense of achievement when players attain this seemingly impossible goal is something that very few games can match, showing why Bennet Foddy has become a reputed video game developer courtesy of this viral hit.

  The Nintendo DS was a unique portable console where many games utilized the dual screen to make for unique gaming opportunities. It can be argued that
  <strong>
   <em>
    The World Ends with You
   </em>
  </strong>
  was the best use of this gimmick on the handheld, with players understanding what made this title so special in the eyes of many when they initiated combat. This action RPG allowed for simultaneous combat scenarios where players controlled one character with the D-pad and buttons and the other with touch controls.

 <p>
  As one would expect, combat was frenetic and chaotic yet felt great once players got the hang of things. It was an excellent way to use the Nintendo DS, and it's a shame that re-releases of this game had to sacrifice this mechanic to work on a single screen. If players happen to own a DS, then playing
  <em>
   The World Ends with You
  </em>
  is downright mandatory to see how creative developers could get with the handheld's hardware.

  While the remake of
  <strong>

It may seem absurd, but using the analog sticks and shoulder buttons on each side of the gamepad to control both brothers made for a satisfying and unique gameplay loop.

 <p>
  Life is all about choices, some of which have no real impact on the future, but in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Until Dawn
   </em>
  </strong>
  , making the wrong ones can have catastrophic results.
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  allows players to decide the fate of the eight playable characters by employing a choice-based mechanic inspired by a branch of scientific study known as chaos theory, whereby certain events have a direct influence on others at a later date.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  , the worst obtainable ending requires all eight characters to be dead before the game's climax. As a result, a helicopter will descend upon the burning lodge and report no signs of survivors. In the best-case scenario, however, everyone lives. Making certain choices in earlier chapters can lock someone out of the game's best ending by dooming another character, so it's important to know what
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  to do. Here are some
  <strong>
   choices to avoid in order to guarantee the best ending (everyone lives) in
   <em>
    Until Dawn

  In Chapter 9, after Mike leaves for the Sanitorium, he leaves Sam, Ashley, Chris (determinant), and Emily (determinant) behind in the "safe room" of the lodge's basement. Sam takes charge and suggests they go after Mike, so the group uses the sewage tunnel as a passageway to the mines. Ashley trails behind after hearing Jessica's voice calling to her and comes to a crossroads where she can either investigate the voice or rejoin the group. In order to collect all the totems in
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  , Ashley needs to investigate.

 <p>
  However,
  <strong>
   Ashley does not need to interact with the trap door that's rattling in the large opening
  </strong>
  . She can simply walk past it. In fact, players shouldn't even unlatch it — it should be ignored altogether. On this route, completionists should make sure to go around the corner to find the totem sitting there for a chance at finding all the collectibles. If Ashley opens the trap door, the Wendigo will jump out and decapitate her.

 <p>
  It sounds fairly self-explanatory that for everyone to survive in
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  , it probably isn't helpful to have an itchy trigger finger. However, the game cleverly deceives players by making them believe that Emily is infected if she gets bitten by the Wendigo in Chapter 8. It's a tricky decision to make, as the truth isn't revealed until after the fact, so players can be led to think that sacrificing the one for the sake of the many is the way to go.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Not only is it horrific to imagine Mike shooting his ex-girlfriend, but it's also entirely unnecessary
  </strong>
  . As Ashley discovers shortly after via the Stranger's journal, Wendigo bites are harmless, meaning that Emily's bite mark is nothing more than a flesh wound. As such, not shooting Emily will allow her to live to see another day.

 <p>
  No one should go around shooting squirrels or attacking deer, but
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  plays dirty by building tension just enough to make QTEs feel entirely necessary. But as the game states in one of the opening segments of the game, during Jess and Mike's snowball fight,
  <strong>
   sometimes the best choice is to do nothing
  </strong>
  . If there's a squirrel chomping on a nut, a bird preening itself or a pack of deer closing in,
  <strong>
   players should not hurt them
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1022} -->

 <p>
  It can be indicated early on that harming nature is a big no-no going forward. If Jess hits the bird with a snowball, she and Mike narrowly evade impalement from a falling icicle. If Chris shoots the squirrel in Chapter 1, Sam is attacked by a crow and cannot successfully hide from the Psycho later on, and attacking the deer as Matt will lead to an ambush that causes him to lose his footing and potentially fall to his death (if the QTEs are missed).

  In Chapter 6, Chris and Ashley find themselves in one of Jigsaw's traps (not really), and Chris is faced with the difficult decision of shooting himself or Ashley before both of them are presumably sliced to shreds by overhead saws. Here's where the game gets tricky, since it ultimately doesn't matter who Chris chooses — both of them still live. However,
  <strong>
   if Chris chooses to shoot Ashley, their relationship falls to zero
  </strong>
  , and Ashley won't forget the betrayal. Later on, in Chapter 8, Chris and the Stranger venture out to the shed to check on Josh. When they find him missing, the Stranger is instantly killed by the Wendigo, forcing Chris to retreat to the lodge.

 <p>
  If he makes it there unscathed (provided he fights back against the Wendigo), then Ashley will be waiting to let him in — or not — depending on the choice made in Chapter 6.
  <strong>
   If Chris chose to shoot Ashley, she will hesitate too long before going for the door, allowing the Wendigo to catch up and decapitate Chris
  </strong>

  After Jessica is snatched through the cabin window in Chapter 4, Mike picks up a rifle and sets off after her. As he races through the woods in a snowstorm, he comes to several forks in the road, where he can decide to take the slower but safer path or the quicker, riskier one.
  <strong>
   If Mike chooses the slower path, Jessica will be dead before he can make it in time
  </strong>
  .

  Likewise,
  <strong>
   if Mike chooses the faster routes but fails any of the QTEs, Jessica will perish

  If Jessica makes it through Chapter 4, she won't be seen again until Chapter 10, when she can either reunite with Matt (determinant) or trek through the mines alone. Either way, Jessica (and Matt) will find themselves hunted down by the Wendigo, resulting in a short chase sequence that has Matt choosing between abandoning Jessica or hiding together until the threat passes.

  When the gang (determinant) make it back to the lodge in Chapter 10, they're being pursued by three Wendigos. This is where
  <em>
   Until Dawn
  </em>
  gets extremely frustrating, as any characters who have survived this long can all be killed off in the last 10 minutes if the wrong choices are made. Players control Sam in the most stressful part of the game as she distracts the Wendigos long enough for everyone else to escape.

 <p>
  Sam must complete several "Don't Move" sequences and choose between saving Mike, Emily, and Ashley, or running for the switch once Mike breaks the light bulb.
  <strong>
   If Sam runs for the switch immediately, the lodge goes up in flames, killing everyone inside
  </strong>
  . Players must make sure that all the characters have exited the lodge before Sam automatically runs for the switch.

  In Chapter 10, Mike and Sam go on the hunt for Josh to retrieve the cable car keys. In one section, they jump down into an underground lake. Sam can wander off to the left immediately after entering and climb up a small overhang to find Hannah's journal. In it, Hannah documents her slow descent into madness — and, eventually, cannibalism — that leads to the spirit of the Wendigo being unleashed.

  Sam also learns that Hannah devours Beth's body after months of being trapped underground.
  <strong>
   If Sam finds the journal, Josh will recognize the Wendigo as Hannah when he is attacked, thus leading her to spare his life

  as a fair share of QTEs, some of which are extremely hard to mess up, but others creep up unexpectedly. In situations such as Matt hanging off the cliff or Emily running along the conveyor belt, the game is lenient with QTEs and allows a few tries to get it right. For these segments, the player would realistically have to actively be trying to get everyone killed to fail them.

  However, the opposite happens in sections such as Sam running from the Psycho, where a QTE pops up in the blink of an eye to stifle her flashlight and conceal her hiding spot. If the QTE is missed, Sam is discovered and captured. It's a split second, so it requires a sharp eye.
  <strong>
   In most cases, failing QTEs will result in the immediate death of whichever character it concerns
  </strong>

   <em>

  uses a fairly standard gacha pity mechanic, but since the top characters—currently the three-stars—aren't as highly coveted as in other gacha games, the pity system is more forgiving. Players have a relatively high chance of pulling featured characters from each banner quite quickly.

  In
  <em>
   Disney Pixel RPG
  </em>
  , with a roster of just 32 characters, including only nine three-stars, the pity system relies on Exchange Points instead of the typical rate-up mechanics. Once you accumulate 50 points, you can exchange them for any featured banner character without additional requirements. Additionally, you're guaranteed a two-star or higher character in every 10th pull across all banners.

 <p>
  Typically, gacha games boost your odds of pulling better characters with each investment in banners. However,
  <em>
   Disney Pixel RPG
  </em>
  offers an alternative approach. Players can guarantee top-tier characters by pulling 50 times on their desired character's banner. Each pull earns one point, and 50 points are enough to unlock that character directly.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":295} -->
 <p>
  The pity system does impact the drop rates for featured characters, providing them with a 1.50% boost on top of the standard 4.00%. However, this difference is minimal, and most players ultimately acquire characters through Exchange Points.
 </p>

 <p>
  You must manually exchange your points for your desired character, and Exchange Points are exclusive to specific banners. To guarantee characters like Aurora or Maleficent, you'll need to pull fifty times on their respective banners. Also note that after a banner ends, any unspent Exchange Points will convert to Memory Points.

  The Premier Gacha enhances the chances of pulling two-star characters, while still allowing for the possibility of three-star characters to appear. Every 10th pull on this banner guarantees a two-star or higher, eliminating one-stars from the equation. As a result, the chance of getting a three-star remains at 4.00%, while the drop rate for two-stars increases to 96.00%.

  players should use the Premier Gacha to farm Medals. Each time you pull a character you already own, you receive Medals, which represent copies of that character. You can then use these Medals to upgrade the character and break their limits. Medals also have drop rates: three-star copies yield 100 Medals, while two-star duplicates provide five Medals, and one-star duplicates give you only two.

  Players looking forward to seeing Ubisoft's current-generation remake of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell
   </em>
  </strong>
  may be pleased to hear that the game is still in development. The
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake was originally announced in 2021, though nothing official has been made public about it outside persistent rumors, including some suggesting that it was canceled.

 <p>
  Despite years passing since the last official entry in the franchise,
  <em>
   Splinter Cell: Blacklist
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remains an iconic tactical action brand. The adventures of Splinter Cell operative Sam Fisher are so famous that the character himself has been included in other games as a legendary cameo. Sam Fisher was present in recent
  <em>
   Ghost Recon
  </em>
  games
  <em>
   Wildlands
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Breakpoint
  </em>
  , calling the titular ghost operatives "friends in the region." Even his iconic glowing green night vision goggles were used as inspiration for a
  <em>
   Destiny 2 Splinter Cell
  </em>
  custom outfit created by a fan.

  But fans looking for a "real" new
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  experience may have a bit longer to wait. A new report from Insider Gaming says that Ubisoft is continuing development on the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake. Despite rumors of the project's cancelation amid concerns about the financial health of Ubisoft at large, the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake is "making progress."

  In its report, Insider Gaming said that the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake project is in the works under the code name "North." Their sources also claimed that the game is being built using Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine. Open world action adventure
  <em>
   Star Wars Outlaws
  </em>
  was also powered by Snowdrop. The Snowdrop engine itself appears to be a staple of recent major Ubisoft titles. It was used to render the detailed environs of post-apocalyptic US cities in the
  <em>
   Tom Clancy's The Division
  </em>
  series. Snowdrop also powered
  <em>
   Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora
  </em>
  's extremely immersive forests and lush, extraterrestrial environments.

  It's good to see news that Ubisoft appears to be making progress on the project, despite many and varied rumors about the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake sparking concerns. Though Ubisoft is best-known for large-scale open world games these days, the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake could serve as a refreshing reminder of the fact that the company once also excelled at finely-tuned linear mission-based experiences. If successful, the
  <em>
   Splinter Cell
  </em>
  remake could help revitalize the franchise and inject some new life into the somewhat dormant stealth action genre, which has seen far too few credible releases from major publishers in the last few years.

  Players exploring the Gizeh map in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Indiana Jones and The Great Circle
   </strong>
  </em>
  may have come across a locked barred gate that required a Haunted Tomb key. This may have piqued the interest of horror fans looking to find demons in the underground tombs, but there's more to this locked area than meets the eye. Unlocking the Haunted Tomb in Gizeh is part of The Haunting mystery, which involves getting to the bottom of the Haunted Tomb's secret.

  After starting The Haunting mystery, head to the designated location to find the barred gate to the Haunted Tomb. After using the key, head down the steps and use the lighter to brighten up the area. You'll be hearing disembodied whispers at this point, but don't be alarmed as nothing is going to pop up at you.

  After walking down the steps and turning left, you'll come across a collapsed pathway with a little space at the bottom. Go through that crawlspace and enter the area on the other side. Players will soon discover the source of the sounds, which was actually a radio.

  Picking up the Spy Note on the table will explain the situation of how Nawal's Spy actually tricked the Nazis into believing that this tomb was haunted to keep the artifact out of their reach. The artifact in question is sitting on the side of the room that you can add to your collection. This will mark The Haunting mystery as complete, rewarding players with the aforementioned
  <strong>
   artifact and 225 Adventure points

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Wears Its Thief and Dishonored Influences on Its Sleeve</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="content-block-regular">
 <p>
  There have been quite a few
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  games over the years. Most of these games can be sorted into a sliding scale that ranges between puzzle games and action-adventure games. For instance, classic point-and-click LucasArts titles like
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
  </em>
  belong to the puzzle side of the spectrum, while
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb
  </em>
  is more action-focused, and the LEGO
  <em>
   Indiana Jones
  </em>
  games land right in the middle.
  <em>
   <strong>
    Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
   </strong>
  </em>
  , however, offers a completely new type of
  <em>
   Indy
  </em>
  experience.

  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  is home to a ton of puzzles and intense action set pieces, but the vast majority of its runtime is spent slowly exploring large open areas, sneaking around enemy patrols. In this regard,
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  feels more inspired by
  <em>
   Thief
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  than
  <em>
   Uncharted
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  A major highlight of the classic 1998-2004
  <em>
   Thief
  </em>
  series and its sort of spiritual successor series,
  <em>
   Dishonored,
  </em>
  is their immersive sim qualities. An immersive sim can be defined in many different ways, but a common feature is a highly-detailed world that feels extremely atmospheric.

 <p>
  <em>
   Thief
  </em>
  's medieval towns, for instance, feature realistic lighting and shadows cast by historical-inspired streetlamps, cobbled streets, and tall stained-glass windows.
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  's steampunk-inspired city of Dunwall is a little more fantastical, but it feels just as grounded thanks to the series' strong art direction and logical architecture.

 <p>
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  features a similarly grounded world, with similar immersive sim qualities. Players are dropped into several real-world locations, all of which have been carefully crafted to look as life-like as possible.
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  's lighting effects, sound design, and visuals all reinforce the realism of these locations, which in turn reinforces the player's immersion in the moment-to-moment gameplay.

  Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Builds On Thief and Dishonored's Enemy AI and Physics Systems
 </h3>
 <p>
  Another common feature of an immersive sim is realistic enemy and NPC behavior. Both
  <em>
   Thief
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  see enemy guard patrols follow designated routes, and both see those guards react logically when one of their patrol suddenly goes missing. These games also tend to have strong physics systems, meaning that enemy bodies will react in a realistic way when struck.

 <p>
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  puts its physics system at the forefront of its combat and platforming. Players can use Indy's iconic whip to yank guards towards them, causing their character models to stumble realistically into any furniture or scenery objects in their path. Enemies will also fall to the ground realistically when knocked unconscious, adding some tangible weight to the game's combat.

  Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Borrows Thief and Dishonored's Layered Approach to Stealth
 </h3>
 <p>
  Immersive sims like
  <em>
   Thief
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Dishonored
  </em>
  are all about presenting the player with choices and allowing them to decide their own route to an objective. This is especially prevalent with these games' stealth systems, which will often allow the player to enter locations and approach targets in a variety of different ways.

 <p>
  <em>
   Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
  </em>
  follows suit here as well. Players are frequently dropped into a large open environment and tasked with reaching an objective on the other side. To get there, players can sneak through air vents, climb ledges, hop through open windows, and swing over enemies using their whip.

  It's par for the course for video games to trickle armory improvements through the progression of a title. However, players will come across the occasional instances where the first weapon they are handed can end up being one that's worth sticking with.

  From bows with reusable ammunition and stealth capabilities to pseudo-game-breaking pistols, video games are proof that bigger doesn't always equate to better. These games offer starting equipment that's worth using right up until the end of the game. Even if players find bigger and better things along the way, it's worth keeping these early-game weapons in their arsenals.

  While the
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  series has been a staple of the open-world video game landscape for nearly 20 years, a remarkable number of the franchise's core elements can be traced back to Ubisoft's inaugural title. 2007's
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  introduced players to the Templars, the Order of Assassins, and the showpiece weapon of the Hidden Blade.

 <p>
  Although Altair had his ring finger removed to fit the Order of Assassins' signature weapon, the payoff that players receive when utilizing its deadly power is worth it. It can kill most enemies with a single blow, and can deal fatal damage upon successful counters. With this blade,
  <em>
   Assassin's Creed
  </em>
  offers players an effective edge to dispatch enemies early on while also providing a host of swords and daggers for to play with as well.

  Even with a vast arsenal of creative firepower, from crossbows to grenade launchers, the wrench will always be iconic to

  Working in partnership with

 <p>
  The incredible versatility and customizability of the Service Weapon is a tactile aspect of
  <em>
   Control
  </em>
  's gameplay loop. Yet, the initial 'Grip' configuration of this Object of Power can potentially see a player throughout the entirety of the game's 12-hour runtime.

 <p>
  While it can be altered into further configurations that excel at close-quarters engagements, or even charge up a deadly bolt, the Service Weapon shows arguably the most utility in its 'Grip' style. It effectively places damage downfield, and can still be upgraded and modified in the same manner as later configurations. Players can combat even the most defensive Hiss forces by fully utilizing this form.

 <p>
  It could be argued that all any
  <em>
   Star Wars
  </em>
  fan wants to do in a video game set in a galaxy far, far away is to get their hands on a lightsaber. As such, it makes sense that in Raven Software's
  <em>
   Star Wars: Jedi Knight
  </em>
  titles, even though players can unleash a whole arsenal of blasters on the enemy, the iconic laser sword is often the player's best bet.

 <p>
  While blasters are an understandable choice for ranged combat in the
  <em>
   Jedi Knight
  </em>
  games, the fact that later lightsaber users can send even the most explosive projectiles back at the player is a glaring flaw. As such, with the access and varied styles available for lightsaber combat, the destructive and defensive capabilities of players when wielding one is unparalleled.

  Despite a successful career wielding her classic dual handguns, when the adventures of Lara Croft were rebooted with the release of 2013's
  <em>
   Tomb Raider,
  </em>
  they were effectively replaced by the versatility afforded by the bow and arrow. A unique trait of Square Enix's 'Survivor Trilogy' of
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  titles, the bow allowed players to deal a deadly amount of damage. It also allowed them to retrieve ammunition and employ a stealth-like approach if they wished.

  Upgradable from a makeshift longbow in
  <em>
   Tomb Raider
  </em>
  's opening hours to a modern compound bow, Lara uses the bow not only as a lethal weapon, but an aide to exploration and puzzle-solving. Following Lara in all three of her most contemporary mainline installments, the bow can be ditched for a range of explosive firearms, but little can compete with its versatility and lethality throughout the titles.

  The weapon lends its projectile-throwing focus and changeable direction of orientation to killing the series' spindly-limbed Necromorphs. The Plasma Cutter itself is narrative and mechanical genius. Its ability to fire a 'bolt' of ionized plasma may not be as flashy as the traditional firearms the franchise bestows to players; however, its versatility, upgradability, and iconic status are tantamount to its pole position.

 <p>
  The concept of denoting a player's Pokemon pals as weapons is somewhat arguable, but as the only way of engaging in combat within
  <em>
   Pokemon Red and Blue
  </em>
  versions, they are effectively just that. As such, with their high base stats and effective type coverage, the starters of
  <em>
   Pokemon'
  </em>

 <p>
  Plenty of players feel understandable nostalgia and attachment towards their choice of Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur. But beyond that, the fact that many players can blaze through the titles' many challenges wielding the power of only their single starter pick. This is proof enough that their power is second to none.

  It may not come loaded, but the M6D Magnum bestowed to the Master Chief on the dawn of his inaugural adventure on Installation 04 is arguably more powerful than even the most destructive capabilities of the UNSC or the Covenant. Firing bombastic 40mm SAPHE rounds at the enemy, the stopping power afforded to the player with the Magnum can rip through enemy infantry and armor alike.

  With minimal bullet spread, a 2x scope, and the ability to kill unshielded enemies with one shot to the head, the Magnum as it appears in
  <em>

  is incredibly powerful. While
  <em>

 <p>
  <em>
   <strong>
    Warframe

  's next big update will be launching with a new minigame, a retro-style run-and-gunner secreted within an in-game arcade. The new minigame coming to
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  , rather than being spearheaded by Digital Extremes, has mainly been the project of Sumo Digital. Dubbed Caliber Chicks 2, it's been part of in-universe lore for some time, teased within the game for over a year. Game Rant spoke with
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  creative director Rebecca Ford and Caliber Chicks design director Nic Cusworth to learn more about what the game's like, as well as what fans can gain from playing it.

  Contra-Style Gameplay
 </h3>
 <p>
  When talking about the details surrounding what Caliber Chicks 2 will look like, Cusworth explained how classic run-and-gun titles inspired development. In particular, he highlighted the influence of the
  <em>
   Contra
  </em>
  series.
 </p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "The team at DE had already come up with character designs for the Caliber Chicks and had a vision for the game being a run-and-gun. It was down to us at Sumo what direction to take it. Looking at the time period we wanted to place the game, I went back to the games I was playing at the time. That was a lot of
   <em>
    Contra 3
   </em>
   on the SNES and
   <em>
    Gunstar Heroes
   </em>
   on the Megadrive.
   <em>
    Gunstar
   </em>
   particularly used to be my ‘cool down’ game.
  </p>
  <p>
   I’d come home from work and just play it through. Something my aging reflexes are no longer able to do. Of course, being an arcade game,
   <em>
    Metal Slug
   </em>
   was also a big influence and was the guiding light on what the cutting edge in 2D arcade games were at the time."

 <p>
  Cusworth also added more detail about how the game will work, saying that "the core loop is around 15 minutes long, spread over three pretty extensive and varied levels." However, he also mentioned that "the game ends with events that send you back to the beginning of the game—only things have changed. With each loop the world gets a little weirder, and the challenge a lot trickier." These concepts, adjacent to time travel, seem fitting for the themes surrounding
  <em>
   Warframe: 1999
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Ford went further to describe how the game will impact
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  's wider community. The game will have "global leaderboards for players to fight for the top spot for," encouraging repeated play sessions and community involvement. All this effort into creating a faithful retro-style arcade game, according to Ford, is in large part there to support worldbuilding—to "make the Höllvania Central Mall mission hub feel more alive."

  The Rewards In Warframe's Caliber Chicks 2

 <p>
  Ford went into detail about the rewards players can reap from playing this arcade minigame, many of which tie into what's coming with

  . Players will also be able to attain numerous cosmetic rewards from the affair.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   "Anyone investing time and effort into side content should be rewarded in some way. If players get far enough in Caliber Chicks they can earn a couple of glyphs and an emblem as rewards to use anywhere in the Origin System. Also, as you rank up in The Hex Syndicate with the Protoframes, Aoi will start offering Somachord tracks from Caliber Chicks to unlock."

 <p>
  Furthermore, Ford clarified how much fans will have to invest to earn these
  <em>
   Warframe
  </em>
  rewards. When asked about whether the team was concerned that there may be a grind to the minigame, she mentioned that "there are small pieces of cosmetic content behind the mini-game, but [they] want people that feel invested in those side experiences to be rewarded fairly," emphasizing its role as side content.

   <strong>
    Stardew Valley
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a peaceful and calm farming simulator. Yet, to anyone who has played it, not all moments are chilled-out and serene, as there are times when deadly fights occur and players need to battle to not lose crucial items. Various locations, such as the Mines or the Skull Cavern, offer a plethora of enemies for players to overcome.

 <p>
  As
  <em>
   Stardew Valley
  </em>
  is loosely an RPG, there are multiple different weapons to choose from. Of these, swords are arguably the best, being reliable, able to deal a large portion of damage, and not too slow to swing. There is an array of different swords to utilize, and some are naturally better than others, being able to deal with enemies swiftly and successfully, making adventures into dangerous areas no longer daunting. For players who favor blades as their primary weapon, these are

   Tempered Broadsword
  </span>
  is a decent mid-game choice for weaponry. It can deal a good amount of damage, but is on the slower side compared to some of its contemporaries.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1075} -->

 <p>
  Some other weapons with similar damage can offer a faster speed, such as the Steel Falchion. Additionally, given the Tempered Broadsword is found in the Skull Cavern, it can be especially hard to obtain, whereas the Galaxy Sword can be acquired in the Calico Desert using a prismatic shard; a much stronger sword actually requires a lot less risk.

  Offering the same stats as Leah's Whittler, Haley's Iron is a solid choice for decent damage in combat against enemies. While it is by no means a fast weapon, it offers a reasonable amount of regular damage and the potential to cause critical damage too. Haley's Iron is a particularly unique weapon, appearing in the form of a pink-handled curling iron, referring to Haley's feminine appearance.

  Alongside Leah's Whittler, Haley's Iron only became available in the 1.6 update, with the introduction of the Desert Festival, where both characters sell their weapons.

   Obsidian Edge
  </span>
  is one of these. The sword can deal with enemies decently enough, but still falls short compared to later weapons that are harder to obtain.

 <p>
  Given players receive the Obsidian Edge on floor 90 of the Mines, it can serve as a useful acquisition for moving deeper into the mines. Players can use it as the venture down to floor 120 of the mine, and if they eventually run out of uses for the item they can sell it for the fair price of 300g once they reach the surface.

   Steel Falchion
  </span>
  is a strong choice of weapon due to its speed. The damage it offers is around the same as other swords like the Obsidian Edge and the Dark Sword, but it is vastly faster, allowing players to keep enemies at bay with greater ease.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":7,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":7,"nbrPlacementsScanned":7,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":659} -->
 <p>
  The Critical Power is also higher, which can allow for a strong attack if it successfully deals critical damage. Since the Steel Falchion can be obtained by a variety of methods, some players may come to find it useful while others may not find much need for it. Getting it from the Adventurer's Guild after reaching floor 90 in the Mines is certainly easier than obtaining it in the Skull Cavern, and players who have accessed the Calico Desert may instead opt to strive for the Galaxy Sword instead.

  The Crit Chance and Weight stats are nice bonuses, and the Vampiric stat can be useful, especially for those that often find themselves taking damage during combat. It allows players to regain a portion of their health; a valuable asset for long journeys spelunking, compared to the Obsidian Edge.

   Lava Katana

  The stats offered by the Lava Katana can be really helpful, with the high Crit Power creating opportunities for heavy damage to be inflicted on enemies, while the Defense and Weight increases are valuable for venturing into hostile territory with numerous enemies.

   Dwarf Sword
  </span>
  is found in the Volcano Dungeon, not the Lava Katana. Regardless of this, the Dwarf Sword deals a great amount of damage that makes it super valuable for combat situations.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  The Dwarf Sword offers other additional benefits: it has a good speed that allows for numerous quick hits against enemies, and its Defense stat is reasonable for improving chances of survival in dicey situations. Also, despite its name, the Dwarf Sword has a good reach and doesn't come up short, making it just as useful as other weapons.

  It is able to deal a powerful amount of damage, easily challenging enemies. It is also quite a fast sword, meaning damage can be dealt speedily against tougher enemies. In addition, players can only acquire it once, as players must bring a Prismatic Shard to the Three Pillars in the Calico Desert, where they will be gifted the Galaxy Sword.

  It has a Crit Power of +50, which can do great damage to enemies when the sword deals critical damage. However, even without the Crit Power stat, the Dragontooth Cutlass can still deal a huge amount of damage, swiftly taking out adversaries. It is a relatively rare sword, with a 1 in 27 chance of players finding it upon opening chests in the Volcano Dungeon.

  overtook the Galaxy Sword when it was introduced in patch 1.5. Being an upgrade to the Galaxy Sword, it came with increased damage, the highest out of any sword. Players who obtain the Infinity Blade now unlock the achievement Infinite Power, which was added to the game in update 1.6.

  is as fast as the Galaxy Sword, capable of continuously hitting enemies, but also possesses a +2 in the Defense stat, allowing for some reduced damage. While other swords in the game offer different stat benefits, the raw damage inflicted by the Infinity Blade is why it's so valuable.

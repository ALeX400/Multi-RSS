  As live service games go,
  <strong>
   <em>
    Helldivers 2
   </em>
  </strong>
  is one of the more successful ones, especially considering how it's consistently being updated with creative new content. One of the recent additions is the Democracy Space Station, a structure whose creation is the result of players completing major orders in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  . Its existence and how it's utilized can be seen as a way for the game's developer, Arrowhead Game Studios, to show how it understands that the fans are the reason for the game's success, which could mean an even better sign of things to come.

  The purpose of the Democracy Space Station in
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  is to aid players who are on a specific planet by providing orbital support, helping make missions easier. Every 24 hours, players can vote on where the structure should be deployed next, making its tactical use a cooperative effort. Giving the community a collective way of controlling the DSS is a great interactive feature, as it lets everyone know that many others are playing and that all of them have the same impact on the in-game world. The creation of the Democracy Space Station and how it's handled could mean that Arrowhead Game Studios is thinking of even more events centered around players' ability to vote, which may lead to some interesting things in the future.

  Why Arrowhead Game Studios Should Let Helldivers 2 Players Vote for More Things That Affect the Game
 </h3>
 <p>
  Other than making the game's community more active, allowing people to vote on future content is a good way of showing them that they are responsible for the game's life and success. Arrowhead Game Studios can always just put whatever it believes is in everyone's best interest, but letting people choose has benefits. Giving the community agency and more means to collaborate in-game is an encouraging reason to stick around to play even more of
  <em>
   Helldivers 2
  </em>
  , ensuring that it remains alive and continues to grow. With the right execution and expansion of the voting system, it can continue to be one of the best co-op games people can play for a very long time.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Disney Lorcana TCG
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a mechanically rich trading card game boasting numerous layers of surprisingly deep strategy, and this is largely thanks to an impressive assortment of card designs that allow for a high degree of deckbuilding variety. Among countless other possibilities are devilish decks comprised almost entirely of easy-to-deploy Broomstick cards, musical decks leveraging
  <em>
   Disney Lorcana
  </em>
  's unique singing mechanic to surprise opponents with powerful card plays, and strategic decks that aggressively use action cards to control the game's flow.

  Game Rant recently attended the
  <em>
   Disney Lorcana TCG
  </em>
  Challenge in Seattle and spoke with co-creator Steve Warner about the team's process for designing new card sets. Since the game's release barely a year ago, numerous impactful card sets have been released that have drastically increased the game's deckbuilding potential, and Warner revealed that the team's approach is not all that dissimilar to how many video game developers approach their game mechanics.

 <p>
  When designing new cards for
  <em>
   Disney Lorcana
  </em>
  , Warner says the team uses two classic game design approaches: top-down design and bottom-up design. Many iconic Disney characters have strong traits that can easily translate to game mechanics, so the team often chooses a character and applies a mechanic that suits its theme. One example of this was the Rapunzel card: Rapunzel's character is well-known for her healing abilities, which made her fit perfectly in the role of a healing card. Tinkerbell's Evasive keyword is another example of a character whose card mechanic naturally emerges from fundamental character traits.

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Top-down means I know what character I'm doing, and I can build the ability for that. And
   <em>
    Rapunzel
   </em>
   was a bit of a top-down design—for example, she’s gifted with healing. And we knew that, because it was Rapunzel, she should probably heal, but we wanted it to be a really exciting card. So, we came up with the ability she has of healing and getting to draw cards for it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Bottom-up design
   </em>
   means there's a mechanic we really need, but we're not sure what the best theme is for it until a bit later.
   <em>
    Grab Your Sword
   </em>
   , for example, is a good way to represent this. We knew we needed something that could deal a bunch of damage and get rid of a lot of characters, but at the time, we weren't sure what card that could be.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1091} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":1000,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  On the other hand, there are times when the team wishes to include a card with specific qualities, and then a suitable character is selected to deliver that mechanic. Warner singled out the Grab Your Sword card as an example of this approach: a card that can damage numerous characters at once is a TCG staple, so the team created this song card specifically to introduce this capability for players building Steel
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  decks. Although
  <em>
   Disney Lorcana
  </em>
  may be starting with a mechanical idea and working upward, the final product is never arbitrary; even these bottom-up-designed cards make clear sense thematically whether they're a character or an action.

 <p>
  Warner also detailed how the team approaches creating card sets that are internally consistent within the theme such as the party-themed Shimmering Skies card set following Ursula's defeat in the Illumineer's Quest. The team starts with the basics: "vanilla" cards that only possess basic strength and willpower stats, and "French vanilla" cards, ones that typically come with a basic keyword like Rush, Bodyguard, or Challenger.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":327} -->
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When we design, we start with creating what we call a
   <em>
    skeleton
   </em>
   . We have certain cards that we're expecting to just have a keyword, and we call those
   <em>
    French vanilla
   </em>
   . We'll have a certain amount of those, and then we'll have a certain amount of
   <em>
    vanilla
   </em>
   cards, which just means they don't have abilities on them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, we look at what the narrative, the marketing, and the story are going to be, and we start designing the characters for those. Following the characters on their story is what's exciting, so we want to make sure that story comes through.
  </p>

 <p>
  Beyond that, the team looks to
  <em>
   Disney Lorcana
  </em>
  's narrative and expresses aspects of the storyline through new card abilities and flavor text. For example, the Floodborn card Belle - Accomplished Mystic carries the flavor text, "The mixed ink had changed more than just the rose." This points to how this Belle glimmer was altered by the flood of ink that occurred at this point in
  <em>
   Lorcana
  </em>
  's storyline. Considering the strong relationship between the narrative and cards, keen-eyed collectors might find clues about
  <em>
   Disney Lorcana
  </em>
  's next chapter tucked between the pages of their Lorebooks.

  Some
  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </em>
  </strong>
  players are calling for the Attack Dogs killstreak to return to the game as a scorestreak in a future update. Long-time fans of the series will know that Attack Dogs first featured in
  <em>
   World at War
  </em>
  , but some would like to see them make their return in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  .

  Generally, it's fair to say that
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  is the best the series' multiplayer has been in a while. That said, it doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. The game's community often shares its own ideas about how Treyarch can improve
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  , and so far, the studio has seemed very interested in feedback. For example, Treyarch bringing legacy XP token to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  after huge fan demand shows that the studio is listening to make the game the best it can possibly be.

  A Reddit thread started by user Fearless-Jeweler-39 started the conversation about possibly bringing Attack Dogs back as a
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  scorestreak. They were first featured in 2008's
  <em>
   Call of Duty: World at War
  </em>
  , although they would also return in
  <em>
   Black Ops
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Vanguard
  </em>
  . This means it has been three years since they were last seen in a
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game, but prior to that, they had been largely absent for many years. The streak itself is simple - it summons a horde of dogs that run around the map, biting enemies to death. It's deadly, and annoying to deal with.

 <p>
  Many gamers in the thread instantly agreed, although one player pointed out that due to the speed of
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's omnimovement, the Attack Dogs scorestreak would probably have to be sped up a little. However, one of the big positives of adding Attack Dogs would be to eliminate campers. Some players in
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  like to hole up in certain spots on the map, and try to move from that area very little throughout the entire game. Adding Attack Dogs would make this very difficult, as they're adept at sweeping out entire areas.

  With Season 1 of

      <title>No Man's Sky Has The Perfect Blueprint for Starfield's Possible DLC Ambitions</title>

 <p>
  With the release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Starfield
   </em>
  </strong>
  , Bethesda has brought players to a whole new galaxy brimming with potential. While the main story may not have been on the level of the studio's previous titles, the universe that it crafted has been fun to explore. Now that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  has received its first DLC in the form of Shattered Space, many are wondering just where that adventure will take them next. Its future may be shrouded in mystery, but Bethesda might actually have a pretty clear route forward.

 <p>
  Todd Howard has said that
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  has the potential to get new content every single year, as long as the studio has exciting ideas to explore. It remains to be seen if the studio actually commits to that, but if it does, then it may want to follow in the footsteps of Hello Games'
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  . That game has shown players just what a massive space adventure should look like, and each year it grows even more. If Bethesda really wants
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  to last forever, then Hello Games has laid out exactly how to do that.

  Upon launch,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  was incredibly divisive. While its massive procedurally generated universe may have been impressive, players were left with practically nothing to do within it. Instead of abandoning the project, Hello Games committed to making it one of the strongest sci-fi titles out there. Through countless updates,
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  has evolved into one of the richest sci-fi games on the market, and as of now, it does not seem like that experience will slow down anytime soon.

 <p>
  Every single year since release, Hello Games has expanded upon
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  's foundations with numerous massive updates. It has given players exciting new planet types to explore, massive ships to pilot, base building mechanics to mess around with, new stories, and so many more features to help make the galaxy their own. This constant stream has not only given players so much content to explore, but also keeps them coming back for even more. Because of its success, it only seems natural that other space titles like
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  may want to follow suit.

 <p>
  Much like
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  gives players a massive procedurally generated galaxy to explore. While it mostly works, there is definitely something lacking here, as many of its planets are left with too little content to explore. However, through
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's post-launch updates or DLC, that could change considerably. The studio could expand its base building mechanics, add new mission types across these planets, inject them with new stories, and so on.

 <p>
  Additionally,
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  's updates could expand the galaxy in exciting new ways.
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  has introduced a plethora of new planet types, with some updates completely overhauling the universe. One of the best aspects of spacefaring games is the variety of planets waiting to be discovered, so it would make a lot of sense to just build upon them. Bethesda could introduce new planet types, shake up older planets with new creatures or biomes, and fill them to the brim with things to discover.

 <p>
  <em>
   No Man's Sky
  </em>
  has added so much content over the years, which has helped make it the gold standard for spacefaring games for many. While
  <em>
   Starfield
  </em>
  may be aiming for a more realistic feel, there is seemingly no reason it could not follow what Hello Games has achieved in terms of gameplay content. Games like this have virtually limitless potential, so Bethesda just has to capitalize on it.

  players have taken to online forums to share their frustrations about the game's hit registration. This has always been a contentious issue throughout the

  Overall, the fan reception to
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  has been largely positive. Despite this, the game does have some issues, and fans have been very vocal about what they feel needs to be fixed with the game. For example, some
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  players are calling for the removal of the Winner's Circle feature at the end of every game. The good news is that Treyarch has been very receptive to all player feedback so far, and while not every idea will make it into the game, the studio has worked since launch to continually improve the game.

  Several clips have appeared online that appear to show how the hit registration in
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  has some glaring issues. The first is a Nuketown clip from Redditor BigSmnonk, in which their opponent is completely paused, allowing them to land perfect shots. However, all hits fail to register, despite blood splatters appearing. It was pointed out that the car usually in the middle of Nuketown hasn't loaded in here, which may account for the lack of hit registration. That's another problem entirely, though.

 <p>
  Still, another clip from Redditor Belial768 is undeniable. They shoot their enemy, with nothing between the two. There's another huge blood splatter, and they even turn away as a muscle memory response to killing their opponent. Yet, the kill isn't registered, showcasing the issue at hand here. One player joked that they "clearly need a better gaming chair," while another said, "you just had red paintball in your gun." It's not as though it's an issue with
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's weapons - there's not even a hit marker, so the game doesn't believe the bullet is landing in the first place.

  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>

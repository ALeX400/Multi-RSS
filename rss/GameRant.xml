  The
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  franchise has had a rocky few years, but in the world of gaming, it has fared much better, with last year's
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  being the highest-selling game of 2023. And while it doesn't quite live up to those heights,
  <em>
   <strong>
    Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
   </strong>
  </em>
  is another silver lining to the franchise's otherwise darkened cloud.

  Released on September 3 2024,
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  sees players pick up a broom, take to the skies, and compete in the iconic Wizarding World sport. After its absence in
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  , many fans were champing at the bit for a Quidditch video game, and
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  should fulfill those desires, though it's unclear for just how long.

  opening hour sees players compete in the Weasley Burrow Cup, which is essentially a tutorial for the game's four distinct roles. Players can assume the role of a Keeper, Seeker, Beater, or Chaser. While the same flight controls are used across the board, each role has one or two unique mechanics, such as the Beater's ability to fire a Bludger at an opponent, and the Keeper's ability to dive in front of a goalpost.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1081} -->

 <p>
  There's a nice balance between accessible and engaging within these four roles. Players can understand the role's purpose quickly, but it takes quite a bit of time to master the role completely. But once all the mechanics click,
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  can deliver some really fun gameplay moments. The feeling of boosting through the air as a Chaser, tackling an opponent, dodging a Bludger, and getting the Quaffle past the opposing Keeper to score a goal is exactly the type of fast-paced, satisfying action that fans have been searching for since 2003's
  <em>

  on the PS2.

 <p>
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  has been marketed first and foremost as an online multiplayer game. Currently, there's just one proper game mode for online PvP multiplayer, and that's
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ' 3v3 mode. In this mode, players are given two roles that they need to swap between, with one always being a Chaser. This system doesn't feel well-balanced.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":343} -->
 <p>
  While it's easy for a Seeker/Chaser to balance their two roles, as the Seeker only comes onto the pitch when the Snitch appears, it's a bit more difficult to balance being a Beater/Chaser, as both roles are needed at all times during a game. This balancing act is exponentially harder for a Keeper/Chaser, as they're forced to frantically swap between being the primary line of defense and an important offensive tool.

 <p>
  Some players will find this balancing act engaging, others will find it frustrating. A 6v6 mode is currently planned for release before the end of 2024, but it's a sizable knock against the game that it isn't available at launch.

  But while
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ' PvP content might be a bit lacking in terms of modes, its PvE content is a bit more complete.
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  offers three tournaments, encompassing the Hogwarts House Cup, the Triwizard Cup, and the World Cup. Players can also host an Exhibition match between any team they've unlocked via completing tournaments. It's not the most extensive offering in a sports game, but it should give fans of the 2003
  <em>
   Quidditch World Cup
  </em>
  game just about everything they're looking for.

 <p>
  However,
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ' single-player also comes with a pretty sizable caveat. Though there are five AI difficulty levels in
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  , only the highest offers a real level of challenge, and arguably, even that difficulty tier won't engage skilled players for too long.

 <p>
  A big problem with playing solo is that both the player's team and the opposing team will get more aggressive on higher difficulties, which ironically leads to a stalemate between them. For instance, while the opposing Keeper is harder to score against on the highest difficulty, so is the player's AI-controlled Keeper, meaning that the difficulty hasn't actually changed.

 <p>
  There are two key forms of progression in
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  : Career Rewards and Season Rewards. Career Rewards give players new brooms, currency that can be used to upgrade them, and skill points that can be used to upgrade the player's custom team. Each role has a separate skill tree with three distinct branches, which offers some solid depth as it's home to both simple stat boosts and new abilities.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":998} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  But a big drawback of this skill system is that players can only equip 10 skill points at a time, which is only enough to fill one of the skill tree's three branches. This cap ensures that higher-level players aren't trouncing newcomers, but it also means that once those 10 skill points have been earned, there's no more character progression in the game. And it only takes a few hours of gameplay to earn 10 skill points.

  Season Rewards are essentially

 <p>
  One thing that
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  gets very right is its presentation. Rather than go for a realistic art style like
  <em>
   Hogwarts Legacy
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  has chosen a more stylized approach to its art direction, which, for the most part, works really well.

 <p>
  This more cartoony art style gives
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  a vibrancy that suits a game set in the Wizarding World, and it allows repeated maps (there are three Hogwarts and four Weasley Burrows maps) to look and feel surprisingly distinct thanks to slight changes in weather effects and lighting. Character faces can look a little uncanny and lifeless under this art style, but that's not a consistent issue or one that's too noticeable during gameplay.

 <p>
  Sound design is also a key strength of
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  . The music used throughout
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ' loading screens and menus feels authentic to John Williams' original score. The game's sound effects are also very strong, with the thud of a Bludger hit sounding suitably punchy and a broom's thunderous boost sounding appropriately powerful. These sound effects are reinforced by the game's particle effects, which emit a joyous rupture of light and color whenever a player scores a goal or passes through a Snitch's boost ring.

  Performance-wise,
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  also seemed to run well on PlayStation 5, with there being no real issues of note during gameplay. A game's presentation often marks the difference between a fine and a good game, and
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ' presentation gets it over that line. Though, it has to be said that the game's English accents – particularly for Fred and George – are laughably bad at times.

 <p>
  In its current state,
  <em>
   Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  is a fun, albeit flawed game. But like most multiplayer-oriented releases nowadays, this isn't the final product. While
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ' core structure, gameplay, and presentation probably won't be changing anytime soon, the game's live-service approach does imply that it'll receive new content in the near future.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":9,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":9,"nbrPlacementsScanned":9,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1009} -->

 <p>
  But the big question is just what this new content will be. The current roadmap for
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  states a new season will arrive in the Winter, with a handful of themed events taking place between then and now. New Season Rewards will be a nice bonus for those enjoying
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions
  </em>
  ' gameplay, but it won't be enough to hook players for the long term or get newcomers on board.

 <p>
  <em>
   Harry Potter

  is still a license that holds a lot of weight, but the live-service model requires a large player-base to stick around for an extended period to be successful, and

  </em>
  ' lackluster roadmap doesn't really encourage players to stick around.
  <em>
   Quidditch Champions

  adapts a lot of the mechanics from the base game into the DLC, which removes just about all the social elements from the game. While mostly a dungeon crawler, players still have access to a lot of the mechanics that they need to explore the Abyss Of Time; such as Twilight Fragments.

  Twilight Fragments were originally found in the various parts of town and earned by spending time with your Social Links, with Aigis having access to only a limited overworld and no social links. Here's how to earn Twilight Fragments in
  <em>

 <ul>
  <li>
   Found in the Abyss Of Time

 <p>
  Much like the original game, Twilight Fragments can be found by
  <strong>
   destroying crystallized shadows that have a blue light
  </strong>
  . These appear much more often in the DLC, with one being found on just about every floor, with some floors even having two commonly. Elizabeth will also be a good source of Twilight Fragments, though she will only give Fragments in batches of five at a time.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1034} -->

 <p>
  Elizabeth will also only give you a
  <strong>
   batch of Twilight Fragments after reaching a milestone in the Abyss Of Time such as fighting a boss
  </strong>
  . Players must also enter the Velvet Room for Elizabeth to give her the Fragments, as she only gives requests when spoken to by the door. Players can also find a few Twilight Fragments in the Dorm or at Paulownia Mall, though there aren't many, with new ones spawning at new locations after reaching various checkpoints in the Abyss Of Time. This last method is the least reliable, as there are only a few to be found and once found they do not respawn.

 <p>
  Exactly like the base game, Twilight Fragments are only used to restore the party's HP/SP and open special chests. It is recommended to save all Twilight Fragments for these chests, as your HP/SP
  <strong>
   can be restored by going out of the Abyss Of Time and back into the dorm
  </strong>
  .
  <em>
   Episode Aigis
  </em>
  doesn't have a functioning calendar system like the base game, so going in and out of the Abyss doesn't offer many penalties. The only penalty is losing any currently active Tarot cards, though these can easily be farmed again with a fully restored party.

  Lenya joins
  <strong>
   <em>
    AFK Journey
   </em>
  </strong>
  as the newest Rogue Hero in the Wilder faction. As a close-quarters combat (CQB) specialist, she primarily engages enemies with her kicks. Many players are curious if she’s worth investing in and whether she will impact
  <em>
   AFK Journey’
  </em>
  s metagame significantly. Currently, Lenya appears to be an above-average Hero with some niche utility in PvP. Here’s everything you need to know about Lenya, including her skills, strategies, and team compositions.

  Lenya’s critical gameplay mechanic is stun. Most of her skill set involves strikes that freeze up the target, allowing her to remain safe and deal damage while being only one tile away from the enemy.

  An Overview of Lenya’s Skills
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Ultimate: Wild Duel
   </strong>
   . Lenya’s Ultimate skill is a powerful, knockback-heavy kick that launches one enemy to the opposite side of the arena. Once she gathers enough Energy, Lenya targets the enemy with the highest damage input and delivers the kick. She then pursues the knocked-back target and initiates a duel, forcing them to focus their attacks on her for a few seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Skill One: Tornado Kick
   </strong>
   . Lenya delivers a stun kick that briefly freezes her target. Her Tornado Kick also periodically blocks enemy strikes and deals AoE damage to nearby foes.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Skill Two: Flurry Kicks
   </strong>
   . Once Lenya’s Crit DMG is increased, she hits the target with a power kick that deals 200% damage and briefly stuns them.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Exclusive Skill: Winning Resolve
   </strong>
   . Lenya’s full potential is unleashed during duels. She gains increased Crit DMG and ATK, while her Flurry Kicks transform into powerful super kicks that deal extra damage and significantly extend the stun duration on her target.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Enhance Force
   </strong>
   : Leyna takes 35% less damage from enemies—except from her target.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Hero Focus
   </strong>
   : Lenya’s Haste increases by 12.
  </li>
 </ul>

  Lenya excels in a standard META team alongside Rowan, Thoran, Smokey, and Lily May. In this setup, Lily May acts as the main damage dealer, while Lenya functions as the primary tech Hero, targeting and sniping the most dangerous enemies. Thoran absorbs damage as the tank, with Smokey and Rowan providing support.

  Lenya needs to be paired with sturdy Heroes who can absorb the initial damage. She requires enough protection to build up her Energy. Once her first Ultimate is unleashed, managing her becomes easier, as she will stun her targets, block some of their attacks, and retaliate against the damage she’s taken.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Lenya automatically chooses her Ultimate target
   </strong>
   . She attacks the enemy unit with the highest cumulative damage and knocks them back.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    She requires her Exclusive to perform effectively
   </strong>
   . Without Winning Resolve, her Ultimate may fail to eliminate targets.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Lenya isn’t very reliable in PvE
   </strong>
   . Since her Ultimate has minimal impact on bosses, it’s better to avoid using her in PvE matches like Dream Realm.
  </li>

  Lenya isn’t a must-have unit, but if your team has an open sniping role, she’s a reliable option. Like Odie, Lenya can target and eliminate specific enemy units, which is especially useful in PvP matches. Despite her utility as a tech and sniper unit, free-to-play players can skip her since she doesn't significantly impact the metagame and can be replaced by other Heroes you may already have in your inventory.

  Volkin, a well-known
  <em>

  creator, reviewed Lenya as a “100% skippable Hero, especially for free-to-play players.” He also noted that with the new season approaching, there may be better unlockable characters on the horizon.

  s Splatfests were the first time that three teams could battle against each other, and Tri-Color Turf War introduced an interesting mechanic that can force opposing teams to temporarily work together. While fans are sad to see the game seemingly winding down,
  <em>

  </em>
  's Grand Festival will give players one last opportunity to celebrate everything the game has had to offer.

  fan purekimwater shared their unique artwork with fellow players in anticipation of the Grand Festival. The artwork features Deep Cut, the triple-idol team from
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  , who are surrounded by elements from every single Splatfest the game has had. For example, the microphones they hold are based on the ice cream battle, the springtime Splatfest's chicks, bunnies, and bear cubs are visible behind Big Man, while the Summer Nights Splatfest's Palace, Theme Park, and Beach theme can be seen behind Shiver and Frye. The squids and octos scattered throughout the piece also reflect Splatfest themes.

  Unique Splatoon Splatfest Art Draws Attention

  players have eagerly celebrated the artwork, not only for its concept but for the execution. There was a lot to cram into one image, and the fan manages to do so in a cohesive way that works as a full picture. The artist even went through the trouble of incorporating the Splatfests that were limited to certain regions, like the Handshake vs Fist Bump vs Hug Best Greeting Splatfest, or the Japan-only Kaiten-yaki vs Oban-yaki vs Imagawa-yaki battle.

  While all of the Splatfest themes have been fun, they ultimately don't have much impact on the games as a whole. However, the Grand Festival will likely be similar to prior final Splatfests in that it will choose the direction of a future game in some way. Marie's win in the first
  <em>
   Splatoon
  </em>
  had her leading the story mode in
  <em>
   Splatoon 2
  </em>
  , while
  <em>
   Splatoon 2
  </em>
  's Chaos win led to Splatsville, and the losing Order team connected to the Side Order DLC in
  <em>
   Splatoon 3
  </em>
  . With the past, present, and future duking it out in the newest fight, it remains to be seen how the developers will interpret that when the eventual
  <em>
   Splatoon 4
  </em>
  arrives.

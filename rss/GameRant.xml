  <strong>
   JRPG
  </strong>
  s are probably one of the most versatile genres out there as they present players with branching storylines, likable characters and interesting plots that often kick off multi-title franchises. One of the key aspects of a JRPG is companionship and the relationships that players can build along the way with valuable party members.

 <p>
  However, in some titles, players don’t have to recruit every single individual they come across. Instead, they can opt to leave a few of them out and only focus on those they’re interested in. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best JRPGs where players can reject party members.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Suikoden
   </strong>
  </em>
  is a timeless classic that tells a tale of liberation and finding oneself in the middle of everyone else’s expectations. The story focuses on Tir McDohl, the son of a famous general of the Scarlet Moon Empire, who was destined to follow in his father’s footsteps but chose to liberate the oppressed instead.

 <p>
  Tir will take it upon himself to look for the 108 Stars of Destiny to end the Scarlet Moon Empire’s hold over the war-torn land and restore peace. The game allows players to complete it without having to recruit all 108 Warriors. And while some people might argue that missing out on a few characters isn’t the same as rejecting them, it’s arguable that choosing not to find them deliberately makes this game fit the list.

  As players progress through the game, they will have the option to ask other houses to join their cause. Alternatively, they can choose to ignore them and prevent the recruitment of certain characters that belong to them. While this might not be an all-out rejection in every sense of the word, being able to decide which party members can travel with Byleth gives players a ton of control.

  Loxodont is a newcomer in
  <em>
   Rivals 2
  </em>
  , and great for newcomer gamers of Rivals as well. He’s a villainous elephant wielding a two-handed axe with great range. He also has the ability to launch Molten Boulders as a neutral special, which can throw his opponents off guard. Similar to Kragg, Loxodont is massive and deals awesome damage.

 <p>
  Loxodont’s down special leaves behind lava pools that he can stand within to gain up to three charges of Molten Charge for a bonus to damage. Loxodont’s downside is how heavy he is— his recovery tends to lack, especially when he gets combo’d off the edge.

  Kragg is known for his hulking weight and ability to survive longer than most characters. He’s a massive beetle with a moveset that deals tons of damage and knockback upon successful combos. His special attacks can manipulate the stage in spectacular ways, like summoning a massive pillar of earth beneath him with his up special.

 <p>
  Kragg can also use his neutral special to dig up a square rock that can be thrown, and upon contact, shatters and knocks back anyone in the way. Due to his beetle-like qualities, Kragg can curl up into a spikey ball and roll across the stage. Kragg can deal massive damage and has an outstanding edge-guarding game, but his downside lies in vulnerable moments like holding the rock or falling faster due to his weight.

  Orcane is a trickster of an orca, capable of manipulating puddles and bubbles to annihilate opponents and dominate the stage. Orcane doesn’t do a lot of damage with basic attacks, but if players master his puddle teleportation, he becomes too slippery to catch up to. Orcane’s combo game is impressive, with a great way of starting them through his sweeping tail attacks which knock enemies up.

 <p>
  Orcane’s aerial game is effective, and timing his hovering bubble stream is essential in dodging opponents and dealing damage at the same time. His strong attacks, when charged, bursts water with enough strength to K.O. at higher percentages. Orcane doesn’t have many long-ranged attacks and his puddle teleportation can be punished, so he requires more movement and careful timing to counteract.

  Forsburn is an excellent assassin, a smoke-based hyena who is best at playing patiently and capitalizing on any mistakes his opponents make. He controls the pace of the game by throwing smoke out that both conceals him, acts as a space to teleport to and emerge from, and to consume to gain combust charges. His overall damage is low, but his combo game is strong enough to rack up damage fast, with many of his attacks flowing well into each other.

 <p>
  Forsburn has great mobility and attack range, wielding a dagger with awesome wide-ranged aerials and long-ranged strong attacks. If his smoke clouds aren’t placed well, they can be destroyed easily by other projectiles, and his up air smoke teleportation can be punished if too predictably used.

 <p>
  Ranno is a poisonous dart frog martial artist with two powerful methods of attack; short-ranged aerial combos and toxic trap techniques. His poisonous bubble and poison darts are his methods of poisoning, with poison stacking up to 4 times. Each stack adds 1% of damage for every move the opponent makes, lasting until opponents parry him or land a hit to remove a single charge.

 <p>
  Ranno’s awesome forward special toxic tongue attack pulls his enemies in, swallowing them and spitting them out into a poisonous bubble that consistently damages the unfortunate contestants within. Ranno’s combos pairing close-range attack combos and toxic traps enable him to shred health quickly to set up for a K.O. His biggest vulnerability is how sluggish some of his attacks are if he misses, and he can be trapped in his own bubble if not careful.

  Wrastor is a falcon who dominates the air space, performing strong attacks in the air instead of on the ground, making him a uniquely powerful character. Most of his moves hit opponents into the air, allowing him to continuously attack using forward or up strong attacks or neutral specials as easy finishers. Wrastor’s Froward Special is also useful as the slipstream it casts creates a line for him to follow that increases his overall speed.

 <p>
  Wrastor’s neutral special spins him around, turning into a tornado for a few seconds, making it an effective move in combos and dealing damage in a decent-sized area. Holding the button down moves him upwards, which allows Wrastor to dodge most projectiles and carry away any opponent in his way. His only weakness is his projectile cannot be repeatedly used and does no real knockback or damage, but he makes up for this in his aerial combo skills.

  Maypul is the self-appointed Guardian of the Aetherian Forest, an agile ferret-raccoon wielding two leaf blades with the best movement speeds in the game. Her most vital tool is her netural special, the Watcher’s Mark ability, a quickly thrown seed that marks opponents and allows her to sling-shot herself to them for extended and devastating combos.

  Maypul also has seeds she plants with her down special, which grows into a plant that wraps an opponent, locking them in place. Her strong attacks involve flinging her vines, dealing great damage, or wrapping up marked opponents. While Maypul is somewhat difficult to learn, mastering her moves will allow gamers to juggle their opponents easily.

  Clairen is a black panther from the future, wielding a flaming sword with the ability to stun opponents with precise attacks.

  Clairen’s recovery is effective in gaining ground and dealing damage, as her up special can be used twice in a row. Her forward special teleports her forward while leaving behind a plasma burst that heavily damages enemies caught within. Her down special counters attacks by preventing all damage and sending opponents flying away.

  Zetterburn is a beast with a flaming mane and blasts his enemies away with fiery combos. His deadly close-range combos paired with long-range fire projectiles make him a challenging opponent. Zetterburn’s moves set his enemies aflame, dealing damage over time while getting hits in. His specials can throw a wall of fire out to buff him and control the stage.

 <p>
  Zetterburn’s strength lies in his explosive combinations, with many sweeping attacks like his up tilt that launches opponents upwards. His neutral air makes him flip into a cartwheel with a wide attack radius, and his down air slams him and anyone in the way straight down for great damage. He may not have the best neutral attacks compared to other characters, but his burning attacks and amazing combo game keep him locked as one of the best fighters to play.

  Fleet the fox is a powerful and nimble character wielding a bow and tornado powers. She can float for several seconds upon jumping to keep herself safe and control the rhythm of the fight. Her neutral special has five charges and empowers her normal attacks with a potent tornado ability. Once her special hits the target, it eventually launches them upwards with a gust of wind. The only downside here is her opponents can transfer the tornado effect back to her before the timer runs out.

 <p>
  Fleet can jab her tornado-powered arrows up close as well, making her an extremely versatile character at all ranges. She can shoot a moving tornado with her side special that throws her opponents off-guard. Her up special has great recovery and can also be used up close for an awesome K.O. With her timed tornado abilities and insane buffing powers, Fleet easily ranks as the best character in
  <em>
   Rivals of Aether 2
  </em>
  .

     <li>
      Party composition is crucial in
      <strong>
       <em>
        Baldur's Gate 3
       </em>
      </strong>
      due to the game's adherence to
      <strong>
       <em>
        D&amp;D
       </em>
      </strong>
      5e rules, as the wrong choices can lead to tough fights.
     </li>
     <li>
      The flexible class system allows for interesting and optimized party builds, with various setups like Classic Baldur's Gate, Back to Basics, Hunter's Mark, and more.
     </li>
     <li>
      Players should experiment with different party compositions to find their preferred playstyle, whether it's focusing on damage, healing, tanking, or magic, to create the perfect team for their playthrough.

 <p>
  Party composition remains essential in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Baldur's Gate 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  , especially since it follows standard
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e
  </em>
  rules. This means that a slip-up can cause entire party wipes. Moreover, the impractical choice of party members might make
  <em>
   BG3's D&amp;D 5e
  </em>
  -based experience a bit underwhelming for some players.

 <p>
  Thankfully,
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  and its Early Access experience allowed players to have a glimpse of what encounters might feel like with various party compositions. The flexible Class system in
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  can pave the way for some interesting, optimized, and even overpowered party builds. Here are some party setups players might want to try out in their playthrough:

  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3 offers players 12 classes to choose from, each with multiple subclasses that are all subtly different from one another. There are a lot of possible team compositions to choose from, and it's not always clear which ones synergize with each other well.

 <p>
  With how much freedom players have in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  through multiclassing and respecing, there's no reason to stick to traditional or even conventional party setups. Sometimes, it's simply more fun to go for something completely unexpected and silly, such as a party of four Bards for example. The idea first rose to massive popularity when a viral video by Okoii featuring four Halfling Barbarians spread on YouTube.

 <p>
  Even the "weaker" classes, when multiple of them, can be extremely potent. Players can go for a full-on melee party with Barbarians or Fighters to demolish their enemies, or gather a group of Wizards to light the battlefield with a flurry of spells.

  There's great synergy between various elements in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , such as water and lightning. This combination is so powerful, that targets who have the Wet status receive twice as much damage from any source of Lightning damage.

 <p>
  For this party, three out of four party members will focus on dealing Lightning damage. Shadowheart can remain as a support, but spec into Tempest Cleric, which gives access to very powerful Lightning spells and reactions. Storm Sorcerer is the perfect option for Gale, with far more power than a simple Wizard. The player should opt for a Charisma character like a Sorcadin, with a focus on Storm Sorcerer as well. The last slot is for a melee character and is relatively free, but whoever is put in should have Lightning resistance as any surface will likely become Electrified with this party composition.

 <p>
  This party composition is credited to Reddit user hearthebeard and plays into a theme of necromancy and having plenty of summons. It utilizes some of the lesser well-known classes and sub-classes in the game, which is why it can be a nice way to spice up gameplay for those who are tired of the usual meta compositions.

 <p>
  What's even cooler is that players can include camp members here who would normally be considered good, like Halsin and Karlach. Of course, anyone can be respeced freely in the game, but if going by character designs and themes, having Halsin as the Spore Druid and Karlach as the Wildheart Barbarian just works. Players will take advantage of various summons and controlling zombies with this party composition. The more the merrier.

 <p>
  As the name of this
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  party build suggests, these characters usually don't get along very well, and this adventure may finally see them become eye-to-eye with one another. Naturally, Halsin doesn't like Minthara for trying to attack the grove and players need to work to receive Lae'Zel's approval.

 <p>
  Besides the story point of view of this party composition, combining these four classes together shows great promise. First, all of them but the Sorcerer, can attack multiple times. They can also easily hold their own, especially if Halsin wild shapes into an owlbear that has a lot of health to spare and hits hard.

  Players who have enjoyed any of the past
  <em>

  titles will love this party setup as it requires the aid of two fan favorites from the old games. In
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  , the player can recruit both the Ranger Minsc and the Druid Jaheira to their team. Both of them are capable fighters who are sure to feel familiar to those who have enjoyed the franchise for a long time while also creating a great team composition for future acts.

 <p>
  The player will be required to be the main tank of the group and therefore will need to choose a class such as Fighter to have a chance of surviving on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Gale can aid the team from afar through his mix of damage and support spells.

 <p>
  It's never wrong to rely on the basics. As with most RPG setups, a party composed of a tank, a pair of melees, and magical DPS, as well as a healer, won't go wrong – and the same works with
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  . Instead of Shadowheart, players should opt for a Light Domain Cleric to gain access to decent healing Spells as well as buffs. Meanwhile, Lae'zel (Battle Master) can dominate the battlefield by controlling the flow of melee combat.

 <p>
  Meanwhile, Astarion (Thief) easily boasts high DPS, especially with Sneak Attacks. Lastly, Gale (Wizard) can fit into multiple builds, especially given the Wizard's flexible arsenal of Spells. Gale can set up battles by creating surfaces or punish enemy groups with AOE.

 <p>
  Players who want to maximize damage over any distance might want to pair Astarion (Thief) 's devastating Sneak Attacks and overall DPS with a versatile Ranger. That way, the Ranger can complement Astarion's melee damage with their own long-ranged DPS specialization. Additionally, a Ranger with an alternate pair of dual-wielded weapons can easily switch to melee should the need arise.

  Moreover, Gale (Conjuration) can ensure that allies won't get hurt with his AOE Spells, leaving players with more room to play around with mobility. Lastly, Shadowheart (Trickery Domain) remains reliable with her range of healing and support Spells.

 <p>
  Clerics are the most versatile class in all of
  <em>
   Baldur’s Gate 3
  </em>
  because they can do basically everything to a certain extent. Tanking, DPSing, support, melee, magic, and everything in between is possible to do as a Cleric. This party composition showcases this perfectly. Tempest Cleric is easily the star of this show, embodying the essence of the storm better even than a dedicated Storm Sorcerer, which is actually a really good class to multiclass into for this build (but not required). Both Life and Tempest Cleric receive heavy armor proficiency, allowing them to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Fighter in the front lines. Only the Light Cleric is somewhat squishy, meant to serve as ranged support and deal damage via Light spells.

 <p>
  In the early levels, Light Cleric shines the brightest as early Light spells are very powerful against the enemies players are likely to face at that time. However, as levels increase and enemies become tougher, Tempest and Life Cleric take center stage. Fighter is always an excellent option because of Action Surge and incredible melee damage, providing reliability in lieu of flashy spells.

  Players might try their hand in a party largely devoted to long-ranged tactics, with a bodyguard to protect them. Essentially, Lae'zel as a Fighter with the Battle Master as a versatile Subclass works best to tank for such a party, especially when buffed by a Light Domain Cleric. That way, the Battle Master can demolish most enemies before even getting to the party.

  A Warlock and Wizard tandem can pepper through enemy forces with their mix of single-target and AOE Spells. The quick-fire nature of the Warlock and the meticulous versatile Spells of the Wizard work well to achieve this type of play.

  Looking for unfiltered rage and destruction, players should focus on a party with the main goal of hitting hard and worrying about actual tactics later. That being said,
  <strong>
   <em>
    BG3
   </em>
   party composition
  </strong>
  is still incredibly important as even while using a Barbarian with the Berserker subclass, this unrelenting frenzy still needs support from ranged spellcasters as well as healers like the cleric.

 <p>
  Essentially, the party can be split into two teams, with Lae'zel focusing on one enemy with the player as a Monk supporting them. Meanwhile, Karlach, who's a Barbarian, does the same with similar support from Shadowheart. A lot of the focus will be put on the Barbarian that needs to get hit, and therefore the Fighter is there to pick off any stragglers that attempt to harm the rest of the group.

  As Shadowheart is a Trickery Domain Cleric, some believe she doesn't do her job well. Thankfully, a main character centered around the Cleric (Light Domain) build may help a party shine. The Light Domain equips Clerics with a decent range of buffing and healing Spells, as well as damaging Spells. Having this Cleric with a

  For added damage players could then recruit Halsin (Circle of the Moon) to be the main target for enemies. While transformed into a bear, Halsin gains a lot of defense while also hitting hard. This works well with Lae'Zel (Battle Master) dealing further up-close damage and Wyll (The Fiend) as the ranged DPS controller for the perfect

 <p>
  In contrast to the
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  team composition of Team Patrons, the Holy Warriors have a heavy focus on the power of light to make a difference and defeat the forces of evil. Players will be relying on a Paladin to protect them from the majority of opponents in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , with Minthara being a perfect option. However, while this may be a holy team, players will have to do some unlawful things to recruit Minthara, and therefore it may be easier for the players themselves to take on the role of Cleric.

 <p>
  Unlike other teams, this party setup has the chance of receiving two Clerics, as players will also require the aid of Shadowheart. What makes this group so great is how they are all likely to defend themselves, minus Gale (Wizard) who will require defending while he deals a great amount of DPS damage.

  Adventurers on a quest to obtain an ancient artifact might find themselves facing a ton of challenges. In fact, they may not be as "equipped" as others might be. Players who want a classic adventuring setup may want to lean away from Classes and instead focus on archetypes that can make combat and roleplay easier.

  Players should always dedicate a character for Charisma and Charisma-based Checks in order to excel in most dialogue options. Moreover, they should have a character with the most Proficiencies in Skills to navigate most environments. In terms of battle, the party should have a dedicated DPS and Healer in order to ensure their survival.

  The idea of the traveling circus is the fantastical and the extraordinary, all of which are great describing words for classes that can cast spells. The bard's role is to inspire the party to try their best through a well-placed tune that can improve Lae'Zel's rolls during combat, especially as she will be expected to tank many of the hits available.

  Players call hacks whenever they see Rogues, as other players easily make OP builds with them. Interestingly,
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  allows the same flexibility as Rogues. Pairing Astarion (Rogue) with another Rogue easily racks up melee DPS, especially when piling up Surprise Attacks, Sneak Attacks, and sheer mobility.

  Likewise, the sheer stats and features that Rogues have allow them to make evasive tank builds, where they "tank" damage by actually avoiding most attacks. This party works well with Lae'zel (Fighter) as a traditional tank to distract enemies. Lastly, Shadowheart (Trickery Domain) can ensure the party survives.

  Who doesn't love pets? A great alternative to a simple Ranger would be a Ranger Beast Master, especially since the Giant Spider Companion easily gives the party a tank. As Larian has recently announced that Halsin will become a permanent party member for the group after Act 1, Halsin can instead become the tank of the group through his use of the Wild Shape ability.

 <p>
  In turn, this party can have its other members focus on various useful Spell strategies. For instance, Wyll (Warlock) can focus on single-target damage, while Gale (Wizard) focuses on obliterating enemies via AOE. Later into the game players will discover the possibility of recruiting Minsc, a ranger from the past
  <em>

  titles, until then a player may decide to use Lae'Zel or instead use co-op.

  Players fighting dangerous enemies and powerful bosses might want to keep their distance as much as possible. Thankfully, they want to try a ranged-focused build to pull this off. Essentially, their Lae'zel (Fighter) should specialize in the Archery Fighting Style to gain a ranged bonus. This Fighter, paired with a Ranger (Hunter), brings in the most ranged physical damage in-game.

 <p>
  Wyll (The Fiend) and Gale (Wizard) will likely excel switching up the battlefield with surfaces and other ranged effects. However, players should note that this build does lack a Healer, so they better stock up with their healing Spells, healing Scrolls, and healing potions.

  As the name suggests, Nature's Blessing takes all the party members and classes that have a nature theme to them and puts them together to form a group of adventurers who hope to protect the forest and the people in it. Naturally, this means recruiting a Druid like Halsin who will become the team's magic-wielding tank. Minsc can then be recruited again to become the ranged DPS of the group, although his subclass isn't known, he'll likely be a Beast Master.

  Players will take on the role of the Monk, a class that only was added during the full release of the game, where players could take the subclass of the Way of the Four Elements to keep the nature theme. Karlach's subclass is yet to be known, though a Barbarian is an ideal pick for this composition with a nature-oriented feel that is sure to leave foes blundering.

  The Sorcerer is the most dangerous spellcasting class in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  , capable of raining multiple Fireballs down on enemies in a single turn with the combination of Quickened Spell Metamagic and Haste. Clerics have the biggest spell list to call upon, complementing the Sorcerer's incredible DPS with their access to healing and utility spells.

  Paladins are backup healers, tanks, and damage dealers rolled into one, and the strongest magic-based melee class in the game. Rangers are jack-of-all-trades physical damage dealers with decent utility to round out the lineup.

  Both Warlock and Bard are Charisma-based classes and can easily take up the role of the face character to easily pass dialogue checks. Bards and Rogues are absolutely incredible together because Bard's entire spell list revolves around different flavors of control spells, which the Rogue is the best class to capitalize on by using Sneak Attacks.

 <p>
  Circle of the Land Druids and Warlocks also have excellent synergy in combat as Warlocks can get access to Devil's Sight, which basically gives them permanent Darkness vision. Combined with a Land Druid's access to Darkness, this means that Warlocks can easily spam Eldritch Blast on blinded enemies without a loss in accuracy. Land Druids can also double as frontline tanks if the need arises in the early game via Wild Shape and in the late game via tanky summons.

  <strong>
   PS2
  </strong>
  games are some of the most beloved in the gaming community, as they were present at a time that many players agree was the golden era of consoles. While their graphics weren't the best and the game mechanics in many titles were a little clunky compared to what's available today, they still delivered an amazing experience and allowed players to have a ton of freedom.

 <p>
  While some PS2 games focused on crafting a single well-developed story that would have players talking about it for decades, others dived deeper and took the risk of doing the same, but with multiple choices. Games with many endings are complex, fun, and overall, interesting, as every choice matters. Here are some of the
  <strong>
   best PS2 games with branching storylines.

  <em>
   <strong>
    Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne

  This title's story focuses on a high school student who becomes a powerful being known as the Demi-fiend. In this fictional world, Tokyo has been invaded by demons as a result of the efforts of a mysterious evil cult, which unleashes the events of the rest of the game. Released in 2003 for the PS2,
  <em>
   Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne

  is certainly one of the best titles the console ever had.

However, when he reaches his destination, he discovers that the town is no longer what it used to be, and is now covered in a thick, ominous fog.

  This title is complex enough without adding branching storylines, since it presents players with amazing game mechanics that help build the feeling of horror and mystery. However, even though the game doesn't need them, there are four different serious endings and two joke endings, which adds another layer of depth to

  Unlike
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10
  </em>
  , which only had one ending, this title actually features several, each with its own events, consequences and rewards. This makes
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10-2

  much more interesting to play than its sequel in that regard and allows players to take full control of their experience as they progress through the game and uncover the many secrets each one has to offer. All in all, it's safe to say that
  <em>
   Final Fantasy 10-2

  is one of the best installments of the franchise.

  As players would expect from a title like this, combat revolves heavily around the use of over 40 different katanas. To obtain more katanas, players must defeat enemies and take them from their cold hands. That said, although there's a large weapon variety in
  <em>

  </em>
  , players can only carry up to three katanas at a time. This title features six different endings, which puts it ahead of many of the previous games that have been covered on this list so far.

  tells the tale of how she slowly but surely, starts remembering her childhood, as well as the people she met and the time she spent at the Rose Garden Orphanage. What makes this game interesting, is that everything is told from Jennifer's perspective, which means players must take everything they see or "remember" as her with a grain of salt due to the possibility of her memory being altered or blurry.

  The
  <em>
   Resident Evil
  </em>
  franchise is beloved by many and has been so since the first game was released more than two decades ago. While
  <em>
   <strong>
    Resident Evil: Oubtreak
   </strong>
  </em>
  isn't the best installment in the franchise, it still presents players with an interesting story that covers five different scenarios spanning from the early hours of the Raccoon City Destruction Incident, to the last few seconds of the event.

  This game probably has the most ambitious branching storyline covered on this list so far, as there are four different endings for each of the eight characters, making up a total of 32. This means that the possibilities are nearly endless when playing
  <em>
   Resident Evil: Outbreak

  opens with Laharl, the Prince of the Netherworld rising from his coffin to receive the news that he's been asleep for two years and that his father, King Krichevskoy has died.

  has multiple endings, making up a total of eight. There are bad endings, good endings, alternate endings, and many other alternatives that will keep players invested and wondering which one they got. All in all, this title presented a very fun experience to those who played it back in the day and kicked off a popular franchise that has spanned more than two decades at this point.

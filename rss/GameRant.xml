  There are many courier services in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Genshin Impact
   </em>
  </strong>
  Teyvat. For example, players may know that the Inazuma youkai, Kirara, is a "Gold Level Courier" of the Komaniya Express. This courier service is a famous company that has already expanded its services beyond the Land of Thunder.

  Similarly, players can find Courier's Longhouse in Natlan. Considering the people of Natlan can't freely leave the Nation of War, it's understandable that this delivery service is not known beyond the borders of Natlan. Despite its limited area of service, though, there seem to be a lot of mishaps happening still. For example, while exploring the Land of Pyro, players may come across some lost or damaged packages and letters. Thankfully, the item is intact enough to be returned to their respective senders. Bringing back these damaged packages and letters will reward players with
  <strong>
   The Packages Returned achievement in
   <em>
    Genshin Impact

   Genshin Impact

  usually adds tons of quality-of-life adjustments whenever a new major update arrives. As HoYoverse introduces tons of new content, it does not come as a surprise that certain important adjustments went unnoticed by many players, despite having a large impact on one of Genshin Impact's main assets: exploring the overworld.

  One of the most important changes
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  Version 5.0 introduced is increasing the World Level limit to 9. Upgrading the World Level in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  raises the levels of Normal Enemies, Elite Opponents, and Bosses by 10, significantly increasing the challenge and enhancing the rewards after beating them. A Reddit user named SuperAHDBatman expressed their gratitude for this change in a post that reached over 4k upvotes on the game's main subreddit. The Redditor, along with many fans in the comment section, claims that having enemies be much tougher in the overworld is refreshing. In fact, some of the enemies that can be found in World Level 9 Teyvat are on par with opponents from the Spiral Abyss, which is widely considered the hardest piece of end-game content in the game.

  The post also pointed out that while certain changes, such as increasing the HP pool for certain monsters and buffing their damage output, might seem small, they have a huge impact on the overall exploration and overworld experience. A lot of fans have pointed out that the increased drop rates allow them to build up their characters much easier. To unlock World Level 9 in
  <em>
   Genshin Impact
  </em>
  , players need to reach Adventure Rank 58.

  Some players even claim that they would not mind if HoYoverse introduced World Level 10 in the next couple of updates. In fact, a couple of comments stated that they don't even need a drop rate increase since they have most of their

  It's unlikely that HoYoverse will increase the world level in the coming months since the game's main focus will probably remain on the upcoming Natlan storyline and the new playable characters. The game has already revealed that one of the main villains of the Natlan arc will be Capitano,

  's First Fatui Harbinger.

  Pop is, as the name suggests, one of the most popular music genres in the world. Some of the most iconic artists and celebrities in the world came to be because of pop music. Even those who aren’t fans of the genre can’t deny the influence that it has had on the music industry.

  It’s no surprise, then, that there are plenty of pop stars available to download in

    The Sims 4

  gallery. Plenty of talented Simmers have tried their hand at recreating some of their favorite pop artists, and these are some of the best that players can add to their game.

  Lady Gaga is one of the most influential pop stars in the world, and has also become a popular actress. It’s not surprising that there are tons of Sim versions of her in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  gallery. Most of them are well-made, but this list's pick goes to this version from Simmer elip1306.

  This Lady Gaga Sim has nailed her distinctive facial features and preferred makeup style. This look represents her more recent style, with long blonde hair and classic Hollywood starlet glamour. There are plenty of awesome picks for Lady Gaga in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  , but make sure to check out this version for accuracy and simplicity.

  The princess of pop punk, Avril Lavigne, also has plenty of recreations in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  gallery. Some Simmers recreate her classic, younger look from the early 2000s, while others replicate her style as she got older.

  This version from Shimeon36 does a little of both, combining her more mature facial features with a style akin to that of her younger self. The face has been amazingly recreated, and the makeup is perfectly chosen. Avril’s iconic black eyeshadow and eyeliner make her bright blue eyes pop, just like in real life.

  Queen B has plenty of Sim replicas in the gallery, but this recreation by Snapdragon27 is a stand-out choice because of how well it replicates Beyoncé’s face. The nose shape, lips, cheekbones, and eyes are all stunning and finely crafted to be accurate to the superstar.

 <p>
  Snapdragon27 also got Beyoncé’s makeup on point. Her smoky eye shadow with a touch of sparkle and her deep red lipstick match some of Beyoncé’s most iconic looks. The choice of hair, jewelry, and the addition of a hat brings it all together to create a stylish and believable Beyoncé Sim.

  Simmer Darth_Geno has recreated famous pop and R&amp;B singer Mariah Carey twice, but this version portrays her iconic festive look from her "All I Want For Christmas is You" music video. Darth_Geno replicates Mariah's all-in-one red suit as perfectly as they can with tools available in Create a Sim.

 <p>
  Not only that, but Mariah’s facial features are spot on, representing her younger self from 1994 in comparison to Darth_Geno's other recration, based on her more recent years. The accuracy and attention to detail here are fabulous, much like Carey herself.

  Teenage heartthrob turned mature artist Justin Bieber is yet another pop star with tons of well-made and detailed replications in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  gallery. This pick comes from Simmer NiJaMa0522, who has hit the nail on the head for both Bieber’s features and outfit choices.

 <p>
  The stand-out feature of this Justin Bieber Sim is the eyes, as there is a sincerity to them that captures Bieber’s expressions perfectly. NiJaMa0522 also got every other aspect of Bieber’s appearance right, such as his slight stubble, eyebrow shape, and chiseled jaw. The only thing that seems to be missing are his tattoos, though they might just be covered up by the long-sleeved shirt. The sporty clothes are also well suited to Bieber, who often wears track pants and beanie hats.

  There are plenty of Dua Lipa Sims in the gallery, but this version from simmer Leanne62640 makes the list thanks to how well-made her face is. Dua Lipa has a beautiful, distinctive face which can be tricky to recreate well in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . Any mistake can become apparent when trying to replicate a face like that, but Leanne62640 manages to get her features perfect.

  The South Korean boy band BTS has been making waves since their debut in 2013, and have since become global superstars. There are versions of each of the seven members in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  gallery, as well as full households with the group. Among the best BTS Sims is this version of vocalist Park Jimin, made by Simmer lmgfio.

  Jimin has a particularly striking appearance in real life, with a beautiful face and delicate features. Lmgfio has recreated these perfectly, from his plush lips to his almond-shaped eyes. The Sim also wears subtle makeup on his eyes, which suits him well and is accurate to Jimin’s makeup style in the real world.

  It’s impossible not to include Taylor Swift, the reigning queen of pop, in a list of pop stars made in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  . There are so many well-made versions of her in the gallery that it's difficult to pick one. However, this version of Taylor from Simmer paulusion is almost identical to the real Taylor and therefore wins a spot on this list.

 <p>
  Paulusion has recreated Taylor’s facial features excellently, choosing to include her blonde hairstyle with bangs from her recent years. The makeup, especially the red lipstick, is also expertly chosen. The only issue is that the Sim requires a ton of packs, but Swifties that have all the necessary packs are sure to enjoy this realistic version of her.

  Ex-Disney star Miley Cyrus has made a name for herself as a musician in her own right, separating herself from the cheery and child-friendly Disney image she had to have in her
  <em>
   Hannah Montana
  </em>
  days. Her image has changed significantly over the years, so there are a lot of versions of her in
  <em>
   The Sims 4
  </em>
  gallery that recreate certain eras. This one is a more modern take from her "Endless Summer Vacation" era.

  Last but not least is the King of Pop himself: the late, great Michael Jackson. Simmer koaleigh has recreated Jackson’s iconic look from the iconic "Thriller" music video.

  Best of all, this Sim can transform into a werewolf, much like he does in the horror movie-themed music video. That does mean that players will need

    Baldur's Gate 3

  innovated within the established framework of
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  by placing a significant emphasis on its characters, making its party of companions the focal point of the game. With a potential follow-up now on the horizon, ensuring that the next game's party members are equally distinctive will be essential to continuing this success.

  While
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  features a decent representation of various
  <em>
   DnD
  </em>
  races, it leans more into specific archetypes rather than the broad diversity typically seen in the greater lore. There may be no Dwarves or Dragonborn in the party, but characters like Astarion being a High Elf vampire, or Gale being a human Wizard embedded with Netherese magic, offer memorable twists on more average fantasy character formulas. These unique takes have opened the door for options far beyond the typical
  <em>
   DnD
  </em>
  fare, leaving
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 4
  </em>
  stuck with a choice of returning to more conventional characters or embracing even wilder picks in the future.

  Baldur's Gate 3's Innovation Shined Over Familiarity
 </h3>
 <p>
  The game's ability to blend familiar fantasy tropes with tragic and bizarre character backstories played a key part in many players forging strong connections between players and
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's variety of companions. Previous
  <em>
   BG
  </em>
  titles experimented with the archetypes of some party members, but the cinematic presentation of the third entry took this to unprecedented heights. Not only does someone like Astarion have a firm place in the player's camp, but his character arc revolves around coming to terms with his vampiric heritage.

 <p>
  In the context of cut content, it appears that the party was originally intended to be even more diverse.
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 3
  </em>
  's cut Bard companion Helia would have been an elderly Halfling werewolf, adding some much-needed height variance to the party. Larian ultimately seems to have scaled back on quirkiness by excluding her, however, as there already exists a mix of a vampire and an interdimensional Githyanki in the content players ended up getting.

  Gimmicks Can't Overshadow Core Identity

 <p>
  The precedent set by characters like Astarion encourages the continuation of bold archetype blends in
  <em>
   BG4
  </em>
  , and this could be one of the most effective ways to emphasize whatever the theme of that game will be. The style of
  <em>
   BG3
  </em>
  shouldn't simply be imitated without a solid foundation justifying the presence of party member types that haven't had much spotlight in fantasy RPGs before, however, as this risks diluting the impact of a new cast. Hybrid or unconventional companions in
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 4
  </em>
  should be crafted with respect to them as more than just flashy additions meant to match the popularity of Astarion and Lae'zel, they need to serve the world in meaningful ways that don't undermine the emotional depth of the party as a whole.

 <p>
  All the different
  <em>
   DnD
  </em>
  permutations that the next
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  could explore in cinematic detail are an exciting prospect. However, it's equally important to keep the setting grounded by exploring characters and races that haven't yet had their time in the spotlight. The likes of gnomes and half-orcs deserve their own fleshing out as companions before a new narrative distracts from them with deeper-cut lore. If
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate 4
  </em>
  is to honor its legacy, it should strive to balance its own sense of unique identity with the remaining areas of the core
  <em>
   DnD
  </em>
  mythos.

  Pax West, the four-day gaming culture event, has ended for another year, and horror fans were treated to a life-like cosplay of Roxanne Wolf (also known as Roxy) from
  <strong>
   <em>
    Five Nights at Freddy’s
   </em>
  </strong>
  during the festivities. An entertainment booth celebrating the
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy’s
  </em>
  franchise took place in Seattle, Washington, hosting a handful of on-brand activities, including an animatronic meet-and-greet, and showcasing the
  <em>
   Secret of the Mimic

  demo.

  Posted by TUMEFATTORE on Reddit, a 50-second clip from the Pax West festival showed a perfect cosplay of Roxy, parading around the
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy’s
  </em>
  entertainment booth hosted by Steel Wool Studios. Created by self-taught mechanical engineer daregularsauce (also known as Atreyu) and worn by caustic_cola, the impressive build captured all of Roxy’s details, down to the green stripe in her hair, and the material used had a realistic, animatronic shine. Most
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach
  </em>
  players want to decommission Roxy, but fans visiting the booth flocked to get their photo taken with the cosplayer, while Roxy posed alongside other animatronics of Freddy Fazbear and Glamrock Freddy.

  One Reddit user had nothing but praise for the cosplay's craft and performance, saying, “I don't know if I'm more jealous of the people getting to meet the cosplayer or the cosplayer themselves for having a literal perfect Roxy costume.” Another admirer on Reddit noted Atreyu was one of the best cosplay artists working today, highlighting the perfect, plastic fursuit. Additionally, several fans from the
  <em>
   Five Nights at Freddy
  </em>
  's Reddit community wanted to hug the Roxy cosplayer immediately after watching the clip, and the creator’s exquisite work prompted the call for a
  <em>
   Security Breach
  </em>
  movie to be made. Furthermore, the community thought the Roxy cosplayer should have tracked down another performer playing the
  <em>

  protagonist, Gregory, to fight.

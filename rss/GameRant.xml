  Skins are a major part of many games, and some even rely solely on selling skins as their monetary schemes. Although skins aren't as important as the character itself in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wuthering Waves
   </em>
  </strong>
  , they can help bring a new feel to the game, or simply improve the appearance of players' favorite Resonators.

  2.0 also comes with an option to change between the two available Rovers. This means players are no longer stuck with the Rover they pick at the start of the game. For those who are interested in switching outfits or the Rovers themselves, here's

  The feature to change Rover is highly welcomed by the community, as many people end up liking the Rover they didn't choose after starting the game. It's also beneficial for players who pick the wrong main character in the beginning. Of course, players can also use this feature to experience the game as two different Rovers and enjoy a change in cutscene.

  Other than changing between the two available Rovers in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  , players can also change character's outfits in
  <em>
   Wuthering Waves
  </em>
  . Here's how you can change a character's skin in
  <em>
   WuWa
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Choose the character you want to change skin on.
  </li>
  <li>
   Press the outfit button on the bottom right.
  </li>
  <li>
   Choose which outfit to change to, then press
   <strong>
    Wear Outfit
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   For weapon projection, choose the weapon tab on the left side.
  </li>
  <li>
   Pick which weapon skin you want to use, then press
   <strong>
    Switch
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Of course, before players can change a Resonator's outfit and weapon projection, they must obtain the corresponding skins first. For example, to get Jinhsi's Peach Blossom skin, players can buy it in the store for 3280 Lunites (2680 on discount).
 </p>
 <p>
  Some skins are also available as a free reward, like Sanhua's Exorcistic Adjuration, which can be obtained for free by participating in the Dances For Spring's Return: Companion Invitation Login Event (available from January 23, 2025, until February 13, 2025). If players miss the giveaway, then they can buy Sanhua's skin from the Outfit Store for 1680 Lunites.

  To download and install mods for
  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  , you will first need to know where to browse and source such files. Nexus Mods tends to be the most reliable place for mods across many different games, with a solid category of different
  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  mods available, such as custom Slimes, gadgets, map edits, new areas, cheats, and more. These mods can be viewed by heading over to the
  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  page on Nexus, where you can browse until you find one or more that you wish to download and install.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before downloading mods, you will need to take a quick detour and
  <strong>
   download the
   <em>
    Slime Rancher
   </em>
   Mod Loader (SRML) from Nexus Mods.
  </strong>
  This is an application that enables you to successfully load and toggle mods that you have downloaded for the game, with an auto-locate function for your save directory, and the possibility to work with both the Epic Games Store and Steam variants of the game. Most Importantly, SRML minimizes the chance of corrupting your save data, as it stores your modded save files separately from your unmodded save files.
 </p>
 <p>
  To download a mod from Nexus Mods, you will need to open the mod page. First, it is important to read the description of any mod you plan to download to check for prior warnings, important details, and specifics regarding the installation directory, as some mods may be required to be placed in different locations following download.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once you're ready to download, you can hit the
  <strong>
   Manual Download
  </strong>
  button on the right side of the mod page banner, which will take you to the download page. At this point, if there are any additional mods that the download in question relies on to work properly, you will be prompted to download them as well. In this case, you will need to make sure that you download all required files, otherwise you may run into errors and bugs/game crashes.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can now use the
  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  Mod Loader to load your mods and successfully customize your
  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  gameplay experience. You may place your downloaded mod files into the Mods directory in the SRML folder. If this directory does not exist, you may need to create it by manually extracting and placing SRML in your
  <em>
   Slime Rancher
  </em>
  game directory folder. The default path for the gameplay folder should be something similar to the example below, but may differ if you customized your installation beforehand.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Slime Rancher\SRML\Mods

  <em>
   <strong>
    Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
   </strong>
  </em>
  players call for developer Treyarch Studios to make dog tags in Kill Confirmed drastically smaller as they are "too large" and "intrusive," according to various community members. Kill Confirmed has been a popular game mode ever since its introduction in 2011's
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  and remains much-loved in the most recent entry,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  ​​​​​, but players still believe it needs this one major change.
 </p>
 <p>
  While Kill Confirmed is a popular game mode in the
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  community, it isn't the only one receiving some flack from players. Since the launch of the latest
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  title,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's Free-for-All mode has been broken, sparking outrage in the community. Usually, the objective of Free-for-All is simple: the first player to reach a score of 30 is crowned the winner. Unfortunately, due to
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  classifying assists as eliminations, players are reaching a score of 30 and not even placing in the top three.

  Black Ops 6 Players Want Smaller Dog Tags in Kill Confirmed
 </h2>
 <p>
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  players are now calling for a major
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  update to address one of the most frustrating issues in Kill Confirmed: intrusive dog tags. In a new post on Reddit, user Willfan8 said Kill Confirmed dog tags are "too big," before showing a side-by-side comparison of the same mode in
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Black Ops 6,
  </em>
  both of which are developed by Treyarch Studios. The comparison shows a night and day difference between the size of dog tags, with
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  's being significantly smaller and lower to the ground, whereas
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  's are large enough to keep an enemy completely hidden from the player.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">
   Other
   <em>
    Black Ops 6
   </em>
   players also aren't happy with the size of dog tags in Kill Confirmed. Reddit user Ifitfitsitshipz said they "don't like that they float up," before stating that dog tags should be on the ground so that they don't block the player's view. Others, such as Ponchorello7, said that they have been killed "one too many times" because they were running to collect a dog tag, only to be eliminated by an enemy that was hiding behind the unnecessarily large dog tag.

 <p>
  Although there are clearly plenty of players who want to see Treyarch make the dog tags smaller, similar to the days of
  <em>
   Black Ops 2
  </em>
  , others were joking that they aren't actually big enough because their teammates still don't collect them. While it's not a particularly new issue,
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  players haven't been happy with teammates not playing the objective ever since the game launch in October 2024. Kill Confirmed is just one of the many objective-based modes that sees most players completely ignore the objective and opt to grind kills instead, so reducing the size of the dog tags could end up creating an even more frustrating experience for those who actually play the objective.

  <strong>
   Xbox Game Pass
  </strong>
  is losing
  <em>
   Figment: Journey Into the Mind
  </em>
  and at least five other titles on January 15. These removals outnumber the current list of new Xbox Game Pass titles that have been confirmed for January 2025.
 </p>
 <p>
  The XGP content catalog typically shrinks every two weeks, in the middle and at the end of every month. This most recently happened on December 31, when Xbox Game Pass lost six titles, including
  <em>
   LEGO 2K Drive
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Another half a dozen games are now set to follow suit on January 15. According to the newly updated "Leaving Soon" section of the Xbox app, that's the date when Xbox Game Pass will lose
  <em>
   Common'hood
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Escape Academy
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Exoprimal
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Figment: Journey Into the Mind
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Insurgency: Sandstorm
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Those Who Remain
  </em>
  . Escape-the-room game
  <em>
   Escape Academy
  </em>
  had the longest stint on the service out of this upcoming wave of departures, having originally been added to Xbox Game Pass back in July 2022.

  Achievement hunters determined to make the most of their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions will be happy to know that almost all of these soon-to-be-departing titles can be comfortably beaten in just a few days' time each. The only outlier is
  <em>
   Insurgency: Sandstorm
  </em>
  , whose multiplayer nature demands a significantly bigger time investment.
 </p>
 <p>
  The "Leaving Soon" section of the Xbox app has historically been an incomplete source of information about incoming departures from the service. In other words, it's possible that even more titles will be leaving Xbox Game Pass on January 15. The complete list of upcoming removals should be confirmed alongside the first wave of January 2025 XGP releases, which is expected to be officially announced in the coming days. That announcement may happen no later than January 7, which is when
  <em>
   Road 96
  </em>
  —the final game from Microsoft's most recently shared XGP lineup—is scheduled to reach the service.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking at the slightly bigger picture, Xbox Game Pass has so far confirmed only five titles for January 2025. While it's likely to receive even more throughout the month, it's also bound to lose additional games on January 31. The last time that the service added more titles than it removed in a single month was back in July 2024, making this ongoing streak of monthly net losses its longest one to date. As for the near-future additions to Xbox Game Pass,
  <em>
   Road 96
  </em>
  will be followed by a trio of day-one releases in the form of
  <em>
   Eternal Strands
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Sniper Elite: Resistance
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector
  </em>
  , all of which are scheduled to arrive in the January 28–31 period.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  features different Mythical, Legendary, and Mega Pokemon as raid bosses. While such monsters already possess amazing capabilities, coming as raid bosses can boost their prowess even further. Winning such raids can reward you with Shiny encounters.

  developers at Niantic significantly boost the Combat Power (CP) of raid bosses, making it extremely challenging to defeat them. Also, since most of these monsters are legendaries, their Shiny counterparts are extremely rare. While preparing proper counters against them is extremely important, trainers must stay updated on the dates and times these raids are set. That said, this guide explores all the Mythical, Legendary, and Mega raids with their exact date and time for January 2025.

  Although there is a probability of a Shiny variant spanning after winning the raids, you should know that the Shiny encounter isn't guaranteed. You must win several
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  raids and encounter numerous Regular variants to match the Shiny odd. Keep in mind that getting a Mega, Shadow, Mythical, and Legendary Shiny Pokemon is extremely challenging.

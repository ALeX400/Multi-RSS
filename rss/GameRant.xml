	This chapter of
	<em>
	 <strong>
		Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
	 </strong>
	</em>
	begins with a Princess Peach Interlude. Much like in the original Paper Mario, we’ll be spending a little time after each chapter seeing what’s happening with Princess Peach.

	It turns out that, in
	<em>
	 Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
	</em>
	, Princess Peach has once again been kidnapped. This time her kidnappers are Grodus and the “X-Nauts”, who seem to be part of the same group as Lord Crump.

	After Grodus sends the “Three Shadows” to deal with Mario, the perspective shifts to Princess Peach. Try the door on the right to discover that it won’t open. It will mysteriously open as soon as you start heading away from it. Head on through, past an inactive elevator, and the door on the far right will also open.

	In this room, you’ll find TEC-XX, or TEC for short, the main computer of the laboratory Peach is imprisoned in. TEC claims to have experienced an “unknown program deviation” after observing Princess Peach, and has brought her here to investigate why. Princess Peach, hearing TEC’s description of the situation, suggests that TEC might be in love with her.

 <p>
	TEC asks Princess Peach to teach them about love, in exchange for granting her wishes (as long as they don’t involve letting her escape, naturally.) Peach considers this and asks TEC to help her contact Mario. TEC allows her to send an email, before sending her back to her room for the time being.

	After the Princess Peach segment, the perspective shifts to Bowser’s castle. We get to play as Bowser in this game from time-to-time too, so head over to the right side of the room to continue the story. Once you make it to the end of the room, Kammy Koopa will arrive to fill Bowser in on Mario’s quest for the Crystal Stars and Princess Peach’s most recent kidnapping.

	Bowser heads for Rogueport immediately, leaving a hole in his poor castle, and that’s all from Bowser for now.

	Now that we’re back with Mario and the gang, we learn that Koops is sticking with us for the rest of the journey. We’ll need to use the Magical Map at the Thousand-Year Door again to learn our next destination, but we can grab an extra badge here in Petalburg first. Head for the pink house and use Mario’s curse to turn sideways and slip through the gap in the fence. This gives us the “Mega Rush P” badge, which gives your partner a massive Attack boost when they only have 1HP left. High risk, but very powerful if used with care.

	As you head back towards Rogueport, you’ll get Princess Peach’s email. With the knowledge that Princess Peach is safe and her kidnappers are after the Crystal Stars, our goal remains the same, so back to Rogueport it is.

 <p>
	Once you make it back to the Rogueport Sewers you should head for the Thousand-Year Door, but it’s worth noting that you can access a few new spots in the Sewers now. In the room where you first entered the Rogueport Sewers, you can access a pipe behind some bars with Mario’s Curse, allowing you to visit the house of Merlee. Merlee can, for a fee, cast a spell on Mario to provide him with a bonus in combat. The duration of the bonus is determined by the amount of coins spent, while the effect is chosen at random. (This includes raised attack or defense power, boosted SP gain, and boosted Coin drops)

	There’s also a room full of spikes you can access, though you don’t have the tools to traverse it yet, and there’s a door behind bars in Rogueport Sublevel Three that we should save for later. When you reach the Thousand-Year Door, take a quick detour through the bars on the right side and use the spring to reach an airplane panel. Soar over to the other side of the room, use the spring, and grab the Shine Sprite on the platform. Once you’ve done all of that, head down to the Thousand-Year Door and show off the Crystal Star you got last chapter.

	After a quick trip to Professor Frankly, the group determines that the second Crystal Star is in the Boggly Woods. He also mentions an odd creature, one that we’ve definitely seen before, so that might be a clue to the warp pipe’s location.

		 You can special order a Contact Lens by speaking to the leftmost merchant in the Item Shop at Rogueport, to replace the one you broke. Once you order it, it’ll arrive pretty quickly (you’ll get an email about it) and you can give it to Zess T to unlock access to West Rogueport. After doing this, you can also speak to Zess T to cook using ingredients from your inventory. This can get you some very powerful items, so it’s worth trying.

	After entering the Woods, you’ll quickly encounter the Three Shadows, who have lost the picture of Mario they were given. We can head past them for now since they’re too busy arguing to notice the party.

 <p>
	In this area, you’ll start encountering Cleft, enemies with 2 Defense and spiked heads that can disguise themselves as rocks. As we saw during Chapter 1, this sort of enemy can’t be hurt by fire but is vulnerable to other damage types. You can use items and the “Piercing Blow” badge to break through their defenses and take them out. Mario’s new Special Ability, Earth Tremor, is also very effective against them. If you’ve upgraded Koops using the Shine Sprites from last chapter, his attacks will be strong enough to do a little damage through their defenses too.

 <p>
	You’ll also start encountering Pale Piranha here, a Piranha Plant enemy that has no defense but decent attack power. They’ll bite you if you try to use Jump, so stick to using the Hammer and Koops to damage them. The “Power Smash” badge can one-shot them if you don’t fail the action command.

	Keep heading deeper into the woods and you’ll soon see the Great Tree. Follow Punio to reach the tree. When you reach the tree itself and Punio heads for the door, take a quick detour to the right side of the tree and check behind the small waterfall to get an “FP Plus” badge. Talk to Punio to learn about a secret entrance that’ll get you around the door. To uncover the secret entrance, we’ll need the help of Madame Flurrie, a wind spirit.

	Head back out from the Tree and follow Punio’s directions. You’ll begin encountering Dark Puffs here. These are living clouds with no Defense and 3 HP. When they’re flying higher up, you’ll need to use Mario and Goombella’s jumping attacks to reach them. Be careful not to do that when they’re charged with electricity, though, or you’ll take damage. Luckily, Mario’s hammer works just fine when they’re closer to the ground. Head through the small gap at the far side of the area to find your way onto a narrow ledge and reach a switch. This raises the pipe and airplane panel nearby, putting them higher up and giving you a clear flight-path. Walk a little further to the left from the switch to grab a Star Piece, use Koops to hit the Shine Sprite block from the airplane panel, and fly over to the right to reach a block.

	This block contains the “Quake Hammer” badge, which allows Mario to deal damage to all enemies on the ground or on the ceiling, which will be very useful later. On the next screen, hit the third tree along to get a Star Piece, then slip through the gap on the far right of this area and head for the pipe to get to Flurrie’s house.

	After entering Flurrie’s house, try the door on the right to get her attention. She’ll explain that, though she wants to help, she can’t leave the house without her favorite necklace. Luckily, we already saw the Necklace on the way here, in the hands of the Three Shadows. As we head back to look for them, they finally find their sketch. This means they know what Mario looks like now, so once we make it back to them we’ll be in for a fight.

	The Three Shadow Sisters are a pretty straightforward fight. Vivian has no special gimmick here, but Marilyn can charge her attacks to deal a lot more damage. Beldam is particularly dangerous, using magic to shrink the party (reducing their Attack) and make her team larger (boosting their Attack.) She can also use a Blizzard attack that has an Attack power of 2, and a lightning spell. Both of these can hit your entire party. This fight is a fair bit easier if you have AOE badges (like the Quake Hammer) or items, such as the POW Block or Earth Quake. Take down Beldam first, then Marilyn, since Vivian is the least dangerous in this battle. Clearing this battle will get you 30 Star Points and Flurrie’s Necklace.

	Take the Necklace back to Flurrie’s house to recruit Flurrie and continue the story. Madame Flurrie can create strong gusts of wind, blowing away certain objects. This can, for example, be used wherever there’s a loose piece of paper hanging off a wall to peel it back and reveal a secret. Flurrie can also disorient enemies by blowing on them, spinning them and making it easy to land a First Strike. In combat she can strike single targets with a Body Slam or blow away weaker foes with a powerful gust of wind.

	Before we head back, go into Flurrie’s room and open the treasure chest for the “Super Appeal P” badge, which allows your partner to generate more Star Power when using Appeal. After taking the pipe from outside Flurrie’s House to get back into the woods, grab a Volt Mushroom near the gap and retrace your steps to the Great Tree. This is a good opportunity to try out Flurrie’s abilities in combat, since she can easily handle the Cleft and Dark Puff enemies with her Gale Force attack.

	Head up to where Punio stood when talking about the secret entrance to the tree, then use Flurrie’s ability to blow away the paper hiding the entrance. Punio will head inside and unlock the security door, allowing us to use the main entrance. Unfortunately, the X-Nauts seem to have taken over the Tree already, so it’s time for a fight.

 <p>
	X-Nauts have 4 HP and 3 Attack, but 0 Defense. The real danger lies in their ability to buff themselves with potions, though this shouldn’t be an issue as long as you take them down quickly. Once they’re defeated, quite a few Punies will show up. Though they’re a bit scared of Mario at first, most of them trust Punio enough to give us a chance. Unfortunately, a large Puni named Puniper isn’t convinced and tells Punio that most of the Punies (including his sister and the elder) have been captured already. Puniper says they’ll only consider joining our “little crusade” if we’re able to rescue the rest of the Punies.

	The first pipe leads you to the second floor, but the only thing we can do here right now is take the pipe on the right side of the room and go up to the Third Floor. You’ll encounter a new enemy type here: Yux. These X-shaped creatures can create Mini-Yux, which protect them from attacks and items. In order to damage Yux, you’ll need to get rid of any Mini-Yux on the battlefield first. Mini-Yux aren’t able to attack, but can replicate themselves if left alone and render the main Yux invulnerable, so you’ll need to take them out fast. Luckily, they only have 1 HP. If they get out of control, have Flurrie use Gale Force to get rid of them all at once.

	Use the Pipe on the left side of the room to go up to a higher section of this floor, then head through the pipe opposite to reach the Fourth Floor. The Elder Puni is in a cage here, so we’re gonna need a key. Slightly to the left, Petuni and the other Punies that were captured are locked up in a separate cage. The two cages are color-coded, so we’re looking for a red key and a blue key.

	Head left to find a room where the X-Nauts are storing their supplies. The X-Naut here has the key, but Ms Mowz the thief is one step ahead of us. She leaves us with a kiss on the cheek and a clue about the Crystal Star’s location, before escaping via a convenient window (again.)

	Sadly, the X-Naut recovered from her attack while we were talking, and we’ll still need to fight them. Power Smash for an easy instant-win, then loot the room. You’ll get the Red Key and an Ultra Mushroom. Use the Red Key to open the Elder’s Cell, then sit through the multi-hour lecture from hell that she’s been saving up for Punio (don’t worry, we get to skip to the end.)

	After the Elder leaves, we’ll need to head back to the Punies on the first floor. Thanks to the Elder’s intervention, we’re now able to get help from the Punies as we navigate the tree. We can use the Puni Orb to gather Punies near pedestals, which will let us access some new areas.

	Now that we have 11 Punies following us, we can finally solve the puzzle on the Second Floor. Place the Puni Orb in the slot to make the Punies weigh down the floor switch. This will reveal a Pipe, so grab the orb from the slot and head down. This will get you to the other side of the locked door on the First Floor, so take out the X-Nauts and hit the switch next to the door to unlock it.

 <p>
	Drop down the gap on the right to find a Shine Sprite, then use the pipe on the left side to get back up. Place the Puni Orb in the pedestal on the left, use Flurrie to blow the Punies off the ledge and into the soapy water below. They’ll rise back up inside bubbles, so keep blowing to push them across the gap and get them to the other side of the room.

	This section of the Great Tree is where we’ll start encountering another new enemy type: Pider. These Spider-like creatures have 5 HP, 2 Attack, and 0 Defense. They can sometimes spit three consecutive web-wads as a special attack, requiring you to time multiple consecutive blocks. More irritating is their ability to scare off the Punies, so you’ll need to take them out before you can get help from the Punies in their vicinity.

 <p>
	After encountering the first Pider, gather up your Punies and head down the pipe to the lower section of this area. Head to the right and go down the pipe there to reach Sublevel 2. A Jabbi here is holding the Blue Key we need, but it flees as soon as it sees us. If you fall off the walkway here, you can get a Star Piece by hitting one of the bushes with the hammer. There’s also a Save Block here and a Secret Shop accessible by using Flurrie to reveal the entrance (to the left of the Save Block.)

	Once you’ve visited the shop and stocked up, use the pipe to head back up to the narrow walkway, and head right to follow the Jabbi with the key. This will trigger a fight with a squad of 10 Jabbi, but you can’t really help out here. The Punies you brought with you will handle them automatically and, as long as you outnumber them, the fight will be won in no time. The Punies will dismantle the Jabbi fortress and open up the path forward, where you can nab the blue key.

	Head back to the cage where Petuni and the other Punies are being held, use the key to open it, and we now have the numbers to take on the Jabbi on the opposite side of Sublevel 2. Eliminate the Piders on the narrow walkway and head into the room. This time, despite the numbers advantage, we’ll still lose without a little help. The trick here is to use Madame Flurrie to stunlock the Jabbi by blowing them away, giving the Punies a huge advantage.

	Head further to the left, down a pipe, and out a door on the right to find a Puni pedestal to activate. Using this will drop a cage, re-trapping all the Punies, and reveal a pipe on the right. Lord Crump will show up and brag about his brilliant plan, so wait for him to leave and then turn sideways to slide out through the bars. Take the new pipe to head further down the tree and activate a switch. This causes four more switches to appear in the room where we found the Blue Key, so we’ll need to head back there next.

	Head through the newly opened path to find the chest containing the Super Boots. Toadette will appear from thin air to explain how to use them, but they essentially allow Mario to perform a Spin Jump that smashes through certain types of flooring. Use them in the previous room to break through the floor and reach the lower part of this room. Use Koops to snag the Charge badge from the pillar on the left, then platform over to the Shine Sprite Block and grab it.

	Head to the right from here to enter a room with a Puni pedestal. Activate it to release the Crystal Star, which is promptly stolen by Lord Crump. He sets a time bomb and escapes through a Pipe, so it’s time to run for it. Follow Crump to quickly ascend back to Sublevel 2, past a short fight with some X-Nauts, and then keep moving up towards the Tree Entrance.

	A quick Tattle Analysis from Goombella shows that Magnus has 30 HP, 2 Attack, and 1 Defense. This also reveals that its fists can be launched for a rocket punch. While separated from the main body, these fists have 2 HP, 4 Attack, and 0 Defense. Aside from the rocket punch attacks, Magnus can also perform a crushing stomp. The Stomp attack is a little tricky to block, since Crump will perform a few feints before committing to the attack. Specifically, he’ll feint twice before stomping, so learn the timing so you can block the real stomp safely.

	Finally, Magnus can perform a ground stomp while standing in place which will damage a single target. To block this, you’ll need to hit A when the robot performs its second jumping stomp, after stamping with alternating feet for a little. With Magnus defeated, the Punies are safe and Mario can claim the second Crystal Star. With the power of the Emerald Star, Mario gains an extra point of Star Power and access to the “Clock Out” special move.

		World of Warcraft

	Remix: Mists of Pandaria, has brought back some fan favorites from the MoP era. One of these fan favorites happens to be the Mini Mana Bomb, which is a toy for Horde players. Here's how to get it.

 <p>
	The Mini Mana Bomb is a small Mana Bomb that is made to be a remembrance of Theramore's Fall at the hands of the Horde. Horde players who assisted in the assault on Theramore were mailed this item before the Mists of Pandaria expansion. Once the expansion went live, players would need to travel to Dustwallow Marsh and purchase the item from Zidormi. Since the item was only available to those who completed the
	<strong>
	 Theramore's Fall Scenario
	</strong>
	, a lot of players missed out on it. Thankfully, the item has been brought back during the remix event that is going on.
 </p>

 <p>
	This toy is an interesting one. Players can throw the miniature bomb on the ground and watch it explode, similar to the way that it exploded Theramore. However, the Mana Bomb used during that event utterly destroyed Theramore, and this one is just for show. Considering what it stands for, it is shocking that the Horde players are able to obtain it.

 <p>
	At the beginning of the MoP Remix event, players could only get the Mini Mana Bomb the same exact way they could originally. They would have to get the Theramore's Fall Feat of Strength (Achievement) by completing the
	<strong>
	 Theramore's Fall Scenario.
	</strong>
	However, players had to do it at exactly level 35, or they would be locked out of obtaining it. Since this was the case, Blizzard decided to add a second way to obtain the item; that way, all players participating in the event could have access to it.

 <p>
	In order to obtain the item the other way, players will just need to head to any Infinite Bazaar in the region. Once there, find
	<strong>
	 Horos
	</strong>
	, who is labeled as the Rare Collections seller. He will sell Horde players the toy for
	<strong>
	 500 Bronze
	</strong>
	, which can be farmed pretty easily. After it has been purchased, players will find it with their other toys.

	player Strawberrysodastars shared their finding with fellow fans, offering a couple of screenshots showing Leah's cabin with Leah asleep on the floor. Her bed is visible in the room, but for whatever reason, she didn't make it there and instead fell asleep in the entryway of the front door. It's an amusing sight, to be sure, but also one that caused a problem for the player, as they couldn't leave once she fell asleep. Sleeping NPCs can't be pushed or woken, so the only options available would be to quit out and restart the day, or allow themselves to pass out in Leah's cabin. The player isn't far enough into the game to have a teleportation device to get out.

	Other players expressed their amusement at the scene, though some also expressed surprise at the level of detail made visible by this odd moment.

	NPCs climb into their beds and fall asleep at night, but due to the blankets, nothing beyond their head is visible. However, it seems that developer ConcernedApe actually created sprites with the whole body for sleeping animations, even if they're not ordinarily seen.

	While being able to visit NPCs in their homes is one of the perks of befriending them, players may want to stay out of Leah's house close to the end of the day to avoid getting stuck there. It's not clear if Leah does this every time she goes to sleep, but at least one other player noted having experienced the same thing. Those who want to try and see if for themselves should either plan on resetting the day or bringing a warp totem to get out of there before their own character passes out at 2 am.

 <p>
	For players who prefer to take to the offensive side in
	<em>
	 MLB The Show 24
	</em>
	, there's some fortunate news ahead. Third basemen are quite popular when it comes to swinging the bat, thanks to their ability to swing for contact and power. Additionally, third basemen are on the lighter side of the defensive workload, with more focus being placed on first and second base, making their jobs easier and taking less out of their durability throughout a game.

 <p>
	The Minnesota Twins have some promising pieces in their bullpen and infield, and among those topping the charts is Royce Lewis. The 24-year-old American is entering his third season with the Twins, and his infielding abilities are only scratching the surface of his potential. In
	<em>
	 MLB The Show 24
	</em>
	, Lewis has good infielding metrics with decent Reacting and Arm Accuracy but lacks the Durability to keep him in long games that extend past nine innings.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
	Offensively, Lewis is better against right-handed pitchers and can use either his contact or power swing and switch things up to fool his opponent. His Batting Clutch also registers at an 80 rating, making him a must-have in the Twins' batting order. If his Plate Discipline and Vision statistics can improve over the year and into next season, Lewis may be one of the better batters in the American League.

 <p>
	The Tampa Bay Rays are trying to reach a World Series final for the first time since 2020, and they'll have a better chance to do so with Isaac Paredes playing up to his strengths. At 25, Paredes is one year removed from being in talks for the Most Valuable Player award, and it's thanks to his powerful swing and defensive attributes that make him special. Paredes has an 88 rating against right-handed pitchers when using his power swing, which led to 31 home runs last season.

 <p>
	At the opposite end of the infield, Yandy Diaz is an exceptional first baseman, which helps Paredes out exponentially. The two can combine for double plays, taking advantage of favorable stats in Infielding and Arm Accuracy, and Paredes' Arm Strength and Reaction are just good enough to avoid consistent errors. Paredes also comes with an 88 rating for Durability, which pairs well with a player who routinely swings for the fences.

 <p>
	For a player who is more known for his ability to hit the ball, Josh Jung doesn't falter on the defensive side. His Arm Accuracy has a rating of 85, which ranks him quite high among all third basemen in the league. Factoring in above-average statistics in the remaining infielding categories and a higher durability and heading into his prime at 26, many players may feel at ease knowing that Jung is perfectly surrounded by a strong cast.

 <p>
	The Texas Rangers are ranked as the seventh-best team in
	<em>
	 MLB The Show 24
	</em>
	, and Jung is one of many reasons for their success. He holds a 99 rating for both contact and power swing against left-handed pitchers, making their lives miserable with every swing of the bat. There are some areas of improvement Jung could focus on in order to resist wildly swinging at pitches to the outside, but his raw potential is undeniable.

	Led by their infield and bullpen, the St. Louis Cardinals are one of the more thrilling teams to play in
	<em>
	 MLB The Show 24
	</em>
	. For players who thrive on the defensive side, Nolan Arenado is one of the best to play the third base position. Hindered only by his average Arm Strength, Arenado possesses a 90-infielding rating and pairs it with above-average Reaction and Arm Accuracy. Players shouldn't have any problems making double plays with Paul Goldschmidt at first base and Tommy Edman at shortstop.

	Luckily, Arenado doesn't fall short in the hitting department, as he has an 85 rating for contact swing against right-handed pitchers and a 78 power swing rating against left-handed pitchers. While he won't be the most relied-upon batter on the Cardinals, his presence in the batting order should be recognized. With an 85 rating for Vision, players will have no problems playing both offense and defense with Arenado as their third baseman.

 <p>
	Alex Bregman's 87 overall rating places him high on the list among all third basemen in the league, but five players on his own team rank above him. It's amusing to see how rich the Houston Astros' roster is, with 14 players ranking at 80 overall or higher. Known primarily for their offense, the Astros place all their firepower at the plate, which includes Bregman's strengths. His ability to face right-handed pitchers will give opposing teams nightmares for days.

 <p>
	On top of a great rating against those right-handed pitchers, Bregman also has excellent Plate Discipline, Batting Clutch, and Vision, making him one of many great weapons in the Astros' batting order. Unfortunately, his defensive side of the game lacks the same structure. His 72 Infielding and 69 Reaction are just enough to get by on a semi-consistent level, but he is ultimately hurt by sub-par Arm Strength and Arm Accuracy stats.

 <p>
	Alternatively, another player who prefers the offensive side of baseball is Rafael Devers, the second baseman of the Boston Red Sox. While the Red Sox are more of a rebuilding team hoping to see a brighter future, Devers is a nice piece to begin with. The 27-year-old Dominican infielder can play both third and first base, though his services are best suited to a team that can deliver a shortstop to help him out.

 <p>
	Devers has the potential to see a rise in his Arm Accuracy and Infielding stats, which are below average, thanks to a Grade A potential rank. It will all depend on how well players put him in a position to succeed and take advantage of decent Arm Strength and Reaction stats. His offensive game will give some hope, as his contact swing is slightly above average against both left and right-handed pitchers, and his power swing can create havoc on any given night.

 <p>
	Being one of the most notable third basemen in MLB at the age of 22 is no easy feat, but one Gunnar Henderson can proudly claim. The 2023 Rookie of the Year and Silver Slugger recipient has plenty of tools in his arsenal, from positive infielding stats and a great Arm Strength rating of 81 to his ability to take on right-handed pitchers and mix things up with contact and power swings.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":9,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":9,"nbrPlacementsScanned":9,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1068} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
	There's still much of his game that is raw with plenty of room to grow, but the potential is there. On top of being a player who can get on base, Henderson is also a capable baserunner in
	<em>
	 MLB The Show 24
	</em>
	, holding a Speed rating of 80, which places him near the top of all third basemen in this department. A versatile two-way player for a third baseman will surely have players aiming to use the Baltimore Orioles more often.

	Jose Ramirez may have one of the more deceptively decent stat spreads in
	<em>
	 MLB The Show 24
	</em>
	, and players who excel at both ends of the field may want to keep him in mind. Though Ramirez has a weaker Arm Strength stat at 57, the remainder of his infielding stats are good enough to keep the ball in play and runners off the bases. Tim Anderson may have a say in just how powerful his arms are after being knocked down with one punch during the 2023-24 season.

 <p>
	Ramirez shines when stepping up to the plate, as his contact swing challenges any right-handed pitcher he faces, while his power swing is excellent for those pesky left-handed pitchers. With 92 Vision, above-average Plate Discipline, and Batting Clutch, Ramirez will earn his bases more often than not and is less likely to swing at wild pitches. His speed and base-stealing abilities add some extra versatility to his game.

 <p>
	On purely defensive rankings alone, Manny Machado is a machine on third base for the San Diego Padres. Thanks to a 90 rating in Infielding, Machado users will have no issue tracking down balls hit toward him and deciding on the correct play to make. Though his Arm Accuracy and Arm Strength fall short, an above-average Reaction time should cover up those shortcomings and help him make consistent plays.

 <p>
	Machado is better when facing left-handed pitchers, as his use of contact and power swings rank at 90 and 85, respectively. His efforts against right-handed pitchers are still above average, and a Batting Clutch of 81 will keep Machado in high pitch counts more often than not. Adding a Durability rating of 92 means Machado won't get winded in the late stages of the game, regardless of how little or how much he plays.

 <p>
	At 27, Austin Riley is hitting his prime with the Atlanta Braves, and the time couldn't be more convenient for the team. As the best-hitting team in
	<em>
	 MLB The Show 24
	</em>
	, and one that ranks second in pitching and top-ten in defense, Riley has plenty of room to grow and improve upon his Grade A potential rating. Defensively, he relies mostly on his Arm Strength, though his Infielding stat is above average compared to the rest of the league.

 <p>
	Once his name is up in the batting order, Riley's greatest attributes are on full display. Whether he's facing right or left-handed pitchers, or using his contact or power swings, it's likely Riley will be on base after connecting with a pitch. His career-high .301 batting average sets the tone for just how well he can hit the ball, and his Batting Clutch of 80 will guarantee a run or two will be scored when it's time for Riley to step up to the plate.

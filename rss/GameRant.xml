  A vocal portion of the
  <strong>
   <em>
    Marvel Rivals
   </em>
  </strong>
  fandom was recently disappointed to learn that the reward for hitting the game's Gold Rank is a single spray. This discovery appears to have discouraged some players from grinding the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  Competitive mode for the time being.

 <p>
  While the NetEase-developed hero shooter is still without a concrete release date, many fans have already gotten a chance to try it out, courtesy of the recently started
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  closed beta. The game's test kicked off on July 23 and is scheduled to conclude on August 5. Although many of the cosmetics unlocked during this period won't carry over to the full version of the hero shooter, NetEase did make a few exceptions in order to reward early adopters for helping test the game.

  Some Marvel Rivals Players Think Gold Rank Reward Isn't Worth the Grind
 </h2>
 <p>
  But not all of these permanent rewards have necessarily been deemed rewarding enough by the fandom. That's underlined by the recent influx of player complaints over the Tooth and Hammer spray that's awarded to those who manage to reach the Gold Rank in
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  ' Competitive mode. "No way I hit Gold for a spray," wrote Reddit user SomeoneSaidTrash on July 27, prompting dozens of other fans to share similarly disappointing perspectives on this Competitive reward.

 <p>
  And while the spray hardly impressed anyone who chimed in on the ensuing discussion, not everyone felt let down by its reveal. E.g., Reddit user Lunas142 said they were "relieved" to learn that the Gold Rank reward is such an inconsequential cosmetic, as that convinced them to give up on the Competitive mode in favor of Quick Matches, which they characterized as more fun. A few other
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  fans expressed a similar sentiment, not least because they've found ranked play to have become increasingly difficult as the beta progressed.

  NetEease recently revealed a much more head-turning beta reward in the form of the Cyan Clash costume for Venom. That particular cosmetic requires participating in the ongoing
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  special event in order to grind XP. Many fans appear to be much more interested in hero skins of this sort than sprays, likely because the latter require time and effort to actually use, whereas costumes are visible at all times.

  Reward complaints aside, the
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  closed beta has already proven to be a big hit, amassing over 52,000 concurrent Steam players on day one. Many fans praised its art direction and responsive controls, as well as the pure entertainment potential of the Quick Match mode. However, some players have also expressed skepticism over its long-term competitive potential, arguing that
  <em>
   Marvel Rivals
  </em>
  lacks the precision of virtually every popular eSports title out there.

  <strong>
   <em>
    Once Human
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a game that merges several genres into one. It has an intriguing horror theme, backed up by solid survival game mechanics, and a story arc more akin to a single-player RPG. The game is free to play, and it is entirely possible for free players to enjoy the entire game without spending a penny in the cash store.

  <strong>
   Assault rifles
  </strong>
  are a staple of most survival shooters, and
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is no different in this respect. Offering good damage at a decent range, they are the Swiss Army Knife of ranged weapons in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . However, some are still better than others.

  The
  <strong>
   KAM
  </strong>
  assault rifle is the basic version of this line of assault rifles in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , obviously inspired by a certain real-world assault rifle manufactured by Kalashnikov. Every player can unlock the blueprint for the KAM by opening up the corresponding memetic.

 <p>
  With no special, baked-in bonuses, and no weapon mods that suit this weapon, most beginners to
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  will choose to skip it entirely, and rely on a melee weapon for the first 10 to 15 levels in the game until they can unlock a better ranged weapon.

  Every player in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  will unlock the
  <strong>
   KAM - Pioneer
  </strong>
  blueprint early in the game. The blueprint fragments are a scripted drop that forms part of the blueprint acquisition tutorial. However, this is actually a decent weapon up until the mid-game.

 <p>
  The shrapnel combat mechanic is easy to understand. When a bullet hits an enemy, it has a chance of breaking apart, and each fragment causes more damage. Overall, this is a workable weapon, especially if the player uses further blueprint fragments to upgrade its star level. However, it is overshadowed by later options on this list.

  The
  <strong>
   KAM - Crank
  </strong>
  is probably the least used of all assault rifles in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . The burn combat mechanic is seen as being a little weak compared to others, such as unstable bomber and power surge.

 <p>
  That being said, not every player will be lucky enough to unlock an assault rifle with better special bonuses early in the game, and in this situation, the KAM - Crank can act as a decent stopgap. If they choose to run with it, the player shouldn't waste resources calibrating the weapon.

  is only available from the Wish Machine, it is an epic assault rifle that many

 <p>
  This is a solid weapon that can take a player all the way to the end-game, once it has been fully calibrated and the player has built a suit of armor that focuses on a power surge build. Overall, this is a weapon that many people will use at some stage, even if they decide to specialize in something else later on.

 <p>
  A high-level shrapnel build can be devastating once a player has fully calibrated this weapon and equipped their armor with complementary armor mods. However, this weapon really needs to be taken to calibration level 10 to get the most out of it, which is going to be resource-intensive to achieve.

 <p>
  Frost vortex builds are one of the least common builds in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , simply because it is hard to see the benefits of the vortex damage, as it is entirely positional. However, where frost vortex really shines is when a player has modded their armor to grant additional frost vortex bonuses, such as automatic reloads.

  The
  <strong>
   KAM - Abyss Glance

  can form the basis of a sold frost vortex build, although some players prefer the SMG equivalent weapon, due to the higher rate of fire, but at the cost of reduced damage at range. Either way, a good frost vortex build can be devastating when used properly in this survival game.

  is a total conversion mod for

  that tells an entirely new story. Taking place sometime between Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, this game hops across the pond to tell a tale of the apocalypse in Old Blighty. Waking up in a mysterious laboratory, we customize our character under the careful watch of two scientists, before circumstances lead to our escape into the ruined streets of London.

  <em>
   Fallout London
  </em>
  overhauls many of
  <em>
   Fallout 4
  </em>
  's mechanics while introducing some new ones. One of these new mechanics is the option of selecting Starting Traits when you make your character. These function near-identically to the traits from Fallout: New Vegas, allowing you to modify your starting character with traits that each provide a benefit and a drawback. This guide will break down the available options and discuss which ones are the most useful for certain builds.

 <p>
  The Acrobat Trait allows you to trade carry weight for speed, granting +10% Movement Speed but reducing your Carrying Capacity by 50lbs. This can be helpful if you're using melee weapons, so you can get in close more easily, but the loss of Carrying Capacity is a pretty huge tradeoff due to having less access to storage in the early stages of the game. If you can push through the early-game then this trait can be quite useful for ranging across London.

 <p>
  Chem Head gives -1 to all SPECIAL Stats whenever you aren't under the influence of Chems, forcing you to regularly dose up if you want to be at full strength. Thankfully, it also quadruples the duration of all Chems to make this easier and help you get more out of all your Chems. This Trait can be incredible if you can handle the penalty, especially if you have a high Intelligence Stat and the right Perks to craft your own Chems.

 <p>
  This one's a tough recommendation. It gives you +1 to all SPECIAL stats when you're outdoors, in exchange for turning that into a -1 to all SPECIAL stats whenever you're indoors. Since decent chunks of the game take place inside buildings and London's Tube Network is extensive, this is likely a bad choice despite the theoretically huge buff.

  Simple and straightforward, Four Eyes gives you +1 Perception while wearing glasses and -1 Perception if you aren't. Once you grab some glasses, this is just free Perception, making this is an excellent pick for builds that focus on gunplay.

 <p>
  Gifted makes leveling up harder by reducing exp gain by 15%, but in exchange, it increases all SPECIAL stats by 1. This is a massive boost early on, though naturally, the slower leveling can be a problem later on. Since Intelligence increases EXP earned, you'll be able to offset some of, if not all of, this penalty eventually.

  This Trait is great for melee builds if you aren't a fan of Power Attacks. It increases all Melee and Unarmed Damage by 20% but makes Power Attacks meaningless. Since Power Attacks are quite slow and can be interrupted easily, this is worth considering if you want to hit fast and hard.

  This one is pretty much always a good pick. It gives you an extra 75lbs of Carrying Weight in exchange for dropping your movement speed to zero when you're over-encumbered. Running around while over-encumbered is never a good idea anyway, and the extra Carrying Weight will make it harder to hit your weight limit in the first place.

  The Trait of Choice for a Glass Cannon Build, Kamikaze regenerates your Action Points 50% faster in exchange for taking 20% more weapon damage. This makes it easier to sprint around, reposition, and use VATS to cripple enemy limbs in combat. If you're building a Sniper or any kind of ranged build, it shouldn't be too hard to mitigate that extra incoming damage by taking cover and playing a little defensively.

  Night Owl is a Trait that, with a little planning, can be easily taken advantage of. It grants +1 to Perception and Intelligence at night, in exchange for penalizing both during the day. If you plan carefully and rest through the daytime, you can easily have the bonus anytime it matters.

 <p>
  A potentially powerful Trait that comes with a steep penalty. Numbskull gives you a permanent +1 bonus to Strength, Endurance, and Luck. In exchange, your Intelligence can never be raised above 3, making certain builds impossible. If you don't care about the Intelligence Stat, then this can be a good pick for getting some free bonus stats.

 <p>
  The Puritan Trait grants you +1 Strength and Endurance, helping you to hit harder, carry more, and giving you more HP to work with. The trade-off, however, is that using Chems or drinking Alcohol will reverse this bonus. The exceptions to this are Stimpacks, Rad-X, and Radaway, so you can still manage your health and deal with radiation, but you won't be able to use powerful drugs like Hero or take advantage of the buffs granted by alcohol without losing 1 Strength and 1 Endurance. If you're up to the challenge, this could still be a very nice bonus on builds using melee weapons, or just if you want extra carrying capacity and health.

  The Sleepwalker Trait is a fun one, causing you to occasionally wake up in random places after sleeping. This can be amazing if you enjoy exploring and want to stumble across all kinds of random locations, but can also be troublesome if you decide to take a nap and end up somewhere you aren't prepared for. It's a pretty safe choice and can lead to some very interesting discoveries, but it's entirely down to personal taste. Much like Wild Wasteland in
  <em>
   New Vegas
  </em>
  , this can lead to some entertaining encounters.

  Coinciding with
  <strong>
   <em>
    Dungeons and Dragons
   </em>
  </strong>
  ’ 50th anniversary, the popular tabletop roleplaying game will be releasing revamped versions of its core rulebooks. The new wave of rulebooks — starting with the release of the
  <em>
   Player’s Handbook
  </em>
  this September — will feature a variety of updates to the game’s 5th Edition. With the goal to both shake up the game’s meta and implement a decade’s worth of player feedback,
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  's classes, backgrounds, and monsters are all getting significant updates. However, when it comes to monsters, none seem to be receiving as drastic of a makeover as
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  ' fierce mascots: the dragons.

  Ever since the game’s inception back in 1974, dragons have been an integral part of the
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  franchise — shocker. From book covers to miniatures and the subjects of innumerable campaigns, dragons and their many variations have always been a mainstay in this game. There was never a chance that dragons would be omitted from
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  ’ upcoming overhaul, but given their legacy and importance, many wondered what the game could do to make the inclusion of dragons feel meaningful.

  <em>

   "There are several facets to it. The critique I would have on
   <em>
    D&amp;D
   </em>
   dragons is they didn't feel like they had unique identities in what their personality was or where they lived in their biome. They really spearheaded what a ‘modern-day’ dragon looked like at that time. But since then, they hadn't really been innovated on in a while, and so we kind of wanted to give them a push while we were doing this refresh. So, this is a good time to reinvent that and kind of look at them as a whole."

  2014's
  <em>
   Monster Manual
  </em>
  featured 10 dragon types — red, blue, black, white, green, gold, silver, copper, bronze, and brass. Though they each had different stats, attacks, and lore, they all ultimately played the same and looked fairly similar. Going forward, however, each of the previous dragon types will have a wholly unique personality, specific interactions with its environment, and a distinct appearance to reflect those.

 <p>
  The gold dragon for example will have a more melancholic, introverted disposition, can breathe underwater, and is far more serpentine in shape than any of the other dragons. The silver dragon on the other hand is a hulking, chrome-covered socialite that gravitates towards cities and behaves more like a
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  paladin than the typical Smaug-esque dragon. These lawful dragons can certainly make for interesting roleplay opportunities in game, but those hoping for despicable dragons that offer no moral quandaries in combat are still in luck.

 <p>
  A video recently posted to
  <em>
   Dungeons and Dragons
  </em>
  ' YouTube channel showcased the black dragon. This hostile, self-loathing creature is the epitome of evil-aligned dragons. If the coiled horns and exposed bone on its face aren’t enough to scare away a party of adventurers, its acidic breath certainly will.

  The goal with these changes is to make every encounter with a dragon feel completely unique for the players. Not only will the dragons look differently, but they will behave differently, and — thanks to a new set of stats and abilities — have a completely personalized strategy in combat. A red dragon can always deliver a full-on brawl, but a green dragon is far more likely to lure unsuspecting adventurers into its woods, mislead them, and then ambush them when the time is right.

  If these switch-ups to the game's draconic lineup are implemented as they've been advertised, it will make for a very exciting update to
  <em>
   Dungeons &amp; Dragons
  </em>
  . Dragons will no longer be predictable, generic additions to an adventure. An entire campaign could be created around each of these dragon types and hypothetically have no overlap in setting, theme, or encounter construction. This is a change that the game has needed for a long time now, and it makes one wonder what other appealing overhauls are waiting within this new roll-out of
  <em>
   D&amp;D
  </em>
  core rulebooks.

  Getting into a new game like Whitethorn’s
  <strong>
   <em>
    Calico
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a different process for everyone. Some gamers do plenty of research ahead of time, while others prefer a blind playthrough. Others can struggle simply to find games they can even play due to disabilities, though, and situations like that are navigated by developers through accessibility features.

  So I started the company about seven or eight years ago, after I left working at PlayStation with Keywords Studios for a while, while simultaneously saving up money to fully start the company. So it was kind of like a stealth situation for a while. But the impetus was–so I always did user research or data science. So I was always studying user behavior–what people were doing with their time and what kinds of things they were getting up to, in games to look for things like crashes, bugs, exploits, but also quality of life problems like boredom and getting stuck not knowing where you're going.

 <p>
  So my PhD is in education, but I studied human psychology much more than I did games. So I come at games from the idea of always thinking about the person in the chair playing the game, and how radically diverse and different those people can be. If you look at it like a psychologist, you know that no matter who comes in and sits in the chair, they’re going to bring with them a radically different set of circumstances, life, backgrounds, abilities, disabilities, languages, and so forth. So all of that informs the kind of treatment that you're going to give to that person or what kind of conversation you're gonna have with them.

 <p>
  Games are interesting, because their interactivity allows them to adapt to those kinds of changes instead of just being a static piece of media. Blindness is a profound example, but we have ways to detect issues in players while they're playing. You might have motor difficulties or dyslexia or color blindness. We know these things are out there, and we know our players have them, and often the fixes are pretty easy. But it also definitely catches issues like cognitive disabilities, and so forth. Even something as simple as just supporting more languages is in its own way, an access issue.

 <p>
  The philosophy is just about making sure every human being that sees my game and really thinks like that doesn't have any pre-qualifying issues to being able to play. And I think that should be every game. So we exist as kind of an outspoken entity that just tries to really be cheerleaders for this. In our own games, we obviously spend the money and put the features in, and we advocate wherever possible for everybody.

  <strong>
   Q: One thing that I've always noticed with accessibility is that, if you're revealing accessibility features for a game, it tends to be a couple of weeks from release, and marketing starts months ahead of time. But why does it happen that way? Is there a way to be more forward without being excessive?

  One of the big things we rely on in the industry for marketing is hype as a concept. That's how we build brand awareness. It's how we build marketing. And in many cases, it's on a platform level, like Steam, they literally numeric allies, hype by wish lists and things like that, and use it as an indicator of where they're gonna play stuff on the stores, there's almost nothing more important than hype in terms of marketing. Importantly, though, for people with disabilities, they literally can't afford emotionally to become hyped for a game, because it's very possible within the last week before it comes out, they're gonna find out that it's unplayable for them.

 <p>
  If you're a person that has poor vision, and there's no high contrast mode in here, even though that's really easy to do, you may have gotten into this hype cycle only to be like, “Oh, well, I'll play it when the accessibility patch comes out, I guess.” So I feel like people get a little bit gun shy to get excited about and be part of the conversation. So when we start really early, we'll sign games that are in barely prototype phases, then we start right there–here's our usability specialist, we're gonna get in here and make sure that we're talking about this stuff from day one so that those folks can feel free to be excited to play the thing, because they know now that they will be able to–and it gets folks that have those kinds of disabilities and allows them to participate in what I think is a core part of the “gamer” experience, which is to build hype ahead of time.

 <p>
  It's just part of letting those folks fully get into it, to make the game more accessible. But if you don't tell them that until the minute it launches, they’re excluded from an entire thing that everyone else got to participate in–Reddit speculation, Discord servers, watch parties… so just about being holistically accessible, the whole thing needs to be accessible.

  That's a straw man argument that conflates access with taste. The Mona Lisa isn't for everybody, right? There are people who will see it, and say, "Okay, that's a painting of some lady, I'm not impressed.” It might not be for them. But they still were able to see it, though, and then chose that it's not for them.

 <p>
  When we talk about accessibility, they can't see it in the first place, so they don't even have the ability to choose that it's not for them. So what's interesting here is that the analogy would be more like if you put the Mona Lisa at the top of an obstacle wall and made people climb it. Then if somebody came up with a simply out of shape would be like, well, I guess it just isn't for you then. That's really very disingenuous for something that's supposed to be an entertainment product that makes people happy. If it's not for you, sure, great. But definitely we owe it to players to give them the right to choose whether it's for them or not.

  If you grew up in the 90s, if you were a gamer, you were a weirdo, right? You were ostracized. Your friends were in sports, and you were playing
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  and the like and you were not at the cool kids table. So what manner of evil must you be to know what that feels like, and then create a place to do it to somebody else? What's wrong with you? I don't know, I find that gatekeeping thing really nasty. I mean, we were the weirdos who played video games instead of playing sports. We're the weirdos who had a crush on the boy in hermit mode. We were weird people. To willfully exclude others seems counter to the people we ought to be.

  I mean, I understand the financial rationale, if you're a tiny indie studio, and it's like “Let's do full colorblind mode,” like, okay, that might be some money, right? Especially in this economy, where you can't just show up and be like, “Hey, I ran a toy company for a week, can I have a million dollars” like that? The money is less available, the funding environment is more stringent. I get it, right. I mean, we'll pull features back then that's going to include accessibility, it's going to include languages, it's going to include content, because we just can't afford it right now. Reasonable argument, you know, but if you're a big triple-A doing it and saying we can't afford this, I don't know. There's a lot of CEOs making 14 million a year–you can shave off 100 grand for doing accessibility right.

  It's a lot of people who tell me they are not ablest or racist, that are very loud to complain about a black protagonist. So I'm very direct on these kinds of things. If it's not for you, then go away. The number of people that we will piss off is far outweighed by the number of people who say thank you. Ultimately, if you are so vitriolically upset that there might be a queer person in a game, you're probably not our customer base.

  Diversity is authentic to who we literally are. It's not something where we're Nike throwing a pride flag on the side of their sweatshop–it's literally who we are, there are disabled people that are trans people and gay people or black people, white people, people with English as their second language, that we really truly have representative brand for the employees that are in the building. And so whatever we make, is always going to have a bit of our DNA.

  So what you're saying when you think about that argument a little bit–you hear the difference between a JRPG and a CRPG, so if you're playing
  <em>
   Final Fantasy
  </em>
  versus playing
  <em>
   Baldur's Gate
  </em>
  , you know, you might think, “Oh, look at the DNA of the studio,” like, you know, Hidetaka Miyazaki and
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , and Hideo Kojima, you know, so, there's a piece of yourself, and it goes into the games you create, and it's recognized. If our games are obvious to our DNA as well, and you're still so upset by them to some degree, that just means you kind of hate us, right? It's like, “well, I don't want queer people to be in video games”–well, to some degree, that means you don't really want us to exist either, and I will never accept that.

  There's an accessibility toolkit that most of the platforms provide that are great and free. So if you're already developing for Xbox, ask your ID and Xbox person like, “Hey, can I see your accessibility guidelines? Can we get accessibility tags on the store?” Often this stuff is low effort, and often the platforms are willing to do some of that work for you to help you be more accessible to their gamers, because it's also important for them as a branding exercise, right?

  One of the ways Xbox differentiates itself in a business perspective right now is by kind of softening their images to get from a good hardcore spot and rather the “when everybody plays we all win,” which is true, I think. So they're trying to distance themselves from the kind of ‘hardcore, get good’, like, for “real gamers.” Because I think that was a dead end because that market never goes anywhere. How do you have new players if you're constantly saying only qualified players can play? They’ll just get old and stop playing and then there'll be no customers. So there needs to be something to onboard new players and a dude with a beard yelling “Good god, you suck” is not what's gonna make you keep playing. I think in many ways, we as little companies have figured out ways to just answer that. It's really uncomplicated. We're just doing what people want. We can directly address customer wants. So the ability for us to do that means that a lot of indies are really ahead on the accessibility curve, in a lot of ways.

  We've seen some awesome things from tiny little places. Again, that accessibility showcase a few weeks ago was an excellent example of Indies doing full blind support, full deaf support, like American Sign Language, like stuff that you would not catch the triple-A linear enterprise currently doing, but I think it's moving in the right way. And I think the louder we are about it, I hope that that continues. Even if you consider something as mundane as nearsightedness, most people don't have to pay money to use their eyes–so it is very much a disability in that way. So we just have to be a little more gentle with what we think accessibility needs. Even if it does “make the game easier,” I still want to enjoy the game. And now I have 10 hours to do it instead of 100. So, really it's all about being more accommodating and meeting customers where they are.

  It's nothing bizarre, it's that humans are different. They're diverse, they have different needs, and we want to accommodate them. By being a good business person and selling to customers what they want. But as far as I'm concerned, it's really just responding to market needs. I think that would be very important, right? If I can sell good things that improve the industry that make people happy, and then allow people to feel like they're welcome.

  Right. We get so much gratitude. That's probably honestly the most important thing. This is my selfish justification. We get so much gratitude from folks that are like, “Oh, my God, I couldn't play this, thank you for thinking of me.” That is such a pleasant change from the usual kind of gamer discourse, and I think it's been very rewarding for us as a company, as well to kind of just get into that space, because everybody seems just thrilled that you even thought about them. Which is tragic. I mean, it's a video game, everyone should be able to pick it up and play it.

  All of our games pass a fair accessibility baseline that we use against the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines, which are freely available. But beyond that, early in the development process we also hook our developers up with an internal accessibility specialist. They will typically work with the developers to try to identify those issues at prototype phase, like “this is going to be a problem later,” so that we know well and early in advance the easiest and most efficient ways to solve those problems.

  Every company does this to some degree; if you're publishing a massive visual novel, it's going to be a very expensive localization project, so start thinking about what languages are going to be popular early on to minimize cost. We try to do as much as possible to help as many people as we possibly can, while still staying within budget, so that does mean that some people will be excluded.

  Unfortunately, it would be impossible to hit every single person, so it's really trying to do as much as possible with as little as possible, which is kind of the indie mantra to begin with. I want you to do this stuff. I want everybody to do this. So we try our best to both make sure the games themselves match where we walk the walk, so to speak. But also, we definitely try to freely distribute tips and tools and toolkits and API's and things where we can just give them to other developers.

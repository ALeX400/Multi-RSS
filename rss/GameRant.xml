  <strong>
   <em>
    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
   </em>
  </strong>
  has released an interesting new cosmetic bundle themed around sock puppets. Just recently,
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  has become the first ever ongoing
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  game to be brought to Xbox Game Pass, sparking major buzz around the title, and leading to more speculation about when all the past
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  games will also come to the service.

 <p>
  Recent years have seen
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  fans debate over the seemingly lighter direction
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  have taken with regard to the tone of their more lighthearted cosmetic bundles.
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  has collaborated with many different popular franchises, like
  <em>
   Dune
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   The Boys
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Fallout
  </em>
  , and
  <em>
   Godzilla
  </em>
  , but it's bundles like
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  's Hopping Mad Easter bunny tracer pack and
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  's more recent Emoting bundle that have caused outrage within the community for fans who prefer the more serious military tone found in previous games.
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3'
  </em>
  s reported use of AI for its Yokai's Wrath bundle has added another layer of controversy to
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's cosmetic practices.

  It seems
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  's more lighthearted cosmetics are popular, as
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 3
  </em>
  has introduced a new bundle, this time sock puppet themed. For 2800 COD Points, the aptly named Sock Puppet Tracer Pack includes two silly sock puppet skins, one named Socky for the Bantam operator, and the other named Sock It To 'Em for Raptor. Sock-themed weapon blueprints for the STG44 and the Lachmann Sub are included in the pack next to several smaller items.

  Reactions to the Sock Puppet Tracer Pack seem largely negative, as many fans bemoan
  <em>
   Call of Duty'
  </em>
  s alleged attempt to become more like its competitor
  <em>
   Fortnite
  </em>
  by fostering a more lighthearted tone. Some fans mention how the sock puppets' enlarged heads will serve as easier targets during matches. Other gamers have questioned the point of such a cosmetic bundle, bringing up the fact that the bundle, like all other
  <em>
   Modern Warfare 2
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   3
  </em>
  content, won't be carried forward into
  <em>
   Call of Duty: Black Ops 6
  </em>
  when it launches in October. With that said, perhaps
  <em>
   Black Ops 6
  </em>
  could serve as the fresh start many fans have been looking for, as it'll debut without any previous
  <em>
   Call of Duty
  </em>
  cosmetics.

  Enemy design is an essential component of the Soulslike genre. With combat being the primary focus of most Soulslikes, it's important for any game in the genre to ensure that its enemies are well-balanced, visually intriguing, and go hand-in-hand with the game's particular style of methodical action.

  Released just a week ago,
  <em>
   Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
  </em>
  is an ambitious Soulslike that sees players take control of Nor Vanek, a "Sapper" who's tasked with killing the tyrannical gods she accidentally let loose on the world. Along the way, Nor faces off against countless foes, many of which borrow from classic decades-old fantasy archetypes. In embracing those archetypes,
  <em>
   Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
  </em>
  's enemies occasionally bear some similarities to
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's own enemy types.

  Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn and Elden Ring Share Some Classic Fantasy Enemy Designs
 </h3>
 <p>
  As mentioned up top,
  <em>
   Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
  </em>
  borrows heavily from classic fantasy archetypes for its enemies, just as
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  does. So, naturally, there's some crossover between some of
  <em>
   Flintlock
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's enemy designs. This is most evident with the use of undead or possessed soldiers, which feature prominently in both
  <em>
   Flintlock
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":596} -->
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
  </em>
  , players will mostly be facing off against some kind of undead warrior, or one who has been possessed by one of the escaped gods. These warriors come in a few different forms, ranging from weaker foot soldiers wielding only a sword to a fully armored knight wielding a large melee weapon and shield. These soldiers share some strong similarities with
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's various soldier enemy types, such as Godrick's Soldiers and Knights.
 </p>
 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":900,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"stopAds":null,"isEarlyInjection":false,"actualCount":1070} -->

 <!-- Repeatable debug data: {"isEarlyInjection":false,"currentRuleCount":900,"actualCount":0,"hasActualCountMetThreshold":null,"countRemainingForInjection":null,"nextBlockCount":null,"hasCountRemainingForInjectionMetThreshold":null} -->
 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  , many of these soldier enemy types aren't technically undead or possessed, they simply work for one of the game's bosses and their armor and color scheme reflect that.
  <em>
   Flintlock
  </em>
  , on the other hand, emphasizes this notion of possession much more overtly, giving its soldier enemy types glowing blue eyes.
 </p>
 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. -->

 <p>
  There are also quite a few
  <em>
   Flintlock
  </em>
  enemy types that bear a much closer resemblance to those found in
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  . A good example of this is an enemy that players encounter in
  <em>
   Flintlock
  </em>
  's Wanderer's Rest area. In this location, players can find a soldier-like enemy with crystals adorning their body and head. This enemy can conjure a set of blue crystal projectiles above their head, which can be launched at the player like homing missiles. This attack bears a striking resemblance to
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Phalanx sorceries, which see enemies conjure magical blue swords around their heads. Another good example is
  <em>
   Flintlock
  </em>
  's exploding skeletons, which bear a strong resemblance to
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's Putrid Corpses.

 <h3 id="flintlock-39-s-enemies-borrow-a-bit-more-from-mythology">
  Flintlock's Enemies Borrow a Bit More From Mythology
 </h3>
 <p>
  One key difference that sets
  <em>
   Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn
  </em>
  's enemies apart from
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's is the former's penchant for mythology. While
  <em>
   Elden Ring
  </em>
  's enemy designs are mostly influenced by dark fantasy,
  <em>
   Flintlock
  </em>
  's often borrow from mythology, giving some enemies an air of grace or mysticism, such as the winged warriors that players will encounter in the city of Sybil.

  Mushrooms are an easy-to-grow crop in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , as they don’t care about sunlight at all. They are used to cook some of the better recipes as well. Additionally, there are certain locations on the open-world map with hidden caves, and these contain many mushrooms that can be picked.

 <p>
  Because mushrooms don’t like light, they are best grown under a roof inside the player’s base. However, they will still grow outdoors, but the growth rate will be much slower. Overall, having a couple of planters given over to mushrooms is enough.

  Wheat is one of the most flexible of all crops in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . Any recipe that requires bread or pastry will call for wheat as one of the ingredients. For this reason, it pays to keep a couple of planters growing wheat most of the time.

 <p>
  Unfortunately, it is very hard to harvest large volumes of wheat in the wild, there just isn’t a lot of it on the open-world map, and certainly not in large quantities in the same way that a plant like corn can be found.

  Morel is a type of rare mushroom in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . It can be very hard to find Morel in the wild, especially in the new player zones. The mid-game to endgame zones do have more, but it is far from easy to find even in these advanced areas of the game map.

 <!-- No repeatable ad for zone: every entry repeatable. -->

 <p>
  It is understandable why Morel is hard to find in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , as it is used in two of the most advanced recipes in the game. Keeping a planter growing Morel if the player is lucky enough to get a seed could be a good idea.

  Corn is one of the crops in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  that every player will need to grow at some stage. It is used as a direct ingredient in some recipes and as part of a crafted ingredient such as corn oil in other recipes.

 <p>
  However, corn can also be used to make basic fishing bait. One corn makes one fishing bait, and one bait is used every cast. So, for players who enjoy fishing, it might make sense to have several planters growing corn at all times, so they can keep up with their bait needs.

  Oranges can be found almost everywhere in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  , growing wild. Players who don’t want to have to run around the map finding oranges might like to grow some orange trees in their base. Oranges are easy to grow, just requiring some water and sunshine.

  There are some great drinks that call for oranges as an ingredient. Orange Soda makes a fantastic drink to craft in bulk to take care of the player’s hydration needs. So growing a few planters and farming oranges at all times makes sense.

 <p>
  Coneflower is used in every tea recipe in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . However, it is in the Fruit Tea recipe that it is most useful. Fruit Tea gives 50 hydration, but more importantly, restores 400 sanity. Sanity management in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  is a critical consideration for every player.

 <p>
  Growing coneflowers in large quantities is a good idea. They are very easy to grow, but like a lot of sun. For players who want them to grow quickly, it would be a better idea to grow them indoors under a growing light.

  Beets are an incredibly useful crop in
  <em>
   Once Human
  </em>
  . Beets alone can be turned into Sanity Gummies, which restore 500 sanity. It takes one beet to make the sugar, and one beet to make the gummy, so two beets per unit.

  Because of its use as an ingredient in a cheap sanity restoration medicine, most players will have a few planters in their base that only grow beets, so that they always have a crop maturing to replenish their stocks of Sanity Gummies. It is possible to find beets in the wild as well, but they are not a common wild crop.

  Chris Niosi has stepped down as the voice of Moze in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Honkai: Star Rail
   </em>
  </strong>
  , leaving HoYoverse to search for a suitable replacement. In a recent Twitter post, Niosi addressed some concerns from the
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  community and finalized his departure from the game to pursue self-reflection in the form of therapy and medical intervention. HoYoverse also released a statement to acknowledge Niosi stepping down from the role, ensuring that Moze's lines would be re-recorded in a future update.

 <p>
  Moze is an upcoming 4-star DPS character, set for release in
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail's
  </em>
  upcoming Version 2.5 update. Moze acts as the Shadow Guard of the Yaoqing, an expert in close-range assassination from the shadows. HoYoverse has confirmed that Moze will follow the
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Path of The Hunt and possess the elemental power of Lightning, like Acheron.

  HoYoverse announced it would be finding a replacement for Chris Niosi as the voice of Moze following backlash from the
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  community. Earlier this week, Niosi confirmed in a Twitter post that he had contacted his agent and voluntarily resigned from the role. Following the announcement on July 18 that Niosi would be providing Moze's voice, many
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  players reacted negatively to his involvement, drawing attention to past abuse allegations. In July 2019, one of Niosi's ex-girlfriends came forward to accuse him of emotionally and sexually manipulating behavior.

 <p>
  Once his ex-girlfriend's blog post made the rounds on the internet, several other ex-partners and former colleagues of the voice actor also came forward to report sexual misconduct. After the initial allegations surfaced, Niosi was removed from Nintendo's
  <em>
   Fire Emblem
  </em>
  series as the voice of the
  <em>
   Fire Emblem: Three Houses
  </em>
  protagonist, Byleth, who returned in
  <em>
   Fire Emblem Engage
  </em>
  . When HoYoverse hired him to play Moze, the
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  community expressed their disapproval and outrage. HoYoverse was subsequently criticized for failing to perform a sufficient background check on Niosi, concerns which, quote, a "simple Google search" would have alleviated.

  In his own statement, Niosi states that he understands the public's reaction to his past shortcomings, but ensures the
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  community and the entire gaming industry that he is actively pursuing medical intervention and remains committed to his life-long work of rehabilitating himself into a better person. As Niosi signs off the post, he thanks HoYoverse for the opportunity, however short-lived it may have been. For HoYoverse, the hunt is on to find a suitable replacement before Moze's anticipated release as part of
  <em>
   Honkai: Star Rail
  </em>
  Version 2.5 in a few months' time.

  While the mysterious figure known as
  <strong>
   Big Boss
  </strong>
  does technically appear in the first
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear
   </em>
  </strong>
  game, he isn't actually a playable protagonist until the third mainline entry in the series,
  <em>
   Snake Eater
  </em>
  . Solid Snake had hogged the spotlight for the first two games, so by the time that Big Boss became playable, it didn't take long for fans to fall in love with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it's his fascinating backstory, his endless charisma, or even just his fascination with guns and gadgets, there's a lot to admire about the legendary figure who plays the leading role in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
   </em>
   .
  </strong>
  With the hotly anticipated remake of that classic game now being released for fans to enjoy, it seems like the perfect time to reflect on
  <strong>
   what makes Big Boss such an iconic protagonist
  </strong>
  , and why exactly so many fans of the series look back on him so fondly.

  Considering players will be spending many hours following the protagonist of any video game, it can get a little irritating if the star of the show is a massive chatterbox who just can't stop talking. Big Boss, however,
  <strong>
   only ever speaks if he really needs to
  </strong>
  , which lends him a very mysterious that makes fans want to learn more about his character and what he's actually thinking. However, this also means that anytime Big Boss decides to open his mouth, his words tend to be very profound and meaningful.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, while Ocelot may enjoy bragging to Big Boss about his revolvers and how great he is at firing them off any time they meet, Big Boss will only reply if he's able to give some advice on where his opponent went wrong in the battle. In fact, he even has a tendency to repeat words that other people have already said as a way to get them to delve deeper into what they mean, which is something he's been taught as a soldier.

  While it's not uncommon for a video game protagonist to start their story as fairly naive and inexperienced, this certainly doesn't apply to Big Boss. As someone who has already built a reputation for being a warrior on the battlefield, Big Boss knows how to hold his own in a fight, especially when it comes to
  <strong>
   CQC
  </strong>
  <strong>
   (Close Quarters Combat).
  </strong>
  It's always an absolute joy seeing Big Boss outmaneuver his opponents with clever movements and techniques to catch them off guard.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most popular example of this is when Big Boss utterly embarrasses Ocelot early on in
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  . The crude soldier may talk a big game at first, but after his gun jams on him, Big Boss takes the opportunity to apprehend him without breaking a sweat. To put it simply, it's badass to see the protagonist performing take-downs on his enemies with such accuracy and precision, without needing to learn all of this as part of a lengthy training mission in the game itself.

  Any time that a new
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  project is announced, one of the first questions fans will ask is whether
  <strong>
   David Hayter
  </strong>
  will be voicing Big Boss or Snake. This is a testament to how iconic Hayter's voice has become, especially in relation to Big Boss, who he voiced not only in the original
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  , but also in
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid: Delta
  </em>
  . The deep and raspy inflections of Hayter's voice suit a hardened warrior like Big Boss perfectly, but he also has a curious tone that he can put on, which feeds into the protagonist's playful side.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just from hearing his voice, players can immediately tell that Big Boss is not someone to get on the wrong side of, and only the best voice actors can convey so much about a character by uttering just a few words. As a result, it's a big reason why fans adore the character, but also why so many of Big Boss' lines have become popular quotes within pop culture; it's always fun to try and imitate the man who originally said them.

  Typically, games that feature a protagonist as stoic and serious as Big Boss would desperately try to avoid involving him in goofy interactions, considering it could break the persona that the developers are going for. As with the majority of Kojima games, this isn't really an issue in
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3.
  </em>
  Big Boss strikes a healthy balance between being cool, calm, and serious,
  <strong>
   but also has a little bit of fun every now and then.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether it's throwing on a crocodile suit to blend in with the environment, or snacking on something that is clearly poisonous, only to then comment on how bad it tastes, this is a protagonist who is never shy about goofing off to break up the tension, and it's a big reason why he has become so beloved.
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  can get pretty dark at points in its story, so having someone around to lighten the mood is much appreciated.

  At the beginning of
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  , after Big Boss launches himself out of a plane and into the jungle, it's easy to assume that this guy is simply the best of the best, and in many ways, the perfect soldier. However, it's not long before he comes face-to-face with the Boss, who single-handedly defeats the protagonist in close-quarters combat after challenging him on the bridge.
 </p>
 <p>
  The complex relationship between Big Boss and his mentor highlights that, though he may be an incredibly strong and wise soldier, he still has a long way to go. This is a clever way to humanize the character so that he comes across as more sympathetic and relatable to the player. After all, it would be hard to connect with him if he was just an invincible super solider who had no flaws to speak of. By giving him an end goal that pushes him to be better, it allows Big Boss to present himself as someone who is more than just a typical one-note video game character.

   Metal Gear
  </em>
  fans encountered the character. Big Boss actually made his debut in the first
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  game. and he was a villain. Since
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  is a prequel, it allowed the character to remain relevant within the wider lore for many years, as fans were clamoring to learn more about who he was, and what his ultimate goal was.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 3
  </em>
  showcased the fragility of national alliances on the global stage and how this impacted Big Boss' outlook on the world as a soldier. His true fall from grace would be chronicled in
  <em>
   Peace Walker
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain
  </em>
  , leading to his role as an antagonist in the first
  <em>
   Metal Gear
  </em>
  , which takes place after these other two games in the timeline. In many ways, this makes the
  <em>
   Metal Gear Solid
  </em>
  franchise the story of Big Boss, a tragic figure who, despite having hopeful dreams, ends up being seen as a villain at the end of his long and arduous journey.

      <title>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance Makes the Flow State Its Default</title>
      <link>https://gamerant.com/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-combat-skills-ningi-flow-state/</link>

 <p>
  The release of
  <strong>
   <em>
    Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
   </em>
  </strong>
  marks a return to form after a 14-year-long hiatus, and LizardCube's entry makes it feel like the franchise never left. Even if players have never experienced the story of the Oboro Clan from past entries, the visual style of
  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  helps welcome players with open arms. In terms of gameplay,
  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  is accessible for platforming fans of all kinds, and this is largely due to how the game treats every moment like players are in a flow state.
 </p>

 <p>
  The concept of the flow state is often associated with gaming, where players become completely absorbed within the gameplay to the point where they lose sense of the world around them. When this state is achieved, players are so focused on the game that controlling the character feels like second nature. The movement and combat of
  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  make achieving that flow state almost instantaneous, as players can quickly become entranced by the combination of the game's visual style and smooth controls.

  Joe Musashi Feels like an Extension of the Player
 </h3>
 <p>
  Although it may be hard for players to picture themselves as Joe Musashi, given his stoic nature and martial prowess, becoming one with the character in
  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  is surprisingly natural. The controls for
  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  don't reinvent the wheel, but are tuned finely enough that movement and combat feel natural, even for inexperienced platformer fans. The way
  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  introduces its mechanics by throwing players right into gameplay also goes a long way toward putting players in the shoes of Musashi.

 <p>
  As is popular among action games,
  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  features the ability to chain basic and heavy attacks together in combos. Performing these combos feels fluid, allowing Musashi to disrupt enemy attacks and essentially stunlock them for as long as the combo continues. Adding in the ability to double-jump and air dash in the middle of these combos can quickly ramp up the flow of gameplay and blur the lines between the player and Musashi himself.
 </p>
 <h3 id="shinobi-art-of-vengeance-39-s-movement-and-combat-only-improve-with-time">
  Shinobi: Art of Vengeance's Movement and Combat Only Improve With Time
 </h3>
 <p>
  While the first level of
  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  is enough to get players into a flow state on its own, that feeling is only intensified as the game progresses. As players make their way through the game, they will unlock four different types of skills, broken down into:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Ninjitsu
  </li>
  <li>
   Ninpo
  </li>
  <li>
   Ningi
  </li>
  <li>
   Combat Moves
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While Ninjitsu and Ninpo slow down the flow of combat for tide-turning attacks, Ningi and Combat Moves serve to enhance Musashi's movement and combo options during battle. Unlocking Ningi happens naturally as players progress through the story, building Musashi's repertoire of traversal methods with things like the Ninja Flip, Ninja Hook, and Sword Dive. Combat Skills usually need to be purchased from the game's shop, but are vastly worth the investment since using moves like Dive Kick and Aerial Slash, followed up by a finisher like Aerial Kunai Burst, can make one long uninterrupted attack sequence feel more like a fighting game than a platformer.

  <em>
   Shinobi: Art of Vengeance
  </em>
  not only places the tools to enter a flow state directly in the player's lap via mandatory Ningi unlocks, but gives players the freedom to customize their gameplay style so that they can find the perfect rhythm with Ninpo setups and a wealth of optional Combat Moves. As a result,
  <em>
   Shinobi
  </em>
  strikes a balance between platforming and combat that allows the game to appeal to fans of both tight platformers and 2D action games.

  The Tickin’ Chicken Token is a quirky, kitchen-inspired collectible shaped like a chicken timer. It’s by far one of the most playful additions to
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  and will add some extra flavor to your rolls.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can get the Tickin’ Chicken Token by completing the entirety of the
  <strong>
   Bon Appétit album
  </strong>
  , which features 171 stickers, spread across 19 themed sets. That means you’ll need to collect every regular and gold sticker before the album ends. Along with opening sticker packs, you’ll need to trade smartly and use Wild Stickers carefully when you get them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once all 19 sets are filled, the
  <strong>
   Tickin’ Chicken Token
  </strong>
  will be awarded as your grand prize. It’s a permanent keepsake from the Bon Appétit season, celebrating the effort and strategy it takes to complete one of
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  ’s most flavorful albums.

  While common stickers can fill up pretty quickly, rare stickers (especially gold and 5- or 6-star cards) can feel almost impossible to find. Rare stickers have a much higher drop rate in higher-tier packs, like Blue, Purple, and Red packs in
  <em>
   Monopoly GO
  </em>
  . You can find the first two as milestone rewards in special minigames, while the Red packs are only earned through the Community Chest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another way you can increase your chances of collecting rare stickers is by playing during Sticker Booms. The Sticker Boom event increases the number of stickers you receive from each pack. More stickers per pack means more chances at rares.
 </p>
 <p>
  Later in the season, minigames will reward you with a Wild Sticker. A Wild Sticker can be turned into any missing sticker, including rare and gold ones. These are extremely valuable and usually limited, so save them for the rarest stickers that are keeping you from finishing a set. Don’t waste them on common stickers you could trade or pull from regular packs.

    <p>
     Although most gold stickers are non-tradeable, during special Gold Trade events, you can swap certain golds with friends. This is one of the best opportunities to grab those tricky rares.

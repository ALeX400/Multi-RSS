  A prolific
  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon
   </em>
  </strong>
  fan artist has recently devised five new Paradox Pokemon, reimagining critters such as Gengar and Rowlet in entirely new forms. The work was praised by the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community, which admired the diversity and ingenuity of these unofficial designs.

 <p>
  Paradox forms were originally introduced in the ninth generation of
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  games, with
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  . Depending on which game is being played, these monsters appear as either the distant past or far future versions of normal creatures. Due to the uniqueness of the concept, Paradox Pokemon has inspired countless fans to come up with new fan art since the release of the Gen 9 games in late 2022.

  A
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan called HertzBurst has recently shared five artworks detailing new future Paradox Pokemon with the community: Iron Orb, Ghoulish Terror, Iron Bank, Iron Jaws, and Iron Needle. Iron Orb turned the Gen 2 Rowlet into a cute metal flying orb with the Grass/Electric-type.The Ghost/Dark-type Ghoulish Terror, on the other hand, reimagined Gengar with a third eye on its forehead, and was inspired by a leaked prototype for Mega Gengar, according to its creator.

 <p>
  The Normal/Ground-type Iron Bank was inspired by Lechonk, and it stood out due to resembling a piggy bank. Another interesting design was the Ground/Rock-type Iron Jaws, which turned the Gen 3 Pokemon Trapinch into an excavator. Iron Needle presented a metal Poison/Fairy-type version of Skorupi, turning its scorpion tail into a huge needle. HertzBurst’s work was adored by the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community, obtaining 3,200 upvotes.

 <p>
  This is not the first time that HertzBurst has created and shared amazing
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  fan art with the community, though. A few weeks ago, the fan designed a future Paradox form for Porygon-Z called Iron Backup. The design had interesting lore, as Iron Backup was a restored version of a Porygon-Z that was made using data from Porygon2. In the drawing, the critter had a metallic body, and blue lights over its body.

 <p>
  Despite
  <em>
   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
  </em>
  being originally released almost two years ago, fan-made Paradox forms for Pokemon continue to be popular in the community. A few months ago, for example, one fan devised past Paradox forms for Quagsire and Wooper. The creator drew a huge prehistoric Quagsire bathing in the water with several tiny Woopers around it in a cute scene. Hopefully, other creative fans will continue to share their amazing artwork with the
  <em>
   Pokemon
  </em>
  community.

  <strong>
   Poison
  </strong>
  is a common mechanic in games, so players should be familiar with it. A unit affected by Poison will take damage after every turn. Poison does not end until after the fight has ended. Players can use items like balms or Psychic Water to get rid of Poison.

 <p>
  Blindness is a status effect that reduces the accuracy of physical attacks, allowing opponents to dodge them easily. If one or more party members are affected by
  <strong>
   Blindness
  </strong>
  , it can become immensely frustrating. Players can get rid of Blindness by either waiting for a few turns or casting certain spells.

 <p>
  If a character is stunned, they will not be able to defend themselves from incoming attacks for one turn. This leaves their defense open, which can be exploited by the opponent.
  <strong>
   Sleep
  </strong>
  is a dangerous condition that puts a character into a state of slumber. Sleep-ridden characters will be unable to use attacks. Sleep can be removed by taking damage, waiting for a few turns, or using restorative items.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Paralysis
  </strong>
  is another status ailment that prevents characters from moving. There are two ways to remove Paralysis from your units: skipping some turns or using restorative items and spells.

 <p>
  Any unit affected by
  <strong>
   Confusion
  </strong>
  can become a hindrance to the rest of the party. Being confused causes them to become erratic, and sometimes they can even attack other party members. In such a case, it is better to use a restorative item or a spell to immediately get rid of it.

 <p>
  A character affected by
  <strong>
   Berserk
  </strong>
  is limited to using basic attacks. The only other action that they can perform is Flee. Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven players should use Psychic Water spell or other restorative item to get rid of the status ailment immediately.

   <em>
    Sunshine Island
   </em>
  </strong>
  is a representative of the tycoon genre games. Therefore, to progress, players have to grow crops, breed animals, and produce various products. All this requires resource investment, which, fortunately, can be easily obtained using
  <em>
   Sunshine Island
  </em>
  codes.

  At first, your farm in
  <em>
   Sunshine Island
  </em>
  will be quite small, and you will be able to create only a few types of resources. But as you progress, players will unlock new buildings, products, and much more. Luckily, you can achieve all this much faster with the help of
  <em>
   Sunshine Island
  </em>
  codes.

 <p>
  Just a few of them will reward you with a large amount of useful resources, such as Fine feed for various animals. Moreover, some of them offer players valuable Deeds and Books. Therefore, you should use them as soon as possible.

  Now that you know what goodies

  Although the developers add new codes to
  <em>
   Sunshine Island
  </em>
  often, they expire quickly, after which the rewards are unavailable. So, you should start following the official pages of the developers. There, players will find all the news about upcoming updates and, of course, fresh codes for this free mobile game.

      <title>Roblox: Knockout League Codes (November 2024)</title>

 <p>
  <em>
   Knockout League
  </em>
  is a
  <strong>
   <em>
    Roblox
   </em>
  </strong>
  game in the clicker genre in which you will train to become a successful fighter. To do this, the game offers several types of simulators that will help you make each part of your body stronger. You need to click to train on the simulator, but there is also an automatic mode, so you can go about your business if necessary. The workouts are interesting to watch as the muscles that are being loaded are highlighted in red and grow right before your eyes.

  In most
  <em>
   Roblox
  </em>
  games, redeeming codes is very straightforward as they help developers attract new players and retain old ones. Of course, there may be some difficulties in certain games, but fortunately, this is not the case with
  <em>
   Knockout League
  </em>
  . Here, you can redeem codes in the settings with just a few clicks, so most people won't have any problems. However, if you still need help, it's not a big deal as we have created a guide explaining how to redeem codes in
  <em>
   Knockout League
  </em>
  .

  Sony intends to go back to releasing major single-player
  <strong>
   PS5
  </strong>
  games on an annual basis starting from 2025, a senior company official has said. This promise is bound to be welcome news for PlayStation fans following the recent drought of single-player titles from the Japanese gaming giant.

 <p>
  Although the PS5 received a fair number of single-player console exclusives in 2024, none of them came from Sony-owned studios. While
  <em>
   The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered
  </em>
  could be considered an exception, it wasn't a new release.

 <p>
  This recent lack of big first-party single-player exclusives for the PS5 isn't here to stay. That's according to Sony President and CFO Hiroki Totoki, who said as much during an early November Q&amp;A session following the company's latest financial earnings call. Specifically, the executive revealed that Sony intends to release "major single-player game titles every year" starting from its next fiscal year, which is scheduled to kick off on April 1, 2025.

  2 Big Single-Player PS5 Exclusives Are Already Confirmed for 2025
 </h2>
 <p>
  The first wave of these titles already has one confirmed first-party game, the recently announced
  <em>
   Ghost of Yotei
  </em>
  , which is presently targeting a 2025 launch. Aside from Sucker Punch Productions'
  <em>
   Ghost of Tsushima
  </em>
  sequel,
  <em>
   Death Stranding 2
  </em>
  is also planned to hit the market sometime in 2025. Given Sony’s history of favoring longer marketing cycles for major single-player releases, it’s unlikely the company has more such titles planned for 2025, as they would plausibly have been announced by now.

  First-party content aside, the PS5 currently has two more single-player console exclusives confirmed for 2025. One of them is
  <em>
   Ballad of Antara
  </em>
  , a dark fantasy action RPG from Shanghai, China-based studio TipsWorks. The other is a dark adventure game with horror elements called
  <em>
   The Midnight Walk
  </em>
  , which is presently in the works at Swedish developer MoonHood. Both
  <em>
   Ballad of Antara
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   The Midnight Walk
  </em>
  are also planned to be day-one PC releases.

  Regarding unannounced first-party titles from Sony,
  <em>
   Horizon Call of the Mountain
  </em>
  developer Firesprite is currently known to be working on multiple projects, much like Naughty Dog. Meanwhile,
  <em>
   Days Gone
  </em>
  developer Bend Studio has a new open-world game in the pipeline, as suggested by some of its recent job listings reviewed by Game Rant. Given Sony's growing focus on live-service experiences, there's a chance that not all of these titles are going to be of the single-player variety. But the next two PlayStation live-service games are most likely going to be Bungie's
  <em>
   Marathon
  </em>
  and Haven Studios'
  <em>
   Fairgames
  </em>
  , both of which have already been announced.

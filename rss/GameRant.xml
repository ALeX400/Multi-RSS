  <strong>
   <em>
    Pokemon GO
   </em>
  </strong>
  constantly introduces new limited-time events, opportunities, and in-game celebrations as part of the live-service format it tends to follow. Throughout each Season, a new theme is introduced, which usually influences the types of themes and featured Pokemon that Trainers can expect to see in events. These events also often include the likes of Pokemon debuts and shiny debuts, the comeback of limited or rare specimens, and improved chances to hunt down unique forms and specimens.

  During the Dual Destiny Season of
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , one of the many different events taking place is Beloved Buddies - which marks the debut of anchor-like monster, Dhelmise. To mark this occasion, a selection of various Water Types and sea-themed Pokemon, among others, has been included as featured specimens alongside Dhelmise. However, a select few of these featured specimens have also received boosted shiny odds, providing an improved chance for hunters to meet the odds and stumble against one of these alternate forms. All relevant information regarding which Pokemon in Beloved Buddies are receiving boosted shiny odds, and how they can be obtained, has been outlined in the guide below.

 <p>
  In
  <em>
   Pokemon GO
  </em>
  , the Beloved Buddies event is taking place between
  <strong>
   February 11, 2025, at 10 AM local time, to February 15, 2025, at 8 PM local time
  </strong>
  . Throughout this duration, there are numerous featured Pokemon that will be making an appearance during the event in the form of wild spawns, Raid bosses, and Field Research / Collection encounters.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, during this event, a small selection of featured Pokemon have received boosted shiny rates, heightening the chance for players to meet the lucky odds and stumble upon one of these rare, alternate color palette variants. These Pokemon involve shiny
  <strong>
   Diglett, shiny Dunsparce
  </strong>
  , and shiny
  <strong>
   Skrelp
  </strong>
  - with Diglett and Skrelp also having the possibility to further evolve into
  <strong>
   shiny Dugtrio and shiny Dragalge
  </strong>
  . A summary of how these Pokemon can be encountered has been included below:
 </p>
 <section class="emaki-custom-block emaki-custom-note">
  <div class="emaki-custom note" id="custom_block_7">
   <div class="custom_block-content note">
    <p>
     While encountering a shiny of these Pokemon is not guaranteed, the chances of finding them are higher than usual. With the use of Lures, more Diglett and Dunsparce can also spawn, which gives more opportunities for one of these spawns to beat the lucky odds.

 <p>
  Unique Relics in
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  are a way to earn special rewards by making the Trial of the Sekhemas harder. Only by defeating Zarokh, the Temporal, the final boss on the fourth floor of the trial with a Unique Relic equipped, can players obtain these rewards. Best of all? They are guaranteed drops, unlike basically everything else in the game.

  This makes these items one of the only true skill checks in

  . For players who are confident in their build and DPS, there are few better ways of making money in-game than through this Trial.

  There are only two ways to obtain Unique relics in
  <em>
   Path of Exile 2
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   As a random drop from Zarokh, the Temporal in a regular run (requires Level 75+ Djinn Barya).
  </li>
  <li>
   By trading with other players.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The drop rate for Unique relics is directly proportional to the value of the Unique you get for defeating Zarokh with that Relic equipped. The Last Flame is the rarest Unique Relic there is because using it gives you Temporalis, one of the most broken items in the entire game. On the other hand, The Burden of Leadership drops much more frequently because the Unique it gives you, Sekhema’s Resolve Ring, is not as valuable.
 </p>
 <p>
  This also translates to pricing on the trade site. The Last Flame relic can go for as much as 250 Divine Orbs, whereas The Burden of Leadership is much, much cheaper.
 </p>
 <h3 id="how-to-farm-unique-relics-from-zarokh-in-poe-2">
  How to Farm Unique Relics From Zarokh in PoE 2
 </h3>
 <p>
  It’s relatively straightforward to farm Unique Relics in the Trial of the Sekhemas. You basically need two things:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Stack Relics with the
   <strong>
    #% increased quantity of Relics dropped
   </strong>
   by Monsters modifier. The maximum you can have is 20% on a single Relic.
  </li>
  <li>
   Get the
   <strong>
    Enchanted Urn Minor Boon
   </strong>
   (30% increased Effect of your Non-Unique Relics) from the Merchant.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The Enchanted Urn Minor Boon isn’t guaranteed to appear in the Merchant’s shop, but you can use a combination of the Silver Tongue Boon (reduced Merchant prices) and the Chipped Dice Boon (Merchant shop can be rerolled) to consistently clear out the Merchant’s inventory for a high chance of obtaining the Enchanted Urn before the run is over.

  <em>
   <strong>
    The Legend of Zelda
   </strong>
  </em>
  has been one of the most dominant forces in the industry for nearly 40 years, but the last two mainline entries have altered the series in some pretty significant ways. Both
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  took the franchise into a new direction, abandoning many of the tropes and concepts that defined the series.
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  has routinely tapped into classic fantasy tropes, utilizing them in innovative ways in order to create its unique worlds, but recent entries have taken inspiration from contemporaries like
  <em>
   Dark Souls
  </em>
  , favoring a low-key approach over the traditional elements from the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  Elements like the Master Sword being the ultimate slayer of evil and traditional dungeon design were left behind, while the classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  formula that dominated the series during the 1990s and 2000s was also left behind. As stated by series producer Eiji Aonuma, the next
  <em>
   Legend of Zelda
  </em>
  game is in full development, and it may be time to dust off some of the old ideas and see how they fit into the modern era of the franchise.

 <p>
  With
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tears of the Kingdom
  </em>
  , Nintendo ultimately abandoned one of the core concepts of the classic entries, as traditional dungeons were left behind in favor of mini-shrines. While there are what one might call dungeons in those games, they do not feature the same design principals and rely less on thematic gameplay design and more on a consistent world structure.
 </p>
 <p>
  With classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  dungeons, Nintendo would construct them around multi-level exploration and puzzle solving mixed with an overall theme that made it feel unique and rewarding. Whether it was the bitter cold of Snowpeak Ruins in
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  or surviving the brutality of the Water Temple from
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  , classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  dungeons would be a welcome return for the next mainline entry. These expertly designed, hand-crafted excursions made up some of the most fun adventures in the classic titles, and it would be incredible to see them make a comeback.

 <p>
  Among the many things that
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  tossed aside was the relevance and importance of the Master Sword, Link's iconic weapon that has slayed evil in the series since the beginning. Although it does not break like other weapons do, it does lose energy rather quickly and needs to recharge, making other weapons feel more useful in Link's quest to rescue Zelda and defeat Ganondorf.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn't entirely a bad decision, resulting in a fun experiment and adding some variety to the weapon selection, but it may be time to restore the Master Sword to its proper place as the ultimate destroyer of evil in the
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  universe. The next proper mainline game could do well by showcasing the true power of the Master Sword, putting it back in its rightful place as Link's greatest tool needed to dispel evil from the land of Hyrule.

  As Link has traveled the land of Hyrule defeating the likes of Ganon and Zant, he has made friends with some truly unique and fascinating companion characters. From the absolutely delightful Midna in
  <em>
   Twilight Princess
  </em>
  to King of Red Lions in
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  , Link has had some help along the way, but the most recent
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games mostly ignored this concept, leaving a core component of the classic games behind.
 </p>
 <p>
  Characters like Fi, the spirit that resides in the Master Sword from
  <em>
   Skyward Sword
  </em>
  , and Navi from
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  , evoke a sort of nostalgic charm that the next
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game could tap into. Companion characters in the franchise tend to do well when they are woven into the narrative, which is why Fi, Midna and King of Red Lions have persevered as the most popular ones. Taking influence from those would be a perfect way to reintroduce companion characters, a part of classic
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  games that would be great to see return.

 <p>
  Following the lead of some of its contemporaries,
  <em>
   Breath of the Wild
  </em>
  cast the new Link as a young adult waking up in a strange world, on a quest to stop an ancient evil and save the land. And while it undoubtedly worked in its favor to create an aura of mystery, it removed itself from a key part of some of the franchise's best games, which was seeing Link emerge as an untested young man in a small village and embark on a grand adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the franchise has been toying with revisiting its roots, it may be time to see a
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  game that echoes titles like
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   A Link to the Past
  </em>
  , which cast Link as a shy young man who goes on an adventure due to outside forces. Iconic locations from the series, including Outset Island and Ordon Village, have served as fantastic ways to introduce players to the newest version of Link, and it could be an excellent way to debut the next mainline
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  title.

  The
  <em>
   Zelda
  </em>
  franchise has had a long, prosperous relationship with music, as composers like Koji Kondo used their unique talents to bring some of the most iconic video game music to life. And it isn't just the excellent soundtracks, but rather how some of the franchise's most incredible titles have tied a specific musical instrument to the game's progression and narrative. Titles like
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Ocarina of Time
  </em>
  positioned a musical instrument at the heart of the experience, something that the series could definitely look to do again with the next iteration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the unique control methods of the Switch, which allow players to use the Joy-con controllers in each hand, controlling a musical instrument of some sort with the motion controls could lead to a magical experience. The franchise hasn't pushed a musical instrument as the main mechanic since 2002 with
  <em>
   The Wind Waker
  </em>
  , which means that now is the time to put the focus back on a musical instrument and see how just what the Switch 2 can do with this legendary franchise.

  Pulling for characters in
  <strong>
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  can be confusing because characters have diverse roles to play in each team comp. A character can have the sole purpose of stunning the enemy while another can be a pure DPS, which is the case in this comparison between Evelyn and Qingyi in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  .

 <p>
  Understandably, Evelyn is a shiny new character in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  . However, Qingyi is still better than most units in the game. So, when both characters have a banner together, it’s harder to decide who to pull for.

 <p>
  In order to compare both Evelyn and Qingyi in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  , players should compare their builds and roles as these are the essential mechanics to decide on who to pull.
 </p>
 <h3 id="build">
  Build
 </h3>
 <p>
  Starting the comparison with Evelyn’s build in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  . She needs at least, an 80% Crit Rate to activate her Additional Ability Ambush Point. Once it’s active, Evelyn will start dealing a massive amount of DMG with her Chain Attacks and Ultimate. So,
  <strong>
   she needs some serious investment in her W-Engines
  </strong>
  , where you’ll have to find the ones that have Crit Rate or DMG in their Sub-stat. Not to mention, Attack units heavily rely on Crit value, which is a very P2W stat in the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand,
  <strong>
   Qingyi is easier to build than Evelyn
  </strong>
  . She needs a W-Engine with an Impact Sub-stat, and that’s pretty much available in every Stun W-Engine. She also doesn’t scale with any stat outside of Impact, making building her incredibly easy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   In conclusion, it’s much easier to
  </strong>
  <strong>
   build Qingyi in
   <em>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </em>
  </strong>
  <strong>
   , but much more rewarding when you complete Evelyn’s build
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <h3 id="role">
  Role
 </h3>
 <p>
  Evelyn and Qingyi are completely different characters in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  . One is an Attack unit that can carry her team’s DPS, while the other is a Stun character that supports her team by disabling enemies and increasing DMG dealt to them. Evelyn takes the field at the end of every rotation to reap what her team has sown. She’s a true DPS who will get the job done with her strong Chain Attacks and Ultimates.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for Qingyi, she’s a Stun character who can quickly Stun enemies. She has a massive extra DMG multiplier she puts on Stunned enemies, which greatly raises the DMG of any DPS in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In terms of Roles, Qingyi can be much more valuable and useful than Evelyn since she is on top of a very small group of Stun characters in
  <em>
   Zenless Zone Zero
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <h3 id="team">
  Team
 </h3>
 <p>
  In terms of Teams, Qingyi works with
  <strong>
   Attack Agents or characters from the same faction
  </strong>
  . Meanwhile, Evelyn works with
  <strong>
   Stun or Support characters
  </strong>
  . This means Qingyi is perfect if you have a lot of Attack units like Ellen and Zhu Yuan, whereas Evelyn works better if your roster includes Agents like Astra Yao and Lighter.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are some team examples that are great for Qingyi and Evelyn:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Evelyn + Astra Yao + Lighter
  </li>
  <li>
   Evelyn + Qingyi + Astra Yao
  </li>
  <li>
   Evelyn + Burnice + Lucy
  </li>
  <li>
   Evelyn + Lighter + Soukaku
  </li>
  <li>
   Evelyn + Lighter + Caesar
  </li>
  <li>
   Qingyi + Nicole + Zhu Yuan
  </li>
  <li>
   Qingyi + Jane Doe + Seth
  </li>
  <li>
   Qingyi + Rina + Harumasa
  </li>
  <li>
   Qingyi + Soukaku + Ellen
  </li>
  <li>
   Qingyi + Lucy + Soldier 11
  </li>
  <li>
   Qingyi + Nicole + Nekomata
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In conclusion,
  <strong>
   Qingyi is more versatile since she supports any Attack Agent
  </strong>
  , but if you already have enough support, then
  <strong>
   Evelyn is a strong DPS to have
  </strong>
  .

 <p>
  Evelyn is an excellent DPS in
  <em>
   <strong>
    Zenless Zone Zero
   </strong>
  </em>
  . She's not at Miyabi level, but she's still up on the
  <em>
   ZZZ
  </em>
  tier list, sitting with top Agents like Zhu Yuan, Burnice, and Yanagi. If players don't have Fire DPS like Burnice and Soldier 11, it's a great idea to get Evelyn.
 </p>
 <p>
  When compared to Qingyi, Qingyi won in terms of versatility, but if players only wish to focus on damage dealing, then Evelyn is the better choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  Additionally, since most DPS have their own dedicated support, Qingyi may be redundant. For example, Proxies who have Lycaon for their Ellen don't need to replace the butler with Qingyi. Similarly, players who have Caesar can rely on her in various teams like Jane Doe + Burnice, Zhu Yuan + Nicole, or even Yanagi + Miyabi.
